The world has been shattered by Russia’s attack on Ukraine in the past few days. Ukraine’s forces have put up remarkable resistance to this attack, but the war is entering an even bloodier phase. Europe could be witnessing the first major military invasion in years. Many people have been displaced, and many Ukrainian citizens have fled neighboring countries for peace. Gunshots and artillery fires have been raining down on residential areas in Ukraine, with several media houses and newspapers reporting the events and sharing the news with the rest of the world.Various newspapers have reported the news differently, with the difference seen in headlines, videos and images posted. The two newspapers covering the events in Ukraine are the New York Times and Le Monde, a French newspaper. While
Take Over Kharkiv,” Le Monde , on the other hand, read “La Russie A Envahi Kharkiv” to mean “Russia Has Invaded Kharkiv.” Recently a video of Ukrainian citizens making Molotov cocktail Petrol bombs was shared. The headline in NYT read, “Ukraine Prepare Molotov Cocktail In Kyiv.” Le Monde ‘s headline read “Ukrainian Resistance Using Molotov Bombs.” Because headlines are the deciding factor for people to read an article, newspapers make them enticing. The New York Times uses headlines that suggest this is another world war, while Le Monde downplays the illegality of what Russia is doing. The differences seen in the headlines of the two newspapers are all for the attraction of their audiences; each magazine writes eye-catching unique topics.
Kidnapping is a crime that involves the illegal seizing and carrying away of an individual by force or trickery, as well as the unauthorized detention and imprisonment of a person against their consent. Thus, in my opinion, a felony of attempt should be punished in the same way as the underlying substantive offence. In the preceding case, for example, one may contend that if Jerry is charged with the real criminal of bank robbery, he must have planned to execute the felony (Roberson & O’Reilley, 2020). Another example is that if a defendant is unable to carry out a murder, the crime is reduced to attempted murder. Even though the suspect did not obligate to the offense, he had the objective to do so, and hence the punishment
ought to be the same. Regardless, other elements might have a role in the decision. Nevertheless, below is how I feel the above case should be handled. To begin with, abduction is classified as a second (legal wrongdoing) or a first-degree crime under criminal procedure. The third level of hijacking is a permissible offense classified as a class B felony.Surprisingly, kidnapping is equivalent to grabbing to the following extent. Abduction in the first degree is also a class A-I legal violation (Roberson & O’Reilley, 2020). People are guilty of this offence if they expect an outsider to pay or transfer money or property as a payment or persuade them to stop pursuing a distinct possibility. Capturing may be a problematic criminal concept, especially given the distinctions involving snatching
and illegal imprisonment. The differences between snatching, unlawful detention, as well as hijacking must be well understood.Relating to the above discussion, Jerry blackmailed the cashier into assisting him in a bank robbery. Thus, he should not be prosecuted with abduction because he afterwards freed the teller. Nevertheless, he should be charged with attempted kidnapping to hold the bank employee captive and use him as a bargaining chip to depart. I believe that the robber’s aim to keep the teller prisoner is a crucial component because he had to flee when the police thwarted his scheme (Roberson & O’Reilley, 2020). Therefore, holding the clerk should not be regarded as abduction because the prisoner was not moved from one location to another.For the crime of kidnapping to occur, the victim
that arises from and within this intended offense will be absorbed into the crime itself. It is worth mentioning that robbery is a criminal offense under common law since threats or force are used to take things from another person illegally. As a result, the use of aggression against the bank clerk is an intrinsic aspect of the robbery that cannot be isolated from it.
International labor laws prohibit making employment decisions regarding individuals’ age and disabilities. It means that Etihad Airways infringed on the existing regulations by introducing its approach to layoff. Considering the fact that social justice is a central demand for multinational corporations, Etihad’s conduct can be viewed as unethical and irrelevant. The more significant employee involvement in the decision-making process could have helped to avoid this situation. It directly influences performance and guarantees that fair decisions considering the workers’ input are made. Thus, Etihad attained success in compensating employees for their contribution and work. Payment processing is a critical factor influencing job security and employees’ motivation, meaning that this decision helps Etihad to generate benefits and rehire them in the future.From the case, one can also see that reduction
in job security was a critical factor associated with the change process in Etihad. The decision to fire workers resulted in a lack of confidence among specialists and reduced their motivation and long-term plans in the corporation. For this reason, it is critical to secure employee positions to ensure individuals are engaged and fulfill their duties effectively. Discrimination was another factor peculiar to the change process at Etihad Airways. The corporation disregarded the corporate social responsibility issues, which resulted in the growth of dissatisfaction, lack of motivation, and engagement. It means that the company ignored possible alternatives that could have been used instead of its discriminative practices undermining job security and individuals’ readiness to work with such entities.Altogether, the case shows that lack of employee involvement was one
started to suffer from burnout because of the high level of stress. Moreover, the lack of motivation and engagement because of the processes mentioned above influenced their performance. As a result, Etihad Airways’ ability to achieve existing objectives was hindered. The case proves the critical importance of employee involvement in decision-making during the change process as it helps to motivate them and select the most acceptable options.
Painters and authors use their skills to address issues that affect their societies. It is very easy for one to understand the happenings in a community by viewing a painted work or reading a literary work established in a given society within a specific time. Looking at different pieces of literature and paintings offers the understanding that humans do not choose to fit into specific movements as often implied. For example, an author writing about social injustice mostly does that after experiencing the issue in their society. Artists living during such a period will also tend to depict images of society members in postures or situations depicting plights or sufferings. The present work delves into the paintings and literary works of Vermeer Johannes and John Steinbeck, respectively, to
show that painters and literature developers mainly generate their jobs as directed by their immediate environments. Vermeer and Steinbeck’s works, lives, and choice of the realism movement and themes are worthy aspects that depict the characters’ parallels.General AnalysisThere exist numerous similarities between Vermeer and Steinbeck based on their lives and works. For example, both Vermeer and Steinbeck were their parents’ dearest children, with each set determined to see the child excel in life (Newlin, 2019). Vermeer was introduced to the art world by his father, an art dealer, who wanted the boy to inherit the family’s art business. Furthermore, Steinbeck was introduced to writing by her mother and father, who wanted him to become a scholar. Such settings thus show the role of the folks’ childhood lives and
their parents to their later careers. Similarly, Vermeer and Steinbeck’s determination in life made them make tough decisions in life. Vermeer joined Catholicism to get a wife and become a member of a wealthy family. Steinbeck further struggled with the idea of religion to the point of assuming a pagan life that insisted on human’s inability to explain the nature of God. The similarities in such occurrences make Vermeer and Steinbeck substantially similar.Vermeer’s paintings depict his immediate surroundings, just like Steinbeck’s writings. The painting of Christ in the House of Martha and Mary is influenced by Vermeer’s conversion to Catholicism, while Steinbeck’s narrative on Oklahoma immigrants to California is influenced by his real-life experiences. The desire to present their work as reality also led Vermeer and Steinbeck to
choose the realism movement and themes (Wuestman, 2017). Vermeer uses expensive color to depict his painted characters as real as possible. Steinbeck also uses real location names and true historical incidents to establish his work and themes. All these concepts make Vermeer and Steinbeck very comparable. The characters’ lives and works provoke one to think that the two lived during the same time. However, the point that Vermeer lived during the seventeenth century, while Steinbeck is a twentieth century writer implies their connectedness.Specific Works’ ExaminationNothing makes the understanding of Johannes’ artistic work better than the investigation of his pieces. The Girl with the Glass Wine and the Girl with a Pearl Earring , for example, present some of his most-liked pieces of art. The two show classic female
characters in calm surroundings and a wealthy lifestyle. For instance, The Girl with the Glass Wine depicts a luxuriously cladded young woman. The character’s economic freedom allows her to interact with the wine and elite male folks, some things only known to the wealthy families during the age. Johannes also prints the girl in the image using classy paints and pigments to show her social status. Red, yellow, and blue shades are prevalent in the painting to show influence. Other items appearing in the printed work, such as cut lemon, white (costly) jug, and a large portrait of the family’s grandparent, also work together to depict the prevailing culture of then Elite Dutch society. Vermeer applies expensive warm colors and fine artistic skills to present the art as
authentic as possible, giving the piece its realism aspect.On the other hand, John Steinbeck’ works mainly capture real-life familiarities directly experienced during the writer’s life in the state of California. Born in February 1902, Steinbeck encountered first-hand all the happenings of the First World War and the great depression, which made the lives of many Americans unstable. Steinbeck’s father (Ernst Steinbeck) was a Monterey County treasurer, while his mother (Olive Hamilton) served as a school teacher of English literature. The parents played a significant role in the author’s life and the eventual writing career. Having money allowed the parents to send the young John to school to have formal education. Therefore, the author’s situation is similar to that of Vermeer Johannes, whose wealthy father led him to the
art world through academic training. John’s local home stood in agriculturally fertile soil that supported commercial farming. This background forms the author’s context in almost all his narratives as a writer (Souder, 2021). The situation further adds to the similarities between the author and Vermeer.Realism is highly depicted in almost all of John Steinbeck’s writings. The author describes real cases involving American farmers, especially those living in California during the great depression. Of Mice and Men and The Grapes of Wrath are some of the most celebrated writings of John (Souder, 2021). The two narratives recount the lives of California people and their neighbors during the First World War and the subsequent global economic downturn. In the last story, John narrates the movement of a deprived family (of
Every business must be managed carefully, and every detail must receive a fair amount of attention. When it comes to healthcare, such facilities must require even more attention because they focus on people’s well-being. Performing such duties might be strenuous and expensive, and mentally demanding. As a Chief Nursing Officer, one will be faced with principles that include integrity maintenance, cash flow management, and employee motivation in the given circumstances.To start with, a healthcare business must always maintain its integrity. It can be evident that any business field should be focused on communication, which makes integrity a vital part (Fisher, 2008). In the given facility, the integrity maintenance principle is heavily adhered to. First of all, every doctor follows an ethical code, meaning that they know of doctor-patient
confidentiality. Moreover, doctors and nurses focus on honest communication with patients. For example, in my situation, I tell patients about their actual conditions and honestly answer their questions.Another important business principle is proper cash flow management. Healthcare facility requires renovations and innovations, meaning that there will constantly be situations when new equipment or repairs will be needed (Mason et al., 2020). In this situation, it is highly necessary to implement the needed changes to not jeopardize patients’ health and well-being. For example, as a CNO, it was my obligation to manage the replacement of power generators. As a result, generators enabled the personnel to carry out their duty without problems during a storm and power outage.The last principle is the management of employees and providing them with motivation.
off and gift cards in the given facility. This can make the workers feel heard and supported. Without these steps, the nurses and doctors will have burnout and lose the desire to provide high-quality results.Thus, the given principles were chosen due to the impact they can bring on employees and patients. The mentioned principles are being used, providing good results and leading to the satisfaction of all parties. These principles are important to me since I believe that healthcare should be based on these values. Otherwise, no facility will be able to treat their patients, and there will be no trust and respect between healthcare personnel and patients.
The nature of mythology and its persistence in culture throughout thousands of years has long fascinated scholars and thinkers. Joseph Campbell’s book entitled The hero with a thousand faces investigates this issue in detail to reveal how myth as a psychologically informed phenomenon predetermines cultural patterns of humanity. In this paper, the first chapter of the book, “Myth and dream,” will be at the center of the discussion.The thesis of this part might be projected through the following quote. The author states that myths “are dangerous because they threaten the fabric of the security into which we have built ourselves and our family. But they are fiendishly fascinating too, for they carry keys that open the whole realm of the desired and feared adventure of the discovery of
the self” (Campbell, 2004, p. 7). Such a formulation implies that people’s minds intertwine myths and dreams as a mechanism of self-perception, understanding of the self in the context of the whole life cycle, and coping with developmental change.Myths lead people through the challenges of life and allow for integrating the conscious and subconscious into a single framework. Indeed, prior to presenting the idea in the above-mentioned quote, Campbell (2004) refers to the repetitive occurrence of the terrors and irrationalities from ancient mythology in contemporary people’s dreams. Indeed, the motifs of hatred, vanity, jealousy are intertwined with love, gratitude, and other feelings and motivations to action. In such a manner, these matters are dangerous to people because they unveil the psychological underpinnings of their subconscious in ways that
Recent fad diets have suggested that carbohydrates cause harm to one’s body. However, this statement has been refuted many times for several reasons. Firstly, to get a beautiful, efficiently functioning body, one needs nutrients – fats, proteins, carbohydrates, and water (Nazario). Carbohydrate metabolism converts carbs into vital energy for the nervous system and brain, as well as for the possibility of proper metabolism of proteins and fats. Once these elements are eliminated, there is a high risk of developing continuous fatigue, which potentially leads to depressive mood.Secondly, giving up carbohydrates leads to extra pounds because after completing a carb-free diet, the body is susceptible to every gram of carbohydrates, and super-compensation occurs in the diet. In addition to an increased appetite for carbohydrate-containing foods, the assimilation of this
The subject of euthanasia is an extremely delicate topic of discussion which is surrounded by numerous ethical debates. Generally speaking, euthanasia as a term is used to describe deliberate action to painlessly terminate a person’s life to put an end to their pain. On the one hand, advocates of euthanasia speak about one’s right to make their own decision in regard to life and death and call the act ‘mercy killing’ due to it relieving people of suffering. On the other hand, euthanasia opponents argue about the sanctity of life and equal the act to murder. However, from the point of view of a few ethical theories – namely, teleology, deontology, and Levina’s “face of the other” – euthanasia is deeply unethical and contradicts all possible moral laws.Teleology
is the study of things in terms of the purposes they serve, and it was heavily relied on by Aristotle. He believed that there was a reason for everything – including human life: he saw it as organized and directed towards the final end. As for what Aristotle considered the final end, it was “complete good” – happiness, the ultimate goal of all our activities that renders a human life “in need of nothing” (Aristotle, 2017, p. 247). Evidently, all of our activities are aimed at achieving a goal, although most of them are means to achieving other goals. Happiness is a goal in and of itself – the ultimate goal; as such, it is the highest good. The problem is that different people tend to disagree with
what makes life happy or good – the goal of ethics is to answer this question. However, it is unlikely for that answer to be death – which is the outcome of euthanasia; therefore, one can conclude that the practice of euthanasia would be deemed unethical from Aristotle’s perspective.The theory of deontology is the theory according to which people have a moral obligation to act in concordance with a particular set of rules and principles. Immanuel Kant was this theory’s prominent advocate, and he formulated its most substantial form. As opposed to deontological theory’s religious interpretations, Kant’s theory’s rules are derived from the human mind. As per Kant, “some actions are inherently wrong,” even if they lead to a remarkable outcome (Kant, 2019, p. 30). This is the
way actions are evaluated in deontology – regardless of the end result. In regard to euthanasia, the end result can be considered good – a person is able to escape suffering. However, from a moral viewpoint, ending someone else’s life would most likely be deemed inherently wrong. Therefore, the act of euthanasia is unethical from the perspective of Kant’s deontological theory as well.“Face of the other” is the theory of Emmanuel Lévinas – a French philosopher of the 20th century – that proposes that people are responsible for one another in face-to-face encounters. He stated that his ethical relation to loving others comes from his inability to survive alone and find meaning “within its own being-in-the-world, within the ontology of sameness” (My Jewish Learning, n.d.). According to Lévinas,
violence to someone else’s life.As a result, euthanasia is likely to be considered unethical from the point of view of any of these theories. From a teleological viewpoint, things that lead to one’s life being happy or good cannot be pursued – therefore, euthanasia, with its end result being death, could hardly be viewed as something positive. Moreover, in accordance with Kant’s deontological theory, there are acts that are always wrong, regardless of the outcome, which fits euthanasia – essentially, a killing that frees one of pain. Additionally, Lévinas speaks about putting someone’s life higher than his own due to the existence being meaningful only with others in it – euthanasia, from his perspective, would be deemed an infringement on another’s life.
IntroductionMarijuana has been used for several thousand years in various directions. In the West, for the first time, medical use became known thanks to the work of Professor O’Shaughnessy, who personally observed the process of her treatment in India (Cerdá et al. 167). After a series of experiments, he began to use it for patients with rabies, epilepsy and tetanus. Over the following years, the opinion of experts has constantly been changing, and discussions about the ratio of benefits and harms are still ongoing. Evidence of medical use of marijuana varies from proven clinical cases to speculative claims. Despite its long history and positive feedback from patients in various fields, one must not forget that cannabis has psychoactive properties, so its turnover should be limited. The legal status
and availability of the remedy are ambiguous for many countries.Forms of Medical CannabisThe Cannabis sativa plant contains more than 100 compounds, including terpenes, flavonoids and – most importantly for medical purposes – cannabinoids (Ali 25). The most common cannabinoid is delta-9-tetrahydrocannabinol (THC), which has psychotropic properties and is capable of causing euphoria (Grassa et al. 1678). The next most common cannabinoid is cannabidiol (CBD), which is not psychotropic. THC and CBD are the most studied cannabinoids. Evidence suggests that other cannabinoids and terpenoids may also have potential medical applications and that different cannabis compounds may work synergistically, enhancing each other’s effect.Opinions on the Legalization of Medical CannabisOpponentsAmong psychiatrists, there are opponents of the use of marijuana. They warn that legal cannabis, even with limited use in medicine and
veterinary medicine, will easily get out of control and will contribute to the additional spread of drug addiction among the population (Nosarieme 293). Opinions are given about the risk of mental disorders, a decrease in long-term memory. The danger is the statement about the harmlessness of marijuana. There is concern that the burden on law enforcement agencies will sharply increase, which will have to deal with the purpose of using cannabis in detainees.Studies have shown that adolescents who use marijuana have noticed anxiety and deterioration in the educational process (Larkin and Madras 590). Colorado was the first to legalize marijuana in 2012 (Page et al. 145). Scientists at the University of Colorado stated that since legalization, the number of patients admitted to hospitals in a serious conditions caused
by cannabis has tripled (Cerdá et al. 169). Opponents of legalization are also confident that legalization will lead to the emergence of a black market for marijuana. It is economically more profitable for producers to trade illegally than to pay taxes to the state and be under its control.SupportersSupporters of changing the law emphasize the need to use medical cannabis as an adjunct to pain relief for different illnesses. In addition, they refer to the results of the experience of other countries where there is no ban on marijuana, which has allowed to reduce in drug trafficking on the black market (Ali 25). A number of studies have shown that the crime rate began to drop markedly in the US states where marijuana was legalized (Grassa et al.
1677). For example, in the states bordering Mexico, the number of crimes decreased by 13% (Nosarieme 294).Results of Cannabis LegalizationThe process was initiated by Uruguay and Canada, which allowed the use of marijuana in 2001 (Larkin and Madras 579). Smoking is not prohibited for persons over the age of 18 in special places (Page et al. 138). The position of the official authorities is neutral. In some countries, the law allows to have marijuana for one’s own use and to breed from 5 to 15 bushes at home for personal needs (Nosarieme 292). In Colorado, Georgia and Washington in the USA, two years after the legalization of marijuana in 2013, there were fewer patients going to drug treatment centers (Ali 21). The suicide rate has hardly changed. According
to police statistics, employees have received more opportunities to investigate serious crimes and preventative law enforcement activities. Consumption of other narcotic drugs has not increased (as shown in the graph) and alcohol consumption has decreased.However, it is also possible to highlight the negative consequences of the legalization of marijuana. The Canadian Association of Psychiatrists demands that the sale of cannabis be restricted to 25 years (Grassa et al. 1669). Doctors say that the passion of young people affects the development of thinking abilities, memory, attention, and learning ability and destroys intelligence. In addition, marijuana becomes a catalyst for people at risk for mental illness. These include people with stressful work, stress and dysfunctional heredity.The Use of Cannabis in MedicineChemotherapyChemotherapeutic drugs are administered to cancer patients in courses for
several weeks. They are effective but highly toxic; treatment is accompanied by severe side effects that worsen the quality of life of patients. One of the unpleasant consequences is severe nausea and vomiting, which are almost impossible to control. Patients try to eat less, and can not stand the sight and smell of food, which leads to exhaustion and depression. Sometimes they interrupt therapy, despite the deadly risk.Antiemetic drugs relieve the condition, but they are not always effective, and their prolonged use causes complications. Marijuana has been proposed as a less harmful alternative. Since 1985, oncologists have been allowed to use synthetic tetrahydrocannabinol in capsules, but Alfred Chang’s research has shown that bioavailability when smoking is much higher (Larkin and Madras 578). Cannabis treats nausea by increasing appetite
(which prokinetics do not do), and also has an analgesic effect, which potentially allows to give up narcotic analgesics.Multiple Sclerosis and EpilepsyClinical manifestations of multiple sclerosis are diverse and depend on the localization of foci of myelin destruction. Etiotropic therapy is absent; the disease is irreversible, so combinations of expensive symptomatic drugs are used. Marijuana relieves tremors and partial loss of coordination. There have been documented cases when cannabis effectively coped with focal seizures in epilepsy (Cerdá et al. 171). Even under the condition of illegal purchase, it was cheaper than traditional treatment. Anticonvulsive properties also helped with tremors of various origins (infections, organic pathology of the central nervous system, and dystonia).Anorexia in the Treatment of HIV/AIDSTaking antiretroviral drugs can depress digestion and cause nausea, which increases the
risk of exhaustion for patients who are already losing weight due to the disease. Cannabis not only excites hunger but enhances the taste and pleasure of food. After the 1971 studies, Dronabinol was allowed to be used in the USA since it turned out to be safer and more effective in comparison with Megestrol (Page et al. 149). Cannabis treatment of anorexia with HIV infection Marinol is possible only in some foreign countries by prescription. Many patients resort to ordinary smoking marijuana. They indicate that it relieved symptoms more effectively than a synthetic analog.Chronic PainTraditionally, chronic pain was treated with opiates and synthetic analgesics. This led to dangerous complications in the form of gastrointestinal bleeding, ulcers and renal-hepatic insufficiency. The combination of sedative and analgesic action allows the
use of cannabis for pathologies such as osteoarthritis and phantom pain after limb amputation. Although marijuana is inferior to opiates in the power of pain relief, smoking on demand is accompanied by fewer side effects and rarely causes addiction. Cannabis is becoming a means of choice for people suffering from migraines, as many of them simply do not help analgesics.Rare Cases of Medical UseCannabis helps only a small part of patients, so it is rather an exception to the rule. This is due to the use of pharmaceutical drugs in the treatment of fairly rare symptoms and side effects. There is reason to believe that marijuana is likely to benefit in the treatment of diseases, the list of which is presented below.GlaucomaIn an experiment at the University of
California, the properties of cannabis were found to reduce intraocular pressure and lacrimation. The effect after smoking persisted for 4-5 hours, while the pupils reacted normally to light and the quality of vision did not change (Nosarieme 295).Atopic DermatitisMarijuana helps to suppress itching and irritability associated with the disease when the effectiveness of antihistamines and corticosteroids is limited or there are contraindications to them.Labor PainsPregnant and lactating women should generally avoid the use of medications, as there is a risk of poisoning the child. However, in India and African countries, marijuana is used to relieve labor pains due to the banal lack of normal medications.Depression, Psychosis and Other Disorders of The Emotional SphereThe use of cannabis, in this case, is ambiguous. On the one hand, it has been
used for years past to treat melancholy. On the other hand, chronic use can cause and exacerbate mental disorders.AsthmaCannabinoids in the experiment showed a weak bronchiolitis effect in the absence of side effects characteristic of beta-agonists and steroids. However, smoking is contraindicated because of its irritating properties; only oral administration is suitable.InsomniaThis is one of the most ancient indications for taking cannabis in various pathologies. Such pathologies can be multiple sclerosis, bipolar disorder, and withdrawal syndrome.SclerodermaDue to the pathology of connective tissue, patients suffer from heartburn, difficulty swallowing and nausea, which leads to a decrease in appetite and exhaustion.ConclusionPeople in the last stages of fatal diseases often turn to weak narcotic substances. Cannabis helps to suppress pain, nausea, depression and feelings of fear without causing severe withdrawal or
safety should be decided by a doctor. If a patient finds a suitable specialist, they will help choose the right dose and weigh the risks in the long term. The toxic effects of cannabis can be acute and chronic, leading to undesirable consequences. However, no fatal cases of intoxication have been confirmed. The effectiveness of cannabis is individual in each case. It depends on the severity of the causal disease, the characteristics of the patient and the dose. Unfortunately, accurate data is not available, as the illegality of the tool limits research.
Cost of Advanced Documentation SystemThe Advanced Documentation System is a document technology partner that helps optimize and ameliorate the work of the company’s printers. The costs spent on printers and their supply grow exponentially within years. There are various ways to improve the way printers are handled by implementing helpful services such as the Advanced Documentation System. The cost of the system depends on the brand, for instance on Capterra, the service costs $25 per month with a minimum of 5 working places which is $125 in total (Capterra, 2022). The software has a free trial period that allows the customer to understand the features of the system and its working specialties.The usage of the system can become profitable for the company within time. It is a cost-saving
service as it analyzes and teaches the personnel to use various printer regimes for various needs. The software teaches the customer to use the printer on a higher level and consequently leads to better document management including converting papers to digital and re-engineering procedures for better productivity. The service successfully integrates into the IT environment of the firm and optimizes the inner work processes.Eventually, the implementation of the Advanced Documentation System can become an investment within time as it can save the time of the personnel, increase their productivity, and help the environment (Advanced Document Systems, 2022). The environmental-friendly approach is based on saving the print and the time printers are used by the personnel.Alternative Funding SourcesThe company can pay for the service using various financial resources for
the more cash flow the firm receives and can use for different needs. The other way to find alternative funding sources is to issue bonds that represent a fixed-income instrument. A bond is a debt obligation meaning that the company loans from an investor a specific sum of money. Bonds are safe for investors and faster to get for the company because more people invest in bonds as a safer method. Finally, the company can use mixed funding to get the cash for the payment which means uniting several methods described above. All the funding opportunities are possible for buying and implementing the Advanced Documentation System.
Carbohydrates are energy-giving foods that enable the body to function well. Every person needs plenty of carbohydrates in their diet to remain healthy and carry out their daily tasks properly. Scientists recommend that carbohydrates form between 45% and 65% of one’s daily consumption (Wali et al., 2021). High carbohydrates uptake translates to high calories and sufficient energy for the body. The paper will discuss carbohydrate consumption and the composition of carbohydrate sources.Some of the foods that contain high contents of carbohydrates are wheat which can be consumed as wheat grain or wheat flour and differ in their functionality in the body. Wheat flour from wheat grain is obtained by milling the wheat grain to remove the outer part of the kernel, which are the bran and germ. There
is a variation in the chemical composition of the bran and portions of the kernel’s endosperm. The kernel contains starch as the major carbohydrate in its endosperm. The kernel also contains free gas, pentosans, and glucofructans. The outermost layer of the wheat kernel, the bran, has starch as a contaminant of the endosperm. The bran also contains carbohydrate materials such as free gas and cellulose.Carbohydrates come from different foods, including fruits, green vegetables, roots, and legumes. Sugar types found in fruits are three in total, namely glucose, fructose, and sucrose (Ludwig et al., 2018). Glucose is utilized in the body by the brain and muscles, while fructose is used in the functioning of the liver. Sucrose is broken down into fructose and glucose to give the body energy.
Green vegetables only contain simple carbohydrates that are in the basic form. Root vegetables also contain carbohydrates in low quantities, which are useful to the human body. Legumes contain complex carbohydrates in resistant starch, used as food by organisms living in the large intestine. Complex carbohydrates resist being broken down into glucose while in the small bowel.Consumption of a large amount of added sugar is unhealthy for the human body. The high calories of carbohydrates consumed daily must be associated with the rigorous activity to burn it. Consumption of high amounts of starch and fat causes obesity. Obesity is a condition that results from unburnt calories in the body. Humans must exercise consumption of the right quantities of carbohydrates. Problems that arise from much sugar consumption are heart
IntroductionCoordination in healthcare is a critical activity supporting healthcare’s efficient and successful transmission. Healthcare regulations, ethical resource development, and many other essential aspects of healthcare should be considered while coordinating treatment for patients. Care coordination also considers a patient’s psychological requirements, cultural viewpoint, ethics, and other specific features that provide satisfaction throughout the treatment process. A selected patient’s hypertension will be examined, and a tentative care coordination plan prepared to address the patient’s needs. Hypertension is a condition in which blood pressure is greater than it should be. Nearly 50% of the US population from around 54 to 74 years has hypertension (Carey & Whelton, 2018). Thus, a coordinated care plan will benefit the patient and anybody else who may be affected by the condition. The number of
instances of hypertension has risen, and the primary reason is people’s lifestyles.Patient-Centered Health InterventionsEffective interventions should place the patient at the heart of the treatment and clinical endeavors. Patient-centered care entails including the patient in the treatment process and taking an active role. Patients may make a significant difference in the quality of healthcare they get if they are adequately involved (Fowler, 2017). The patient in this study was a 65-year-old woman diagnosed with hypertension in July 2019. The important statistics are BP 141/90, HR 108 bpm, temperature 38 °C, and RR 37 bpm. When the patient learned about her illness, she became interested in care coordination and made the plan better and faster. She stated that she was eager to learn more about the disease and what
she could do to maintain a normal life despite having a disability. Her hypertension would cause several health problems; thus, it was critical to point out three of them.Stroke or Heart AttackA heart attack can occur because of the hardening and thickening of the arteries caused by hypertension (atherosclerosis). It is common knowledge that a heart attack happens when there is a blockage of blood flow to the heart, resulting in a blood clot formation. A stroke is a similar obstruction of blood flow but affects the brain (Wang et al., 2018). They do, nevertheless, follow a similar pattern, and patients with high blood pressure should be on the lookout for any of these health problems since they are more likely to occur.The best ways to prevent heart
problems for the patient in question include quitting smoking and drinking alcohol, getting enough exercise, managing their blood sugar and cholesterol levels, and losing or maintaining their current weight. With the support of a medical coordination cooperation team, the patient can accomplish this. Another way to improve this is to incorporate a shared resource to provide the patient with more information about their treatment options (Wang et al., 2018). Health Partners Regional Hospital, Mayo Clinic, and University of Minnesota Medical Center are excellent community resources.DepressionLearning about hypertension might significantly affect a patient’s mental and emotional health. Because this is a long-term ailment, the patient will need to alter her lifestyle and spend a significant amount of money to guarantee that she receives the best possible treatment (Fowler, 2017).
All of these things may take a toll on the patient. Depression is a serious problem because its symptoms and indications might be mistaken for those of other medical conditions.In the treatment of depression, patient-centered interventions include ensuring that the patient maintains her daily activities, uses medication when symptoms appear, educates the patient about depression, and gets the patient’s social circle more involved in her overall health and well-being (Wang et al., 2018). The University of Minnesota Medical Center, Mayo Clinic, psychiatric hospitals, the Minnesota Department of Human Services, and other community services might be consulted if a patient suffers from depression.DementiaBlocked arteries cause vascular dementia, and constricted arteries hinder blood flow to the brain. Strokes are thought to be a contributing factor in people developing dementia. Cognitive
decline is one of the hallmarks of dementia (decline in memory, problem-solving skills, and language) (Fowler, 2017). Patients with high blood pressure should know that poor health and lifestyle decisions can lead to dementia, a chronic and progressive disease.Workouts, multisensory stimulation, and medication are all examples of patient-centered therapies (pharmacology). Reminiscence, reassurance, and aromatherapy are some of the methods used to treat those with dementia (Wang et al., 2018). The Minnesota Guardians Pharmacy, the University of Minnesota Medical Center, and the Mayo Clinic are among the local community services that can assist patients in dealing with dementia.Ethical considerations in patient-centered healthcare interventionsHealthcare has a crucial role in upholding ethical standards and should be performed following moral principles. According to the Institute of Medicine (IOM), patient-centered treatment includes ethical
considerations as a core component (Fowler, 2017). This includes making sure that patients are treated with respect and consideration at all times. American Nurses Association’s (ANA) Code of Ethics encourages nurses to guarantee that they adhere to their professional standards. The ethical principles of healthcare delivery, such as benevolence, independence, nonmaleficence, and impartiality, are crucial criteria for ensuring that treatment is provided ethically. Improving care coordination is made possible by ethical and moral healthcare practices.When it comes to caring coordination, ethical questions arise and are critical, such as whether the patient’s well-being has been considered. Additionally, whether care coordination has improved patient safety and healthcare quality is another matter (Wang et al., 2018). Team members might reflect on what they would have achieved if the problem had been
more personal (maybe to a family member or friend). Quality care and patient outcomes may be ensured if concerns are dealt with ethically, and the patient is given the finest treatment available.Continuity and Coordination of Care in Health PolicyHealth policies play a critical role in ensuring that healthcare is ethical and compliant with applicable laws. Health policy should also consider ethical deliberations, a critical part of the care integration strategy. The government and the organizations established to monitor and operationalize healthcare operations set health policies. They are designed to ensure that healthcare goals are met quickly and effectively (Wang et al., 2018). The Affordable Care Act (ACA), commonly known as Obamacare after President Barack Obama, who advocated for its passage, is a major healthcare policy. Regardless of how
it is perceived, the law has had a substantial influence on the process of care coordination and continuity.The Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA) is a regulation that controls patient information privacy and insurance coverage for health care services under its purview. It aims to make healthcare more accessible to more people, regardless of where they live in the country or where the federal government has authority over them at any one moment. A multidisciplinary approach, trust, and privacy in care coordination make it possible for patients to share their private medical information with a wide range of specialists (Hu et al., 2018). HIPAA guarantees that care coordination uses patient data in the most effective manner possible.Both Obamacare and HIPAA assure patient assistance in times of need.
Hypertension may significantly influence patients, and they should obtain the best available care (Hu et al., 2018). Additionally, the Care Continuum and Coordination Act improves patient care by allowing them to continue receiving healthcare services for a given time. Effective health policy provisions are important tools if a patient is nearing the end of their life and cannot pay for treatment.Priorities a Care Coordinator Would IntroduceLearning sessions are essential to improve care coordination. The best method to implement a care coordination strategy is to provide patients with regular educational opportunities (Liang et al., 2017). These opportunities will assist patients in grasping the need for care coordination better. Many key aspects of the patient’s care coordination plan were emphasized. We effectively coordinated and dealt with the difficulties that developed
because of the uncovered concerns, ensuring that the care continuum was done in the manner intended by the appropriate parties.As a care coordinator and healthcare provider, I learned how to attend to patients’ needs in partnership with them. In addition, I gained insight into the hopes and concerns of patients and the areas where they believed the healthcare continuum might require improvement. The patient made it clear that she was aware of the importance of the continuum of treatment. The coordination strategy allowed her to gather crucial information that she would not have otherwise accessed. However, it was clear that some aspects of the care plan needed improvement.Close people, such as family members, should be encouraged to attend the sessions by the patient. Consequently, improved care coordination is
achieved even in the patient’s own home. Care coordination practices will benefit nutritionists, fitness coaches, and other professionals in physiotherapy and occupational therapy (Liang et al., 2017). Because of such adjustments, the final care plan would be revised and implemented. Increasing the number of learning sessions will benefit everyone, but it would be especially beneficial to hypertension patients. Changes based on evidence-based practice should be intended to ensure that care is delivered quickly and efficiently.Plan for Patient Care and Healthy People 2030In the treatment process and the care coordination plan, patient happiness is the most important goal for all parties. The patient in this study expressed her happiness with the treatment process because of the learning sessions, which incorporated patients in the care process. The progress made in
Rolling Stones were in the shadow of the Beatles from the very beginning, and this fact disturbed them a lot. On the other hand, most of the fame went to the Beatles, and the Rolling Stones constantly felt their superiority. To be different, they tried to become the anti-Beatles. The legendary Beatles were a pioneer of hard rock: the musical influence of the song Helter Skelter led to the emergence of heavy metal (Covach and Bell 28). The influence of The Rolling Stones on the formation and development of rock music cannot be overestimated. It was significant not only in music, like the Beatles but also in artistic and visual, image and mass media terms.In songwriting development, the Rolling Stones tried hard to keep up with their competitors,
A mutation is a change in the genome of an organism. Most commonly, mutations are defined as changes in DNA structure that occur due to disruption of the sequence of genes or the emergence of new genes. In this paper, I would like to talk about spontaneous mutations. Spontaneous mutations occur by chance – for example if a sheep is suddenly born in a flock of sheep with shorter legs; such mutations can also occur in humans. The ADRB1 gene, for example, is responsible for regulating the amount of sleep a person needs each night to function properly. Most humans need eight hours of sleep or more, but about 5% of the population enjoys a slightly different mutant version. Tests done on a mother and daughter who had
yet been conducted. Such a mutation does not affect the human population in the general world. This is mainly due to the fact that it is not dangerous and is not life-threatening to its carriers. Thus, such a mutation is only a positive addition to the life abilities of a human carrier. This mutation is sporadic and is not a dominant trend in population genome changes despite its dominance. I find this example interesting because natural changes in the human genome open up new possibilities for the population. Thus, studying such changes is essential for human development and a deeper study of human capabilities.
Obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) is a chronic and long-term disorder characterized by uncontrollable, repeated thoughts and behaviors that an individual feels the need to repeat over and over. The case of Robert, a twenty-three-year-old young man, will be discussed further. Robert came to a mental health facility to get treated for anxiety, but it soon turned out that he rather struggled with OCD because he strongly smelled of disinfectant and reported excessive cleaning behaviors. After being in contact with surfaces and people, Robert felt a strong urge to wash his hands with bleach. He could wash his hands up to thirty times a day, which damaged his skin dramatically. However, the fear of germs was much stronger, and he could not stand touching something without washing his hands afterward.
prefers keeping his distance from them. He works remotely from home, which quite pleases him because he does not have to go anywhere and spend time with other people in a confined space. Overall, Robert does not have a dependency on other people when it comes to handling his OCD and prefers being on his own the majority of the time. In Robert’s case, the combination of behavior therapy and pharmacological treatment is possible. Cognitive-behavioral treatment can be implemented for treating Robert’s OCD, including exposure and response prevention and cognitive restructuring (Moody, 2017). It is expected that Robert will feel relief from his symptoms within several weeks.
Physical examination of the affected regions of the skin is necessary. Individuals with cellulitis are likely to have a reddened region of the skin, swelling as well as intense pain (Brown & Watson, 2022). Brant experiences pain in his right leg, in a reddened region that is swollen.The affected area should be thoroughly checked for any signs of skin disintegration. Variations in temperature in the area should be monitored along with signs of an abscess (Sutherland & Parent, 2017). Brant revealed that he was bit by a mosquito on the reddened area.This being a seemingly severe case, the physician may order complete blood count (CBC) testing. This will help measure blood count levels (Bennett et al., 2020). A CBC will allow the physician to make an accurate early
diagnosis of a wide range of medical conditions.The physician may also order a C-reactive protein (CRP) test, which is a blood test for inflammation. This would be a necessity since Brant has broken skin because of a mosquito bite (Sutherland & Parent, 2017). Brant’s case is an event of major systemic disturbance since there is a manifestation of chills and acute disorientation.Priority diagnostic criteria for Brant would include assessing the occurrence of erythematous inflammation in the basal dermis and subcutaneous tissue. Redness, swelling, and pain are all signs of cellulitis (Sutherland & Parent, 2017). Erythema must be present in order to make the diagnosis.The location and nature of broken skin should also be assessed. For cellulitis to be diagnosed, the patient’s skin must be checked for micro-abrasions resulting
the skin, “cytokines” and “neutrophils” are released into the bloodstream to fight them off. This causes cellulitis, which is characterized by redness, warmth, swelling, and pain (Brown & Watson, 2022, para 5). This appears to have been the case for Brant. He was bitten by a mosquito, which broke his skin, allowing bacteria (Streptococcus pyogenes) to penetrate the area. An outbreak of redness and swelling occurred when “cytokines and neutrophils” were drawn to the area of the skin to fight against the bacteria (Brown & Watson, 2022, para 5).
One of the distinct characteristics of the nursing craft is the professionals’ need to constantly adapt to the dynamic environment of health care service and approaches to patient care. In order to facilitate this process, researchers have identified a series of change theories that seek to systematize the experience of implementing new practices (Udod & Wagner, 2018). The two most widespread theories of change in the nursing practice are Lewin’s change theory and Roger’s five-step theory. In Lewin’s framework, the change process undergoes three major stages: unfreezing, change proper, and refreezing (Udod & Wagner, 2018). Thus, according to this framework, in order to introduce change, the team needs to acknowledge the existing workflow and “unfreeze” this system, actively participate in implementing change and new functional patterns, and, finally,
Chapter 12 describes the events of the colonization of the Americas in 1450-1600, including the conquest of the southern continent and the types of trade that affected Asia, Africa, and Europe. The chapter begins by explaining why the more active and aggressive empires, the Ottoman and Chinese, were not involved in the colonization of the lands in South and North America (Adelman et al., 2015, p. 475). The authors note that the peoples of many Asian countries for centuries had only a vague idea of the scope and importance of Columbus’ discovery. This discovery, through increased trade and interaction between peoples, changed the borders of states on new continents and the ways of life of the inhabitants of European, African, and Asian countries. Interestingly, China had a particular
role in international relationships as a country whose population was one-third of the world.It is noted that the expansion to the west was partly an experiment, resulting in the concepts of the New and Old Worlds. Afterward, the control of information from various parts of the world has become a source of political power (Adelman et al., 2015, p. 478). It is also described how the Ottoman Empire, which had already conquered Byzantium, the Balkans, and cut in the Venecians’ empire, conquered Syria and Egypt in 1516-1517. The Ottoman Empire failed to conquer Iran when faced with the Safavid, who established a Shia state on the Iranian plateau. Notably, the subsequent plans of the Ottoman Empire to conquer Europe coincided with the Protestant movement led by Martin Luther.
The authors also discuss the presence of the Portuguese in Africa and Asia in the context of the ‘clash’ of the continents. Key topics include navigation and military advances, sugar and slavery, commerce and conquest in the Indian Ocean, and the conquered Atlantic world.Chapter 13 discusses the further mingling of relationships between the New and Old Worlds, China, Africa, and Europe. The emergence of the mercantilism concept in global commerce is given special attention. Europeans see mercantilism as an understanding that valuable resources such as gold and silver are limited in the world as a whole and the desire to get these resources into their treasury.After the Spaniards seized most of the gold and silver in South America, other European countries tried to obtain these resources by selling
cash crops like tobacco and sugar and through government-sanctioned pirate attacks on merchant ships (Adelman et al., 2015, p. 520). Further, the authors describe the Little Ice Age in the 17th century, when a cold snap and drought caused reforestation after the extinction of millions of cities in South America as a result of diseases introduced by the Spaniards (Adelman et al., 2015, p. 524). Then, the expansion in North America is described, including the settlement of the first states by Europeans on the Atlantic coast.The comparative perspectives on climate change in the Ottoman and Ming empires are equally interesting. In these empires, the Little Ice Age caused severe rebellion and unrest among the peasants who faced famine. The cold hit the eastern Mediterranean parts of the Ottoman
Chapter 9The two main concepts in chapter 9 of “Women in World History” are gender roles and feminism.Gender RolesGender roles (GR) are societal roles allocated to each sex, regardless of whether they are masculine or feminine. GR is learned early on in a person’s life through a process known as gender socialization. Women have been assigned feminine roles over time, which has limited women’s opportunities in society. The Turkmen women were engaged in nomadic carpet making from the comfort of their own homes (Hughes & Hughes, 1997). While men were transporting products out of the family tents, women were responsible for activities within and around the shelters. Young women who had not yet given birth to their first children wove for twelve hours a day while older women
looked after the house. In the twentieth century, carpet weaving became a primary industry in Iran, as it was in high demand in other western societies. Generally, the book outlines how the division of labor made the females handle household chores and males travel and be involved in business transactions.FeminismFeminism is a phrase used to describe a western ideology that advocates for women’s rights based on political and socioeconomic equality. However, feminism’s definition and goal have evolved to include and recognize the interests of males as well. According to Hughes and Hughes (1997), feminism emerged alongside Middle Eastern nationalist movements in Western countries, motivated by European ideas of women’s education, gender equality, individualism, and pride and contempt for Islamic societies. As a result of growing international trade pushed
by the railway and the Suez Canal, many women experienced life changes. Ultimately, When the Islamic Republic was established, the leadership began amending legislation concerning women’s newly acquired rights.Chapter 10Chapter 10 of the book mainly discusses the impact of British rule on Indian women.Gender Division and FeminismThis part, like Chapter 9, covers gender roles; however, it focuses on Indian women in this context. The British came to India to develop their trade and increase their profits. The British colonial government began an educational program to prepare men to work as clerks in the civil service. Women were in charge of domestic chores and the planning and coordination of family gatherings. Westerners had debated on the treatment of women to rationalize their conquests of Asians and Africans. Some conserved
own land and live in nuclear families rather than isolated dwellings. Women in purdah were forced to come out and participate fully in modern-day public events. Indian women were freed from societal restraints, not British colonial power.Poverty and LiteracyDalit women were among the poorest in India, with a high percentage of illiteracy.Discrimination made it more difficult for them to get above poverty, while the ongoing political discussion aggravated the issue of educational and employment protection. Instead of being considered human beings, males have viewed women as sexual objects. They have been repressed for a long time, making it difficult to make significant life adjustments.
The 1999 movie Girl, Interrupted presented life in a psychiatric hospital from the perspective of its patients. The main character is Susanna Kaysen, a girl who has graduated from high school, decided not to go to college and attempted suicide. The last incident became the reason why her parents sent her to a mental institution, where she was diagnosed with borderline personality disorder. The way Susanna was portrayed in the movie using lighting, music, external and internal factors, messages, and relationships with others presented her as a teenager with a severe but not hopeless psychiatric condition.The protagonist is a beautiful thin girl with short hair, pale skin, and a unique sense of style. As the plot reveals, Susanna is talented in writing, painting, and music. However, this framing
was created in the movie to demonstrate that even individuals like Susanna may struggle with multiple emotional issues, including low self-esteem, nonadherence to societal rules, and anxiety. Still, some elements of this character’s appearance suggest that the girl is sad and anxious. Specifically, her eyes rarely express happiness, especially at the film’s beginning.Lighting was also a critical element in Girl, Interrupted , but it was not used to highlight one character. Indeed, during night or day, the light was shed on those involved in a particular conversation or silent scene rather than on one character. This technique probably was used to show that even though this story was mainly about Susanna, she was a small part of this world, where people self-harm, starve themselves, lie to others, and
be violent.Music in Girl, Interrupted is primarily depressing to reveal the protagonist’s state of mind. Susanna’s conversations with therapists always accompany the clock ticking, which usually means that the character is in danger. In this case, the girl is haunted by her mind, several months or weeks from harming herself again. Although most of Susanna’s communication does not have musical framing, there is dramatic music when she makes crucial statements and decisions about her future.The film’s editing was made to represent Susanna’s unease about her memories and thoughts. The story’s timeline is not linear but goes backward to show the girl’s flashbacks about difficult moments in her life. Moreover, the movie starts with one of the final and pivotal situations where the main character sits in darkness with
other patients. It changes to the scene when doctors try to save her life after her suicide attempt when she claims her bones have disappeared. This transition wanted to demonstrate that Susanna was unsure if she was sane or crazy.The movie creators used exterior and interior factors to build the character. For instance, although Susanna, an unconventional and dramatic name, is beautiful, her appearance, attitude, and behavior suggest that this teenage girl may have emotional problems. Indeed, she looks anxious around people and wants to make herself invisible by putting more powder on her face to make it paler and wearing clothes that can maximally cover her body. Susanna’s inner world revolves only around drawing and writing about random situations without any specific purpose. Still, her relationships with
the hospital forever. Thus, her final message was that she wanted to be a part of the ordinary world despite its ambiguity, which set her path to recovery.In summary, Girl, Interrupted is not only a movie about psychiatric patients but also the story of a teenage girl who struggled to find her place in the world. Susanna was a beautiful and talented but anxious young woman. Her framing, interaction with other characters, and the film’s editing were made in such a way to show that the protagonist was aware of her mental issues. However, only true acceptance of these problems allowed her to recover.
It is necessary to fully understand the fundamental difference between the concepts of a leader and a regular employee in any field. While the head of the company is most often focused on the internal financial processes, a good leader understands the paramount importance of employees in any enterprise. The ideal leader sees the potential in every person and helps them develop to the maximum while working with them in the same direction instead of putting pressure. The policy of actions of flawed leaders can lead to more than unpleasant consequences for all sides of any business.Unfortunately, imperfect leaders in our time can be found a lot in any field. Bad experiences can happen on any level, from personal to global. It is particularly difficult to single out
a specific person without personal experience and hard evidence, but statistics show an extremely high proportion of unscrupulous people in high positions. According to available data, the owner of Ali Express online retailer, Jack Ma, can be cited as an example. Plenty of evidence suggests that most of the items available to order are made by underage children from the poorest parts of the world. With the tacit consent of Jack Ma, many thousands of people are being exploited for minimal pay and terrible living conditions. It is an example of a person who is not only a bad leader but intentionally contributes to the violation of human rights. One of the biggest problems, in this case, is the lack of empathy and humanism. A bad leader always
Most writers rely on their stories’ pivotal points to fully develop particular characters. The readers gain a vivid picture of the genuine nature of the characters by narrating their interactions with others, discussions, and actions. The authors use this methodology to bring their characters to life in their stories. Mr. Kapasi, the driver who also performs the role of a tour guide for the Das family, is divulged more via his interlinkages with Mrs. Das than any other personas in Jhumpa Lahiri’s short novel Interpreter of Maladies .In his late forties, Mr. Kapasi, a brilliant Indian man who has lost romantic values in his marriage, is the protagonist of this short narrative told in limited omniscience. Mr. Kapasi is precise in his physical appearance and possesses several qualities
such as observance, hard work, modesty, dependability, and intelligence. He is well-educated, works two jobs that need him to employ his linguistic skills, and goes through life without his wife’s affection. He’s quick to point out the parallels and contrasts between tourists and himself. As a result, the paper looks at how Lahiri portrays Mr. Kapasi through his relationships with Mrs. Das and the story’s indirect depiction of Mrs. Das.It is revealed how Mr. Kapasi views himself and his love life through their connection and communication. For example, he regards his marriage as a failure and aspires to more romantic life. To do something about it, he creates a fantasy in which he imagines himself in an intimate relationship with Mrs. Das, who he believes is suffering from
the same issues. His wife has alienated him and disapproves of his second job as a doctor’s interpreter, as seen by their interactions. His wife seemed preoccupied with their son’s death, which occurred at the hospital where Mr. Kapasi works as an interpreter. Mrs. Das has similar feelings as the protagonist. She is also stuck in a loveless relationship. Mr. Kapasi fantasizes about probable similarities between himself and Mrs. Das initially, but when he learns more about Mrs. Das’s personality, he is disappointed.He chooses closeness between them as a token of his gratitude for Mrs. Das’s kindred spirit in describing his job as ‘romantic,’ believing that it is the only way suitable to escape his loneliness. Although his attitude does not substitute when he discovers that the woman
is not the one he envisages in his delusion, this conversation demonstrates his grateful and empathetic character. It occurs after she tells him about her adulterous affair with her husband’s buddy, through which she produced a son. “Is it agony you’re feeling, Mrs. Das, or is it guilt?” he wonders after hearing her narrative of unfaithfulness (Lahiri 120). This inquiry expresses his sorrow for Mr. Das once he discovers how evil the woman he had thought was good has turned out to be.Mr. Kapasi realizes that he has exaggerated the depth of his troubles with his wife after listening to Mrs. Das’ confession. He realizes that considerably deteriorated cases could have made him perceive even worse than he does now if they had transpired to him. Mr. Kapasi
appears to have no genuine experience in comprehending people, regardless of his faculty, to elucidate some health and related concerns for many individuals, as seen by his wife’s incorrect view of the woman he once dreamed of.Mr. Kapasi’s character would not have been revealed explicitly without Mrs. Das in the short story Interpreter of Maladies. The other characters he meets and interacts with are unconcerned about his safety. They treat him as if he were a second-class citizen, exactly like they treat each other. Mr. Das, for example, is unconcerned about Mr. Kapasi because they have never met. As a result, it is feasible to conclude that Mrs. Das’ character is crucial since she aids in revealing and displaying Mr. Kapasi’s actual personality, which would otherwise stay underdeveloped
if she had not appeared.Mrs. Das is a catalyst for story development and a medium for societal commentary in Jhumpa Lahiri’s intricately gorgeous novel The Interpreter of Maladies. Mrs. Das is a direct cultural contrast to Mr. Kapasi through her indirect portrayal, propelling the plot while providing sad social commentary. The Das family meets Mr. Kapasi as they prepare for their journey through India. It is noted that Mr. Kapasi thought it weird that “Mr. Das should refer to his wife by her first name when speaking to the small girl” (Lahiri 30). It is instantly evident that there is a cultural divide between Kapasi and the Das family. When “Mr. and Mrs. Das behaved like an elder brother and sister, not parents, the cultural divide becomes evident”
(Lahiri 56). As in the case of Mrs. Das and Mr. Kapasi, such stark contrasts often pique people’s interest.Mrs. Das represents an unknown land to Mr. Kapasi. Mr. Kapasi’s adoration for Mrs. Das develops as the novel unfolds, and he finds himself staring at her, appreciating her legs, and yearning to be with her. The cultural difference between Mrs. Das and Mr. Kapasi distinguishes this fling from others and adds to its intrigue (thereby carrying the story forward). Mr. Kapasi, on the one hand, is a poor, down-on-his-luck Indian who works as a translator and tour guide. Mrs. Das, on the other hand, appears to live in style. She does not live in reality: she’s unhappy because she lives a life of irresponsibility, shallowness, superficiality, and an unhealthy
expression.In conclusion, the details of the character’s personalities, the author enable the reader to understand the character. Moreover, the writer shows how the characters view certain subjects through their response to different events. The theme of love and marriage has been reflected in-between character characterization from the narrative. Their personalities, such as Mrs.das being self-centered and Mr. Kapsi’s evolution as a sympathetic character, are well developed. Through both characters, marriage has become an underage issue to be taken into interest. Their characterization has also enabled the story’s development relating to societal issues affecting us.
Developing a contract so that all parties involved could be aware of their obligations and meet them accordingly is one of the vital tasks for an organization. Charles Schwab, an organization offering banking and brokerage services, has developed a contract for its users to sign so that both parties could meet the respective requirements (Reder et al., 2021). For their collaboration. Since the contract in question contains the essential components of a legal agreement, it can be considered viable.Starting with the key definitions of the foundational concepts on which the agreement is based, Schwab’s contract establishes the offer, acceptance, and legality terms from the start exceptionally clearly. The specified clarity and transparency benefit the company and its customers, promoting immediate trust and cooperation (Templin, 2017). Remarkably, Schwab also
In the academic environment of chemical processes, named reactions are of particular importance because they are of applied value or solve problems of intergroup transition between compounds. Among the named processes, the Diels-Alder reaction, or diene synthesis, traditionally used to produce stereospecific six-membered carbon cycles with multiple bonds, is of excellent research popularity. Two types of reagents are used for this reaction, one being a conjugated diene and the other a dienophile. As a dienophile can be used, any substances with π-bond, including alkenes or acetylenes with activating electron acceptor groups, and diene must meet the requirements of chemical stability, conjugation of bonds, and the ability to take s-cis configuration. When they interact, the electron density is redistributed with the formation of single multiple bonds with a six-membered
cycle.The double name of this reaction is due to the history of its creation. In 1927, the process was patented by German organic chemists Otto Diels and Kurt Alder (Diels & Alder, 1927). Since the synthesis of six-membered homocyclic has applications in organic chemistry, including the possibility of using them to produce aromatic rings, Diels and Alder were awarded the Nobel Prize for their development in 1950.Since then, the possibilities of diene synthesis have expanded significantly; this includes the possibility of obtaining bicyclic compounds if cyclic dienes were used as raw materials. However, the basis has remained unchanged; namely, the addition of a dienophile to a diene by 2,4-conjugation allows the preparation of non-aromatic homocyclic with one multiple bonds in them. Initially, an intermediate compound with unstably separated
multiple bonds is formed, which stabilizes over time into a stable homocycle. The exothermic reaction is carried out without additional reagents in an inert solvent at low temperatures, which is an additional advantage in terms of its practical implementation in the laboratory.ProcedureFor the present diene synthesis reaction, butadiene sulfone was used to produce a conjugated diene system when heated. The use of butadiene-1,3 instead of butadiene sulfone was complicated by the gaseous state of the diene, which made the process technically challenging to implement. Thermal decomposition of solid butadiene sulfone was carried out to produce toxic sulfur dioxide and butadiene-1,3. The sulfur dioxide was captured with water since using only a fume hood would result in air contamination.Thus, 2.29 g of butadiene sulfone was added to 1.22 g
a five-minute cooling down after the completion of heating, the process was repeated but with 5 mL of distilled water added to the round-bottom flask. After 30 minutes of repeated heating, the mixture was cooled, and the synthesized crystals were collected by vacuum filtration with 2×2 portions of ice water. The cyclohex-4-ene-cis-1,2-dicarboxylic acid crystals were dried and analytically weighed to determine their exact mass for further analysis. If the crystals were not distinguishable after the reheating procedure, the addition of a few drops of concentrated sulfuric acid should have catalyzed the process.
It is no secret that some members of society have more privileges than others. People are marginalized based on their race, ethnicity, and social class. My experience with unjustly treated people was when I saw how an African American woman was not allowed to enter a restaurant due to some unknown reasons. This was a terrible experience as I felt anxious about what was happening in the restaurant. I think people should not be treated badly because of their race. Racial discrimination should be a problem in the modern world.This minor case suggests the greater problem that is unjustly treating people in the context of the criminal justice system. The criminal justice system in the United States is designed to protect and serve everyone. This concept should be
inclusive of all races, genders, and other identifying features. It happens more than what the news channels may bring to light, although it should not. Minorities and people who do not meet society’s “norms” are frequently subjected to unequal treatment by those charged with protecting them. In the book, Stevenson writes about groups of people who are vulnerable to being victimized by the system and how he helped people in prison to bring them justice. It can be said that the system is inherently biased toward minorities, and it makes people suffer without any significant justification.A prominent example of this is the case of George Floyd. When I first viewed the footage of George Floyd’s killing, I felt a wave of pain and rage run through my body.
Not because I was surprised or outraged because Black women and men have been occurring since long before I was born; rather, I felt impotent.That someone in a position to protect and safeguard chose to do the exact opposite and murder someone so openly and publicly. It’s the same hopelessness that the spectators who witnessed Floyd’s murder must have felt, and it’s the same helplessness that George must have felt as he screamed in his final minutes. The kind of powerlessness that makes you want to take action.One of the lessons of the Black Lives Matter movement is that being non-racist is not enough; we must all utilize our voices to be anti-racist. Because silence might be construed as consent, we all must fulfill our moral obligations to
Differences between primary and secondary sourcesPrimary sources are the ones providing first-hand evidence on the events or phenomena that one is studying. Such sources include diaries, photographs, video and audio recordings, interview transcripts, works of art, statistical data, and others. All of these types of sources give the researcher a possibility to learn about the investigated matter directly by observing it or reading/listening about it from first-hand witnesses. In case of the Chernobyl Nuclear Plant Disaster, the most relevant primary sources include reports, documents, and local newspapers of that time, photographs, and interviews of witnesses. By using such resources, one can obtain the possibility to learn unbiased facts and obtain the most relevant information about the event or phenomenon under investigation. Moreover, when analyzing primary sources, the researcher
can become immersed in the atmosphere in which the object of investigation existed and the circumstances under which it developed. For instance, for historians and archeologists, such primary sources as ancient fossils or some tribes’ belongings serve both as sources of information and inspiration. On the other hand, for someone analyzing a political or environmental issue, reports and pertinent news releases will be helpful sources of reliable data.Meanwhile, secondary sources offer second-hand information and analyses from other researchers. Secondary sources include books, reviews, and scholarly articles investigating the subject of research. By analyzing secondary sources, one can get a deeper understanding of both the analyzed phenomenon and the primary sources. While primary sources offer a first-hand view of the situation, secondary ones enable the researcher to synthesize the
The development of the Chesapeake colonies is a bright example of how slavery became one of the integral parts of societies existing on these lands. The necessity to grow specific crops and use them to earn money and survive resulted in the constantly growing demand for the workforce. However, the practice of using indentured servants was ineffective because of the end date of their contracts. It meant that new sources of people to work on fields and plantations were needed. The resolution of the given problem was a matter of survival, as the inability to raise crops would mean death for the whole community (Kidd, 2019). Under these conditions, the development of slavery was inevitable as people stripped of their rights could be used to perform diverse tasks,
as a cheap workforce was inevitable. Although the pacific principles of Quakerism dominated these lands at the first stages of their evolution, settlers still needed people to perform complex tasks and support the evolution of colonies. Regarding the limited number of arriving settlers, slavery became the possible option to compensate for the deficit and create the basis for future expansion. The given trend was similar to the Middle and Chesapeake colonies, proving specific attitudes to slavery peculiar to people of that period (Huntley, 2019). They were ready to promote further evolution of this institution as the central way to support the development of the agricultural sector critical for survival and enrichment.
The history of humankind has witnessed several events that significantly affected large areas shared between several countries. One such incident is the explosion at the Chernobyl nuclear power station in modern Ukraine (Naoum & Spyropoulos, 2021). The accident happened in 1986 and has influenced numerous lives and regions (Naoum & Spyropoulos, 2021). The explosion at Chernobyl is a disaster with long-lasting effects that still present threats to the environment and should be remembered by the society around the globe.People’s mistakes have contributed to the nuclear tragedy, which the previous administration attempted to conceal. Chernobyl is located north of the Ukrainian capital, Kyiv, and the country is neighboring Russia, Moldova, Romania, Hungary, Slovakia, Poland, and Belarus (Mousseau, 2022). The station began to operate in 1977 in the former Soviet
Union, and about 14000 people lived in the town before the explosion (Naoum & Spyropoulos, 2021). The closest city was Pripyat, with approximately 49000 residents, many of whom were Chernobyl employees and their families (Naoum & Spyropoulos, 2021). A reactor exploded on April 26, 1986, during a safety test, and the incident was due to several reasons, such as human errors, unauthorized manipulations, and design imperfections of the reactor (Naoum & Spyropoulos, 2021). The Soviet authorities had tried to hide the occurrence but failed, and the Chernobyl accident later ranked at the maximum classification on the International Nuclear Event Scale (Naoum & Spyropoulos, 2021). The fire burned for ten days, and a radioactive plume spread across Europe, with an exclusion zone remaining nearby Chernobyl (Mothersill, 2022). The disaster
at Chernobyl has impacted numerous people, especially those who lived nearby.The Chernobyl accident has caused multiple consequences, primarily because of radiation. Radioactive substances significantly contaminated more than 38000 square miles, affecting vital natural objects like the river Pripyat, which was watering the broader area of Kyiv (Naoum & Spyropoulos, 2021). The explosion harmed agricultural lands and pine trees and led to the weakening or dying of wild animals (Naoum & Spyropoulos, 2021). According to Naoum and Spyropoulos (2021), domestic animals inside and outside the Soviet Union also showed increased levels of radioactivity in the following years. Moreover, the incident had an intensive human impact, raising the number of people suffering and passing away from cancer and acute radiation sickness (Naoum & Spyropoulos, 2021). Inhabitants from nearby areas have
developed mental health issues due to being worried about the risks of radiation exposure (Naoum & Spyropoulos, 2021). Despite little evidence of the accident expanding congenital disabilities, some European countries have detected a higher number of abortions (Naoum & Spyropoulos, 2021). The explosion resulted in damaging lives and the local environment.Furthermore, the nuclear power station disaster had political and socioeconomic consequences. After the incident, the international community became distrustful of the Soviet Union, and the explosion is perceived to have facilitated the fall of the Union (Naoum & Spyropoulos, 2021). Several countries, mainly European, have spent resources to inspect the amount of radioactivity in soil, water, and food, while Ukraine, Belarus, and Russia lost lands needed for agricultural and forest production (Naoum & Spyropoulos, 2021). The tragedy at
Chernobyl has led to expenditures from governments and geopolitical changes.The territory of the Chernobyl nuclear station remains to be a place of international interest. For several years, the area has attracted scientific expeditions and people interested in visiting sites associated with death, but the situation changed after Russia invaded Ukraine (Mothersill, 2022). According to Mothersill (2022), in the absence of humans, forests grew up in the region that wild animals like wolves, horses, lynxes, and bison started to occupy. However, as Russia entered Ukraine via the Chernobyl exclusion zone, the army brought heavy equipment through contaminated places (Mothersill, 2022; Mousseau, 2022). An environmental threat that such a tactic can cause is the ignition of forest fires, which, worsened by climate change and local dead trees and debris, can
with new trees and more wild animals. However, the current political conflict with the Russian army entering Ukraine from the nuclear station’s area can potentially initiate forest fires that can ruin nature. Society has to know about such disasters as the explosion at Chernobyl and its outcomes to understand the need to prevent similar events in the future, preserve the environment, and save lives.
An exhibition is a planned staging and demonstration of selected items such as attires and garments which occur in an educational or cultural setup. It may be carried out in museums, exhibition halls, art galleries, parks, or libraries. All exhibitions are short-term; hence they are scheduled to occur within a set timeframe. For an exhibition to be successful, it has to be assembled and implemented by a team of experts such as the curators whose work is to select items to be displayed and presented. It involves activities such as commercially focused trade fairs and expositions, art in major museums and smaller galleries, and interpretive shows. Christian Dior: Designer of Dreams show scheduled from September 10 th , 2021 to February 20 th , 2022 is an example
of a presentation illustrating several aspects of an exhibition.Thesis and Themes of Christian Dior’s ExhibitionThe exhibition on Christian Dior sightsees the intelligence behind Dior’s theatrical creations that rejuvenated the entire Parisian haute couture industry after the desolation of the Second World War. In 1947, the revolutionary “New Look” and the establishment of the new couture house swept away the manly wartime silhouette, making Christian Dior’s postwar fashions wanted, worn, and imitated by women around the globe (Bowles). Drawn from the Royal Ontario Museum, the Christian Dior fashion design collection is perfected by a dozen attires from the McCord Museum’s fashion, dress, and textiles collection and loans from Dior Heritage, Paris. The exhibition emphasizes on the epoch from 1947 to 1957. It offers a fascinating insight into the inventive
process and the mechanism of the Parisian haute couture industry during the 1950s (Bowles). It examines Dior’s luxury textiles, romantic embroideries, and iconic lines that laid the basis for the fashion house’s international success. Presenting magnificent fashions from daytime to sunset attire for grand events, the exhibition invites guests to discover the gorgeous artistry, sophisticated feature, and brilliant luxury designs by the amount from the Golden Age of haute couture.Presented are galleries dedicated to Dior and the creative directors who thrived him: Marc Bohan, Yves Saint Laurent, John Galliano, Gianfranco Ferre, and Raf Simons. A latrine room, an acknowledgment to the Ateliers, and contiguous galleries of tailoring garments display Dior’s petite mains (Bowles). The chief foyer of our Beaux-Arts Court has been restructured as an enthralled garden, and
an ending gallery reveals dresses worn by celebrities from Grace Kelly to Jennifer Lawrence. The Brooklyn Museum exhibition of Christian Dior: Designer of Dreams is curated by Denver Art Museum, Florence Muller, Avenir Foundation Curator of Textile Art, and Fashion curate Designer of Dreams, in collaboration with Brooklyn Museum.Installation view, Christian Dior: Designer of Dreams, Brooklyn Museum, September 10th, 2021–February 20th, 2022. (Photo: Here and Now Agency)Description of DisplaysGuests are correspondingly shown how Dior has been understood through the years. Fashion photography beautifies a room, plus the work of such prominent artists such as Ethan James Green, Irving Penn, Lillian Bassman, Annie Leibovitz, and Horst P. Richard Avedon takes the middle stage in this room, instantaneously displaying the most photos and also the largest. Avedon’s Dovima with Elephants
is positioned in the center of the room, to be observed beside a mannequin earring and the same dress that Dovima dressed in the photograph. Unprecedented attention is also given to American photojournalists, who have their hedge to depict how Americans see the brand.Narrative StructureDior exemplars on show comprise Galliano’s first dress premeditated for the house: the midnight satin and lace lingerie-inspired clothing worn by Diana, Princess of Wales, to join the Metropolitan Museum of Art’s Dior reviewing in 1996. Here is the chartreuse satin outfit trimmed in fawn-colored pink that Nicole Kidman wore to the 1997 Academy Awards (Bowles). Raf Simon’s shell pink ballgown that Jeniffer Lawrence sprawled over as she went to claim her 2013 Academy Award. The fashionable diadems throughout the exhibition are by Stephen
Jones, who has craftily recommended period hairstyles and replicated archive hat silhouettes, and this final room suggests the character of the specific wearers with twists of ribbon.Exhibition DesignThe exhibition uses an interesting display method whereby a few rooms offer an understanding of the encryptions of the house and how they play a part in different designs. The 18 th century’s inspiration on the house is given exceptional attention, displaying how the overgenerous dress of the time prejudiced the silhouette and configurations of the designs (Bowles). Raf Simon’s work here markedly differs from his forerunners because he takes encouragement not from ladies’ current dresses but rather from men and dressing representations in traditionally manly coats.Color also plays an important portion in the brand today. Items of all kinds from
into the course of couture’s creation (Bowles). Flowers and gardens, which held a special place in Dior’s heart, are given the largest room in the exhibit. Their influence is seen constantly throughout the show and beautiful dresses from the house’s history encircles the visitors, reaching up to the ceiling in front of garden-inspired backdrops. Christian Dior’s exhibit poses relevant question in the fashion study. It asks whether the legacy of its process has led to the progressively narrow and standardized fashion exhibitions that can harm America’s fashionable status through excluding several places and networks that make the State’s fashion culture unique.Installation view, Christian Dior: Designer of Dreams, Brooklyn Museum, September 10th, 2021–February 20th, 2022.

In his writing, Daniel Spanjer claims that the Christian worldview has influenced the study of Liberal Arts. He discusses science and how humans are the products of the world – they are endowed with feeling and thought, which are beyond natural (Spanjer 3). The author differentiates the reasons for learning everything surrounding people and claims that thinkers can answer many questions, either logical or surreal. These people have developed a term worldview “to describe this holistic concept of learning, scholarship, experience and knowledge” (Spanjer 15). Even though sometimes they cannot agree on the solution to the problems, time helps them dissipate false beliefs.The other reading by Brad Green suggests the interconnection of words and faith. In the chapter. When transcendent realities and goals surround a language, it is
by Dockery narrates about the Christian faith’s influence on learning. People are encouraged to think in Christian categories in order to sanctify thoughts and beliefs (Dockery 4). It is vital to seek God’s guidance and His calls that help humans contribute to the societal good (Dockery 8). Thoughtful believers are needed to revive faith-centered higher educational institutions because only such people will be able to promote gracious deeds. Hence, Christian worldview is again viewed as foundation of successful education and learning.
BackgroundBoth Christianity and postmodern relativism relate to spirituality and its influence on human life. Christianity authors the belief in the existence of a sovereign God who controls everything in the universe, allowing and disallowing life events. The theological and religious prism affects how people perceive God as the all-powerful and eternal one (Lasair, 2020). Christians’ belief systems are based on the concept of God as portrayed in the Holy Bible. They explain the purpose, truth, and meaning of human life, influencing how Christians perceive health care. Dependence on the all-powerful external force enables Christians to reach a transcendent state for health care experiences and other life events.Since they follow God’s guidance in every decision, Christians are more at peace with life outcomes. For example, they accept health care
outcomes more readily than non-believers do because of the belief that God allows every fate, whether it is bad or good. Ethics are guided by biblical principles, even when related to health care (Lasair, 2020). For instance, abortion is equated to murder the unborn child and is not accepted by Christians. Therefore, healthcare decisions involving Christianity are guided by the bible.Unlike Christianity, which rejects ambiguity by adhering to biblical guidelines, postmodern relativism takes a liberal approach to spirituality and ethics. These relativists believe there is no absolute truth regarding the existence of God or adherence to ethics (Garrett, 2018). Therefore, every spiritual or ethical belief is valid, even if there are contrasting ones. As such, discarding any argument or decision about health care is not encouraged. Postmodern relativism
supports diversity and multicultural approaches to healthcare because medical professionals must embrace multiple and contradictory perceptions from patients and families (Garrett, 2018). In addition, the understanding of ethics might change from one patient to the other without affecting the quality of care.ScientismScientism argues that hard sciences provide superior scientific knowledge as the only source of genuine and absolute truths. The hard sciences, including physics and biology, rely on laws of nature or experimentation. They produce reliable results based on testable, factual, and replicable data. Scientism regards soft sciences as inferior or pseudosciences since their conjectures and guesses are not replicable or factual but subject to change (Vukov, 2021). It seeks to differentiate the two science categories based on the value of their information, with hard sciences presenting more
valuable knowledge than soft sciences. The reliance on subjectivism makes soft sciences prone to influences by human nature, leading to contradictory ideas on the same topics of principles. Overall, scientism accords greater intellectual authority to hard over soft sciences in knowledge matters.There are arguments raised against scientism and its elevation of hard sciences. The first argument refutes the claim that hard sciences use factual data that does not change by asserting the restructuring of measuring instruments and fluctuations in the environment (Vukov, 2021). Therefore, the sciences cannot provide absolute facts and truths as knowledge grows with new information, creating no difference between hard and soft sciences. The second argument against scientism is the disregard hard sciences have over personal opinion to rely heavily on rationality. Since willful thoughts
are significant in new knowledge discovery, the tyrannical approach presented by scientism prevents scientific advancement. Therefore, soft sciences will perform better in advancing scientific knowledge through the discovery of new information as they support willful thoughts.Worldview QuestionsUltimate RealityUltimate reality states that individuals are the result of the exchanges they have with the environment. People are the product of their surroundings through nurture than nature. The environment includes family units, schools, religious groups, community, neighborhood, city, and state. In this view, I am the product of my interactions with parents, grandparents, and siblings at the family level. Other important exchanges are in my school, where I interact with students and teachers. I have a social life away from home and learning institutions such as at work and in other
community events.My family has instilled foundational values and beliefs in me, while schools, community, and religious groups have added to the belief system or changed my perspective on some ideas. Since I was raised in a Christian family, most of my childhood was spent in Christian circles rather than Muslim ones. Therefore, I am more inclined towards conservatism in controversial public health issues abortion and polygamy. However, the school environment and knowledge acquired in learning have opened up my thinking to become a more liberal Christian. As such, I would support abortion where life is threatened and embrace LGBTQ communities in respect of equal human rights.Nature of the UniverseThe nature of the universe is to experience constant change by relying on energy and prioritizing processes through evolution, energy
conversion, extinction, and competition. Evolution entails adaptation to changes in one’s environment, while energy conversion is a shift between energy forms. Extinction occurs when components are removed from the universe due to the inability to compete, while competition is the struggle for scarce resources.While plants and animals are known to experience extinction, humans undergo competition and evolution. The nature of the universe forces us into schools to acquire the best education to become the most competitive in the job market. Without skills and experience, people can become ‘extinct’ in their areas of specialization. As technology advances, humans must evolve to adapt to the newest ways of living to avoid extinction. For example, the world is gradually shifting to paperless currency such as digital money offered by central banks.
People who stick to cash payments will be unable to buy from most stores a few years into the future. The nature of the universe forces them to evolve from cash to cashless payment systems for survival.Human BeingHuman beings are animals with rationalism and can be defined as the creations of God or the products of evolution. Religion recognizes God as the creator of all universe, including human beings. For instance, Christians believe that humans have the image of God as entailed in the creation story of the Holy Bible. Therefore, they are to follow the creator’s purpose for their existence, including procreating, nurturing the earth and everything in it, and obeying his word. Humans are also defined as the products of science through the process of evolution.
This perspective argues that humans developed higher thinking capacity through selective adaptation, leading to complex vocabulary, languages, and technologies.My worldview aligns with the Christianity definition that a supreme God created humans in his likeness to accomplish his purpose on earth. In this definition, we are supposed to abide by the principles of the creator to procreate and protect the rest of the universe. Human beings are stewards on earth, positioned by God to take care of animals, birds, and the environment they live in.KnowledgeKnowledge is a combination of skills, information, and facts cognitively acquired from learning or experience. Learning might occur in formal or informal set-ups such as schools or at home. In a formal learning environment, knowledge acquisition processes are structured with clear roles between teachers and
learners. Additionally, specific sets of knowledge are passed down to learners. However, informal learning environments are often social groups where knowledge is unintentionally passed from one person to another. For example, in a family setting, children learn from their parents through imitating behavior and words. Experience refers to acquiring knowledge while doing some work rather than from somebody. Therefore, learning imparts theoretical knowledge while experience gives practical know-how.Knowledge is a critical component of our lives as it enhances the quality of life for everyone. For instance, professional medical practitioners such as doctors and nurses utilize their knowledge to help us maintain bodily and mental health. Engineers in every field ensure that we achieve optimum efficiency by using functional machines, living in well-built houses, and using safe infrastructures. Teachers
have the knowledge that helps children and adults to acquire more knowledge through formal learning structures.Basis of EthicsThe basis of ethics can be individual culture or public beliefs. My basic basis of ethics is my culture, which is the result of interacting with family, community, and other social groups. This culture develops from birth, where a child learns right and wrong from parents and older siblings. For example, I have learned to respect others and treat everyone with kindness. I have also learned to be assertive and fight for my rights where necessary. Stealing and cheating other people to get ahead in life is morally wrong. Overall, the greatest percentage of my ethics are based on my culture, while a small part is determined by the prevailing belief
Nephrology Dialysis Transplantation (NDT) is a scientific and clinical European journal. It is a collection of articles that analyze dialysis, transplantation, and nephrology research. Moreover, the NDT journal is officially approved by the European Renal Association (ERA). Thus, it presents crucial analysis and data for scientists worldwide. Additionally, the other article from StatPearls was selected as the source is included in the National Center for Biotechnological Information (NCBI). Therefore, the center distributes and stores information about scientifically approved research.The article focuses on the leading causes of chronic inflammation at the time of end-stage renal failure. In addition, the authors describe the impact of disease on clinical outcomes and the role of middle molecules as significant factors in the onset of pathology. The latest breakthroughs and research in dialysis
Elephants dance the polonaise, sea lions juggle balls, bears ride bicycles, a tiger jumps through a burning hoop – all these are attractions with four-legged performers that thrill the audience, especially the little ones. Nevertheless, animal rights activists have sounded the alarm because circus tricks are unnatural for wild creatures; they are considered mockery and torture. There should be a thoroughgoing prohibition on the exploitation of animals in circuses, as this issue is contrary to humane treatment and is a direct violation of their rights.Since the 1970s, numerous nations have been setting up laws to treat creatures and guarantee their essential protection. International agreements were concluded, recognizing that animals are sentient beings whose basic needs must be respected and protected (Marino 148). Significantly, the tricks taught to animals
Learning history helps people draw connections between the past and present and allows making predictions for the future based on previous lessons. Climate change is one of the most significant topics of interest and research. No matter how well societies develop in terms of technology, they will inevitably face disasters if they neglect the issues of nature. The Chornobyl nuclear accident, which happened in 1986, was one of the most devastating ecological events that changed the fates of thousands of people in many countries.My prior knowledge of the topic is not ample, but I do know that the major release of radioactive materials occurred, which led to the contamination of air and water, causing numerous diseases and deaths. I have also read somewhere that the then-ruling government of
the USSR kept the explosion a secret, which prevented people from saving their lives within the first few hours and days after the accident. Unfortunately, individuals living next to the nuclear plant, as well as those living farther, had no chance of survival. The accident led to the increase in radiation levels to “between ten and one hundred times normal” (Price, 2021, para. 1). I have also read about the courageousness and self-sacrifice of those who were involved in fire extinguishing processes.I would like to learn more about the reasons that led to such a disaster and to find out whether it was preventable. Also, I want to investigate the reasons behind the decision of the USSR government to conceal the truth and not let people save their
lives. I cannot understand how they could have been silent at a time when thousands of citizens were being gradually driven into an ecological trap.The values, assumptions, and beliefs I have related to the chosen topic are two-dimensional. On the one hand, I am concerned that such catastrophes can occur and harm people’s lives. On the other hand, I am deeply disturbed by the fact that the authorities can act so thoughtlessly and dare to neglect people’s lives. I have always considered freedom and health as the most important values. I believe that world leaders should do everything possible to prevent such disasters or at least not conceal them.My opinion about the topic is that people should learn from such disasters and use this devastating lesson in the
Russians seized Chornobyl and Zaporizhzhia nuclear plants, and they seem not to realize what aftermath explosions there could bring.Sadly, it seems that history has not taught some people anything. After so many deaths in 1986 and following years, one could think that countries of the world had learned the value of people’s health and lives. That is why I want to investigate the topic of the Chornobyl nuclear accident. This way, I will be able to learn more about that disaster and draw conclusions on the present-day threats and the need for preventive measures to stop the possibility of its repetition.
A cardiopulmonary attack happens when the heart suddenly ceases to pump blood, causing the victim to become unconscious and show no signs of blood flow and breathing. Instant death can occur if corrective steps are not implemented quickly enough. One of Australia’s leading causes of mortality and morbidity is cardiovascular arrest (Paratz et al., 2021). Each year, around 5,000 Australians under the age of 50 suffer suspected cardiovascular arrest. Ninety percent of the victims die directly as a result of the arrest (Paratz et al., 2021). Cardiac arrest can occur in anyone, regardless of age or health history, but it is more likely in people already diagnosed with heart problems (Kandasamy et al., 2019). Therefore, early defibrillation and cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) preserve a person’s life and decrease any
lengthy neurological dysfunction.The chances of survival of a patient requiring resuscitation depend on the correct application of the CPR procedure and the immediate collaborative response of the medical teams. The video obtained from YouTube attempts to illustrate the basic steps for appropriate CPR and the use of a defibrillator (ChristianCare, 2011). According to the video, a nurse enters the room and observes no patient activity on the bed after calling the patient’s name and receiving no response. The nurse responds by calling out to her colleagues for assistance. When a patient fails to respond to tactile or verbal stimuli, it is best recommended that the nurse or any healthcare worker call for help (Olasveengen et al., 2020). The Australian Resuscitation Council (ARC) guideline three recommends that healthcare workers
call for help from colleagues in case of a cardiac arrest (Curtis et al., 2019). Since cardiac arrest can cause neurological dysfunction within a few minutes of its initiation, it is critical for teamwork among the medical personnel.Before making any clinical decisions or commencing CPR, it is necessary to evaluate the patient’s airway and assess whether or not CPR should be initiated. A comprehensive but quick examination of the airway is essential for managing patients who require immediate CPR. According to ARC guideline four, clearing the airway includes opening the mouth and gently lowering the head to enable any visible foreign material, such as food, blood, vomit, or fluids, to drain (Bray et al., 2021). Fingertips can be used to remove noticeable foreign material by sweeping. The finger
sweep is beneficial in cases of unconscious adults and children older than one-year-old who has a foreign body airway obstruction (FBAO) (Couper et al., 2020). However, the person clearing the mouth from foreign material should be careful enough to avoid being bit and to avoid causing harm to the patient.Additionally, if the airway gets obstructed during resuscitation, the patient should immediately be turned onto their side to clear it. After clearing the airway, it is crucial to review responsiveness and regular breathing. In the video, the nurse only listens if the breath sounds are audible but misses to confirm any obstruction in the mouth (ChristianCare, 2011). The guideline also recommends that the airway be opened using the head tilt-chin maneuver (Bray et al., 2021). Furthermore, the team initiated
CPR without confirming the presence or absence of pulsation. The carotid pulse should be monitored at the beginning and during resuscitation to assess whether or not CPR should be performed.Another essential aspect of CPR is the insertion of a large-bore intravenous cannula. In emergencies such as cardiac arrest, health workers need to act quickly in obtaining intravenous access as it enhances adequate infusion of fluids at a faster rate. Additionally, it guarantees that emergency drugs, such as epinephrine, are supplied promptly to achieve peak blood concentration (Feinstein et al., 2017). Epinephrine is an emergency drug given intravenously in the video. The administration of intravenous drugs in the video aligns with ARC guideline (9.2), which needs fluid and drug administration via intravenous access, which is critical in reviving the
patient (Sethi & Chalwin, 2018). Fluid infusion is vital for patients who have suffered a cardiac attack to facilitate tissue perfusion.The ability to breathe normally is critical to preserving life. Resuscitation is required for a patient who gasps or not breathing regularly and is unresponsive. According to the ARC guideline five, the medical team looks, listens, and feels while checking the patient’s breathing pattern (McLure et al., 2021). They should look for movements in the abdominal area or lower chest. They should also listen for air escaping from the mouth or nose and feel for movements in the nose and mouth (McLure et al., 2021). In the video, the nurse actively listens for the presence or absence of air moving through the nose and mouth in accordance with
the ARC recommendations.During resuscitation, breaths can be given to the patient by various methods depending on the setting or skills of the caregiver. These include mouth-to-mouth rescue breaths, mouth-to-nose, mouth-to-stoma, mouth-to-mask, and bag valve masks (BVM) (Panchal et al., 2020). In the video, breaths are given via a bag valve mask. Ventilation with a bag valve mask is another means of giving rescue breathing. An inflating bag is connected to a non-rebreather valve and a face mask to form a bag valve mask gadget. A clear airway (Guideline 4), an appropriate mask seal, and an acceptable breathing method are required for effective bag valve mask ventilation (Olasveengen et al., 2021). Continuous ventilation with the bag valve or poor technique may cause air to enter the stomach, raising the
chance of gastric contents reflux (Newell et al., 2018). When BVM ventilation is utilized, it is advised that two experienced rescuers supply a ventilator for the unconscious person: one to handle the airway, seal, and mask, while the other to handle the bag valve mask.The video illustrates the use of a BVM in giving rescue breaths where the nurse adopts the jaw thrust maneuver using one hand while the other hand gives oxygen via the bag. However, the bag valve mask should have been connected to a reservoir or oxygen mask, enhancing a high oxygen concentration in the body. The use of BVM has the potential to save lives and is far less invasive than intubation.Compression of the chest is one of the most critical procedures in resuscitation
that must be performed properly. The video illustrates the compressions being given at a rate of 30 compressions followed by two rescue breaths after every two minutes. This is consistent with the ACR guideline six, which confirms a pace of 30 chest compression before giving two rescue breaths. According to some research, compression rates of fewer than 30 are linked to a reduced survival probability (Maconochie et al., 2020). Each compression should result in a downward displacement of the lower sternum, roughly making up a third of the chest’s entire depth. In adults, this corresponds to an increase of greater than 5cm in height (Garcia-Jorda et al., 2019). There is little doubt that insufficient compression depth is related to poor outcomes. It is worth noting that the chest
compressions performed in the video were shallow and did not exceed 5cm, as advised by ACR.The Compression speed and depth vary significantly amongst rescuers, and the compressions may be more severe during the first few minutes of the cardiac attack. Chest compressions were ineffective after one minute in a mannequin trial of CPR, even when caregivers became aware of exhaustion after five minutes. (Cobo-Vázquez et al., 2018). If possible, rescuers should be switched every two minutes while compressions to avoid rescuer fatigue and worsening chest compression performance, particularly depth. The video illustrates that only a single person is involved in chest compressions. According to research, the rescuer’s fatigue during CPR affects the compressions’ efficiency (Cobo-Vázquez et al., 2018). Following the initiation of continuous compressions, the depth of compressions
gradually lowers due to the rescuer’s exhaustion.Finally, the essential role of defibrillation in conjunction with good CPR has been well documented. An automated External Defibrillator (AED) should be utilized only on unconscious individuals who are not breathing regularly (guideline 7). The timing of defibrillation is critical in determining a person’s likelihood of surviving following cardiac arrest. The success of an AED in usage depends on proper knowledge and use of the device. Proper pad placement guarantees that the shock is transmitted through the heart on an axis (Olasveengen et al., 2020). The pads should be arranged anterolateral on the open chest. The first one is placed just below the clavicle on the patient’s right chest, while the second pad is below the armpit on the patient’s left side.
not to contact the patient.When the heart abruptly ceases pumping blood, cardiopulmonary arrest follows, rendering the individual unconscious. Thus, timely cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) and defibrillation may help save a person’s life and minimize any long-term functional disability. The odds of life for a patient who requires resuscitation are dependent on the correct administration of CPR and the medical teams’ prompt joint reaction. Prior to initiating CPR, it is critical to assess the airway, breathing, and circulation, as these factors directly influence the outcome of the CPR.
A Rose for Emily is an excellent example of the Southern Gothic genre. The Southern Gothic is a literal tradition that came into existence in the 20 th century and became popular in European literature. The genre is rooted in mysterious secrets, supernatural events, frightening scenarios, and extreme character duress, which leaves the reader desensitized. The genre focuses on ridiculous and morbid features such as secret passages, draft castles, and laced cobwebs. The Southern Gothic genre explores the antisocial behaviors that confined against the social norms and hinged on the belief that daily life and these social customs were just imaginary. A Rose For Emily creates the theme of mental illness, murders, love-loss that ends up creating a frightening environment for the client, thus suits a Gothic Tale.Firstly,
A Rose for Emily illustrates the Southern Gothic genre through the townsfolks accessorizing Homer’s murder. After Emily’s father died, she isolated herself from society, and her house began to decay to smell awful. The judge sent some township men to clean the place, but instead, they sprinkled lime over the property. The township could have helped Emily and discarded the father’s body, but rather, they worried if she needed help (Sullivan 175). It is clear that the townspeople are fond of Emily and respect her. This aspect can be seen when she purchased the rat poison “So the next day we all said, “She will kill herself”; and we said it would be the best thing.” (Faulkner 6). They were in awe of her, but they harbored feelings
of powerful aggression. The town did not want to associate with her, yet they cared for her, which pushed her to buy the arsenic to kill Homer Barron. Instead of doing the right thing, the town decided to cover the crime. Them turning a blind eye on Homer Barron’s death shows the element of the extreme character duress in the Southern Gothic genre.Secondly, A Rose for Emily contains the theme of lost love, representing Southern Gothic stories. When Emily met Homer, a foreman, marriage was possible. Still, then issues of her social status arose, and it can be seen when the town murmured, “Of course, a Grierson would not think seriously of a Northerner, a day laborer… grief could not cause a real lady to forget noblesse oblige”
(Faulkner 5). Homer’s perspective on his love towards Emily was not accurate, but he spent time with her. However, it was said that Homer was gay and he liked men (Faulkner 6). Emily saw the relationship from a romantic perceptive, while Homer saw it as spiritual. It made Emily terrified of being alone as unrequited love is painful (Liu 198). It led her to purchase wedding items for her and Homer, invite him to dinner, and poison him with arsenic. Hence, A Rose for Emily portrays a romantic love skewed with dysfunctionality as described in the Southern Gothic stories.Similarly, lost love is also portrayed between Emily and her father, just as Southern Gothic themes. Emily’s father controlled her life, making it almost impossible for her to interact with
the town and also forbid her from a romantic relationship “We remembered all the young men her father had driven away” (Faulkner 4). There was a falling out between Emily’s father and the extended family due to property; hence she was only left with her father to teach her on love. He also took the role of protecting as seen in this text, “father a spraddled silhouette in the foreground, his back to her and clutching a horsewhip” (Faulkner 4). Emily leaning on her father’s back portrayed more concern about his physical well-being and protecting her. After he died, Emily was utterly lost as she did not know how to love in a normal way. It explains her behavior of not having any trace of grief and why
she would tell the town that her father was not dead for almost three days. The love of an overprotective father that forbids her to interact is an example of a Southern Gothic story.In addition, Southern Gothic style is portrayed in A Rose for Emily through appropriation and transformation. The narrator transforms Emily’s innocence into a psychologically damaged spinster. At the beginning of the narration, Emily is used as a protagonist. She used to be the perfect young wealthy lady living with her father. Her privileged status causes her to be emotionally and physically isolated; she becomes erratic with characteristic behavior (Huang 205). At first, she denied the death of his father for approximately three days. The town sided with her, claiming “we knew that with nothing left,
she would have to cling to that which had robbed her, as people will.” (Faulkner 4). However, it was difficult for the town to explain how she slept and spent years with the corpse of Homer. Her erotic behavior is also seen when she is asked to pay her taxes by the Board of Abelderm. She gets mad, saying, “I have no taxes in Jefferson” (Faulkner 2). Even after being told that no public agreement excluded her from paying taxes, she continued denying it. Her mental instability is an example of a character in the Southern Gothic story.Furthermore, Faulkner uses Southern Gothic elements throughout the stories. At first, the writer’s description of Emily’s house gives the reader the impression that it contains mysterious secrets (Xiaokang 95). He describes
it as “It was a big, squarish frame house that had once been white, decorated with cupolas and spires and scrolled balconies in the heavily lightsome style of the seventies” (Faulkner 1). Homer’s death took place in the same house, and his corpse was left there to rot. The story’s setting shows it was created in the Southern Gothic period. Emily was the last bloodline of his family that had stayed in that town for generations. The tax collectors went door to door collecting taxes which made him a southern gothic. Such scenes and creating a mysterious atmosphere throughout the story illustrate that A Rose for Emily was a Southern Gothic story.The story illustrates Southern Gothic literature through slavery, racism, and oppressive patriarchal forces. Southern Gothic still idolized
racism and slavery despite its abolition, where black Americans were still viewed as a class of servants. It is first portrayed by Colonel Santos stating that ” the edict that no Negro woman should appear on the streets without an apron-remitted her taxes” (Faulkner 1). He is racist as he favorably removes Emily from the obligation of paying taxes and makes up a story that his father had loaned the town some money. The book’s setting reflected the slavery element based on Tobe’s treatment. The narration describes Tobe as a negro which denotes racism in the Sothern Gothic era. The author supports this when he says, “They were admitted by the old Negro…The Negro led them into the parlor” (Faulkner 1). We see him being released from his
and also forbid her from a romantic relationship. It also contains elements that hint the Gothic nature, such as the house description, Emily’s character, the poison she acquired, and Emily living in a crumbling house alone. From the beginning of the story, it generally creates a frightening environment for the reader, vital to Gothic tales. All these elements make Faulkner’s work a Southern Gothic tale.
The Concept Of ColonialismThe term “colonialism” is used to characterize the system of domination of the developed countries of Europe (since the end of the XV century) and the USA (since the XIX century) (Cooper, 2002). It occupied vast areas of Asia, Africa, Latin America, Australia and Oceania until the early 1960s (Diop & Moschovakis, 2020). Colonialism also took place in Japan (in the 1st half of the XX century) over a number of areas of East Asia and Oceania (Diop & Moschovakis, 2020).The formation of the system of colonialism began in the era of Great Geographical Discoveries. In the XV-XX centuries there were many colonial empires (Diop & Moschovakis, 2020). The British Empire, the German Colonial Empire, the Spanish Colonial Empire, the Dutch Colonial Empire, the Portuguese
Colonial Empire, the French Colonial Empire. Belgium, Denmark, Italy, the USA, Sweden, Japan, etc. had extensive colonial possessions. The system of colonialism of the XV-XIX centuries was characterized by the desire to establish a monopoly in trade with conquered territories (Diop & Moschovakis, 2020). The seizure and plundering of entire countries were often accompanied by the destruction of a significant part of their population. The use of harsh forms of exploitation of the indigenous inhabitants of colonies and slave labor were often involved. Colonial policy during this period was carried out in many cases by specially created large privileged companies, such as East India Companies.From the 2nd half of the XIX century, the exploitation of colonies through unequal trade exchange began to play an important role (Rodney &
Davis, 1972). Colonies were turned into agricultural and raw materials appendages of metropolises with a monocultural direction of agricultural development and into markets for industrial products. At the end of the XIX century, the dependent territories and colonies came under the direct state administration of the metropolises (Cooper, 2002). By 1914, colonies and dependent countries accounted for about 66.8% of the territory and 60% of the world’s population (Diop & Moschovakis, 2020). The national liberation movement in the colonies was brutally suppressed by the metropolises. The struggle between the leading powers for the redistribution of colonies was of no small importance for the beginning of the First World War.Features of ColonialismThe period of colonialism is characterized by some key features: strong states militarily seized undeveloped countries and state
entities. The population of the colonies was exploited by feudal lords and slave owners. The metropolises established a monopoly on trade relations with the colonial territories. In fact, the metropolises used the colonized territories only for their enrichment. They accumulated their own capital, thereby further strengthening their positions, becoming world leaders (Diop & Moschovakis, 2020). The largest colonial empire in the history of mankind was Britain: it had colonies on every continent. Among the most famous of them are the USA, Canada, Australia, India. Many African countries were also dependent on Britain.The center of the colonial empire was the metropolis: domination was expressed either in the form of a dominion, that is, the government was carried out by governor, or in the form of a protectorate. European countries
sought not only to own large territories, but also to spread their culture. The Spaniards forcibly carried out Catholicization and Hispanization of the population, the Dutch carried out apartheid and the imprisonment of Africans in reservations (Diop & Moschovakis, 2020). There was a division of the existence of the colonists and the local population, religious communities were formed separately. The colonial administration actively supported local conflicts, for example, the clash of Hindus and Muslims in India (Rodney & Davis, 1972). Decolonization took place after the Second World War; before it, the uprising in Madagascar and the rebellion in Tunisia lasted six years (Rodney & Davis, 1972).Pursued GoalsThe established colonial regime pursued certain goals: dependent countries were used as markets for the sale of their products by Europeans as
the profit received was higher there. An important factor was the supply of cheap raw materials to the European part of the continent. Due to the exploitation of colonies, the profit of the colonizers increased. This made it possible to increase the wages of their employees; criminal elements were sent to new territories (Rodney & Davis, 1972). The local population could be used for heavy work; in addition to economic interests, the colonies were used as points for the formation of military bases. This was necessary to maintain the international status and strengthen the security of each empire; the colonialism of territories here was very convenient.Key Consequences of ColonialismPositive ConsequencesIndustrial revolutions affected not only the leading powers, but also the colonial entities, which contributed to their economic and
industrial development. A local intelligentsia was formed in the dependent states (Cooper, 2002). Modernization, the growth of culture and economy in the controlled countries took place relatively rapidly. The world economic market was formed and mobilized.Negative ConsequencesThe more territories a country captured, the less competitive it became on the world stage. Expansion led to a slowdown in development. The colonies lost their natural resources, ethnic identity and partially lost their own culture. The indigenous population of the occupied territories was rapidly forcibly destroyed to reduce their numbers (Cooper, 2002). If forced extermination was not carried out, then people died due to the appearance of epidemics provoked by imported diseases. There was a complete lack of political development in the colonies, and the major powers could not allow this.
Due to this fact, such countries are now going through a difficult period of formation of the political structure, accompanied by wars, repression and devastation.The metropolises had stable markets for their products, so they practically did not develop their own production, since there was no such need. A crisis of the structure and culture of traditional society has developed (Rodney & Davis, 1972). A large number of local conflicts have arisen. Empires have not solved a lot of problems in their colonies, which is why wars are still being waged in them. The former metropolises continue to try to participate in the management of the previously fully controlled states. This led to a fierce, including military confrontation between the parties for the right to conduct their own policy.
The emergence of a large number of refugees and the development of terrorism on a global scale.Consequences For MetropolisesThe metropolises lagged behind other countries in military and economic terms due to the lack of incentives for development, their production growth slowed down (Diop & Moschovakis, 2020). The resources and income received from investments in controlled countries were directed only to the development of the center of the empire.Consequences For ColoniesAlmost all kinds of resources, both natural and human, were looted. There was enslavement of society, a significant and sharp deterioration in the standard of living. Groups of the population who disagreed with the policy of the metropolis were physically destroyed. The population was forcibly moved to other territories to extract resources or perform other work (Rodney & Davis,
1972). However, at the same time, cultural, social and economic foundations were laid for further development as independent States. Local industrial facilities were formed, production gradually developed. However, industrialization was very slow, since all resources and finances were directed to the center.The World After ColonialismAs the economy and society developed, the colonial system collapsed. It could not resist the conditions of rapid development. The metropolises did not want to introduce liberal changes, which led to the complete collapse of the existing system. To a greater extent, the consequences turned out to be negative, although there are quite a lot of positive aspects. The most negative consequence of this era for the modern world is the threat to security. When the metropolises abandoned their colonies, the latter were left
Commitment to health theory is a special model designed to determine the stages of development and behavior changes. This theory assumes the development of an internal state, as well as the acceptance of the desire to lead a healthy lifestyle under the conditions that any circumstances may limit a person. Moreover, with the help of this theory, the necessary level is determined, which indicates a particular stage of human health (Kelly, 2014). In addition, this theory assumes that there are no established differences, such as gender, race, and others, in order to build behavior aimed at developing a healthy lifestyle. In her research, Kelly (2008) uses the principles of the Transtheoretical Model of Behavior Change. First of all, this is done in order to demonstrate certain stages of
Being a knowledgeable and experienced professional in one’s professional sphere is, without a doubt, of great importance. For this reason, many students of medical education facilities seek to acquire as much theoretical and practical expertise as possible before graduation. Although such a strategy is by no means wrong, I have recently discovered that the true success in the work of healthcare providers is explained by the doctor’s ability to build relationships with one’s patients. I fully understood the advantage of this simple but often overlooked truth when observing Dr. Wang’s work.Dr. Wang is an experienced professional working in the sphere of eye surgery. Yet, it was surprising for me to discover how easily he/she is able to build close relationships with the patients. After analyzing her/his behavior, I
In turn, I saw that this allowed the professional to deliver better and more accurate treatment. Moreover, seeing the positive outcome that the ability to build a trustful relationship with the patients has on the healthcare provision, I have become determined to develop this quality. In this regard, I hope that my description of Dr. Wang’s practice will also inspire other current and future medical workers to develop their communication skills.
One of the social factors that might impact what groceries are purchased is the lack of healthy food. Addressing Wal-Mart in Forest Part allows me to gather enough information about available products and their prices. For example, one gallon of great value milk is $2.65, one loaf of Sara Lee bread is $2.44, one bag of gala apples is $3.58, and one bag of organic baby carrots is $3.88. Continuing my visit, the prices are as follows: one yogurt container is $1.92, 2-liter of Pepsi Soda is $1.98, one bag of chips is $2.84, and one family-size pack of cookies is $3.98. In Maywood, IL 60153, the population is mostly African Americans (68.6%), but white citizens (18.2%) and Hispanic/Latino (26.9%) also live there (United States Census Bureau, n.d.).
In the history of mankind, the computer has become one of the most important inventions. Hardly anyone can imagine a modern home or office without computers. While some people argue that the computer has provided us with additional conveniences, according to others, the computer has made our life more complex and stressful. I believe that computers, in the first place, have enriched our society with several advantages due to faster communication and easier access to information.The computer provides us with a fast way to communicate. In our time, when modern society is becoming more global, computers play an essential role in communication systems. Previously, communication was limited to means such as mail (Grudin, 2017). If a businessman traveled abroad, the sending of reports and reports, as a rule,
healthcare workers use computers for many essential uses. Computer hardware is widely used in making a diagnosis, conducting examinations and preventive examinations are examples of computer devices and methods of treatment and diagnosis (Farinella & Marco, 2018). Computed tomography and nuclear medical diagnostics provide accurate layered images of internal organ structures (Farinella & Marco, 2018). Ultrasound diagnostics and probing, using the effects of the interaction of incident and reflected ultrasonic waves, opens countless possibilities for obtaining images of internal organs and studying their condition. The diagnostics and treatment methods will be much easier with the help of computer intervention.
In relation to building construction, Code of Practice may be defined as a particular set of standards, procedures, and regulations to which a contractor and developer should adhere to manage potential environmental consequences caused by construction works. For large clients, local authorities, and public bodies, it is applied to new developments and sets out requirements related to the impact of construction. It aims to provide guidance within the framework of legal, administrative, and technical systems for the protection of workers, the environment, and the public and control over major hazard installations. According to the code, by arranging separation between large centers of population, including housing, shops, schools, and hospitals, and major hazard installations and developing appropriate emergency planning, major accidents that may occur at these installations will be
IntroductionThroughout the history of the United States, the country was the primary direction for out-migration from Latin America. Hispanic and Latino migrants from different countries started to come to the U.S. before the beginning of the Gold Rush. In the following centuries, the influx of Hispanic migrants to the country increased significantly. This paper will consider the conditions of Hispanic out-migration to the U.S. and the reasons that caused the migration of the discussed populations. In addition, different views on Hispanic migration and its effect on the country, including the current impact, will be examined.History of Hispanic MigrationThe Gold RushAlthough the Hispanic minority was present on the territory of the United States since the annexation of Florida and Louisiana, the first great migration started after the end of
the U.S.-Mexican War. The end of the war coincided with the discovery of gold in California and led to the first significant influx of Latino migrants to the U.S. (D. Gutiérrez). In addition, the treaty of Guadalupe-Hidalgo signed in 1848 resulted in the territories of California, Arizona, New Mexico, Colorado, and Utah being surrendered by Mexico to the United States (Gregory). Thus, the Hispanic individuals living in these states were naturalized as U.S. citizens, and several thousands of Mexican migrants came to California to work in the gold mines. Overall, most Hispanic migrants to the U.S. in the second half of the 19th century were Mexican.First Half of the 20 th CenturyThe migration from Latin American countries to the United States continued during the 20th century. In the
first half of the century, Mexican comprised the majority of the Hispanic migrants to the country, with a small proportion of immigrants from the Caribbean countries. The influx of migrants can be explained by the acceleration of the agricultural sector in the U.S. and the need for seasonal farmworkers (R. Gutiérrez 3). Although many Latino immigrants were deported during this time, the government invited Mexican laborers to work in the defense industries and the agricultural sector due to the lack of workers caused by the Second World War (Gregory). Thus, the second wave of Hispanic migration was characterized by the need for workers.Second Half of the 20 th CenturyDuring the second half of the 20th century, the Hispanic migration to the U.S. became more diverse. Migrants from Puerto
Rico and Cuba were granted permission to enter the country as the former were considered U.S. citizens, while the latter were granted the status of refugees due to Cuba being a Communist country (Gregory). Migrants from other Latin American countries were scarcer due to fewer quotas for the number of persons allowed in the U.S. granted to them.Reasons for Migration and Migration ConditionsThe reasons for Hispanic migrants to travel to the United States are varied. However, it can be argued that the economic reason was and remains most prominent. The country offered high wages for unskilled labor that compared favorably with the wages offered for the same work in the Latin American and Caribbean countries (Sánchez-Alonso 11). Compared to Mexico, Puerto Rico, Cuba, and other nations, the United
States offered more opportunities for migrants from those countries. In addition, various political events, such as the Mexican Revolution, contributed to many people being displaced and immigrating to a safer country (D. Gutiérrez). Most Hispanic migrants opted to move to the United States for economic reasons.It should be noted that a large percentage of immigrants moved to the U.S. as spouses or children of American citizens. In the first waves of migration, spouses often came to the country together. However, most women worked in the household, with under 20% of Hispanic female migrants obtaining positions outside it, primarily in the domestic and personal service sector (R. Gutiérrez 8). Later, the migration trend changed to male migrants coming to the country first in order to find work and establish
themselves in the United States before their families could join them. Thus, legislation allowed legal spouses, minor children, and parents of adult U.S. citizens to move to the country (R. Gutiérrez 15). Overall, the conditions of Hispanic individuals migrating to the United States changed substantially throughout history.Views on Hispanic Migration to the U.S.The Hispanic migration to the country was a divisive topic, and people with distinct points of view saw the issues differently. During the Gold Rush and the first half of the 20th century, Hispanic migrants were often victimized and discriminated against due to their ethnicity (R. Gutiérrez 22). However, employers considered migrants essential to maximize profit (R. Gutiérrez 22). In 1965, the Hart-Celler Act was established to prevent discrimination and better account for immigrants coming to
the U.S. from different countries, affecting many ethnic minorities (R. Gutiérrez 14). Although the act regulates what persons are allowed to enter and remain in the country, it is often argued that the act normalizes and decriminalizes the anti-Mexican laws that are ignored when there is a need for seasonal workers (R. Gutiérrez 22). In the last two decades, views on immigration did not change substantially, with the Republicans viewing it as a critical threat, while the democrats have a milder view on it (Hammer and Kafura 2). Overall, the view on Hispanic migration remained largely negative since the first arrival of immigrants during the Californian Gold Rush.Effect of Hispanic Migration to the U.S.Effect of Migration throughout the History of the CountryThroughout the history of the United States,
Hispanic migration primarily affected the country’s economy. During the Gold Rush, the Hispanic population comprised primarily Mexican migrants, who were engaged in several economic sectors, including the gold, copper, and coal industries (R. Gutiérrez 5). One of the most significant contributions of the small Hispanic populations was their work on the railroads and irrigation systems in the West of the U.S. (R. Gutiérrez 5). It should be noted that the labor of the Hispanic community was less restricted by government policies and regulations than other migrant groups. At the beginning of the 20th century, authorized and unauthorized Mexican immigrants comprised the majority of seasonal agricultural workers in the southwest of the United States (R. Gutiérrez 8). Furthermore, in the 1940s, due to the mobilization of the American population,
the U.S. government established a guest worker program with Mexico, Puerto Rico, Cuba, and other Latin American countries (D. Gutiérrez; Gregory). Since the onset of the Hispanic influx to the country, migrants have become indispensable in the labor market.The influx of Hispanic migrants and immigrants from other nations also led to the development and establishment of various policies and government agencies. For example, the arrival of vast numbers of Hispanic and Asian individuals into the U.S. through the Mexican border led to the creation of the U.S. Border Patrol in 1924 (R. Gutiérrez 7). In addition, Hispanic migration contributed to a change in the demographic composition of the United States. Overall, the Hispanic migration to the United States substantially affected the country’s development, legislation, and economy.Current and Projected
Effect of MigrationThe Hispanic migration to the United States of America continues to affect the country today. According to Huertas and Kirkegaard, the Hispanic population of the U.S. contributes significantly to the economic growth and development of the nation and is expected to continue this contribution in the coming decades (2). Today, first, second, and third-generation Hispanic migrants achieve better living standards than migrants from other countries and actively engage in the country’s economic life. Huertas and Kirkegaard point out that the Hispanic community has higher levels of opportunity-driven business ventures that support the economy than other U.S. populations. Research shows that the Hispanic population of the United States is among the youngest ethnic minorities (Huertas and Kirkegaard 19). If the non-Hispanic labor force is aging and is
A forecast predicts that by 2048 the Latino community will account for most of the labor input in the country’s economy (Huertas and Kirkegaard 20). Thus, Hispanic migration is expected to play a crucial role in the future of the United States.ConclusionIn summary, the Hispanic migrant community has a long history in the United States. Since the Gold Rush and throughout the 20th century, migrants from Mexico, Puerto Rico, Cuba, and other Latin countries have come to the country. Their reasons for migrating to the country were primarily economic due to better wages being offered in the U.S. compared to their countries of origin. Although the views on Hispanic migration primarily remain negative, this community contributes significantly to the economy of the United States.
In the present day, the preservation of Confederate statues provokes multiple discussions. According to the official political agenda supported by former President Donald Trump, these monuments are the historical symbols of the United States that should be protected. However, more and more evidence supports the public opinion that Confederate statues should be removed as they aim to demonstrate racial disparities and the supremacy of Whites. The main argument of this claim is supported by the fact that the majority of monuments were erected not directly after the Civil War but in the 1900-the 1920s (Best, 2020). During this period, several discriminatory laws against Black people’s social rights were enacted.The construction of Confederate monuments was sponsored by the United Daughters of the Confederacy. In the present day, it was
Conflict management at the workplace is one of the crucial elements related to the organization of work in healthcare facilities. In this regard, McKibben (2017) asserts that conflict is an inevitable part of any human interaction, especially when the collective activity is associated with physical, mental, and ethical complexity found in hospitals. Consequently, if ignored or not handled adequately, the disputes between the colleges at the workplace lead to decreased performance and satisfaction levels of the involved employees (Suifan, Alhyari, & Sweis, 2020). This, in turn, negatively impacts the overall quality of provided patient care. Therefore, it is important to resolve the conflicts as soon as they appear. However, to understand how to manage disputes effectively, one should understand the factors that cause them.In general, all the antecedents
of organizational conflicts may be divided into three groups, namely individual, interpersonal, and organizational. As for the former, Kim et al. (2017) argue that the healthcare professional’s self-esteem, self-focus, emotional intelligence, prevalent responses to conflict, communication styles, and overall worldview determine the frequency and severity of the disputes. In a similar vein, Chang, Chen, and Chen (2017) found that a person’s license level, age, and previous experience of working in other collectives can all affect the behavior during conflict situations. Interpersonal conflicts, on the contrary, are caused by such factors as lack of trust and respect towards a person, power abuse, and ineffective communication (Kim et al., 2017). Finally, organizational conflicts stem from the overall structure and work arrangement. In this respect, such factors as ambiguously defined responsibilities
thus, he often fails to recognize other people’s opinions. Due to that, we usually have to do what he wants, which eventually leads to conflict when I become tired of compromising. Secondly, I have noticed that many conflicts between me and my parents and friends are caused by my inability to control one’s emotions. Finally, once, we had a conflict with my classmates while working on the team project as we failed to discuss the responsibilities of each person before starting.
In many philosophies, some archetypes can be described as the perfect self in terms of the way of living one’s life. In Confucianism, such a man called junzi — a noble person or gentleman — is a common aspiration (Yu-kit 223). The combination of the highest qualities that an ideal human being should possess is an almost unachievable goal, yet the one that is held in high regard by many. This essay will describe the Confucian gentleman and compare this idealistic archetype with Plato’s philosopher-king.This idea that stems from the traditional Chinese culture continues to hold its importance for society. Such a man stands above evil ideas, recognizes them, and counteracts their effects to the best of their abilities (Yu-kit 225). Moreover, the Confucian gentleman helps others to
They both are set to exhibit certain positive moral qualities while addressing negative ones through reason and rationale. He is ultimately humble and stoic and continuously seeks wisdom for the sake of the betterment of society (Mark). Notably, Plato’s archetype is more leaning toward education rather than living life as a role model for others.In conclusion, both roles possess certain qualities that define a noble person following moral qualities, such as kindness, fairness, selflessness, and the striving for harmony. However, Plato’s version of an ideal person is a stoic leader who puts wisdom at the highest value, while the Confucian gentleman is set to uphold moral values first. They are both set to uplift the personal values of other people through kindness and selflessness.
The organizational strategy involves the expansion of healthcare institutions in sub-Saharan Africa. Unlike the typical medical services in the field, the institutions would comprise medical records management employees and other statistical professionals. The need for this expansion into the open offices of sub-Sahara Africa can be explained by its rising business and investment opportunities for the particular area through the past decade (Omilola & Sanogo, 2020). High demand for a group of employees to relocate to the chosen destination can then be noted. Considering the political and economic value of each country, it would be best to initially arrange the expansion to the most developed and largest countries of the area. Therefore, the targeted countries include Kenya, Nigeria, and South Africa. Moreover, additional countries and locations can be
proposed to ensure adequate healthcare development once the business relocation proves successful. The total number of supported relocating employees for all three countries should not exceed thirty per office to allow maximum productivity and financial coverage.Employees with different levels of experience and expertise will receive varying bonuses and pay changes. However, it is important to establish general policies for all relocating workers. In that way, the move must not compromise the employee’s previous health state and lifestyle (Oyelere & Oyelere, 2021). Commissaries, banking, and currency exchange make up an essential part of the adjustment process and must therefore be provided by the company. The location of the offices would then be close to the leading establishments necessary for domestic purposes. Furthermore, the contrasting climate conditions are to be
considered as well, requiring both a medical checkup before the move and setting up urgent-care stations reserved for emergencies. The health of medical professionals and other employees is a particularly principal aspect to plan due to the nature of the business field.The organization should set an assignment length of one year to gain the necessary data while also building the company’s experience. Research has indicated an increasing number of short-term relocations for problem-solving purposes (Pucik et al., 2017). This statistical finding suggested higher productivity and increased work efficiency in the case of one-year assignments. Consequently, families should consider the disadvantages of traveling in favor of the company’s interests. It is possible that some employees would not choose to relocate with their families for a short period for evident
reasons; the move may be inconvenient. Moreover, while a one-year-long assignment is officially recommended, additional work months can be added in specific cases. For instance, in the case of the business goals not being reached or a new project appearing.As previously mentioned, the decision to relocate along with one’s family would be reviewed by the employees themselves and financed accordingly by the organization. Depending on the structure of each family, including the number and ages of any children, particular arrangements would be necessary. Before organizing the details, each worker must fill out a form indicating the essential information on their moving family members (if any), including any children and their current level of education. One optimal option for incoming school children involves international schools, which would provide an
environment of minimal cultural shock and language barriers. One school for all is recommended to ensure an organized arrangement of the employee’s children in the educational field.Similar to the school grouping, housing the employees would have to be based in its compound of apartments. This decision allows for both safety precautions to be considered and a unified method of financial distribution. Since the planned assignment’s length does not exceed a year, the prospect of the employees selling their housing units is unlikely. Therefore, the suggested plan comprises selecting an apartment block in a safe environment near the school and the workplace. While the organization can compensate for the apartment rent, additional charges, such as water and electricity tariffs, are to be covered by the employees accordingly. The apartments
must follow the company guidelines while guaranteeing minimal employee stress due to the relocation. Indeed, the main objectives of the business plan must be achieved to improve the healthcare field of several sub-Saharan African countries. In that way, the company’s global impact will also increase in direct proportion to the efficiency of its employees. While funding the workers’ main traveling and family expenses, a safe and shared environment can be offered. Ultimately, the one-year assignment length ensures the mentioned goals are reached while demonstrating the organization’s beneficial mobility.
Consequentialism is an ethical philosophy that determines whether something is right or wrong based on its repercussions. The consequentialist view of euthanasia and physician-assisted suicide has always had opponents and supporters. While there are scholars and researchers who believe that legalizing a given activity will be a so-called slippery slope, others believe that prohibiting it is a violation of fundamental rights and disregards human autonomy.Support for independence and choice is commonly cited as a major motivation for legalizing physician-assisted suicide and euthanasia. However, Dickinson et al. state that 80% of healthcare workers find the given practice not ethically justifiable (Dickinson et al., 2002). Meanwhile, several publications have argued that this is due to a misunderstanding of autonomy’s ethical importance (Sjöstrand et al., 2011). It has been claimed that
if autonomy is correctly understood as a value, then assisted suicide and euthanasia are both unethical since they damage the patient’s rights.Sjöstran et al. explore the argument of autonomy by delving into the idea of its value. Beginning with the present discussion in end-of-life healthcare, two distinct perspectives of how autonomy is valued were examined. The scholars examined one argument where euthanasia and PAS could be against the best interest of patients and a second argument where euthanasia implies a right to uphold autonomy (Sjöstrand et al., 2011). As a result, Sjöstran et al. determined that neither line of argument can be utilized since not all cases of PAS or euthanasia can be considered acceptable, and the harmful consequences outweigh these arguments.On the contrary, Weinstock perceives harm reduction
without focusing on other views. The concept of harm reduction has grown both horizontally to apply to a wider variety of policy areas and vertically to become part of the official socioeconomic and regulatory debate (Weinstock, 2020). In his work, Weinstock states that deliberate harm reduction effectively accounts for some of the most appealing aspects of harm minimization and offers a credible manner of reasoning for the justificatory principles and limitations of harm reduction (Weinstock, 2020). Weinstock stresses consequentialist concerns to regulate and control the activity rather than descend the pointless route of determining whose view is accurate about the ethical implications of the conduct.On the other hand, the last argument proves that relying solely on consequences can violate people’s rights and freedoms. In Smith’s paper, a slippery
the repercussions of the given practice. On the one hand, the researchers found that the given activity is a slippery slope and should be regulated and prohibited due to its negative impact on society and the pointlessness of ethical implications. On the other hand, others viewed this argument as unnecessary due to a violation of human autonomy and failure to comply with their wills.
IntroductionElectronic services can be used to provide a wide range of remote services, including patient care and education, and monitoring. Telehealth is a revolutionary technology that could reform and enhance the healthcare system by lowering costs, improving quality, and increasing patient satisfaction. During the recent COVID-19 epidemic, which affected both privately insured and Medicare beneficiaries, patients increasingly received healthcare treatments from providers not situated near their doctors. There were restrictions on who may perform and where they could be reimbursed before the pandemic. Due to COVID-19, Congress and the CMS enhanced traditional Medicare’s coverage of telehealth services to make medical treatment more accessible and reduce coronavirus exposure in healthcare settings. Without legislative action, Medicare’s telehealth coverage will revert to its pre-pandemic levels when the public health emergency expires.A
New Contribution-Based Incentive Model (CBI)This paper suggests a new physician compensation model that rewards productivity, quality, and community involvement. The CBI Model combines a secure base salary with configurable core incentives to give physicians more career flexibility. The CBI model basically works towards motivating the physicians based on their outcomes and quality and offers great career autonomy. The model also steers organizational stewardship and the degree of clinical and other related activities in physician fields to another level.A Flexible Formula Aligns Disparate InterestsSalary-based compensation schemes will become increasingly popular in the healthcare industry in the wake of the pandemic as physicians seek a more stable and predictable source of income. A modest yet significant part of total compensation is the goal of this model’s base wage (Kwon &
Kim, 2022). The starting wage of a doctor is indeed higher than that of an entry-level employee. However, physicians can still expect to see a rise in their pay by meeting or exceeding their employers’ vision, strategic direction, and specific goals. A modest base wage is a safety net for physicians, as it reduces the possibility of burnout or other adverse effects of financial strain. The performance will improve if incentive points are allocated openly and transparently.Many conditions have to be met before doctors can participate in the bonus structure, including regular clinical activity and productivity in line with the physician’s base salary (on a fair market value basis). Second is quality thresholds with outcomes set by the organization, and third is agreed-upon community service efforts (Brousselle et
al., 2020). It is possible to influence physician behavior by varying financing for each “Core Incentive” based on the business’s goals, needs, and purposes.Increased Productivity Leads to an Increase in RevenueIn business, productivity and revenue go directly proportionally in different aspects. Revenue generation goes alongside the rate of productivity in most cases. Work relative value units are the units used to gauge physician productivity at the moment (wRVUs) (Mehrotra et al., 2020). Productivity-based incentive compensation can be provided to avoid anti-cooperative behavior and over-utilization (a suitable percentage of base pay, incentives, or compensation benchmarks. It is, therefore, evident that productivity depends directly on incentives given to employees.Quality Measures Give Top Priority to Patient TreatmentCommercial and government payers have developed quality standards to recompense providers for their services. Measures
used to evaluate healthcare practitioners include documented diagnosis and communication with patients, treatment and pain/symptom control, readmissions, and preventative screening. It’s important to note that while these measurements can be used as a starting point for excellent outcomes, they need to be tailored to each patient’s specific needs. With consultation from suitable stakeholders and physician practice executives, businesses are encouraged to develop unique Key Performance Indicators (KPIs).Citizenship Enhances a Modern, Patient-Centric, and Integrated BrandThe third component is patient and brand loyalty and market expansion.Advocate for Patient Satisfaction Metrics; as a result, Ganey, an independent research firm, remains a leading expert in this field. Hospital Consumer Assessment of Healthcare Providers and Systems (HCAHPS), using this method, we suggest awarding points to organizations based on survey results and other satisfaction
criteria. Affirmatively adopting new technology, physicians should be rewarded for researching and using innovative technologies that improve patient care and efficiency. Treatment outside of traditional healthcare facilities will be in high demand post-pandemic, and virtual health services will be critical in meeting these demands (Smith et al., 2020). It is feasible to track and measure telemedicine education, coaching, and application metrics. This element may help digital health and other cutting-edge technology.Office policies and procedures and incentive programs can promote adherence to organizational and clinical standards and procedures. Both the doctor and the firm will benefit when these actions are adopted.Promote an organization’s brand through administrative roles and marketing Leaders in the CBI Model, which involves the compensation of leadership. Participation in quality improvement committees or medical supply formulary
incentives, physicians are encouraged to mobilize participation among their colleagues.ConclusionIn summary, the CBI Model’s alignment models and proposed amendments to the AKS and Stark laws complement and reinforce the model’s timeliness while remaining true to its essential principles. The model is a vital feature when it comes to the motivation of the general service providers. Following the COVID-19 outbreak, healthcare practitioners have been forced to reconsider the value of cradle-to-grave care, a strategy that relies on cutting-edge technology to offer appropriate care at the appropriate time and in a suitable location.
Corporate entrepreneurship is the process by which groups inside an existing corporation build, foster, promote, and administer a new business distinct from the parent organization. However, these new entities emphasize the parent’s holdings, competitive positioning, knowledge, or other capabilities. The new groups may also be an oxymoron while again utilizing the unconventional approach to further economic growth alongside the meticulous planning, framework, and organization that several large firms have developed over time (Demirkan et al., 2019). Instead of reclining on their glories, the world’s wealthiest organizations, such as Amazon as well as Samsung, are progressively undertaking proactive innovation projects to prevent disruption.Amazon Custom is an excellent extension of an existing innovative initiative that has reaped the benefits of both evolutionary and radical tactics. As the name indicates, this
Sociology considers social strata built according to the criteria of race, age, education, and, above all, socioeconomic status. It is precisely the strata by the socioeconomic situation that are most entrenched in modern sociology. Although, in my opinion, studies on the topic of social strata by race and medical care are the most exciting and responsive to the demands of society. Sociology shows the possible causes of the emergence of social phenomena, including inequality. Due to the correlation of certain events or properties that sociologists record in their studies, people can see these reasons.These correlations form the basis for creating charts reflecting statistical and demographic studies. Based on the results obtained, it becomes possible at one time to make sociological forecasts, including those related to public health. Having
complete information about public health and inequality in this area, it is possible in the future to build a unique way of life, taking into account education and prospective job.For example, sociologists find a correlation between the level of education received at a young age and possible illnesses in maturity and old age. I would also note the specifics of education itself in correlation with the characteristics of diseases. People who are educated in programming or cybersecurity will not have the same health problems as those educated in music. Even if these people at the age of 20, during their studies, show the same health indicators and (and) have similar complaints, the gap will be noticeable in the future. At the age of 20, the probability of the
same hands, specifically for the specialists in question, is negligible since the musical education received by a teenager at school quickly deforms the body.People can draw similar parallels with specialties such as archeology and accounting, industrial chemistry, and psychology. In their research, Adler and Ostrove (1999) confirm this: “We find effects of education acquired through young adulthood on health problems that emerge many years later, suggesting that educational attainment is determining later health” (p. 8). By choosing one or a specialty, a person decides what role he will play in society, what means he will have at his disposal, and what diseases he will be more susceptible to.Sociological research also identifies which, for example, forms of cancer are more typical for low socioeconomic strata. Adler and Ostove (1999)
describe it this way: “Research in Canada reveals that the association of SES with survival is strongest for cancers of the head and neck region, uterus and cervix, and bladder. These are cancers in which local symptoms often antedate development of metastatic disease and allow early treatment” (p. 9). People with low social status are less likely to see a doctor, self-medicate more often, and seek advice from their neighbors and friends. They rarely get screened, and sometimes the screenings they can afford financially or live in a tiny town are not of good quality.That is how sociology can draw correlations and parallels and build forecasts. It helps people make smart decisions that affect their entire lives. By analyzing the medical applications of people with high and low
It is clear to modern people, as well as many people who lived in the 1930s, that the Second World War was inevitable. Some believe that the United States of America could prevent the outbreak of the war. However, this could hardly be possible due to several reasons. The American government maintained an isolationist foreign policy in the 1930s. The period was challenging as all countries had to address severe economic issues (Corbett et al., 2021). Americans wanted to concentrate on domestic matters, including a threatening spread of communist ideas (Russett, 2019). It is noteworthy that the USA could hardly interfere and have a considerable impact on European affairs due to the country’s comparatively low economic might. The United States was not a financial leader at that period,
the new war as the regimes that emerged in Europe (the communist USSR, Nazi Germany, and fascist Italy) were likely to start a new military conflict that would inevitably grow into a world war. Therefore, it is possible to assume that the USA could not have prevented the start of the Second World War even if the American government had abandoned its isolationist foreign policy. At that, the country made a tremendous contribution to stopping the war and establishing a new world order.
This paper will provide an analysis of the article “COVID-19: Impact on Nurses and Nursing” by Fauteux (2021). The abstract is supposed to be the opening of the article. It is a way to quickly introduce the reader to the results of the research. In this article, the abstract is a brief overview of the topic that will be discussed. However, it contains no information about the methods of the research or its results. On this basis, such an abstract cannot be called comprehensive.The article’s introduction is already more extensive, offering a general overview of the topic. It provides information that the times of coronavirus pandemic have affected nursing. In addition, the introduction has statistics, which introduce the reader to the subject in a tangible way. From the
interested in the increased risk of nurse burnout due to too much workload. I also learned about the popularization of telemedicine due to the pandemic, which was a revelation to me because the attitude of the patients to their health seems to have drastically changed after the virus outbreak. This article is beneficial in understanding how an entire division of medical practice can change under extreme conditions.
Historically, law enforcement was founded on the need to ensure citizens’ safety, possession, and health and to safeguard the people from civil disorder and crime. As such, Harris (2020) shows that law enforcement’s lawful powers included using force legitimized by the government or arrests through a monopoly on violence. In its primitive system, law enforcement clan members banded together to enforce rules of the group on rogue members. The purpose behind enforcing societal directives, conducting human control, and empowering authoritative enforcement of those rules was to safeguard the people from rogue members.The community believed that any form of violence against any of them was tantamount to an attack on the rest (Harris, 2020). Therefore, to achieve its purpose, early law enforcement employed three fundamental features, no coercion, law
Lawsuit TendenciesCivil lawsuits are constantly evolving and are driving new trends to emerge. For decades, filing criminal charges against police officers for excessive use of force has been extremely rare. Even if the defendants were convicted, the jury did not want to find them guilty. However, nowadays, there is a growing trend in the number of lawsuits against the police, and the percentage of successful settlements is also increasing. There are many lawsuits out of court, which causes anxiety to enforcement officials who are afraid of potential cases. Moreover, is a tendency to protect the rights of citizens and to punish any person who subjects to the deprivation of any rights, secured by the Constitution (The United States Code, 1980). Such individual shall be liable notwithstanding his job,
but the requirements of a declaratory decree shall be considered.Tendencies concerning corrections lawsuits and equality among people have also been modified. Analysis of the case law enables one to conclude that although correctional facilities have broad powers, they have the primary duty to ensure equal conditions for people with disabilities. Under the Americans with Disabilities Act (2010), physical or mental disabilities should not diminish a person’s right to participate in all aspects of society. Therefore, even in justiciability lawsuits, there is a need to provide exceptional facilities and necessary assistance for everyone who requires it.Civil liability issues have a direct impact on the criminal justice system. As a result of tendencies toward equal opportunity and protection of the needy, the specifics of justice are reversing. According to the
Civil Rights Act (1991), everyone must be responsible for the harm he or she has caused and make restitution. Therefore, justice is the central feature and value of the modern criminal justice system. Civil liability issues and their distinctive features guide modifications in the system, and each new trend necessitates a change in approach.Civil Lawsuits TransformationsThe modern world is constantly evolving, and its improvements impact civil litigation in the United States. The U.S. justice system continues to fulfill its primary mission by adjudicating cases on the merits of conflicts or resolving legal disputes through other established methods. While the primary mission of the court system has remained, some features of dispute resolution are different. Civil lawsuits have transformed over time, and these changes directly affect criminal justice professionals.It
is noteworthy that the period between the 1970s and 1980s was a crisis in the U.S. judicial system. It manifested itself in a multiplication of the number of court appeals, the duration of cases, and the parties’ litigation costs (Horner et al., 2018). Therefore, the need to reform the system, which was not coping with many lawsuits, emerges. Most of the transformations concerned civil cases’ subject matter and complexity, but decision terms were prolonged.The extensive caseload was the reason for judges to take up civil cases. The concept of geographic uniformity was no longer actively used, and Congress authorized the judiciary to amend and have exclusive authority over the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure. This reform has led to duplication of cases, increasing costs, and delays. The sweeping
The decline of the 14-15th centuries, also known as the crisis of the late Middle Ages, is a term used in Western historiography to refer to the recession processes that took place in some countries of Western Europe. Western historians, considering the socio-economic processes in some European countries in the 14-15th centuries, paid particular attention to the “crisis phenomena” in the European economy of these periods (Cole and Symes). They put in the first place the movement of prices, population, “desolation” of lands, and others as determining factors of recession (Cole and Symes). Although the Middle Ages were once seen as a time of ignorance and social oppression, it is now understood as a dynamic period during which the idea of Europe as a separate cultural unit appeared.Since
the 20s of the 14th century, the economic downturn in the history of Europe has begun. The population was declining, while cultivated lands were mainly abandoned. Cities were falling into decline, agricultural and industrial products were reducing, technological progress was suspended, the development of trade, primarily foreign exchange, was slowing down, prices were falling. Additionally, the period is characterized mainly by overcoming feudal fragmentation and the formation of centralized states in France and England. Using the financial resources of the cities, the kings could constantly maintain a mercenary army to fight rebellious feudal lords. The appearance of firearms at the beginning of the XIV century reduced the importance of chivalry. Castles could not withstand artillery, and the appearance of hand-held firearms made heavy knight armor meaningless.After the period
of rapid population growth, Europe faced the depression phase. It has been traditionally believed that the late Middle Ages is vividly characterized by demographic decline. There were three significant factors for the recession: plague epidemic, famine, and numerous wars. In addition, the weather conditions were also to blame since winters became harsh at the end of the 13th century. The soil was inappropriate for planting crops which took a toll on the nutrition of European residents. At the time of the Great Famine, thousands of people died daily from lack of food, parents sold and ate their children, cannibalism was widespread. Hence, the population struggled to survive and did not focus on materialistic goals.The other reason for the decline was the plague which quickly spread around Europe and
killed millions of people. It is believed that the epidemic has penetrated almost every corner of the continent, killing from 30 to 50 percent of the population (Cole and Symes). The mass fled from the cities gripped by the disease gave rise to anarchy, panic, and mob rule. For fear of getting sick, anyone who aroused even the slightest suspicion was dragged to the infirmary by force. The suicide epidemic, which intensified along with the spread of infection, forced the authorities to adopt special laws that threatened those who took their own lives to put their corpses to the public eye. Together with the sick, healthy people often got into the infirmary, who was found in the same house with the ill or dead, which forced people to
hide the sick and secretly bury the corpses. Therefore, the contemporaries again had the only goal – survival.Ultimately, the revolts created severe conditions for the Europeans in the late Middle Ages. The pressure on the poor caused peasants to rebel against the nobles. Being a peasant was viewed as something pejorative, which opposed wealth and status. While the aristocracy was accustomed to a luxurious lifestyle, the poor considered their fraud. Hence, these two classes were fighting against each other with increased violence. However, the nobles beat those from lower stratification since they had more power. In addition, the War of Roses, Hundred Years’ War, Polish-Teutonic Wars, and some others have greatly devastated the European territory leading to political, economic, and social dissonance. Consequently, the population was trying to
make ends meet to survive.For all its versatility, spirituality and culture of the Middle Ages were built around one vector. Religion permeated all spheres of life in medieval society and changed their perception of crisis (Gaddy 72). The Church continued to eradicate heresy to a large extent, repressing religious sects and urging priests to punish unorthodox followers (Gaddy). Meanwhile, the peasantry practiced pagan customs and began mixing them with Catholic ones. The Church has become the center of social contradictions, weakening the political influence of the Papacy in the 14th century. It further led to the development of independent centralized states.The religious assumptions have also given rise to the progress of art and sciences, initiated by the development of universities and the spread of scholarship. The revived interest
in ancient literature led to the Italian Proto-Renaissance (Cole and Symes). Antiquities, including books, have been accumulating in Europe since the Crusades (Cole and Symes). The invention of printing also contributed to the spread of knowledge. Previously rare and costly books gradually became publicly available, preparing the European reformation.The first Italian humanist, Francesco Petrarch, revived man’s science – humanities. Humanists believed that eternal truths were hidden under cover of the poetic fiction of ancient literature. They rejected the totality of academic knowledge with its ontological problems and brought to the fore ethics, the science of the formation of human personality based on a thoughtful reading of Roman authors with their ideal of human dignity. The defining feature of Italian humanism was the possession of classical instead of medieval
The church was gaining more power causing individuals to convert and making them serve for the sake of God (Gaddy 114). It also helped shape the concept of chivalry and contributed to the rise of women’s status in society (Luther 359). Consequently, the population was trying to find peace resorting to religion during the decline.In conclusion, the crisis of the Middle Ages caused devastating consequences on Europe; however, it gave rise to cultural formation. The recession was primarily driven by the plague, famine, and conflicts making contemporaries suffer and fight for life. Therefore, their only goal was survival and trying to find reconciliation in religion. The religious assumptions of that time have significantly impacted the development of culture and education.
The phenomenon of slavery is one of the most devastating factors that affected the lives of people of African descent throughout the years. However, it is essential to address the origins of racism and slavery in order to create a comprehensive understanding of these concepts. In the chapter “The Origin of Negro Slavery”, Williams explains that although currently slavery is deeply connected to the exploitation of African Americans, initially, populations of various races and ethnicities were occupied as enslaved people (Williams 7). Considering that individuals of all races were involved in slavery in the New World, racism emerged as a consequence of forced labor and was not originally connected to the targeted discrimination of African Americans.In the history of slavery, the first population compelled to undergo the severe
result, racism and racial discrimination emerged, but the initial origin for substituting other enslaved people with African Americans remained economic, not racial.To conclude, the connection between slavery and racism lies in the fact that racial predispositions towards African Americans were caused by the overwhelming use of enslaved African Americans. As such, slavery did not emerge as a result of racism; on the contrary, individuals from various races and ethnic communities were involved in the slave trade. Nevertheless, after the economic benefits of using enslaved African Americans were established, negative racial stereotypes began to emerge, leading to the occurrence of racism.
In his graphic novel, Spiegelman uses a literary device known as anthropomorphism to show the difference between races, including Americans, the Germans, and the Jews. This device makes the severe issue seem simpler to understand, and the readers pay more attention to the ideas expressed by the author. In Maus , Spiegelman portrays the horrors of the holocaust and reminds the readers that the holocaust’s victims and survivors also had their own lives and dreams.The first section to be discussed is Chapter 1 – “The Sheik.” In this section, the main character Artie asks his father Vladek to tell him about his life during the war. Instead of describing the horrors Vladek faced during the holocaust, he prefers to tell his son about his happy and careless life
The only way to cope with life’s everyday complexities is by commanding your mind. In that, whatever you are doing, feel about a situation, or whichever action you want to undertake, all are determined by the quality of your thinking. Critical thinking helps one gain control over their life, deal with life’s challenging situations, and make a rational decisions for the matter. Therefore, before acting on any decision made, it is important to think critically about the situation at hand and evaluate the best solution to apply. Thus, this paper will apply the critical thinking steps in my personal experience describing what I will do at various stages to combat the problem and make a decision. Before arriving at the last carefully thought decision, I will follow up
on each of the stages of critical thinking to arrive at a sound decision. According to Medeiros et. (2019), the steps of critical thinking are; identifying the problem, detaching from emotional involvement, and determining solution criteria. They also include gathering and evaluating information, considering personal values and beliefs, and choosing and evaluating the solution.On identifying the problem, I will look at the niche that exists in my family. Many times I overreact when a small dispute or rather a disagreement arises and therefore, I do not relate well with my mother since such an episode occurred ten years ago. I am sure she cannot stand me either though I have reformed and would like to go to my childhood home someday. On the same note, having separated from
my children’s mother, the children were affected by the separation and are not doing well in school. Therefore, after a careful evaluation, I decided to move into my childhood home after my mother passed on and transferred my children to another school.After a series of counseling sessions, I have conceded that healthy control of my emotions is vital. This is because it enables me to engage more effectively in critical thinking before jumping to vague conclusions or overreacting. On the same note detaching from negative emotional dispositions will enable me to build a better relationship with my family as they have always considered me problematic and hard-headed. The criteria I will employ to determine solutions is outlining positive solutions that will guide me in discerning whether the decision
school. With all that transpired between me and my mother and her being on the death bed, I accept her imminent death and the solution that stands out is moving back to my childhood home. However, the anticipated outcome of the solution is to create a way to reflect on my past while reevaluating the decisions I made back then and starting afresh, and therefore, this decision will give me closure. The children will have a clean start and hence improve academically and the proximity will enable easier follow-up.
The Poem of The Righteous Sufferer is a Mesopotamian poem about the unjust suffering of a suffering man. The Poem is small, consisting of nearly 500 lines, and written in Akkadian. It is relevant to its time of creation because, by the 13th century B.C., people had already begun to understand the need for moral foundations. The story is told in the first person, who honors his gods, but suffers from many illnesses. The Poem is a kind of reflection of alienation from the divine, drawing attention to injustice and the problem of morality. In this regard, the Poem of the Righteous Sufferer allows the historical community to explore ancient Mesopotamia’s cultural values and social attitudes.First and foremost, the Poem is seen as one of the beginnings of
the biblical narratives of the Old Testament. The fall of man and his repentance are essential elements of the Poem. In terms of its cultural contribution, it is crucial to understand the Babylonians’ view of the divine. Awareness becomes the companion of the Poem’s protagonist, and he realizes that not all the good that happens to him is good to God. His lamentations are seen as a prayer complaint against the injustice accompanying a man, no matter how much wealth he possesses.The source demonstrates how people’s consciousness and doubts about life’s value have been transformed. This cultural heritage shows that a righteous lifestyle does not mean good treatment from the deities. Possible injustice significantly affects society, so the protagonist laments, “the persecutor persecutes me day in and day
out,” without understanding what he deserves it for (Poem of the righteous sufferer). Even the healing of his troubles does not make him happy, and he thinks that “the grave is near, the shroud is ready for me” because he has already once confronted God’s will (Poem of the righteous sufferer). The culture of the time forced the man to hope for the best, even though the deities did not explain their decisions.The social problems in the Poem are revealed as a set of attitudes followed by the protagonist. He considers “the joy of the heart” the days of honoring God, glorifying the king, and striving for the state’s prosperity (Poem of the righteous sufferer). In his figure, one can discern the image of the man of antiquity,
and rewards do not accompany good people (Poem of the righteous sufferer). Thus, the overall social mood of the Poem is restless and unknown: the reasons why the gods send misfortune to society remain unspecified and unknown.The Poem of the Righteous Sufferer thus reveals the issues of culture and society that existed in the middle of the second decade B.C. The cultural precepts of society gradually changed from complete trust in deities to an understanding of the necessity of morality. Human consciousness at that time was transformed, and hope for the best was the companion. Society’s social attitudes are expressed through the main character’s rituals: honoring God and praising the king. The hope for the best was only fulfilled through the execution of these rituals.
Culture is the entirety of social norms, behaviors, and customs which distinguish a certain society from the rest of the world. Naturally, some cultures have common features, thus forming cultural clusters. At the same time, leadership is a personality trait that transcends national boundaries. This does not imply that all people with power behave in the same manner, as leaders are also influenced by cultural norms.Behavior differences are evident in the way people in different clusters view time. Middle Eastern cultures are frequently juxtaposed to Western ones, particularly American. Beehner writes that while “most Middle Eastern nations are past oriented” and uphold traditions, “many Americans believe they can control the future and embrace change for the sole purpose of changing” (72). Barak Obama is an example of a
al. 23). This implies that the more traditional a culture is, the more successful leaders are likely to be in transformational endeavors.Altogether, there is a definite influence of culture on the conduct of leaders. Therefore, the definition of culture should include the importance of its effect on leadership behaviors. Not only does culture distinguish a certain social group, but it also underscores the likelihood of changes driven by people who have authority. After all, these people are the ones who make the most important decisions in society.
The concept of culture is a fundamental phenomenon influencing all spheres of human life. It influences people’s actions, methods, and approaches toward specific tasks and daily interactions. Thus, Roseberry determines culture as a socially constructed and socially constitutive part of the context where all activities take place. It means that all other fundamental institutions and phenomena, such as power, economy, and history, comprise the culture. At the same time, being the way of life, it influences the mentioned spheres and preconditions for the emergence of critical processes in these domains. In other words, peculiarities of culture influence decision-making in political processes and historical events which took place at different stages of society’s evolution. Furthermore, the approaches to business in particular, and economy in general, depend on the values
The process of forming states is not characterized by ease. It involves many different processes, including cultural strategies of strength. It is believed that this aspect in the form of actions of social agents is of particular importance. This is because they occupy a central place in such processes as the formation of alliances and the establishment of dominance relations. Understanding this concept can give a better understanding of the creation of Western Europe, China, the Islamic World, and India.First, it is necessary to understand what a social strategy of power is and what significance it has. Thus, it is defined as a particular area of practice where the creators of mass media have cultural influences and act as agents of social change. Thus, these sources form and
consider the culture strategy of power. Therefore, the author makes an attempt to distance from the generally accepted European principles and views on the role of social anthropology and factors in Chapter 3. In addition to many other political and economic factors, social influence is of significant importance. Social agents form public opinion and contribute to the formation of opinions. In this way, there is a relationship in the creation of the states of Europe, China, the Islamic World, and India and the social strategies of the authorities.
Assessments of CurriculumAssessment of curriculum is a natural and critical element of instruction, as it allows to evaluate the progress that has been in education. It can be defined as a method that is used to understand the current knowledge that a student possesses (Dikli, 2003). Assessment has always been a contentious issue due to various factors of objectivity, diversity of learning styles, and bureaucratic issues, among others. However, traditional assessments are generally tests and tools that are commonly utilized in academic settings. Some of the most popular tests are multiple-choice tests, true/false, short-answer, and sometimes even essays. These fall under what is commonly known as standardized testing, aimed at objectively test whether a student possesses knowledge of the curriculum. With the same or similar tests given to
everyone in a population (classroom, grade, school), the traditional assessments of curriculum provide an insight at the broad effectiveness of instructional strategies. There are certain benefits to traditional assessments, they are easy to construct, implement, and score (often via machines), they are scored objectively providing an appearance of ‘fairness’ and they are most often associated with assessment in public perception (Dikli, 2003). This approach to evaluation is influenced by the scientific, modernist approach, with clearly stated objectives and precise indicators that students have achieved the intended objectives (Ornstein & Hunkins, 2018).Alternative assessments are also known as performance tests or authentic assesmsnts. They are commonly aimed at determining what a student can do rather what they know, measuring proficiency rather than blunt knowledge, known as action strategies (Petre, 2017).
Some examples of this can include projects, portfolios, and other methods that allow the student individually or as a group to demonstrate their skills, and most often their knowledge at the same time. The benefits of alternative assessments include being able to assess valuable skills, realistic and applicable skill application, can always be aligned with learning outcomes, and typically provide more individual approaches to assessing students (BYU Center for Teaching and Learning, n.d.). The humanistic, post-modernist approach is best applicable to alternative assessments, as these seek to identify whether the student has been enabled to understand and improve self-concepts. To this perception, achievements matter less, but rather the search for knowledge and truth, as the student gains the skills necessary to study the world, engage, analyze, and communicate
In recent years, the computer technology field has evolved and developed gradually and has contributed to the success of many individuals and organizations. Technology has faced numerous challenges as it continues to grow tremendously. The main challenge is cyber-attack, where criminals have been targeting companies and individuals, creating great harm to the vulnerable users of technology. Some of the incidences that support this claim are information theft, malware, ransomware attack, and hacking of servers which has become a significant challenge to technology users in all parts of the world. Cyber security experts have rescued technology users by detecting and protecting computer systems from these attacks.In 2017 shock befell the globe after learning how helpless the world was after the famous wanna-cry ransomware cyber-attack targeted the Microsoft Windows operating
system by encrypting the data of its users. The encrypted ransomware demanded some payments in the form of Bitcoins to decrypt the data, an incident that prompted my venture into a career in technology to help in countering these vices affecting technology. Since all technology forms and systems are vulnerable to cyber-attack and it is not always easy to identify the weak link where the cyber attackers would penetrate, relevant studies such as cyber security would solve this problem.Computer programming sessions were among the best topics back in my school, which drove my desire for this technology path. Being a recent graduate of Electronic Engineering Technology and Computer Engineering Technology from Norfolk State University, getting a chance to pursue a master’s degree in cyber security at Norfolk State
University to develop more skills would be highly appreciated. Cyber security is vital to the current growing digital world because it offers confidentiality and security of personal information and financial credentials.Crucial topics include big data analytics, cloud computing, digital forensics, cyber-psychology, wireless security, and socio-cyber-security. Cyber security knowledge enables an individual to engage in actual-world practice using recent digital security technologies. Top organizations are willing to spend a lot on cyber security experts who can protect their data from being vulnerable, taking a course in cyber security very relevant and marketable with good job security.The masters in cyber security will enhance the best ways to secure networks and information systems by intrusion detection and detection of ordinary events. One will also learn the defensive cyber security technologies and
IntroductionDarren Aronofsky is an independent American filmmaker who explores various psychological themes in his movies. While all of them are different, they may be classified as psychological thrillers, with surrealism and magical realism elements. In his various films, Aronofsky shows themes of deep psychology: love, hate, addictions, genius, relationships between humans. Mysticism and surrealism are often present: paranormal phenomena and fantastical events interrupt the main realistic narrative to highlight the central ideas of each film. Archetypical plots, such as biblical legends, are used by Aronofsky as a basis for films mother! and Noah . He often changes the original plot to make it more suitable for modern realities. In other films, such as Requiem for a Dream , and Black Swan , he explores the various pathological states
of human consciousness.Films AnalysisMother!The film’s main heroes are the couple living an ordinary and happy life. They both have self-describing names: a man is called Him, and a woman’s name is Mother. Him is a poet, and at the beginning of the film, he is struggling with writing block; while he is doing that, the house where he lives looks like burned remains. He places the crystal object on a pedestal, and then the remnants transform into a full and beautiful home. This fantastic scene symbolizes the power of creation, and one may already see the allegory to the creation of the world by God, and the name Him may as well be an allegory for God. Mother is his wife and muse, inspiring Him to write poems,
which are usually commercially successful: he has many fans. Then, a stranger appears in Him’s house, who presents himself as Man; he pretends to be in search of a bed, but it turns out that he is the admirer of Him’s literature (Given 117). Him is generous, and he agrees that Man may stay in his house and obtain help.Soon, he and Mother notice that Man has a deadly wound and will probably die shortly. Before that, there are several scenes of the beating heart; their meaning will be revealed at the film’s end. After some time, Man’s wife arrives, whose name is Woman, and they both stay at the Him’s house. One may see that their names symbolize manhood and womanhood in general and are allegories of
biblical legend about Adam and Eve, the first people on Earth. Mother is dissatisfied by their presence and is visibly annoyed while preparing food for them (Given 117). Him, however, argues that they have the right to obtain help, as they are in a hard situation. Soon, two sons of Man and Women arrive, quarreling about their father’s will; Mother becomes even more displeased. Sons’ argument becomes brutal, and in the end, one of them kills the other.In the second part of the film, which starts the next morning after their intercourse, Mother understands that she is pregnant, and Him is inspired by that. He writes much more actively, and his poems have an enormous commercial success (Given 118). Their life with Mother becomes happy and fruitful; however,
when they organize a lunch, the mob of savage Him’s fans appears. The film ends tragically: while covering him by adulation, the mob behaves themselves as beasts and smashes Him’s house. He does not know how to stop this and is seemingly passive and disoriented (Given 118). When pregnant Mother tries to stop them, they rape and maul her, and she eventually retreats to the basement. Then, she burns out the house, leaving the burning remnants seen at the beginning of the film.mother! has many hidden meanings, connected with symbolic representations used widely throughout the film. Names of characters are chosen carefully, and scenes are designed to show the dramatism of the situation. An example is the close-up scene of bleeding Mother, which is repeated at the beginning
and at the end of the film (Given 120). Aronofsky implied a strong environmentalist message in the film: the rape and killing of Mother by the crowd symbolize the terrible and unstoppable consumption of Earth resources by people; Mother refers to Mother Nature (Given 120). When she is brutally mauled at the film’s end, it is a bright metaphor to the unconscious mob of humans who maul the Earth ecosphere similarly (Given 119). Him symbolizes the God who creates the Earth and Nature again and again: at the end of the film, he asks Mother for her love. When she consents, he takes her heart and creates a new crystal object. It reveals the sense of the beating heart, shown at the beginning of the film: it is
the heart of Mother Nature, beating to support life.NoahThe biblical plot also inspires this film, but it interprets the legend more literally, unlike the previous one. While events in mother! take place in modern reality, being only an allusion to the biblical events, Noah resembles the actual ancient times of the legendary Great Deluge. Muffled lights are used to show the visions of Noah, the main hero, about the coming Deluge, at the beginning of the film (Skorin-Kapov 121). Scenes are edited to show the blunt colors and mists, emphasizing that those are the visions in Noah’s head, not the reality; then, he consults with his grandfather about his visions. After that, Noah starts to build his ark, where he, his family, and animals will survive the Deluge.
Tubal-Cain, a vice young king who previously killed Noah’s father, tries to seize the ark, but Watchers stop him. They are stone angels sent by God on Earth to defend people. It is one of the film’s fantastic elements, designed by Aronofsky by using motion design (Skorin-Kapov 124). After the retreat, Tubal-Cain starts finding people and weapons to attack the ark again.Along with that, Noah travels to the closest settlements trying to find couples for Ham and Japeth, while Shem already has a girlfriend, Ila, rescued by Noah after the massacre. However, they see that people are extremely cruel and shameless; they threaten Noah, and he retreats with his family to their home. Noah is shown reflecting in various scenes, and this plotline is the main for the
film. Meanwhile, they continue to build the ark, and Noah starts to be utterly disappointed by humanity. He thinks that God wants to wipe out humanity completely, without any recovery, and that only plant and animal life are good to live.The film’s main idea is the fragile line between good and evil, nature and humanity, and reflections about the actuality of such a line. Noah, initially, tends to separate good and evil strictly and without any compromise (Skorin-Kapov 122). He condemns people, being sure that they are impure and sinister, and he is happy that the Great Deluge will wipe them out. Noah is vegetarian, as he thinks that animals are pure and innocent: only humans make them brutal and evil. He is even ready to sacrifice his
granddaughters, born by Ila, to stop the line of human reproduction. However, he stops when seeing that they all sleep peacefully, full of love and not hate. Eventually, he transforms, and his last will to his descendants is to multiply and live well.Requiem for a DreamThis film is not focused on divine and biblical plots; it shows ordinary people who suffered from drug addiction and all the hardships connected with it. Main heroes want only to live their lives happily and realize their dreams but cannot do that; they all become drug addicts, ending up with that in different ways. One of the main characters, Sara, spends her time watching TV while her son Harry is taking heroin along with his girlfriend Marion and friend Tyrone. The name
of this film is connected with the broken dreams caused by drug addiction. Aronofsky uses scenes with close-ups and split screens to show the feeling of despair and hopelessness, typical for this extremely dark film (Skorin-Kapov 22). Various characters described there are all connected by a similar problem. They all want to realize their dreams: Sara wants to look good, Harry and Marion wish to open the cloth shop, and Tyrone to break free from the ghetto he is living in. They try to substitute their problems by taking heroin and methamphetamines; however, drugs only bring them to the bitter end when their dreams are shattered completely.Black SwanThis film is the story of Nina Sayers, a dancer with good prospects, and is focused on her inner experience. In
the ballet company where she works, there are two roles: White Swan and Black Swan, and both of them symbolize two aspects of female sexuality. While White Swan is focused on purity and innocence, Black Swan refers to dark sensuality and the power of seduction. Nina wants to take both roles, but she fails to perform the Black Swan, focused on seduction and dark sensuality. (Skorin-Kapov 95). Her mother, Erica, is overprotective and greatly influences all aspects of Nina’s life; thus, she is oversensitive and insecure, usually unable to organize her life as she wants. Then, she meets Lily, another ballerina who comes to dance in the ballet company, and two women quickly become rivals. As the film continues, Nina starts to experience hallucinations, seeing images of Lily
as her “dark” alter-ego: much less technical but sensual and daring (Skorin-Kapov 95). It motivates her to dance better and better but worsens her psychical health.This film shows the tension between “light” and “dark” aspects of the human soul, which is extremely hard to overcome. While both are interconnected, they are usually divided within a single consciousness. The roles of Black and White Swans are metaphors for such a division, and Nina’s desire to play them both is her willingness to overcome it. Eventually, she plays both roles successfully, and even Lily admits her talent. However, she ends up bleeding, and the film ends on this, leaving the viewer unsure whether she will remain alive after this successful performance. This ending scene is used by Aronofsky to emphasize
the hardships underwent by Nina in trying to overcome her inner division.DiscussionAronofsky’s films show the extreme aspects of human nature, placing characters in challenging conditions where they are forced to show their true nature. Such positions create dramatic episodes, very bright and full of emotions experienced by characters. He uses cinematographic techniques to create a feeling of constant tension: one who watches his film is always unsure what will be next due to the thrilling and emotional atmosphere. The color range is usually limited: instead of using colors variety, different hues of one-two color are used throughout the film. Combined with slow scenes of characters’ reflections, they create a feeling of something monumental and important.In addition to that brightness, his films are full of philosophical reflections and archetypical
Modification of personal computers required the development of more complex hardware and software. For example, buses, which are the communication channels between different internal components and peripheral devices, have become more advanced. Such three types of buses as address, control, and data are known (Farret et al., 2017). The latter is utilized for data exchange between the Central Processing Unit (CPU) and peripherals (Farret et al., 2017). The significance of the address bus is to assist the CPU in locating specific information in the memory, while the control bus regulates data processing. Data buses are represented as a multiple of two and currently include five types: 4, 8, 16, 32, and 64 (Farret et al., 2017). These numbers indicate the bits of data that can be delivered simultaneously,
Data collection used to determine how to improve the conditions within a specific setting is very important. In the community health care setting, the use of real-life experience with patients and supervision of a preceptor, as the case manager, will apply. The data from treating the members of this community is to apply to assess the needs of the health sector. This will include; assessing the current information using the patient data in the emergency room and applying the data to improve the health sectors. One chief function of caregivers is to help prevent disease, and intervention methods should be focused on prevention and not treatment. This paper describes how a practicum agency can use assessment data to improve health conditions.The need assessment data includes data on the
record of diseases report, preparedness of the health facility, and measures of prevention by the community. This data should help identify the most common illness, improve the readiness within the health facility, and increase disease prevention in the community. However, patients’ needs vary from each other. A good example is a patient who comes to the emergency room with asthma and expects their condition to be maintained and provided with drugs that will help stabilize (Stefaniak et al., 2018). This differs from a patient with malaria who will be treated and taught prevention measures after that. Individual patient assessment desires differ from the community’s wants. The data on health needs include patient illness with specific diseases and the patients’ progress.To prioritize the health needs of patients, it may
be essential to have information on patients’ behavior, environment, and genetic predisposition. A good example is the asthma patient; the environmental conditions of the patient should be taken into consideration to avoid subsequent attacks (Iriarte‐Roteta et al., 2020). Another example is a diabetic patient would benefit from data on lifestyle as their condition can easily be managed through their lifestyle.The data from the practicum can establish a support program, increase screening facilities, and offer health education to the patients. The support program helps patients suffering from addiction, makes them feel accepted by the community, and helps them overcome their habits. Screening facilities allow for early detection and management of disease at a primary or early secondary stage (Gillies & Schabath, 2020). Moreover, health education benefits the entire community
in the prevention is better than cure campaign. Health workers should prioritize the prevention of disease rather than treatment.The practicum agency used the available data to improve the outcome of their programs. First, they collaborated with some health providers to form an online platform where patients could interact with health providers and ask them questions about their health status (Yang et al., 2019). This helped in the prevention of disease and reducing the crowding in consultation. Moreover, it also reduced the consultation fee for those who could not meet the expenses since the consultation on this platform was free. Second, the agency focused on promoting health equity by championing for provision of health services for the less fortunate. This was done by agitating for the construction of more
health facilities and the employment of more health providers to ensure that all people can access health services despite their financial status.During the practicum, I engaged in community-based activities such as taking care of the homeless, treating the uninsured members of the community, and educating members of the community on the importance of preventive health. During this period, I handled a patient who was having rheumatoid arthritis. At first, I thought the patient had rheumatic fever, but I understood how the clinical signs and diagnosis differed through preceptor consultation. The patient with rheumatic arthritis is just one example of how the practicum enabled me to improve critical thinking, clinical judgment, and clinical reasoning. Clinical judgment, critical thinking, and clinical reasoning are essential aspects for all health officers, from
I visited the Museum on Saturday 12 February this year from 9 am to 5 pm. The Holocaust Museum Houston serves as a monument and strives to teach people about the consequences of cruelty and prejudice, as its motto and tagline “Stop Hate.” “Let’s begin here”(Holocaust Museum Houston, 2022). The museum emphasizes the perils of intolerance, bigotry, and apathy by drawing on the lessons of the Holocaust and other massive genocides. There is fear that if these sins are ever allowed to get out of hand, another mass massacre on a scale much bigger than the Holocaust could occur. “Bearing Witness: A Community Remembers,” a permanent display at the museum, conveys the Holocaust story directly from the source. The exhibition revolves around the lives and encounters of Holocaust
survivors who eventually settled in the Houston Area. This museum allows tourists to study the life of the Jews in a chronology like fashion, starting with Pre-War Europe and concluding at the end of World Conflict. Upon entering the show, the management offered an image of Jewish art and society in pre-war Europe.The museum is very young, and it features several intriguing and unusual displays. The museum’s interactive aspect was one of my favorites since it offered depictions of natural occurrences. The museum included several additional sections where one could learn unique parts of African American culture, and a traditional African American dance was among the new things known. I spent much time in the Sports exhibit, which featured mementos from players like Gabby Douglas, Serena Williams, and
others and the music exhibit demonstrated the uniqueness of this museum.The Holocaust Museum was the most significant stop, and I learned a lot. It gave everyone present a genuine representation of what transpired during the era of the Holocaust. Apart from being the most sensitive of the visitors to this museum, I gained more information and expertise. Through the drawings, I learned about how the two Holocaust survivors, among other things. It was incredible to hear from those who had been there and witnessed it firsthand. The Holocaust was a period of prejudice against people of many races and beliefs and a terrible time for tens of thousands of people.It felt like back to the 1944 era during World War II while walking around the room looking at
all the numerous relics and documents related to the Holocaust. During the way to the rail car, the sorrow of the casualties of this horrible period hit me hard. There was a confined and uneasy atmosphere in the car, with only eight individuals onboard. An instruction stand indicated that the management would put 50 people in there for travels that would last days at a time.The Holocaust Museum was informative, but I hoped to see more stuff. The highlight for me is a full-size train car, which gives you an impression of the dread victims experienced on their journey to a much worse destination. I spent most of the time in the museum reading literature on the walls; that is why I was disappointed. I would expect museums
to fill the more tactile element of things in an era where you can obtain information on almost anything with your phone. A tiny model of a detention camp, for example, would help one understand the scale of the organization and how well-planned it was. They did not just walk into a park and begin doing bad things; there was still a lot of preparation involved, which shows these people’s nefarious schemes. Reading about Holocaust is not the same as experiencing it. I realize it is a sensitive issue, and I am delighted the museum exists in its current form, but there may be potential for improvement.After the Holocaust, learning about medicine provided a strong foundation for professional identity construction. As a result, this history can ideally “equip”
the general public about the hazards of hatred and bigotry in society. The Holocaust is predominantly central since the entire world watched it develop. Today, individuals commemorate the Holocaust to teach themselves that there is a need and space to do better as global citizens. When students study the Holocaust, confrontations with difficult questions of morality that often do not have clear answers face them. Education about the Holocaust encourages people to consider how they should behave in society. While Holocaust provides vital historical lessons for the present and future, it also puts individual rights and social justice issues at the forefront.
Data science is the discipline that studies the life cycle of digital data from appearance to use in other fields of knowledge. It involves researching and analyzing substantial amounts of information and is focused primarily on obtaining practical results. The definition suggested by Os Keyes presumes that this science is the reduction of humanity to something that can be counted. This perspective is engaging in a way that Keyes’s perspective opposes the standard definition of data science. Perhaps, her expression implies that everything in this world could be measured since the discipline is concerned with countable objects and quantitative analysis. There is also an assumption that data science systems want to devour everything possible, including a human’s life, and quantify it. Finally, when it comes to the decision-making
accustomed to giving the right answers when necessary and at the same time being afraid to say something that will not be automatically approved.On the other hand, data science is vital in areas where mistakes should be avoided. For example, in healthcare, workers use different electronic systems that assist them in choosing the proper treatment and its dosage. Medication errors occur due to human factors mainly, for instance, when professionals forget to check the expiration date of a drug. Meanwhile, the system will suggest which pharmaceutical is better for the patient and ensure it is not expired.
It was genuinely surprising to read Gerai’s account about the Dayak community, as it seems to represent an almost utopian view on sex and gender. Unlike Western perspectives that seek to distinguish the two genders, and raise one up at the expense of the other in some ways, the Dayak recognize the differences but see it as a benefit. Reading the account, it almost seemed as the culture promotes the empowerement of both genders based on the characteristics which define them (i.e., male strength, female persistence). These positives are then brought together to contribute to the wellbeing of society as well as personal relationships in a nearly egalitarian perspectives.It is difficult to believe, although greatly comforting to know that there are cultures as this. Unfortunately, most industrialized societies
have the culture of severe gender clashes, and the characteristics of the gender are associated with negative aspects, such as Gerai notes, male strength is connected to aggression. I think it is correct to note that it is a matter of values, the values that are taught by society are the ones that people would exhibit. Western society gives value to hypermasculinity and aggression as definitions of males, exemplified via the genitalia and abusive actions such as sexual domination, assault or rape – therefore, the culture forms around this, being far removed from the egalitarianism and harmony of the Dayak.As shocking as that perspective may be, I agree that it reflects accurately the social element that has been created conservatively around rape for centuries. As mentioned earlier, rape
With thrombosis of the lower extremities’ veins, blood clots or blood clots form cavities, which interfere with the normal movement of blood. Over time, they can clog the venous lumen and even come off, ending in the heart, lungs, and other organs (Dalen, 2016). Unfortunately, it is often impossible to timely determine the initial symptoms of thrombosis of the leg vessels. However, if the skin changes color and swelling occurs where the blood clot is located, these are signs of vascular disease.When thrombosis progresses, its symptoms appear: acute pain and heaviness in the patient’s legs. These symptoms are provoked by the venous congestion below the site of thrombosis. The main causes of the disease’s development are blood clotting and damage to the vein wall (Thachil & Bagot, 2018).
of blood clots. With the most severe outcome, surgery will be required. Undoubtedly, this is the last thing to do since it is always important to use all the other methods before making it. It may also be dangerous in the age of the considered patient. Thus, it is vital to use other methods and try to avoid any harmful consequences. Not only this will help cure thrombosis, but also save patient’s life.
A Western scholarship has distorted the long history of African culture for centuries, and many of its basic principles have been viewed through the lens of colonization. As a result, the ideas and tenets of African philosophy have been appropriated and changed in value from the inherent parts of people’s nature into commodities. In their works, p’Bitek and Marimba discuss such concepts as culture, spirituality, and philosophy of African nations and how Western ideology has reshaped their presentation without fully understanding their meaning. The commodification of African culture and the imposition of European views on the distinction between culture and philosophy, religion and spirituality have disrupted African people’s ability to self-identify.The ideas by scholars show that African culture does not distinguish itself from philosophy or drive a line
In a narrow sense, the “zero-sum story” is a belief that there is a competition between racial groups, and any progress for one group is a threat to the resources and position of another (McGhee). This story is the mainstream paradigm for conservative media and has been told in different forms for years. The negative impacts of the “zero-sum” paradigm on the United States are massive and diverse. This mindset created additional economic, political, and social costs for all citizens of the United States. One of the prominent examples demonstrated by McGhee is the history of public swimming pools in cities across the US. At the beginning of the 20th century, there were massive public swimming pools in many US cities, yet at that time “public” mostly meant
Chronic pain is still considered to be an extreme issue among at least 8% of the residents of progressive countries. The introduction of the study describes the apparent link between pain and demoralization. Chronic pain is always accompanied by negative emotional experiences and blocks a person’s ability to receive joy and satisfaction from life. The research investigates the development of depression and anxiety among patients receiving pharmaceutical opioids and medical marijuana (MM) as severe painkillers. It compares the efficacy of prescriptions and examines the possibility of post-treatment depression.There is currently a severe lack of information about the effects of opiates. They manage pain successfully, but the past few decades indicated the growing concern regarding opiate abuse in forms of overdose and addiction. A more manageable and safer alternative
might be medical marijuana. However, the legal status and novelty of this drug do not allow finding a large number of studies on its effectiveness. Specifically, it concerns the emotional condition of patients experiencing chronic pain. This research paper aims to analyze levels of depression and anxiety among people receiving therapy by comparing the effects of pharmaceutical opioids and MM.The study was conducted in the form of collection and analysis of statistical data. Participants were recruited for six months at two major pain relief centers in Israel. The researchers used The Depression Module of the Patient Health Questionnaire and the Generalized Anxiety Disorder Scale to interview participants, evaluate their answers, and conduct the study. To specifically evaluate and compare the probabilities of depression or anxiety among the diverse
groups, the study used multiple logistic regression analysis and chose medical marijuana as the control group.This type of study is the most revealing and inclusive, as it contains direct responses from a large number of participants. All tools in the form of questionnaires and scales have already been used and proved their efficacy for collecting analytical data. It helps to systematize and classify distinct kinds of information for subsequent uncomplicated services. Thus, researchers can compare the effects of medications on patients of diverse age groups, backgrounds, physical conditions, emotional states, and so on.The analysis of any human reaction has a high potential of subjectiveness and bias, especially regarding people in severe pain and unstable emotional condition. Perhaps some patients tend to exaggerate their depressive state or vice versa,
de-emphasize serious difficulties. Because the survey responses were thoroughly anonymous, the researchers were unable to carefully analyze each patient’s reaction and compare it to the actual states of condition. More accurate answers could be obtained by professional psychologists via personal communication and behavioral analysis. However, this method of research is way more resource-intensive and energy-consuming.Participants were recruited for six months at two major pain relief centers in Israel. All patients experienced chronic pain for at least 3 months. The study included 890 participants, of which 474 (59%) were treated solely with opioids, 329 (41%) were treated with MM, and 77 (8.6%) acquired both (Feingold et al., 2017). The remaining ten participants who did not receive pharmaceutical opioids and medical marijuana were withdrawn from the analysis in the research.
Therefore, it is not possible to comprehensively compare patients taking medications with those who do not.The study conducted a correlation type of research with variable measures. It evaluated the interdependence of various factors that affected the physical and emotional condition of patients experiencing chronic pain. For example, the survey showed that the ratio of female patients was remarkably higher in the opiates group compared to the MM group. In turn, people on opiates were more likely to report major depressive disorders.The questionnaires used different variable measures to collect information. For example, it included comprehensive socio-demographic data: gender, age, country, type of residence (urban/rural), years of education, and employment status. Patients were also asked about their medical history over the years and the current presence of any severe diseases
IntroductionDescartes’ philosophy is called dualistic, which implies the equality of the material and the ideal but allows the existence of these two phenomena separately from each other. In one of his main theses devoted to the study of the interaction between the mind and body, the philosopher, while comparing bodily and spiritual substances, speaks of their opposition (Thibaut, 2018). Descartes deals with the question of what is true in the content of the mind, in other words, in representations: ideas, affects, and judgments. He speaks of the complete difference between the mind and body, which implies that the body is divisible and the mind is not because the activity of the latter cannot be explained by mechanical principles (Dika, 2020). In his explanations, Descartes offers an adequate solution
to the mind-body problem. The argument that the connection of the body and mind is an empirical fact given to a person in everyday experience is logical, and their difference is directly determined in the act of philosophical reflection.The Problem and SolutionTo solve the mind-body problem, Descartes sorts out the content of consciousness in order for clarity and distinctness. In the mind of a thinking subject, in addition to the idea of ​​oneself, there are ideas about inanimate bodies, other living beings, people, and God. According to Dika (2020), the conception of oneself is clear and distinct and, therefore, true. Ideas about other living beings can be formed from available experience. Descartes guarantees the truth of the original principle as clear and distinct knowledge by the existence of
God, who has put the natural light of reason into humans (Dika, 2020). Self-consciousness in Descartes is not closed on itself but is open to God, acting as a source of the objective significance of human thinking.This proof, which can be called epistemological, is decisive for the entire system of the philosopher. As Urban (2018) argues, according to Descartes, the mind is a thinking thing, unextended, indivisible, capable of knowing the truth and striving for it, and also endowed with absolute free will. The body, conversely, is an extended and non-thinking thing; moreover, it acts automatically (Urban, 2018). Thus, Descartes believes that the human is indeed separate from the body and can exist independently of it. Theoretically, there can be no connection between these two substances, but in
actual experience, a person is their inseparable unity.Cogito is Descartes’ first reliable judgment and, at the same time, the first object directly given to the mind – a thinking substance. It is open to people directly, while the existence of the other substance, material, is given indirectly (Urban, 2018). Descartes views a substance as a thing that needs nothing but itself to exist. Analyzing this position provides the idea that only God can be called a substance. Among created things, the philosopher conventionally calls substances only those that need divine assistance for their existence. The thinking substance as an attribute is unextended and, therefore, indivisible. The substance of the body has an extension in length, width, and depth; thus, it is divisible into parts, has a figure, movement,
and a certain arrangement of parts. Only these qualities are really inherent in bodily substance, and all the rest, including color, taste, smell, warmth, and others, Descartes calls secondary. Such features owe their existence to the impact of primary qualities on the body.Ideas inherent in the thinking substance from the very beginning and not acquired through experience are innate. These include the idea of ​​God as an all-perfect being, the ideas of numbers and figures, as well as some general concepts, or axioms (Macbeth, 2017). These eternal truths are the embodiment of the natural light of the mind. Thus, Descartes draws a clear distinction between the concepts of mind and body and argues for clear differences between their functions, which is one of the main premises of his
theory of transcendental idealism. The concept of substantial or Cartesian dualism proposed by him formed the basis of the philosopher’s works, who proved his ideas empirically.Criticism Against Cartesian Substance Dualism and Descartes’ ResponsesDespite his rationale for dualism in the theory of body and mind, Descartes faced objections from some other philosophers who refuted his concept. For instance, as cited in Dong (2020), Thomas Hobbes argued that the nature of the identity between thought and thinking did not allow applying a similar interpretation algorithm to other phenomena or states. According to him, Descartes identifies the subject and its abilities, and only a material subject is capable of thinking since thinking itself cannot think because this is an endless contradiction (Dong, 2020). To this, Descartes replies that he understands thinking
precisely as a substance and not as an action, but this substance is spiritual and by no means material (Bardin, 2019).After all, as Dong (2020) remarks, a substance is not learned directly but only through its accident, and if two substances have different accidents, they should be separated. A spiritual substance has such accidents as cognition, desire, fantasy, and some others, united under the name of thinking, while material substance has magnitude, form, and movement, united under the name of the extension.This is how Descartes responds to Hobbes’ objection: if the attributes of two substances are absolutely different, it is impossible to mix these substances in thought. Otherwise, a person goes against the rule of clarity and distinctness in thinking. Such an understanding of the thinking substance provides
a place for freedom; as cited in Dong (2019), people comprehend their mind independently of the body, which means that consciousness and body are different. In addition, people comprehend their will like the ability of the soul to act and think freely, which means that the will is really free. Moreover, only the soul as a finite substance can have free will since freedom is where there is a choice, and a choice is where there is something else outside the subject.One of the most pointed arguments against Descartes’ theory was made by Gilbert Ryle. He challenged the dualistic concept of the body and mind, arguing that it was based on a category error (Nnaemeka & Chukwunenye, 2018). In addition, as cited in Christofidou (2018), in Ryle’s view,
concept of the mind and body offers empirical justifications that are revealed through philosophical reflection. Involving the divine principle as one of the main incentives explaining the motives for specific actions corresponds to the ideas of Descartes’ contemporaries about the spirituality of any behavioral motives. The idea of ​​ Cartesian dualism, which became the basis of Descartes’ theory, received its recognition due to clear justifications regarding thinking and its participation in human development.
Diabetes of type 1 usually develops due to autoimmune destruction of pancreatic beta cells in genetically predisposed individuals. The damage to beta cells occurs at a subclinical level for months or years in the form of insulitis. Patients with insulin deficiency cannot process glucose in peripheral muscle and fat tissues. This stimulates the secretion of antagonistic hormones such as glucagon, adrenaline, cortisol, and growth hormone (Lee et al., 2019). These antagonistic hormones, particularly glucagon, promote gluconeogenesis, glycogenolysis, and ketogenesis in the liver. Consequently, patients experience hyperglycemia and an anionic metabolic acidosis gap. Type 2 diabetes is the most frequently encountered pathology of the endocrine system organs. The core mechanism of disease development is insulin resistance (Lee et al., 2019). It is a decrease in the biological response of
It is suitable to confound hypoglycemia in patients over 18 years of age. In addition, Zynquista is an oral medication intended to be combined with insulin (Sinclair et al., 2019). Besides, individuals with type 2 diabetes may require insulin if their diet plan, weight loss, exercise, and anti-diabetic medications are not achieving their target blood glucose levels. In that case, Insulin Degludec may also be appropriate; the oral drug is Metformin.
The healthcare industry typically draws sufficient attention to patients’ education, especially when it comes to representatives of minority groups. That is why the article by McCurley et al. (2017) offers valuable information. The researchers demonstrate that Hispanic individuals deal with improved diabetes prevention when they participate in individual and group face-to-face sessions (McCurley et al., 2017). I believe that there is an apparent reason why such positive outcomes are achieved. It seems that face-to-face interventions are effective because patients have an opportunity to ask questions if they require explanations. Simultaneously, such educational sessions demonstrate that a patient is not unique with such a health issue. As a result, such interventions can improve people’s morale, which, in turn, will lead to increased motivation to take preventive measures and protect
Brand name: Glumetza. Initially, it is administered at 500mg daily with meals and later adjusted to 1000mg, 500mg XR, or 1000mg XR. It acts by suppressing gluconeogenesis in the liver and reducing glucose absorption in the small intestines, reducing insulin resistance. Common side effects: bloating, lactic acidosis, nausea, gastrointestinal upset, loss of weight, and deficiency of vitamin B12. Furthermore, the initiation of metformin is associated with the development of hemolytic anemia (Miller & Fortun, 2018). It should be cautiously administered in pregnant and alcoholic patients. In conditions such as renal insufficiency, there is reduced medication clearance, thus leading to toxicity.To reduce side effects related to the gastrointestinal system during the first treatment, metformin should be taken with meals. Once treatment has been initiated with metformin, it should not
be discontinued unless the patient develops contraindication (Miller & Fortun, 2018). For individuals with renal failure, myocardial infarction, diabetic ketoacidosis, and heart failure, metformin should not be initiated or stopped if the patient develops these conditions while undergoing treatment.Metformin should not be administered to patients with glomerular filtration rates (GFR) of thirty or below. Patients with a glomerular filtration rate of forty-five or more can safely use metformin (Miller & Fortun, 2018). Therefore, patients with GFR lower than forty-five on this medication should be closely monitored. Additionally, the patients’ prescriber should assess the risk and the merits of the continued drug therapy for patients with GFR lower than forty-five. It is essential to monitor the kidney function of the patients. It is considered first-line therapy in addition to
lifestyle modification. Upon initiation of insulin therapy, metformin should also be started for metabolic benefits.Classified into:  * Basal: agents in this group are neutral protamine Hagedorn (NPH) with an onset of 2-4 hours and act for ten to about sixteen hours. It reaches its peak at 4-10 hours. It causes an increased risk of nocturnal hypoglycemia (Gupta, 2022). Another group is glargine, detemir, and degludec, which have an onset of one to four and act up to twenty-four hours. They have a reduced risk of nocturnal hypoglycemia as compared to NPH. Basal insulin acts by suppressing the production of glucose in the liver. Basal prandial: includes Regular U 500. Its onset is at half an hour, reaching its peak after two to three hours. It should be
and lispro. Prandial insulins act rapidly. They have a reduced risk of postprandial hypoglycemia as compared to regular insulin. Human insulin can either be short-acting, intermediate-acting, or pre-mixed. Short-acting insulin includes human R and Novolin R (Gupta, 2022). They have an onset of thirty to one hour and reach their peak at two to four hours. The intermediate-acting acts for 12-16 hours and begins from one to three hours. Examples are Humulin N and Novolin N. The pre-mixed insulin has a varying peak but begins acting from 30 minutes to one hour.
The creation of a web-based system to store the university’s information on students and their transcripts presents certain risks that need to be addressed in the feasibility report. Using the standard risk evaluation process, it is possible to differentiate the risks into two large groups. These are risks to the continuation and completion of the project and risks to the end product’s performance after the project has been completed.The risks to the continuation and completion of the project are as follows:  * Unforeseen delays and time expenditures. It is possible that the project’s implementation will be more complex than anticipated, requiring more time;  * Individuals participating in the project might become sick and slow down production;  * The available hardware and software may malfunction.The risks
with personal student data;  * The product would be economically unfeasible to run;  * The product would not perform adequately to the university’s requirements.Time-related problems could be identified by comparing the progress made with the timeline developed before starting the project. Functionality and requirements risks can be discovered by matching the product against its requirements for it, as well as through testing during specific project milestones. Potential time constraints and personnel/hardware breakages can be accounted for by allocating more time to the project than initially estimated to allow for replacements to be made. Countering the risks associated with site performance would be more difficult and largely have a reactionary nature, should some of them not be discovered and remedied during the product testing phase.
In order to prevent heart disease, cancer, and diabetes, people are required to adhere to strict routines, including in terms of diet. According to American Heart Association, people wishing to prevent heart disease must consume food which does not contain added sugars and high volumes of sodium, as well as saturated and trans fats (“Staple Ingredients”). Additionally, individuals need to eat whole grains, vegetables including frozen and canned ones, nuts, seeds, and meat such as chicken and lean beef. American Cancer Society’s dietary recommendations to people include the need to consume more fruits and vegetables, especially dark green and orange ones, since they have a considerable cancer prevention capacity (“American Cancer Society”).Moreover, the society advises people to eat foods high in fiber, such as legumes and whole grains,
One is watching the news or reading the latest article from Forbes, and you see the terms “business” and “economics” used interchangeably; one may wonder about the differences. Business and economics are similar in that they are supplements to each other, both dealing with the process of creating products and services and selling them to generate output. These are fields of study that are closely related and include a range of shared subtopics, such as enterprises, marketing, finance, manufacturing, and banking. Both are social sciences that focus on financial measurement and analysis, focusing on variables that impact the market and also focus on short- and long-term projections, as well as the inner workings of various industries. Finally, both business and economics tend to focus on various problems facing
major difference is in concepts, economics deals with theories and broad elements of the economy, such as supply and demand, interest rate, and international trade. While these undoubtedly impact business, both individual entities and as a field of study, business focuses on the process of wealth creation within the context of the economy and typically applies practical theories.Economics focuses on and attempts to maximize the welfare of society, while business is centered on its shareholders. Both face different issues, with economics encompassing poverty, unemployment, taxation, and federal expenditure, while business focuses on product positioning and differentiation, marketing, growth or lack thereof of profitability, and individual or industry performance (Gitman et al.). While business and economics share many commonalities, their conceptual and practical differences make them distinct sciences.
The difference between a doctor approaching a patient in comparison with nursing practice on the same subject can be an excellent topic due to the highlighted features that are emphasized when parallel. Thus, medical practice using one’s physiological status while nursing also implementing psychological responses is an effective way in making the difference between the two clear while operating based on PICOT. The points to be included are the difference in the research approach. Since medical practice is more objective due to the fact that it relies on specific outcomes and facts, the research is quantitative. On the other hand, the PICOT question included in the nursing practice implies mixed research that considers both opinions and data.Topic presents the differentiation between nursing and medical practice in terms of
A digital engagement policy determines how the organization intends to position itself online. The regulation also covers the company’s brand qualities and its vision and mission objectives. It also directs how employees can communicate digitally, both internally and externally, with suppliers and clients (Brown, 2019). In addition, the above guidelines also target social media interaction practices that may affect the business, either negatively or positively.Our organization has a digital engagement policy that it utilizes to protect the reputation of its brand. Moreover, the above strategy has enabled the business to increase employees’ commitment while boosting the levels of their obligation. Hence, workers share more about the organization online, thus, contributing to more sales and profit. Additionally, with the above rules in place, the firm’s private information is secure
since it is not shared online.My professional presence online is aligned with the organization because it entails displaying the company’s products and services and connecting with all stakeholders. My existence online builds a good relationship with clients, friends, and followers, which is advantageous to the business since the company image has improved. This has helped the organization become relevant because it has offered its clients a ‘human face.’I use media platforms to promote my brand by focusing on different social networks. I also create informative and engaging content about the company’s products and ensure all the information is up-to-date and accurate before uploading. It is critical to do regular online marketing while avoiding over-posting not to look desperate. All the updates of accomplishments and newsworthy developments are done
achieved but avoid posting any negative comments made by an individual or a dissatisfied customer because this could cause a destructive online discussion, which may diminish the brand.After completing the course, I plan to change how to respond to any negativity, and I will not ignore any undesirable feedback because it enlightens me about the buyer’s experience. In addition, I will also start to market strategically, for instance, to develop a procedure of targeting my audience depending on the social media network, have schedules for my content, and change the communication methods.
The approach and thought process underlying the thesis is explained in this chapter. This section aims to provide enough information for other researchers conducting studies relating to the digitalization of the management accounting sector. As a result, the scholar begins by describing the research design, which includes a description of the study’s actual procedures. This paper then explores the researcher’s methodology, findings, recommendations and offers limitations and future research.Research DesignThe research design is a broad strategy for addressing the study issues. A well-organized research design ensures that the research methods match the research goals, quality data collection, and appropriate analysis to answer the research questions using reliable sources. Good designs allow researchers to draw valid, trustworthy conclusions. The design connects the conceptual research challenge to relevant and doable
empirical research. The researcher will adopt the experimental research design, which entails posing open-ended questions to get a new understanding of the subject under investigation. The design was chosen based on what was best suited to answer the following research questions: 1. ” How will digitalization change the management accounting profession? “ 2. “What skills will a management accountant need in the future to address future challenges of digitalization? “An experimental design is an excellent strategy for acquiring a new perspective or elucidating your thoughts on a theme. It will further broaden the understanding of the subject, allowing the investigator to understand better why and how things occur. The researcher applies exploratory research to clarify concepts, create priorities, and generate operational definitions. According to the scholar, this field
of research is relatively new after searching for literature on the subject. As a result, few scientists have looked at these topics. There is research on the impact of digitization on accounting businesses. However, there is a scarcity of information about accountants’ perceptions about how digitalization would affect their profession. The researcher looked forward to comprehending how digitalization has impacted the managing accounting sector. The ability to convey and obtain new information about the subject benefits from employing this type of study. It allows the writer to take an open approach to data gathering and analysis.Data CollectionResearchers can use both primary and secondary sources to acquire data. The scholar used primary data in the thesis to obtain material pertinent to the study challenge. Personal interviews played crucial roles
in information collection by the researcher. An interview is an excellent way to get information and ensure the writer acquires more information about the participant’s self-awareness, motivation, and personal views on digitalization. The researcher collected secondary facts from the accounting businesses’ websites to learn how digitalization has affected management accounting.Assortment of businesses and participantsInterviews with five accounting firms provided the basis for the research. The respondents are equally diverse in terms of experience, age, and gender. They have worked anywhere from 9 months to 25 years of experience. All firms were free to select who would be questioned. Interviewing the manager provided an opportunity to examine the company’s entire picture. By interviewing a management accountant, the scholar obtained firsthand information and vision of how digitization has impacted their
profession and their skills to attain organizational goals. Random sampling strategy played a significant role in giving each participant equal chances of selection.Interview methodAs previously noted, the researcher primarily collected data through interviews, which would be an excellent method to gather information about digitalization impacts. An interview is a method of gathering more extensive and comprehensive information about a person’s experience, viewpoint, and views about a subject. Interviews provided accurate and consistent data relevant to the research questions. Interviews comprise semi-structured, organized, and unstructured (in-depth) interviews. The investigator applied semi-structured interviews to focus the conversation in one direction while allowing the subject to express themselves freely and clarify any ambiguities.Interview preparations and guideAn interview guide provided a systematic framework for the interviews. An interview guide lists topics and
questions that the researcher wants the interviewee to respond to. The researcher was not required to follow the rules of the letter when conducting a semi-structured interview; hence the researcher used the guide to help in remembering essential subjects and questions. The interview started with a brief overview of the issue and ourselves, followed by a series of straightforward questions. These methods would help the interviewee get off to a good start, such as, “What is your employment position?” and “How long have you been in the accounting industry?” were some of the first questions we asked regarding their background and education. “What problems and opportunities do you connect with the digitization of the accounting industry?” and “What attributes are needed to take advantage of digitalization?” were two
of the questions posed. These were open-ended questions so that the reply might offer extra information about the subject.Interview CompletionQualitative interviews can be conducted in person, over the phone, via chat, or by email. The researcher considered in-person interviews since they fostered a sense of trust and transparency. This strategy allowed for a smooth dialogue with few interruptions. We were also able to keep an eye on the issue and control it. The researcher utilized a voice recorder during the interview, which all participants agreed to, both writing and oral records. Voice recorders helped the researcher be present throughout the interview to enhance effective communication.Data AnalysisThe researcher used thematic analysis, which entails compiling, dissecting, recombining, analyzing, and closing. The investigator utilized codes to indicate the themes from the
data gathering during a thematic analysis. The scholar further used theme analysis for the thesis since it facilitated a rigorous methodology of depth interview data while also providing a more open route for study. This strategy aided the research, which allowed the writer to identify central themes, study critical themes, and notice new difficulties that arose during data collecting and evaluation that the researcher previously overlooked.Findings: Digitalization of Management Accounting RoleManagement accounting digitalization changes the profession significantly in various ways. For instance, IT solutions, particularly automation, increase resource availability due to a significant reduction in the required capacity for repetitive tasks, enabling management accountants to assist with strategic decisions. New business models, a shift in the focus of management accountants, and real-time performance data and reactions are all
aspects in support of innovative value-adding operations. Overall, organizations can gain a competitive advantage by effectively managing the data and information made available through digitalization (Puhovichova et al. 140). Due to numerous laws, it is challenging to use all of these benefits. Any significant change to be executed in a firm requires a well-thought-out strategy and overall plan. The development of a performance management approach requires open communication and constructive feedback. Change drivers will struggle to implement changes without strong employee participation. A trial-and-error culture must be established in addition to changing the culture. In an environment where less stability is unavoidable and more uncertainty must be managed, disruptive developments add stress.Digitalization plays a significant function in allowing workers to try new things, which is critical in dealing
with environmental changes but challenging because it contradicts another strategic goal that prioritizes safety through defect avoidance. As a result, digitalization in the management accounting industry is critical for keeping personnel up to date on new technologies, such as artificial intelligence and ERP deployments, to eliminate complications and guarantee that work is completed quickly. Before automating anything, it’s essential to figure out which actions and responsibilities are appropriate and then rate them. Another problem brought up is the expensive expense of building sound IT systems. However, good data management is required to get the most out of any technology. One of the most critical problems is that management accountants’ abilities must be updated to utilize digitization fully.Artificial intelligenceLearning ability, often known as machine learning in AI, is a
common requirement. In actuality, the term “artificial intelligence” was coined in 1956, but it has only recently acquired attention due to a few other factors. Big Data is one of them since when AI confronts new scenarios that necessitate decisions, it consults large amounts of high-quality data. The second wave of digitization is Artificial Intelligence. As a result, it emphasizes how new the technology is in management accounting applications. Several academics stress the importance of AI, predicting that it will undoubtedly become a critical component of business in the future. In the future, AI might make precise decision-making recommendations to the management accountant, or systems could make sovereign judgments and design steering measures based on management practices.A well-known Artificial Intelligence software example is IBM Watson Analytics. This tool
could be cooperative in MA, particularly for reporting and risk management processes, where data collection, correlations, visualization, and forecasting are obliging. Artificial neural connections are a powerful technology that replicates human-machine learning in today’s AI. These networks learn from processed data by looking for patterns, adjusting connection strength, and taking into account terrible outcomes to find solutions to previously unforeseen situations. As a result, the foundation for machine learning is artificial neural networks. As a result, as the amount of data being studied rises, it helps apps enhance the quality of their analysis and discoveries since the algorithm can constantly comprehend the magnitude of elements and how they are related. BA models, for example, can be updated and enhanced regularly to achieve the highest level of analytical quality;
DataRobot, BigML, and PredictionIO all provide IT solutions. The storage and processing of data and applications on the cloud are called “cloud computing.”Artificial Intelligence tools help management accounting institutions raise the visibility of organizational plans, a dream of total control in which distance is eliminated, and databases and analytical algorithms know people better than they know themselves. It also increases the number of misleading connections and the necessity to choose from vast amounts of data and alternatives. Furthermore, AI assists management accounting managers in addressing various complicated issues that their companies encounter. Management accounting is one of the most valuable tools accessible to a manager, who may use it to assess opportunities, situate action directions, and develop the corporate strategy. Thus, management accountants add significant value to firms
by identifying and eliminating parts of the issue.AI plays a significant role in management accounting actions, including processing large amounts of data for policymaking, improving speed and timeliness in decision-making; thus, allowing for time and money savings, capability to monitor overarching business practices, enabling planning due to intuitions created by higher data volumes, productivity gains, reducing operating costs because of better data quality, and possible new sources of income as a result of connecting ability of data quality and improving interactions with customers due to the open nature of data. Fundamentally, artificial intelligence (AI) promotes the horizontality of financial organizations, allowing companies to benefit from it at both intra- and inter-organizational levels. The corporation becomes a collection of social networks connecting various stakeholders within and without the enterprise.
Management accounting firms may utilize AI in managing their accounting data; thus, it may be transformed into actionable insights that drive company decisions and help improve every customer engagement and increase operational improvements.AI is more than a support function; it is a crucial component of value generation and a competitive advantage. It helps firms operate better with streamlined business processes, increased efficiency, better operational planning, and the ability to respond swiftly to unforeseen events. AI and the rapid utilization of information and communication technologies have accelerated financial institutions’ Big Data growth and effect. It allows for new management accounting data and forecasts based on existing data. On top of that, AI also assists accountants in creating precise forecasts based on extensive comprehension of the macro environment, permitting them
to identify the fundamentals that may affect a firm’s incomes and more accurate prices. Therefore, AI implementation provides a strategic edge for management accounting firms in the future, essentially putting rivals out of business.Blockchain and data analyticsBlockchain technology, a machine recording system that uses bitcoin in a customer network, is another trend that may alter the demand for accountants. While bitcoin, a virtual currency that keeps track of transactions and enables the construction of new currency systems without the use of a bank, has raised blockchain’s popularity, the technology has progressed significantly. The application of blockchain in management accounting stems from “the promise of a new form of a holistic approach – one that can be updated and confirmed regularly without fear of being changed or damaged.” Accountants
are naturally interested in blockchain since it allows for real-time access to books and records and the establishment of intelligent contracts and recordkeeping. Blockchain has already been adopted by some accounting firms, including the Big Four — EY, PwC, Deloitte, and KPMG. While blockchain data can verify an asset’s ownership, its condition, location, and genuine value must be confirmed.By lowering the expenses of storing and maintaining ledgers and enabling complete transparency into financial assets and history, blockchain can help enhance audits. When combined with other automation technologies such as machine learning, Cryptocurrency will enhance transaction processing accounting, but only for experts. Instead, competent accountants will look into the real-world economic consequences of blockchain records, linking them to economic reality and valuation. A debtor’s existence, for example, can be
validated using blockchain, but the debtor’s recoverable valuation and financial value are still up for argument. The value of a company’s data, for example, could widen the scope of accounting by allowing more aspects to be included that are currently judged complex or untrustworthy to assess.ReportingEach decision should be centered on accurate and relevant information obtained from a credible and secure database. Data scientists and other departments like IT are increasingly challenging controllers’ primary role of building and enhancing such a “single source of truth.” New information procedures may likewise contribute to an additional self-service, decentralized-based broadcasting and decision-making setting, affecting the kind of control and the responsibility of controllers. Conversation bots and additional robotic mechanism automation tools can save time and money for businesses, but they need
to be managed carefully.The Management Accountants’ Exposure to DigitalizationSeveral businesses are still at an early stage of digital transformation. Specific organizations have numerous information about their customers, products, and transactions. As a result, those polled are enthused about the potential of big data. The respondents appear more interested in the subject matter, including the use of modern technologies like AI and RPA (Robotics Process Automation) (RPA). Every company that uses RPA also employs AI; most respondents use ERP systems hosted in the cloud. According to the research, those polled are happy with the cloud solution and feel that the data is safe and secure, and accessible at all times and in all places. Several clients Find ERP fascinating and amusing since they can utilize it on mobile apps
and track the progress on their mobile devices. Cloud-based accounting systems have numerous advantages; traditional systems take longer to implement than cloud-based systems.Businesses are implementing digitization, and most of them are adopting artificial intelligence and robots to ease their work; they are just starting their journey to Robotic process automation (RPA) technology. Automated processes are becoming more commonplace since it is a tool that countless companies have long-term plans. Robots are not the most important technology for companies since they are programmed to execute a limited number of simple, repetitive activities. Appropriate advancements must be in place to automate the repetitious tasks, and the government needs to support and encourage new ideas. Most management accountants are aware that robots are utilized on less than ideal systems to save
money; hence companies only use AI when necessary because accountants have to deal with it in a complicated manner. Companies that have been using AI for a long time are finally seeing results because they realize the advantages and are optimistic about their potential.Challenges of Digitization and OpportunitiesArtificial Intelligence, which may be incorporated into auditing and accounting activities, can reduce the need for human labor considerably. Artificial intelligence can help with more structured, programmed, and repetitive jobs, where getting human intelligence and expertise is not time-wasting. Innovative technologies are not being designed to take the place of human intellect; instead, they are being integrated to aid accountants become restored strategic consultants by offering crucial firm visions. Machine learning and AI will offer accountants more access to real-time data
from more sources. Though AI is in its early phases still, most companies apply it mainly for intelligent document OCR (“Optical Character Recognition”) and funds transfer automation. Software development leads to a knowledge of invoices rather than just matching order numbers and invoice amounts.Businesses may utilize the blockchain to get real-time data from several sources. Most organizations opt for this distribution method to protect sensitive financial data and streamline complex operations. The term “blockchain” should not be used to describe the technology. Blockchain can replace traditional auditing, compliance, and reconciliation chores due to its unwavering security and transparency. Technology advancements open up new avenues for delivering information regularly. Accounting is still based on the evaluation and analysis of financial data regularly, but stakeholders, auditors, and others expect more
detailed and real-time reporting. A transition period and implementation processes will be required to move from an episodic basis of bookkeeping and reportage positioned exclusively on financial information to an additional complete view of accounting reporting. Current jobs will be displaced and disrupted due to implementing and transitioning to a more comprehensive accounting function.Higher performance and greater efficiency can be achieved by accounting experts through the usage of digital systems while reducing waste and increasing competence. Accountants will be looking for new methods to do things when working electronically, developing more complex accounting tools, which will aid in the efficient flow of accounting work. Accountants will have to learn to use new accounting systems and technologies to work digitally, advancing the accounting industry. Digital working allows us to
work from any comfortable and safe location while keeping the COVID-19 scenario in mind. It is more cost-effective to conduct business via digital means because it reduces the need for actual office space and other expenses such as stationery travel. Therefore, accountants can complete clients’ data presentations in a specific time frame and low cost.Technology provides a plethora of options and assists individuals in doing various tasks. The electronic working environment, among other things, will make full use of various technology. The digital world uncovers talented people by allowing them to accomplish tasks from anywhere in the world and give a surprise, high-quality results. Customers would have more faith that their administrative job is automatically done because it is more evidence that their chosen accounting specialists will perform
it. It will also make the expert more accountable, ensuring that the work is precise and reliable. The electronic performance of financial work will aid in the proper record of information, evading the damage of data information in traditional paperwork systems. It will also assure the security of the data by applying many layers of protection. Another advantage of digital platforms in accounting and artificial intelligence is that they provide 100 percent accuracy and automatically detect faults, preventing human error. The various accounting programs give high accuracy and error detection technologies, ensuring that the financial work is relevant.ChallengesAccountants’ tasks and actions include critical intellectual and imagination, thus mechanizing the errands and actions that would be problematic, impacting the accounting occupation’s development. Auditors must be ready for computerization, which
requires specific and new information and assistance. Automation is on the horizon for accountants who perform tedious, repetitive, and standardized tasks. Data mining, experience and understanding systems, and a more comprehensive network of facts are potent tools to manage a firm effectively. Because of automation, there will be a reduction in the need for human data input and an increase in speed, reliability, and correctness through digital technologies like artificial intelligence and cryptocurrency.In the future, bookkeepers and auditors will be supplanted by consultants, counselors, and accountants’ technologists. Because of this, accountants must seize the opportunity presented by technological improvements that make their work more accessible and more efficient. Large firms must spend substantial money digitizing their operations and incorporating new technologies to implement expertise management. Investing decisions, especially
for small shareholders, could be significantly impacted by widespread accounting and auditing automation concerning capital markets. In the modern digital financial accounting and reporting context, a regular balance sheet is provided to readers of the income statement. Lastly, human intellect will always trump machine learning, even though various tasks done by auditors can be mechanized.Future SituationThe accounting industry is undergoing a fast transformation due to advancements in technology. It is becoming increasingly commonplace for the financial department to use technology, machine learning, micro-robots, and various other technologies. Intelligent technology has only recently become available to organizations; therefore, they continue to employ automated accounting methods that are decades old. Computers may assist with accounting tasks, including supplier interaction, audits, account payables, purchasing procurement, cost control, closure procedures, and client
questions. The prospective availability of accounting jobs is influenced by advances in technology (Rijanto et al., 3079). Automated systems take over tedious activities and link data and consumers, doing more analysis. Thus, the tasks and responsibilities of accountants will change shortly due to innovationStudents will learn data analytics, management accounting, complicated financial reporting abilities, and a deeper understanding of modern accounting technologies and advanced analytical procedures with an online master’s degree in accounting. In general, artificial intelligence (AI) will offer attempts for learners to simulate cognitive capacities in computers so that they can solve problems on their own and improve their solutions over time (Hassan et al. 143). “Strong AI” and “weak AI” or “narrow AI” are the two categories of AI that scholars will learn in future.
Strong AI refers to ideas aiming to emulate and imitate human brain functions, whereas narrow AI refers to systems that merely demonstrate intelligent behavior in limited domains. Artificial General Intelligence (AGI) will offer a software that can handle complex problems in a variety of fields while also directing itself. Weak AI is currently more widely used and is included in modern AI software.Artificial intelligence will provide real-time information about financial matters because it can generate brochures using natural linguistic dispensation and computer ideas faster, making daily reportage possible and cheap. The accounting industry is rapidly evolving due to technological advancements. Automation, adaptive intelligence, machine learning, and mini-bots will become integral components of the finance team. Even though intelligent technology is still in its early stages, countless organizations rely
on manual accounting systems. Accounting duties that computers will assist with include supplier engagement, audits, accounts payable, purchasing, procurement, cost optimization, closure procedures, and customer questions. The kinds of accounting jobs that will be accessible in the future will be influenced by intelligent technology. As intelligent technologies take over repetitive jobs, humans conduct more analysis, making them the crucial link between data and people. As a result, technology will impact the duties and expectations of accountants in the future.Blockchain and data analyticsBlockchain technology, a machine recording system that uses bitcoin in a customer network, is another trend that may alter the demand for accountants. While bitcoin, a virtual currency that keeps track of transactions and enables the construction of new currency systems without the use of a bank,
has raised blockchain’s popularity, the technology has progressed significantly. The demand for blockchain in accounting stems from “the promise of a new form of a holistic approach – one that can be updated and confirmed regularly without fear of being changed or damaged.” Accountants are naturally interested in blockchain since it allows for real-time access to books and records and the establishment of intelligent contracts and recordkeeping. Blockchain has already been adopted by some accounting firms, including the Big Four — EY, PwC, Deloitte, and KPMG. While blockchain data can verify an asset’s ownership, its condition, location, and genuine value must be confirmed.By lowering the expenses of storing and maintaining ledgers and enabling complete transparency into financial assets and history, blockchain can help enhance audits. Accounting firms could
use blockchain to obtain visibility into their firms’ available assets and liabilities, allowing them to concentrate on strategy and valuation rather than recordkeeping. When combined with other automation technologies such as machine learning, Cryptocurrency will enhance transaction processing accounting, but only for experts. Instead, competent accountants will look into the real-world economic consequences of blockchain records, linking them to economic reality and valuation. A debtor’s existence, for example, can be validated using blockchain, but the debtor’s recoverable valuation and financial value are still up for argument. The value of a company’s data, for example, could widen the scope of accounting by allowing more aspects to be included that are currently judged complex or untrustworthy to assess.Skills Needed for Management Accountants in The FutureAs big data becomes more complex,
accounting professionals will have to be conversant with information extraction methods to harvest organized and unstructured information. Using data analysis techniques skills, they will need to gather and maintain this knowledge and then evaluate and present stories. Industry analysis, planning, budgeting, operating decision analysis, risk assessment, and invention fall under the “strategic management” umbrella. Automated accounting operations will necessitate that accounting professionals examine the quality and productivity of accounting systems and provide recommendations for improvement. Advanced costing methodologies and procedures will also be required to ensure data security, protect assets and meet the legal and disclosure requirements. Skills in activities and business strategy include knowledge of the company’s industry and understanding operational processes, quality control, and program management.Future Challenges and OpportunitiesLack of specialized IT skills, a lack of
organizational change management, changing consumer expectations, a lack of a clear strategy, financial worries and limits, security concerns, and inadequate data management are all issues that need to be addressed. The achievement of any effective digital transformation depends on a group of dedicated and highly qualified IT professionals. However, it is becoming increasingly hard to unite this team. Increasing investment in new technology is creating a lack of skilled workers. Organizational structures that are antiquated, ineffective, and inflexible may hinder the success of the transformation, which was not clearer when firms struggled to migrate to a distant design explicitly in 2020 quickly. Currently, people have realized what they may do on their laptops and smartphones. As an outcome, customers have never been choosier or demanding. For instance, it
is no more prolonged anxiety to have touchless purchasing options. Therefore, firms are forced to navigate rough waters, sure of their need to move forward but unclear of how. If a business does not have a strategy, its change will not get off the ground.OpportunitiesDigitalization will provide various opportunities, such as the utilization of Artificial intelligence. Future utilization of technology will generate digital management accounting solutions, new digitalization series, new possibilities, and fragmented firms. Most firms will utilize digitalization to attain their goals, attract more clients, or enhance efficiency. AI will help businesses perform standardized responsibilities that contribute to a repetitive effort that can be robotic. Companies would have no problem taking over their clients’ financial activities since technology allowed businesses to become more effective and discerning. The
fragmented business would be competitive and more likely to merge with other industries. According to the survey respondents, competition with other firms in a similar sector and competitors from other fields.Management Accountants’ Role in The FutureAccounting professionals will need to be familiar with data visualization techniques and tools to assist clients and executives in making sense of the data. Accounting specialists use predictive analytics and estimating to deliver tactical advice to consumers or administrations. Because computerization frees up spells spent on additional ordinary tasks, accountants may devote more time honing their analytical skills. The accounting will undoubtedly need to be technically advanced to stay up with the evolving business. As more innovative technologies advance and more institutions migrate their data to cloud-based platforms, accountants must become skilled in
exploiting it to give customers efficient financial statement examination and stay modest.Recommendation and How to Implement These Recommendations in The FutureThe organization’s “economic conscience” should be conscious of its (long-standing) survival and digital strategy. This type of strategy uses digital technologies to give guidance, allowing executives to lead cardinal initiatives, trail their growth, and redeploy energies as wanted. Controllers should handle digital chances and accompanying changes in organizational initiatives and business models, which have numerous ramifications. New KPIs and adjustable steering approaches like the objective and central outcomes system and creative portfolio methodology that integrate traditional and digital commercial representations must be designed and adapted by controllers. Furthermore, typical capital budgeting tactics may be insufficient in the setting of exponential development powered by digital commodities, platform initiatives, and
network thrifts.Organizations should implement digital solutions such as Artificial Intelligence, machine learning, and the implementation of ERP systems. AI improves key processes by enhancing the precision and agility of strategic processes, allowing firms to create sound judgments. Machine learning allows businesses to track consumer trends and processes, which helps them create new goods. Corporations can streamline their business activities and centralize their data using an ERP system, allowing for better reporting and a data-driven, collaborative workplace. In light of systemic shortcomings, integration of human ruling and corporate savvy and extensive data and technology use are essential in the submission procedure. Identifying and effectively executing suitable methodologies and drivers are critical concerns. Total automation will probably be successful only in well-defined and comprehensive operations positions.Data and information made available
Case SummaryCharita Chalmers, a supervisory employee at the Tulon Company in Richmond, was terminated after sending several letters to other employees’ houses, targeting their religious beliefs and life choices. Chalmers, a devoted Christian, saw it her duty to share her Lord’s gospel, and thought it her duty to inform her coworkers of their “improper conduct” in the face of God. By sending the letters to their homes, she disturbed them and their privacy, which eventually led to termination. Although Chalmers claimed to have the best intentions, she lost her religious discrimination claim against the company.Chalmers attempted to inform two coworkers, Mr. LaMantia and Ms. Combs, that they need to rectify and strengthen their relationships with God. In the case of LaMantia, Chalmers claimed that he was being untruthful
to customers about job turnaround times. However, she failed to explicitly mention his shortcoming in the letter that was sent to his household, which led to a miscommunication. Since Mr. LaMantia was working at a different branch that day, his wife opened the letter and assumed that Chalmers was talking about an affair Mr. LaMantia was having. Although during a call later that day Chalmers explained her intentions, the letter still highly disturbed Mrs. LaMantia and put a strain in the relationship with her husband.The letter intended for Ms. Combs described “God of Wrath” as someone who dislikes adultery, implying that the illness Ms. Combs was experiencing was a punishment from God for giving birth out of wedlock. The letter highly distressed Ms. Combs, which she related to
Craig A. Faber, Vice President of Administration at Tulon, who was in the process of investigating the incident. Faber found that the letters Chalmers was sending were inappropriate in their invasion of privacy, and disruptive to the work relationships, and overall an example of bad judgement from Chalmers’ part. The plaintiff was terminated as a result, causing her to question whether the company’s actions were based on religious discrimination.Nevertheless, Chalmers did not have a sufficient claim to her religious accommodation case, since she could not satisfy the requirements of the prima facie test. More specifically, the court agreed that Chalmers had enough evidence to prove that her religious beliefs were genuine and that she did get a disciplinary punishment. However, she could not prove that she had warned
the company of the letter sending as an element of her faith, which made it impossible for it to accommodate her. Therefore, the plaintiff’s claim was deemed a failure and Tulon Company was affirmed as not responsible.Case QuestionsThe employer’s action to avoid this situationIt would be difficult to avoid this situation since it is impossible for the employer to be explicit about every single type of behavior that is frowned upon in the office. The employer could not have known that Chalmers was planning on sending the letters or predicted their contents. Therefore, there was no way for the employer to protect himself from the confusion and miscommunication that occurred, or the other employees from the discomfort they experienced. Furthermore, it would be impossible for the employer to
predict the reactions of the letters’ recipients, as they could have also been positive. The only possible way the employer could have attempted to avoid this, or similar situations, would be by better protecting the privacy of its employees, such as keeping personal addresses and such private. Nevertheless, it would still not be guaranteed that the addresses could not be acquired outside of the work hours.A possibility of a different outcomeIf the employee had explicitly warned the employer of her intentions, and the employer chose to prohibit such actions, then the situation would have been slightly different. Prohibiting the sending of the letters would be unlikely to be considered disciplinary punishment, therefore, one of the prima facie requirements would be questionable. However, if it was considered disciplinary action,
The case under consideration, Bostock v. Clayton County, 590 U.S., was significant for developing measures to avoid discrimination in the workplace. More specifically, it was primarily related to diversity in terms of sex and age since this combination frequently evokes the concerns of the population (King, 2021). The examination of the issue by relying on the example of Gerald Bostock was advantageous for establishing proper employment practices in this respect.In this lawsuit filed by the plaintiff, the main factor was his unjustified dismissal from the company in which he had otherwise positive reputation. This event was caused by the man’s interest in a gay softball league which he expressed while being in the workplace while neglecting the provisions of Title VII (Mallory et al., 2020). This part of
was successful as Bostock managed to support his position with the opposing statements of Massachusetts law, Chapter 151B (“Bostock v. Clayton County, 590 U.S.,” 2019). In this way, the meaning of the previously used provisions regulating such cases was modified accordingly.To summarize, the examined court case based on employment law and, more specifically, discrimination against workers happened to be crucial for making adjustments. The previous evidence, as per Title VII of the Civil Rights Act did not include the particular considerations of sex and age. Hence, this gap was compensated for by this decision, and the consequent change in the legal provisions helped guarantee the equality of people in the workplace in the context of their diversity.
Case SummaryThe case concerns Christopher Lee Peterson, at the time of events an employee of Wilmur Communications and a follower of the World Church of the Creator. In 2000, Peterson gave an interview to the local paper on WCC, expressing his racist views, which included the support of a known shooter that targeted African-American, Jewish and Asian people. After finding out about the interview, the company president suspended Peterson without pay and later demoted him to a lower pay and responsibility role. Since according to Title VII it is unlawful to discriminate based on religious views, the plaintiff sued the organization for the demotion.Creativity, or the World Church of the Creator, is a self-proclaimed religion with its beliefs centered around white supremacy and the maintenance of racial purity.
The extremist group was established in 1973 by Ben Klassen, and after he committed suicide in 1993 Matt Hale took on the role of the leader (“Creativity Movement”, n.d.). According to the founder, Klassen, the organization and its members strive towards a “total war” against all “goddamned mud races” (“Creativity Movement”, n.d.), as he thought of the White Race as elite and superior to the other races. Although the group believes itself to be a religion, it did not endorse any gods, and considered race to be the most sacred truth (“Creativity Movement”, n.d.). Furthermore, the followers of WCC claimed that Holocaust did not exist, and that a utopian world consists of white people only. Throughout the years, the neo-Nazi organization attracted several violently inclined individuals, which allegedly
resulted in numerous attacks.Peterson, who was a member of the organization, supervised a team of both white and non-white subordinates. In March 2000, the plaintiff appeared in the local newspaper, which was doing a segment on the WCC. The article included the confirmation of Peterson’s views and beliefs as those concordant with the views of the WCC, as well as a photograph of Peterson showing respect to a mass shooter. Although Peterson’s believes were similar to those of the KKK and arguably unethical, his termination was still judged to be unlawful and religiously discriminatory by the court.Case QuestionsAn employer’s reaction to the news articleIf I was the employer that saw this news article, I would find a legal way to terminate the employee. As an employer, it would
be my duty to maintain a functioning and safe workplace. Therefore, seeing an article that could potentially disturb some of the employees would cause me to question whether the person making these claims is a good fit for the company. If the employees are unable to feel safe in the working environment, then as the employer I would be liable for creating such environment. Although, to the best of my knowledge in the scenario, the employee had not acted on his beliefs and had just been expressing them, I would not want to be responsible in the case that he did. Furthermore, the fact that the employee had non-white people in his subordination makes the open support of the racist mass shooter in the paper a relatively explicit
threat. Therefore, it would be easier to eliminate the problematic employee from the workplace before he became a bigger problem.The court’s decision reflectionThe court decision is completely valid in legal terms, since the demotion was explicitly reasoned as a result from the employee’s religious beliefs. However, it is surprising that the World Church of the Creator was recognized by the court as a religion in the first place. Firstly, Creativity does not endorse not only any gods but anything metaphysical or mystical. Secondly, Peterson’s religion is quite explicitly based on racism and white supremacy and has previously been linked with violence towards non-white members of the society. Although Creativity follows the definition for a religion requires to judge the case according to Title VII, the morality as described
be my duty to maintain the safety of the workplace. Mistreatment of non-white employees by other employees is a serious problem and would require disciplinary hearings to investigate the incident. There is a certain culture in the corporate world to ignore problematic situations for the sake of long-term profit, such as if the abuser was a particularly valuable asset. However, although profit is generally one of the most important goals of a company, as an employer I would commit to valuing the employees. This would entail disciplining those that disturb the workplace, without showing favoritism. Therefore, depending on the decided degree of offence, the punishment for such mistreatment could range between a warning and termination.
Case SummaryThe case of Trans World Airlines, Inc. v. Hardison is concerned with the failure of the employer to accommodate the employee’s religious observance day. The plaintiff, Hardison, was an employee at Trans World Airlines and a devoted Jew who observed Sabbath every Saturday. According to the Jewish traditions, the seventh day of the week, Saturday, is a rest day during which the followers of Judaism are not allowed to do any work. As Sabbath, or Shabbat, is a holy day in Judaism, it was important for Hardison to be able to work shifts that would allow him to be free on Saturdays.Trans World Airlines maintained a seniority system that would allow each worker to have a certain level of priority when choosing his or her shifts. For
some years, Hardison worked at a department of TWA which presented him with a level of seniority enough to choose the shifts that allowed his observance of Shabbat. However, after willingly changing jobs, his seniority level was no longer enough to give him the necessary freedom to not schedule shifts on Saturdays. Although the company sought to accommodate Hardison’s religious needs, it was unable to accept his proposal to only work 4 days a week. Hardison’s refusal to work on Saturdays eventually caused him to be terminated.The plaintiff claimed that the company failed to accommodate him and violated Title VII that protects individuals from religious discrimination. However, the court concluded that TWA made a reasonable effort at accommodating Hardison and granting him the request to work four days
a week would detriment the function of his department due to them being short-staffed. Nevertheless, the Court of Appeals claimed that TWA did not make sufficient effort of offering alternative solutions to Hardison’s scheduling problem and rejected three reasonable alternatives. Regardless of the apparent potential hardships the company claimed, it could have offered Hardison’s Saturday shift to another employee for an overtime pay. Nevertheless, breaking the seniority rules for one employee, no matter the little individual cost, would set a precedent for future cases. Therefore, granting Hardison special treatment would have led to TWA having large costs in the long-run. Regardless, the Court of Appeals deemed TWA liable for not having made a sufficient effort to accommodate Hardison.Case QuestionsThe alternatives suggested by the court of appealsThere were a
few alternatives that were offered by the Court of Appeals for the TWA in the case of Hardison’s scheduling conflict. However, for several reasons none of these alternatives were viable in the long-run and therefore, TWA should not have been held accountable for its decision to terminate Hardison. Firstly, allowing the plaintiff to work four days a week would have caused a short-staffing situation and would put unnecessary strains on the other workers at the organization. Furthermore, allowing Hardison to overlook the seniority system and to have more freedom to choose his hours would also be unfair on other workers. Lastly, forcing another employee to take on more hours as a result would not only be unfair on the other staff but would put a strain on the
company’s budget in the long-term. Since putting forward a precedent could cause a number of similar cases to come forward, such as other people that for whatever reason wish to overlook the seniority system, this would cause disorder.Prohibiting religious discrimination and accommodating religious differencesSome agreements and rules, as well as rights, can be non-coexistent, leading to inconsistencies in judgements. However, since there would not be a viable solution that would honor both prohibiting religious discrimination and the collective bargaining agreement in this case, it should be accepted that only one of them can be prioritized. Considering that the company made an effort to accommodate Hardison’s religious needs, including a search for a new job, it cannot be blamed for inconsistency. Furthermore, it was Hardison’s own decision to change
have the sufficient seniority level to not schedule any shifts on Saturdays. In this case, I would help him come up with alternative solutions, such as finding someone in the company to regularly take Hardison’s shift instead of him. However, if the compromise could not be found within a two-week period, I would be forced to terminate Hardison. I think that the Court was unnecessarily dismissive of the company’s efforts and should have deemed the effort sufficient.
There are several types of fake news, ranging from apparent articles to more subtle kinds of deception. People frequently rely on critical decisions on what they read in the news, such as how to vote in elections or what therapy to provide when they are sick. This is why it is critical to have trustworthy news. When individuals can’t identify the difference between true and fake news, critical social and political issues get muddled and misunderstood. A lot of false news is created with the intent of inflaming and exacerbating societal disputes. Most significantly, critical thinking is required while posting or researching on a certain issue, writing comments, and engaging in other social media activities. Many fake news articles are constructed in such a way as to elicit
The computation of the three ratiosReturn on Assets (RoA)Return on Equity (RoE)Profit MarginThe purpose and information conveyed by each ratiosThe three ratios presented and computed in the previous section represent vital profit generation indicators for a modern commercial organization. The return on assets (RoA) shows how well the company utilizes the entirety of its assets, including the borrowed ones, to generate financial returns. The return on equity is largely similar to this metric, but it does not consider the debt of the company (Gallo, 2016). Finally, the profit margin is one of the most important indicators of financial health, as it draws a direct comparison between sales and profits, showing how much the company actually earns from its operations.ABC Company review on three ratiosFirst of all, the ABC
Company’s business model can be deemed successful, as it generates adequate profits. Optimal returns on equity and assets show that the investors can reasonably expect returns on their participation in the company’s financing. The profit margin is also considerable, which means that this aspect of the firm is handled well.The profitability of the companyOverall, the ABC Company remains a profitable enterprise that successfully converts its assets into revenues. The profit margin is over 50%, which is commendable, even though the overall turnover is below $1 million. Therefore, the business model on its own functions well, allowing the ABC Company to retain a stable position on the market. However, it may not suffice for the sustained growth in the long-term.ABC Company financial successfulWhile the ABC Company’s financial statement may
growth phase ahead. Furthermore, the industry’s leaders, such as Williams-Sonoma, have hundreds of millions of sales, whereas the ABC Company only has half-a-million. As the total assets of the company increase, there is no guarantee that its profit margins and returns on investment will remain equally high. Under these circumstances, the emphasis will be on maintaining the profitability of operations above the average level across the industry.
Geographical distribution and locationBanana is a popular fruit crop that grows all over the world and has several health advantages. Bananas are particularly significant in several low-income, food-insecure, least developed nations, where they may help with both household food security and revenue-generating as a cash crop. The crop is a key export item for a number of agricultural nations, and it is Africa’s, Asia’s, and Latin America’s biggest fruit crop in terms of production and commerce (MacKinnon & Cumbers, 2019). Bananas from Central and South America, as well as the Philippines, account for more than 90% of all exports (MacKinnon & Cumbers, 2019). The EU, the USA, China, Russia, and Japan are the top importers (MacKinnon & Cumbers, 2019). Banana output worldwide is projected to be 130 million
Blues-inspired poetry reflects the interaction between literary art and musical tradition that originates from the early 20 th century. Most researchers of this area, including Tracy (1981), state that blues-inspired poetry stems from the struggle and culture of African Americans. These people expressed their views and concerns through the music of blues, which quickly found a warm reception from the audience. Naturally, these aspects found their way into poetry, creating a unique style that combines the thematic elements of blues with the poetic tradition of literature. Blues poetry is stylistically similar to blues music in that it does not attempt to incorporate a variety of complex language forms and sophisticated rhymes. Instead, blues poetry is characterized by repetitive lines that emphasize the emotional burden of the author, as
well as often simplified grammatic and lexical construction. Importantly, these attributes do not imply that blues poetry is simple or primitive by any means. On the contrary, these works are characterized by an extreme level of emotional depth, which is further multiplied by the realistic nature of the narration.Blues poetry is a common feature of the first decades of the 20 th century and it is closely connected to the names of renowned authors of the time. More specifically, Tracy (1981) and other researchers highlight the contribution made by Langston Hughes and Sterling Brown who virtually defined the genre as it is. Nevertheless, blues poetry is not limited to their literary works, as a number of other authors contributed to the development of this style. Furthermore, blues poetry
is found nowadays, as well, and the reason is that its themes are immortal. This genre addressed human struggle, pain, addiction, sexual relationships, and death, which are the topics that are not at all exclusive to the origins of blues poetry.Having researched various works of the genre, I was particularly impressed by a piece that dates back to the 1920s. James Weldon Johnson (1927) created a poem that is titled Go Down, Death . As the name suggests, the piece thematically addresses the grief of a person over a beloved one. The recurring element of the poem goes like this:“Weep not, weep not,She is not dead;She’s resting in the bosom of Jesus.”Johnson mourns the death of a woman, attempting to console himself by searching divine meaning in the
of blues poetry that reflects the depth of the genre.You ain’t gonna see it coming, noNo one’s gonna see it comingIt comes unannounced in day or at nightAll you can do is just sit here real tightHe wants to your granny, yeahHe wants to take your neighborDon’t think that you’re too cunningDon’t think that you’re too cleverI saw him once and it was scaryI saw him once, yes, it was scaryHe got me mumbling like I never did‘What’s your name?’, I askedand he said, ‘COVID’
AbstractThe research involved finding the difference between men and women about body image concerns. The research was developed to resolve the limitations of previous researchers. In the current research, it was suggested that men scored higher on DMS and women on BSQS. The research also established associations between masculinity or femininity and drive for muscularity or body shape concerns and understanding if masculinity correlated with a drive for muscularity. It was suggested that DFM and masculinity showed a positive correlation as described by previous research to understand this association. The research included 700 participants from Princeton University who completed survey questionnaires. 64% of the participants were women, and 36% were men allowed to complete various measures such as the DMS, BSQ, and BSRI for a personality trait. The
research used ANOVA and correlation to analyze data, and the results showed that men recorded higher on DMS, while women indicated higher scores on BSQS.BackgroundResearch on gender differences in body image concerns and their results solely relied on the adiposity viewpoint. As a result, there has been the belief that men are less dissatisfied or concerned with their tendency of body fat than women who are less likely to diet to lose weight (McCreary et al., 2005). DMS and gender role measures showed men with significantly higher personality traits and the drive for muscularity in the previous study. Contrary to women who showed significant communal traits and acted in a more female-typed manner. In determining the degree for predicting drive for muscularity, men scored higher on the DMS
than women on controlling gender behaviors (Gattario et al., 2015). Therefore, higher levels of male gender roles were closely related to the desire to become muscular. Femininity was not associated with the drive for muscularity as there was a lack of interrelation amid feminine-typed behaviors and traits and DMS scores (McCreary et al., 2005). Another finding showed that both men and women showed a similar association between gender-typed behaviors and traits and the drive for muscularity.Similarly, men with more traditional attitudes desired to become more muscular. Men who wanted to be muscular experienced conflict about societal expectations, as they wanted to be competitive, powerful, and successful (Radwan et al., 2019). Previous research had limitations such that the research involved was correlational, which determined only significant relationships’ direction and
presence. Another limitation was that the study samples were restricted based on ethnicity and age. Therefore, the current study was designed to address the limitations of McCreary et al. (2005). The study explores the direction of causality in the interrelations amid masculinity perceptions and drive for muscularity and uses different populations and measures. A previous study contacted by McCreary et al. (2005) used BSQ for body image measure and drive for muscularity scale (DMS) and BSQS. However, the current study uses measures geared toward body fat and muscularity. Based on gender personality measures, BSRI is employed to explore different aspects of gender role socialization.The research questions for the current study entail finding if there is a difference between men and women in body image amid concern with muscle
mass and body fat or shape. The hypothesis for this research question predicted that men would score higher on DMS and women higher on BSQS, as found by McCreary’s theory and research findings. The second research question involved finding the relationships between masculinity/femininity and drive for muscularity/body shape concerns and understanding if masculinity correlated with a drive for muscularity. Based on this research question, it was hypothesized that there would be a positive correlation between masculinity and drive for muscularity (DFM), as stated in the theory and prior research. For DFM and FEM, McCreary theorized a relationship but did not find it. Hence, the current study wants to replicate and confirm or disprove original findings and investigate correlations for BSQS.MethodsParticipantsA total of 700 participants completed surveys, of which
64% were women, and 36% were men. The participants’ age range was between 18 to 35 years with a mean age of 20.8 years, men SD = 3.2 while women SD = 2.5, and only 2.3% of the participants were older than 24 years. Most of the participants were European American, accounting for 90%, working-class was 65%, middle-class 17%, upper-middle-class 15%, and upper class 3%. The majority of participants were individuals who were employed in their professionals. Out of the total participants, 78 were lesbian, 79 bisexual, and 176 heterosexual.ProcedureThe research was conducted at Princeton University, containing a large student and staff population. Relevant research authorities in the college approved the study, and all participating research students were permitted to research body image concerns. For participants to be
recruited into the research process, they must fulfill the exclusion and inclusion criteria. A survey was used to collect data where each participant was given Likert-questionnaires to complete that included questions about personality traits and demographics. Participants were allowed to complete all the DMS, BSQ, and BSRI, after which the collected data was analyzed to ascertain each trait. Informed consent for the research involved assessing the ability of participants to comprehend and present relevant research information and make a voluntary decision. Filled informed consent was documented and included in the research record.Every participant completed DMS that measured their desire for a muscular body. The item on this scale presented behaviors and attitudes, and no reverse coding was performed. Sample items entailed participants wishing to be muscular and feeling
guilty for missing training sessions. All the participants answered similar survey questionnaires administered with various self-report instruments as part of the research. The questionnaires were conducted voluntarily, and the participants were invited to answer the questions. Participants were allowed to fill out consent forms willingly without manipulation after being told what the research entails, including its benefit.Measures  * Survey. A survey was performed by asking participants about their opinion on their body shape, including rating themselves on a 6-point Likert scale, with 60 traits related to personality. In addition, a question on the participant’s background and personal demographics was included. The participants were not required to put their names on the survey, and all responses were kept with high confidentiality and anonymity. The survey questions were to
be answered freely by the participants without penalizing those who submitted an incomplete survey.  * Drive for Muscularity Scale (DMS). DMS is a 15-item measure of the degree to which individuals desire to have a more muscular body. Each item on the DMS represents a combination of behaviors and attitudes scored on a 6-point scale ranging from 1, which implies ”very much like me” to 6, which indicates ”not at all like me.” There is good construct validity with DMS about-face, discriminant, and convergent validity. The Cronbach’s alphas for men are.91 and women’s.83.  * Body Shape Questionnaire Scale (BSQS). BSQS is a 34-item questionnaire that measures how people feel about their body shape. BSQ is scored on a 1-6 scale (with 1=Never and 6=Always), with some
of the items being calculated from the total scale score and scores ranging from 34 to 204. A higher score indicates more discomfort and dissatisfaction with body concerns.  * Bem Sex-Role Inventory (BSRI). BSRI measures femininity and masculinity used to research gender roles by assessing how individuals recognize themselves psychologically. The test has 60 diverse personality traits where participants rate themselves on a 7-point Likert scale. Personality traits are equally dispersed with 20 gender-neutral traits, 20 feminine, and 20 masculines. BSRI has shown high test-retest reliability and validity with coefficient alphas of.87 for masculinity scale and.78 for femininity scales, and no androgynous scale was used for analysis.ResultsParticipants recorded different measures of central tendency for both scales such that for DMS men mean=2.42, SD=0.79, BSQS M=2.48, SD=1.30, BSRI
masculinity M=2.28, SD=0.57, and femininity M=2.44, SD=0.45. For women DMS M=1.99, SD=0.61, BSQS M=2.85, SD=1.40, BSRI Masculinity M=2.82, SD=0.70, Femininity M=1.88, SD=1.75. One-way ANOVA was used to ascertain DMS, BSQS, and BSRI measures, as shown in table 1. The results for ANOVA F-ratio indicated a big difference between the two genders. To evaluate how the study variables correlated and whether they related differently based on sexual orientation, correlations were performed for DMS and MAS, DMS and FEM, BSQS and MAS, and BSQS and FEM.Table 1.

Based on DMS and FEM, the findings showed a positive correlation between DMS and femininity, such that drive for masculinity was directly related to femininity. Women who are attracted to muscular individuals influenced men to gain weight. However, women had no association with DMS as they diet to lose more weight. There was no significant correlation between BSQS and MAS; however, BSQS and FEM
showed a significant correlation.DiscussionTo determine the difference among men and women in body image concern with muscle mass and body shape or fat, ANOVA and correlation were used to analyze the results. Men recorded higher scores on DMS, while women indicated higher scores on BSQS, which conformed with the theory of McCreary and previous research findings. It was also found that masculinity correlated with a drive for muscularity, unlike femininity, which showed a relationship with a drive for body shape. Studies show that most men experience the drive for gaining muscles to avoid risking depression symptoms and poorer self-esteem. Men also become muscular because women feel more attracted to muscular body shape than ideal body size, thereby posing the urge to want more prominent shoulders, biceps, and pectorals.
BSRI findings showed an association between gender about masculinity and femininity. Men depicted having stronger confirmation to gender-role expectations than women did.The degree of masculinity was positively correlated with DMS, and both women and men interrelated male-typed behaviors and traits with a prerequisite of becoming more muscular. In addition, the studies have also revealed that men seldom encounter clinical disorders related to body images such as bulimia nervosa and anorexia and are relatively happy with their bodies. However, the belief has not considered that adiposity is not equally paramount for men and women. Women depict a thin and small social standard of bodily attractiveness, unlike men, who show big and muscular social standards in a muscular mesomorphic shape. Being muscular has been regarded as essential among adolescent males,
is likely to cause misleading results. A questionnaire allows efficient and quick collection of data from study samples. However, this method has limitations, such that respondents are prone to lying due to social desirability. Most individuals want to present a positive image about themselves and lie to look good. In addition, the method is only suitable to educated respondents where open questions are used that require superior writing skills and better capability of expressing one’s feelings orally. To maintain validity and credibility, there is a need for future research to focus on ensuring the data collected is reliable by using the best measures for data collection besides survey questionnaires.
Chinas Food Culture and Table EtiquetteChina is a country that focuses on courtesy with a deep history in its food culture. In China, it is essential to observe table manners as both guests and natives have a precise placement on the table during meal times. It is admirable that the Chinese stress taking care of the elders and children before others during meals. In a domestic setup, it is the norm to place the main dish, consisting of grain or rice, at the center. Rice is an essential part of the meal since it has some religious value to society. Since China leads in rice cultivation, the people believe it is their source of wealth and show reverence to it by making it the main meal in every
dish. Elders sit at the head of the table and serve first. Chinese receive rice bowls with both hands to show respect regardless of the age of the person serving. So, when in China, it is advisable to like rice and teat it religiously during meal times.Another distinct aspect in Chinese food cultures is with eating chopsticks. I found it interesting that Chines have a unique way of holding chopsticks according to the meal. I find it hard to eat noodles with chopsticks, but the Chinese make it sound and feel easy to eat rice with chopsticks. It is incredible how people rip meat and fish with chopsticks when I do not know how to hold them in the first place. I did find out that chopsticks have
cultural value in China, where they are considered lucky charms in a marriage.Norms And Values In ‘How Family Works’The author describes family norms and values from a more ritualistic perspective. Ancient communities relied on rituals and ceremonies to showcase their socio-cultural and economic importance. Rites of passage are a norm for people who must pass through all stages from childhood to adulthood. Community members observed all rites of passage through ritualistic ceremonies involving willing participants. Nowadays, families also celebrate rites of passage differently. While the natives held rituals, nowadays, people have celebrations and religious traditions to mark developmental stages such as birthday parties, graduation, and religious events like baptism and matrimony. Elders ensured the passing of traditional knowledge across generations through narratives and observing traditional ceremonies. The people
had a central kinship that dictated societal traditions, behaviors, and ceremonial locations.Significant stages such as marriage ceremonies were held with the utmost respect. It was a norm for the girls’ parents to receive a dowry, which shows the girl’s value and the community. In the marriage ceremony, the couple faces away from their parents to indicate broken ties and the formation of an independent union. The same traditions apply in modern society, where people have a central kinship that dictates their habits through generations. The community also celebrated seasons as a way of thanksgiving and sharing among community members. Generosity was a value that all members upheld, and during festivals, people came together with various items to exchange and give out. People also celebrate significant seasons through festivals
and even their inter-relationships based on finances. As a result, workers may exhibit reluctance to change. It leads to the creation of each budget with the backing of top leadership. Each employee’s requirements are fully described and distributed in a formal structure. If this is the case, they will be aware of their power and responsibilities, which will be valuable for budgetary management. A financial management program’s effectiveness depends on the organization’s defined objectives. As a result, when establishing targets, management should exercise caution. Furthermore, the aims are explicit.
Gendered behavior denotes fundamental expressions of gender socialization and identity through an individual’s various developmental phases. Thus, gendered behaviors refer to the ways persons behave according to their respective male or female genders (Au & Rudolfsdottir, 2021). One of the prominent gendered behaviors instilled in me during childhood was that women are the primary cooks in the home. Hence, from childhood, I learned how to prepare food for the family, unlike most male relatives around. Even the movies mostly depicted women as the cooks in the home.Perhaps the gendered role that I quickly adopted/ accepted from childhood was the idea that women are natural caregivers. The function depicted women as noble people who consider the plight of others in the home and society and consistently seek to alleviate
The guilty but mentally ill (GBMI) verdict may be regarded as a highly controversial phenomenon that has been nonetheless adopted by a considerable number of states regardless of little empirical support and sound criticism. In general, it is a particular verdict option that authorizes both psychiatric treatment and conventional criminal sanctions for defendants whose criminal offense was determined by their insanity (Bartol & Bartol, 2020). In other words, in the case of the GBMI verdict, juries and judges formally acknowledge a perpetrator’s mental illness and find him guilty of criminal violation at the same time.The GBMI verdict was introduced due to the increased number of crimes committed by defendants who had been previously released as not guilty by reason of insanity (NGRI). At the same time, the GBMI
verdict was introduced as an option for a judge to define a sentence on the basis of an individual’s guilt and insanity. Its purpose is to minimize the cases of NGRI acquittees’ early release based on the GBMI verdict’s peculiarities. Thus, a perpetrator who receives it is sentenced as any other defendant found guilty (Bartol & Bartol, 2020). At the same time, he receives mental treatment to the extent determined by the court. The main peculiarity of the GBMI verdict is the offender’s serving out the rest of his sentence if and after his mental health is defined as stabilized (Bartol & Bartol, 2020). This fact is a major difference from the conditions of the NGRI verdict that presupposes the release of the insanity-defense acquittee from psychiatric commitment
when he is no longer dangerous for society.The GBMI verdict remains highly controversial as it presupposes rehabilitation and societal compassion for an offender along with the criminal sentence and the system’s control. On the one hand, mentally ill defendants receive necessary treatment while being punished for their criminal offenses. In addition, the verdict protects community members keeping those defendants imprisoned for the rest of their sentences even if their mental health is improved. In turn, in the case of the NGRI verdict, the absence of defendants’ guilt is justified by their insanity. Moreover, staying imprisoned with stabilized mental health allows GBMI defendants to realize their mistakes and prevent crime recidivism.On the other hand, the GBMI verdict is frequently criticized for being a misleading option introduced for political reasons
A lot of historical events and time periods have specific names. The renaissance, the enlightenment, the stone age – all of these were called such for a particular reason, and signify a way to differentiate one era from another. One prime example of that trend is the industrial revolution. Also called the industrialization, it was an important part of history and a big step in both technological and social development. Happening at a never-before seen speed, the process has begun and ended in less than a 100 years. The word “revolution” in “industrial revolution” is used to emphasize that fact, and note that the process is regarded as both an extreme and quick advancement in society ( Industrial revolution ). Like a real revolution, it also had a
to the establishment of the city as a central hub for human interaction. On a larger scale, the ability to mass produce goods and services has allowed countries to establish larger economies, expand trade, and start more thorough relationships with their neighbors. Overall, the industrialization age has had its ups and downs, but the significance of the process is hard to overlook, as it remains the basis for the society people see today.
Miranda warning, also known as Miranda rights, is a formal statement in which a person being arrested is informed of their basic civil rights under the jurisdiction of the United States. Through this warning, an officer of the law enforcement notifies the individual of their right to remain silent, as well as to an attorney. Such principles reflect the foundation of the legal system of the United States, in which both sides are protected by a comprehensive set of rights in order to eliminate bias and enable an objective investigation of the case.The obligatory nature of the warning serves the interests of both sides of the process. First of all, the person being detained possesses an inherent set of rights, which must be respected within the framework of
to incapacitate the perpetrator before starting legal procedures. From this perspective, it may be contextually appropriate to postpone Miranda warnings until the public safety is secured. In other words, the possibility of a direct, immediate threat to people’s lives outweighs legal formalities (Rogers & Drogin, 2019). Nevertheless, Miranda warnings should not be ignored completely, as they form the core of a transparent trial. Therefore, even if they are not presented at the moment of an arrest, Miranda rights will be given later once the situation is secured and prior to launching formal legal procedures.
The doctor’s job is to follow ethical standards, including loyalty to patients and respect for their choice. However, the profession concentrates on philosophical, religious, and cultural traditions and beliefs. Physician-assisted suicide can be seen as voluntary death by a medical professional. At the same time, the doctor provides all the necessary means and information regarding the patient’s desires for the end of life. However, such cooperation on the part of a doctor cannot be ethically conditioned.Allowing euthanasia can cause irreparable harm to the patient if done incorrectly. Thus, a person can be left without the possibility of a habitual existence. Even though many patients who decide to die to suffer from incurable diseases voluntarily, the doctor cannot assist them. In this case, the moral commandment that a person
Portraying the lives of gods and depicting relationships between them, as well as their interactions with humans, both “Iliad” and “Metamorphosis” elaborate on the theme of power abuse by those at the helm. In “Iliad,” Agamemnon has to face retribution due to his constant abuse of power: “be ready, that I be not left,/Alone of all the Greeks, without my prize” (Homer, 762 B. C.). Likewise, in “Metamorphosis,” various deities display complete disrespect for those of lesser power: “What had escaped the waves, now feared the flame” (Ovid, 8 B.C.). However, unlike the “Iliad,” “Metamorphosis” rarely demonstrates the comeuppance that deities have to face for their negligence of mortals’ needs (Homer, 762 B. C.; Ovid, 8 B. C.). Therefore, while thematically similar, “Iliad” and “Metamorphosis” represent slightly different
The project aims to explore the questions behind people’s sexual orientation identification and the reasons behind it. Some people consider sexuality a subject of choice; others argue that the environment cannot dictate a person what sex attracts them. The latter group proceeds with the argument that sexuality is determined biologically, making it an aspect of one’s identity, which should be protected by the government (Sheldon et al., 2017). To further explore people’s perspectives on the matter, the project’s topic can be phrased as the following research question: does the environment affect people’s sexual orientation?While exploring the subject of the research, the following dependant and independent variables related to the topic were identified with the help of the GSS database. The dependent variable is sexort, which stands for respondent’s
One of the main purposes of a leader of a business is to select the best course of action out of the available alternatives when it comes to the process of decision-making. Clearly enough, it is impossible without a thorough understanding of a company’s business environment. When it comes to entering the market with the goods for the purchasers’ consumption, the one theory that specialists often take to is the supply and demand theory. This theory is utilized to understand the customers’ buying behaviors and help managers strategize the product in the market in accordance with them. For instance, a lack of demand for the product signifies that supply needs to be shortened – and vice versa: when there is an increase of demand, it is reasonable to
enhance supply of goods as well. Additionally, a supply and demand analysis helps in pricing: if the demand for the product is high, buyers are more likely to accept price increases an keep on purchasing it. With the low demand, however, prices should be sufficiently affordable; otherwise, the producer will suffer losses.There are various strategies to make the supply and demand model work to one’s advantage. Dayton cites an example of De Beers – a company specializing in creating diamond jewelry. Their vaults are filled with diamonds – but they manage to maintain high prices for gems by limiting supply. Thus, diamonds keep staying a rare commodity, for the acquisition of which as a status symbol purchasers willingly pay. Another organization using the supply and demand theory to
enormous assortment, excellent customer service, and a favorable return policy make buyers choose them time and time again. Finally, there is Apple – a renowned giant of the technology market. Their building of anticipation for the release of a service or a product is a manufacturing demand that makes purchasers feel like they are a part of something bigger than simply another gadget’s market entry. In conclusion, a supply and demand theory can definitely be used as a tool for navigating the market – one only has to search for appropriate ways to use it to their product’s advantage.
The influence of social networks is increasing, pushing traditional media to second place. In particular, Twitter platform has become an influential tool for obtaining current information and even conducting debates on various topics. However, tweets can also be different and may or not impact society. This paper examines the Australian politician Bill Shorten’s tweet concerning the National Disability Insurance Scheme (NDIS). Although the politician reports a joyful event in his message, he also expressed regrets about the current policy, limiting the NDIS activity.This tweet is meant to be both informative and grievance. At the same time, the author reports that the girl received assistance thanks to NDIS funding but also regrets that this was possible only after public coverage of the situation. As a result, Shorten deplores the
retweets, 50 comments, and 858 likes – such activity for a poorly discussed topic is quite a significant influence. However, the popularity of the issue is low, and in relation to the population of Australia, such indicators are small. Assessing authority, one can say that Shorten as a politician, is aware and concerned about the topic and has experience and knowledge to express an authoritative opinion. Thus, the tweet may be influential in discussing the activities of NDIS but not on the national scale.
SWOT AnalysisSWOT analysis plays a pivotal role in the strategic planning process for organizations operating in various industries. This framework allows for evaluating the company’s strengths, weaknesses, opportunities, and threats, which in turn provides foundations for establishing relevant strategic goals and developing a coherent business plan. Diversicare Healthcare Services, Inc. is a healthcare provider focusing on the field of post-acute care (Diversicare, 2020). The organization continuously provides high-quality medical services and therapies to its patients.Thesis StatementThis paper aims to conduct a SWOT analysis of Diversicare Healthcare, including its strengths, weaknesses, opportunities, and threats, in order to develop appropriate strategic goals for the company.Strengths  * A broad range of high-quality acute care services. As stated in the most recent annual report of Diversicare (2020), the company has a
strong reputation as a provider of high-quality, cost-effective services due to its pursuit of excellence. The organization implements an evidence-based approach and a quality assurance system to provide patients with effective and safe treatment and therapy options.  * A total of 61 operating locations across eight states. As Diversicare (2020) reports, the “continuing operations consist of 61 nursing centers with 7,250 licensed skilled nursing beds … in Alabama, Indiana, Kansas, Mississippi, Missouri, Ohio, Tennessee, and Texas” (p. 2). Therefore, the organization addresses the needs of an expanded population base.  * Strong corporate culture. Diversicare emphasizes the importance of connectedness, compassion, trust, respect, and communication as core values shaping the workplace environment and interaction with patients (“A name you can trust,” n. d.). As a result, Diversicare’s
company culture is considered its distinguishing feature compared to other post-acute care providers in the United States.  * The loyalty of customers and employees. Diversicare is recognized for excellent experience by its customers and for its unique culture by its employees through respective 2020 awards (“A name you can trust,” n. d.). The medical staff is provided with training and tools for obtaining and enhancing necessary skills. Customer satisfaction is ensured through effective communication, support, and continuous improvement.Weaknesses  * Decreased revenue and high operating expenses due to the COVID-19 pandemic. According to Stulick (2021), Diversicare reported: “a net loss from continuing operations at -$2.9 million, or -43 cents per share in the third quarter” of 2020 (para. 1).  * Employee turnover rate due to overwork.
One of the major challenges the organization faces is the problem of retaining qualified medical staff in the context of high demand and longer or irregular hours (Diversicare, 2020). The pandemic and competition aggravate increased workload and the associated employee shortage.  * Lack of communication between employees and management. Diversicare has a problem with ensuring effective internal communication among its staff, which results in weak leadership (Diversicare, 2020).  * A limited supply of licensed skilled nursing center beds. As Diversicare (2020) indicates in the annual report, “high construction costs … and start-up expenses also act to restrict growth in the supply for such centers” (p. 6).Opportunities  * Increasing the number of nursing centers. Diversicare (2020) can “acquire and lease new centers, focusing primarily on opportunities
that can leverage” the existing infrastructure (p. 2). By aligning the growth with strategic objectives, the company can determine markets for continuing operations.  * The use of innovation and technology. The organization fosters an evidence-based approach in order to provide purposeful services for its patients (“A name you can trust,” n. d.). Therefore, Diversicare can develop an innovation culture to improve the quality of care and promote efficient solutions. The use of technology is another opportunity to enhance communication, eliminate medical errors, and improve management.  * Increasing profitability at existing centers. Diversicare can address the financial challenges by improving the payor mix and promoting higher occupancy (Diversicare, 2020). Furthermore, the company can continue to introduce marketing initiatives at the existing nursing centers.  * Presenting additional
IntroductionDiversicare Medical Care (formerly Advocat) offers a variety of health and living services to the elderly through care facilities and assisted-living facilities, most of which are situated in the southern and southwestern United States. This company is a health center that specializes in post-acute care. It was established in 1994 on a culture of passionate service. Recollection care, short-term restoration care, protracted care, and medical treatment are among the services provided. It is located in Brentwood, Tennessee, and its mission is to better the lives of all of its caregivers by surpassing their expectations and delivering exceptional health care services. Integrity, sympathy, greatness, teamwork, and stewardship are its core values. It employs over 6,800 people in more than 60 separate areas across nine states (Diversicare, n.d.).Workers’ pensions include
life insurance, a 401k plan with a match, continuing professional education, short break, holiday, sick time prepayments, career path intending short and long-term disability insurance, and healthcare, dental, and aspiration plans (Diversicare, n.d.). This essay will analyze the swot analysis, financial analysis and budget, strategy, implementation, and strategic evaluation respectively of Diversicare healthcare. The strategic initiative is to expand this company’s resources by increasing funding and leveraging opportunities to diversify the services provided with high professionalism and ethics.Swot AnalysisStrengthsDiversicare Primary care has a solid reputation for providing its clients with high-quality services. Furthermore, medical care ensures the long-term loyalty of both Staff and clients. There is a professional and competent bi-cultural team bi-lingual and, as well as receptive Staff eager to improve their skills. Nonetheless, the Ethnic Society
Council Queensland’s (ECCQ) Public Compassionate Institute (PBI) Co-payment Gift Recipient (DGR) strives to enhance corporate practices and essential facilities.WeaknessesOne of Diversicare’s weaknesses is a lack of technical skills and abilities among its Staff. The company’s aging workforce is also a drawback to growth. What is more, a proportion of skilled colleagues are nearing the end of their careers. Two government-funded programs account for 85 percent of the corporation’s total revenue (Diversicare, 2021). As a result, Diversicare healthcare faces another challenge due to the lack of a long-term plan for panel members and senior leaders. As an ECCQ division, this company lacks legal status, which presents a threat to the institution. Subsequently, Diversicare’s structure has too many implementers for the present level of activity/business, which is a problem for
healthcare.OpportunitiesThe clamor for Aged Care CALD Sector has increased, particularly for high-level care services like EACH, EACH-D, and Transition Care. In addition, existing User Pay Services are being expanded, as is the use of advanced technologies to ensure the quality-of-service delivery, especially with their in-home facilities. There are also plans to expand geographic reach to the Gold Coast and principal cities and CALD regions in Queensland (Stapleton et al., 2018). Demographic trends show that an increasing number of CALD working-age people are relocating to Queensland. Existing HACC and CACPS operations can be expanded, and proposals for capital and economic expansion funding can be developed for submission to the government.ThreatsOne of the risks to Diversicare healthcare is the conflict problems federal political environment. Significant competition from domestically and internationally
for-profit and non-profit institutions is also a potential danger now and in the future. The other hazard is sector consolidation through mergers, amalgamations, and takeovers. Constant public influence on the ECCQ – the industry’s peak body – investigating the causes for delivering aged care and public support facilities is also a potential danger to healthcare. Eventually, the technical skills, training, and knowledge necessary to provide future aged care services pose a serious risk.Financial Analysis and BudgetDiversicare has indeed been capable of providing post-acute and donor care worldwide. However, their client traffic has increased, even more, forcing them to place patients on a standby list until space becomes available. After financial analysis, more beds are proposed to be opened to accept more clients. This healthcare aims to provide nursing,
home healthcare, and interpersonal services to patients and residents.Furthermore, the firm’s nursing centers provide a variety of services, including nutritional support services and comprehensive rehabilitation services.The corporation of Diversicare owns more than 75 healthcare and assisted-living facilities, totaling approximately 8,500 beds (Ginthotavidana & Waidyasekara, 2021). The medical Centre is planning to increase the number of beds to accommodate more clients. Diversicare, which concentrates on rural areas, provides a variety of health care services, such as residential care, leisure activity therapy, welfare care, and clinical, cardiovascular, rehabilitative, and other customized ancillary services. Table 1 shows the simple budget for the strategic initiative.Table 1. Budget for Strategic Initiative.Budget Items

The total net income of the planned hospital has been $356210. Based on the projected balance sheet, the hospital will acquire $1500000 debt and $500000 equity to fund the current assets and purchase the land and equipment for the hospital to be constructed. Table 2 shows the ratio of assets and liabilities, considering the adopted strategy. It should be noted that the current revenue current ratio will be close
to one, which demonstrates the potential for growth in the company’s liquidity and relevancy.Table 2.

plans to reach them. A perfect corporate strategy is critical to a firm’s progress and profitability because it offers a new picture of how to reply to various advantages and threats faced by employees and the management. It provides an idea of the endeavors to be made and the routes to be taken by concentrating on the aims and priorities. Analyzing the strategic plan reveals the strengths as well as the regions that need to be enhanced.Countless specific goals must be established to obtain more beds. One target is to schedule the expansion or construction of a new facility with an additional 78 beds to allow more patients to be cared for. Cash flow has to be analyzed the resources required to meet the hospital goals in a
reasonable amount of time. Once the budgetary funds are endorsed, a location has to be looked near the agency or the university to build the expanded facility. Another goal will be to find more healthcare workers to care for the extended facility. Diversicare will be one lot closer to providing care to more service users once all the goals are met. With all these supplementary beds, Diversicare will reduce their wait time and cure more clients.This significant development will provide the most job positions for healthcare professionals in the city and resources for the company. A valid contract is required to ensure interactions with all sides involved in procuring a new location for the new beds. Having everybody in the same section can help this operation run smoothly
and efficiently, allowing the beds to be built in a reasonable amount of time. The hospital employs geographic segmentation to ensure that its patients receive accessible services, for example, treating and researching a wide range of diseases to provide better care to all patients. The funding of Diversicare is accounted for by American Lebanese Syrian Charities, which ensures that there are available funds to help the organization perform its duties (Reinsberg et al., 2017). The organization makes this possible through donations organized by St. Jude throughout the year.Implementation ScheduleTable 3. Phase Schedule.Phase 1           Phase2

First, the issue should be addressed at the level of senior management on providing more beds. The second step is to create a tactical plan and goals for modern growth. Third, talk to the accounting department about the financial plan for the new beds that will be installed. The fourth step is to consult with Human Resources or hire new medical personnel. Then, the next step is to plan for recent changes
in clinical outcomes and the addition of new beds. Finally, the sixth implementation is to inform stakeholders about current organizational changes and developments. The seventh is the start of the expansion day, which is used to estimate how long the process will take. The eighth meeting is a stakeholder briefing on the expansion process. The final step is managing human resources and worker recruitment, followed by a site inspection.Strategic EvaluationThe effectiveness of a business strategy can only be comprehended if it is evaluated regularly. A timely and regular assessment must be performed, and the reports must be reviewed in work to explain the areas for improvement as well as the areas that are profitable to the organization. Because the proposed strategic plan includes the construction of a new
There is a growing number of physicians’ encounters with the victims of human trafficking, sometimes even without recognizing them as such. Recently, Todres (2017) reported an incident, where Dr. W was requested to screen the women-employees of such a firm for sexually transmitted infections. On the one hand, according to the Code of Medical Ethics of the American Medical Association (2011), it is necessary to safeguard patient confidentiality, including several aspects, such as physical, informational, decisional, and associational privacy. At the same time, it is obligatory to keep the records of all the patients in the healthcare settings while Dr. W was asked not to maintain them to avoid possible arrest of these women. Thus, the doctor understood that in another case, the employees of this firm would
Feminist ethics is founded on the views that women’s subordination is morally inappropriate and that women’s moral experiences are as valuable as men’s. Vaughn (2019) states that the following are the practical aims of feminist ethics. Firstly, feminist ethics express moral critiques of behaviors and attitudes that reinforce women’s rights. Consequently, the vital goal is to provide morally reasonable means to oppose such behaviors and practices. Ultimately, feminist ethics’ objective is to imagine a morally good alternative that promotes female empowerment. Feminist ethical argument resurfaced in the late 1960s, first among the general public and then in academic discourse, as part of a broader rebirth of feminist ethical questions. On issues like abortion, fairness and equality, domestic work, sexual violence, and obligatory heterosexuality, the first academic feminist ideas
The concepts of domestic violence and abuse refer to psychologically or physically aggressive behavior of one family member towards another. This aggression could take the form of beating, rape, screaming, and humiliation. Unfortunately, in the modern world, these are common phenomena. According to statics provided by Huecker et al. (2021), 10 million Americans per year suffer from violence and abuse. The victims of domestic violence and abuse feel depressed and helpless, and their self-esteem is also extremely low.Fear of the aggressor might force a victim to keep calm about the experience of being abused. Nonetheless, there are signs via which a provider could suspect domestic violence, child abuse, or elder abuse. If a woman arrives at the emergency room with bruises or fractures that do not as she
slipped on the wet floor, a nurse could suspect that her partner beats her. In addition to that, victims are highly likely to be depressed and anxious even though they might try to hide these emotions (Lloyd, 2018). A provider has a reason to be concerned with child abuse if a young patient is underweighted without objective reason and is afraid of other adults. In addition to that, a child might get severely scared with a loud sound or sudden movement.As for older adults, a nurse could suspect abuse if they have bruises, broken glasses, or walking stick, show signs of depression, and fails to take medications properly. Another warning sign is the refusal of a caregiver to leave an older person alone with a nurse. Undoubtedly, caregivers
must report them to the relevant authorities. More precisely, in the case of child abuse, medical staff contacts social services via hotlines or a written statement. The fact of elder abuse should be reported to the agencies on adult protective services. Finally, a nurse should inform the local law enforcement of the case of domestic violence. Still, before informing the related agencies, a nurse should discuss the case with a physician or a nurse practitioner and exam the patient without the potential abuser in the room.
OverviewIn this research paper, drug addiction will be analyzed as the only type of personal addiction to facilitate the analysis process and give consistent study-level treatment recommendations. Firstly, many scientists define the term drug addiction differently. On the one hand, the term’ drug addiction is specifically defined by NIDA (1) as “characterized by intense and, at times, uncontrollable drug craving, along with compulsive drug seeking and use that persist even in the face of devastating consequences (2020). On the other hand, Liu and Li (1823) define drug addiction as “a complex disorder that involves complicated neural mechanisms and psychological processes; this mental disorder is treatable and may be curable by therapies such as gene modulation in the future” (2018). As a result, one may observe scientists defining the
term from different scientific perspectives by emphasizing some of the facets of drug addiction disease. Statistically, the most prevailed drug usage was observed for cannabis (3,8%) among people from 15 to 64 years old, amphetamines (0,77%), opioids (0,37%), and cocaine (0,35%) (Peacock et al., 1909). Based on this information, it is crucial to admit that drug addiction is a widespread and complex disease that might influence different aspects of individuals’ functioning possibilities.More specifically, drug dependence is an intellectual disease powerfully affected by surroundings and psychosocial factors. The psychosocial environments at which point it has grown provoke numerous debates around the country (Cheron & Kerchove D’Exaerde, 2021). Exposure to analyzed suggestions can be a principal issue in precipitating drug cravings and relapses. Even afterward a successful cure, they should
be minimized accordingly. As with many other mental disorders, drug inclination is deeply influenced by fervor, knowledge, and cognition (Cheron & Kerchove D’Exaerde, 2021). Besides medical interferences, behavioral actions are more promising for acting drug addiction. To some extent, non-pharmacological situations grant permission and have greater benefits by way of their limited aftereffects.Despite the numerous reasons for obtaining drug addiction after drug abuse, there are no specific factors that can conclude if one will enhance compulsive to rugs. Moreover, a blend of determinants influences risk for inclination (Kumar et al., 2019). Changes in the intelligence that support material and emotional reliance on amazing essences are the direct cause of dependence, but those changes do not happen accidentally. As a result, the individual might have a certain factor of
influence that becomes dangerous in case of direct contact. For instance, this might be a close person with strictly negative exposure to the cured individual.When it comes to the main differences between drug addiction and other addiction types, it is critical to understand that they have nearly the same symptoms and short-term effects on the brain but significantly differ in the long-term perspective. More specifically, Lindesmith (4) states that “While alcohol is addicting in approximately, the same sense that heroin is, it will also be referred to only incidentally” (2017). Consequently, cannabis is unlike heroin or morphine addiction, and alcohol is not covered by anti-narcotic legislation, but it shares many features with opiate addiction.As a result, drug addiction campaigns might unintentionally be not focused on lowering the rate
of addicted people in the US. Instead, the substance-addicted become excluded from society, which creates a distinct class of people that are united by the same situation (Cheron & Kerchove D’Exaerde, 2021). Some theoretical applications also provide evidence that drug addiction is usually supported by overall depression, while in other addiction types, such as alcohol or sexual addiction, individuals activate themselves, which may even have some dangerous consequences (Zou et al., 2017). The whole relocation of recreation affecting the mind so as to produce vivid visions entities from people is the pair impractical and hopeless. There has never in record existed a drug-free association, and it is unlikely that skilled always will be individual. In spite of this reality, law enforcement condemning the unenviable task of completing activity
restraining relating to sports drug-use policies that stress frugality.Another important aspect of drug addiction treatment is the correct medication process. In fact, medication might be considered a regular vaccination since it is focused on giving a small dose of the same drug that causes addiction, but in medically calculated amounts so that the body might adapt to the new regime of this drug consumption. For instance, famous psychologist Freud believed that cocaine would manage to help his friend to escape significant addiction to morphine. This attempt was abandoned, and eventually, von Fleischl-Marxov withered from cocaine addiction (Loose, 2018). However, nowadays, most medical professionals in the US are able to correctly calculate the needed dose for a proper medication so that the possibility of receiving the additional drug addiction
is extremely low.Finally, when it comes to treatment possibilities, drug addiction curing depends on the type and scope of the patient’s problems and needs. Research signifies that most compulsive things need not completely three months of treatment to stop their dependence on the illegal substance considerably and that best choice consequences accompany longer durations of the situation (NIDA, 2020). Recovery from drug cravings is an unending process and repeatedly requires diversified adventures of cases. As with additional incessant sicknesses, relapses to dependence on illegal substances can occur and concede the possibility signal a need for the situation expected to be reinstated or regulated. In fact, treatment changes consistently on the type of drug and the traits of the subjects (NIDA, 2020). Matching situation backgrounds, interventions, and aids to
an individual’s particular questions and needs detracts from welcoming or her best benefit in responding to beneficial functioning ancestral, institution, and society.Recovery PlanLogisticsIn the case of group consultation, all the patients will pass both general and specialized treatment processes depending on their physical and psychological health conditions. As one of the main psychological remedies, a group would exercise behavioral therapies that would be prescribed during the first consultation. In fact, treatments with a behavioral focus may address a patient’s motivation to change, provide encouragement for abstinence, enhance skills to resist drug abuse, replace drug-using activities with more constructive and rewarding activities, and improve interpersonal relationships (NIDA, 2020). Nevertheless, patients should primarily receive a medical treatment plan. More specifically, they will receive an individualized list of special drugs that
would help to cure the addiction effects. Gradually, combined with constant help from consultants, patients will disclose the opportunity for psychologists to cure the addiction from a mental health perspective entirely. Some mental diseases might be interconnected with drug addiction. Consequently, medical professionals should be vigilant with patient interaction dynamics and psychological exposure to the treatment process. Finally, participating in peer support programs during and after treatment can assist in maintaining abstinence.When it comes to the individual consulting process, the patient should have a determined medical professional who has a specialization in drug addiction treatment. Primarily, the patient would attend nearly three general consultations where a medical professional would define the key characteristics of actual addiction (Grenfell & Hart, 2018). After that, a person would certainly follow a
prescribed medical course to cure substance addiction physically. Simultaneously, the patient should receive regular medication sessions. More specifically, medications are the main aspect of treatment for many cases, particularly when combined with accompanying advising and different behavioral healings. For example, methadone, buprenorphine, and naltrexone (containing a new long-acting expression) are effective in meal things addicted to dope or added opioids maintain their lives and reduce their illegal dependence on a banned substance (NIDA, 2020). Acamprosate, disulfiram, and naltrexone are drugs approved for curing alcohol abuse. For persons compulsive to nicotine, a nicotine substitute output or oral pill is.Since drug addiction and abuse are considered mental disorders, and they coexist with different mental diseases, many patients who represent multi-disease should be correctly evaluated for the existence of parallel issues.
Finally, the patients should be advised at the end of the course, which is the most significant part of the treatment process since it defines its efficiency. During this consultation, the patient will determine their level of health. In case of normalization, the patient will be prescribed regular drugs that would help to maintain the level of independence. The client will also be consulted at the interval of three days. If needed, the gap might be modified in accordance with the patient’s health conditions.Treatment PlanIn the case of the basic scenario execution, the drug-addicted patient would pass a 70-day general course of treatment which might be divided into three main stages. The general course contains three main sessions at the beginning of each stage and at least seven
supportive sessions that last more than 30 minutes. Firstly, the debut week will be dedicated to actively consulting with the patient and defining the safest and most individualized recovery plan. Secondly, the patient will pass a dynamic 40-day physical and mental treatment process, which includes taking medically prescribed drugs and visiting a professional psychotherapist. After that, the final stage of the treatment would emphasize the development of the patient’s consistent life routine and provide additional consultations with the medical professional, individually attached to the person. In the case of group treatment, patients might experience additional collaboration sessions where all the engaged course members exchange their opinion about the current treatment. These sessions should be added, not interchanged with the general number of sessions.Issues in TreatmentThere are many possible
The article in question addresses the correlation between the duration of a vowel and the type of focus or stress. De Jong and Zawaydeh (2002) address this phonetic issue on the basis of the Arabic language, attempting to observe a potential effect of quantity and voicing duration on the vowel duration and describe this influence. The authors refer to the concept of hyperarticulation that is used to describe transformations in speech style condition by an intention to realize stressed material by more intense articulatory activity. Similar effects have been described by them in the English language, which provided a solid foundation for this subsequent investigation into the patterns of Arabic. De Jong and Zawaydeh (2002) equally rely on prior observations, suggesting a speaker’s ability to create specific phonological
contrasts through hyperarticulation to attract the listener’s attention to a specific segment. Hence, the article in question elaborates on a phonetic phenomenon that has been at the center of academic research for some time.This piece of research aims to explore the relationship between stress, focus, and segmental contrast, resulting in modified vowel durations. At the same time, De Jong and Zawaydeh (2002) acknowledge the fact that the dynamic characteristics of durational lengthening are not universal. The authors refer to a number of previous studies that confirm this information, elaborating that hyperarticulation is more commonly observed within the final portion of a vowel. Nevertheless, most of these previous pieces of research are centered around the trends of the English language. De Jong and Zawaydeh (2002) note that Arabic is
found to possess similar stress characteristics, making it a viable option to verify the central hypothesis. The key research question that is pursued by the authors is whether stress, lexical focus, and segment focus have an observable effect on the quantity and voicing of the speech.The formulation of the research question has determined the selection of the methodology used by the authors. De Jong and Zawaydeh (2002) investigate the phonological phenomenon in question on the basis of a colloquial Arabic dialect. The study utilizes the input of four native Ammani-Jordanian Arabic aged between 17 and 28. The experiment incorporated a two-step design, with unfocused items and lexical focus items followed by a segmental focus. Table 1 of the article describes the target words, reflecting the phonetic similarity between
this study, as it takes the subject matter into a new direction. The course of research is thoroughly document, which supports the validity of the findings, which, however, are only applicable to the discussed setting. The relatively small sample of four participants does not allow for generalized conclusions regarding the entirety of the dialect. Furthermore, the results may be different in the case of other Arabic dialects, which limits the contribution of the findings to the overall understanding of this language’s patterns.
Charles Schwab is a for-profit Corporation whose main business is savings and loans. The company provides banking and asset management services, and financial advisory. It has several subsidiaries – Charles Schwab & Co., Inc., Charles Schwab Investment Management, Inc., TD Ameritrade, Inc., and TD Ameritrade Clearing, Inc., which are all limited liability companies (“The Charles Schwab Corporation,” 2021). This paper aims to analyze the form of business in Charles Schwab Corporation (CSC).Charles Schwab is a corporation, which is a form of business with some distinctive features. Firstly, its officers are agents, unlike its directors and shareholders, which means that the latter are not involved in the company’s current strategic, managerial and other business decisions (“Corporation,” 2022). Secondly, the corporation is managed by the board of directors who have
shareholders.Thus, the form of business in Charles Schwab Corporation was analyzed. The CSC is a corporation with several subsidiaries and conducts business following the requirements for a corporation form of organization. A distinctive feature of corporations is the board of directors, which has an indirect influence on daily decision-making. Still, in critical cases, it can appoint new officers to manage the company. Corporations can also transfer property rights in the event of bankruptcy or other cases.
AbstractThis report starts with stating and discussing the stakeholders in the given case study, the shareholders, Management, and employees, to mention a few. It will also focus on the directions given to Zoe, who is in charge of the organization’s accounting books, to adjust some entries in the book. This report states that those actions by Zoe are not only unethical but also illegal. It further proceeds to point out scenarios where the adjustment of figures in the accounting books can be ethical and legal. The conclusion of this report points out who can quickly discover the adjustment on the accounting books, which is the organization’s auditor.Information Systems ReportA stakeholder is a person in a business entity or an organization who has an interest in the proceeding of
the organization. Stakeholders are directly or indirectly involved in the organization, either running or benefiting from its activities. In the given case study, the stakeholders are the organization’s shareholders, who are the people who have invested their money in the organization and stand to benefit from the organization in terms of dividends due to the sales made by the organization in a year. In our case study, the shareholders will be affected by a decision to change the organization’s profitability since the change directly affects the company’s stock prices. A drop or a rise in stock prices will affect the shareholders directly as their dividends will rise or fall, respectively.The Management of the organization in our case study is also a part of the stakeholders as they are
involved in the decision-making of matters concerning the day-to-day running of the organization. The Management also makes account-related decisions which include adjustments in the accounting books. Finally, secondary stakeholders in the organization are the employees; their daily work enables the company to run smoothly and achieve its goals and expectations. The vendors in this organization are parties in the supply chain that avail goods and services to the final consumers and companies. A vendor is a person or organization that makes the goods available to the consumers and not necessarily the manufacturer. The last category of stakeholders is the lenders. They are individuals or groups, both public and private, who makes funds available to persons or business with the sole expectation that the money will be repaid with
interest hence making a profit through it.In our case study, the president requests Zoe Baas, the controller of the company accounting books, to accrue every possible revenue. To forego as many expenses as possible and preserve the current year’s revenues so that the following year can easily absorb the costs foregone in the current year. In this scenario, the presidents’ requests go against prudent accounting policies. They can be seen as an attempt by the Management to window dress by manipulating the organization’s accounting books entry and posting better profit numbers than the actual ones (Weygandt et al., 2018). Concerning accounting policies, this action is unethical, as well as the acts by Zoe to date the entries in the accounting books to December 31 of the previous year
instead of January 17. These actions are done to adjust the organization’s accounting figures, which inflates its revenue by illegally accruing some of its revenues and deflating its expenses by wrongly delaying some costs. These are wrong, unethical, and illegal since they do not follow the rules and policies of accounting.One of the questions that arise in our case study is whether Zoe is still ethical by deferring the company’s expenses and accruing the company’s revenues. These actions can only be ethical if they are done as provided in the accounting provisions and the GAAP and IFRS framework (Weygandt et al., 2018). Any accruing of the organization’s revenue and differing expenses done in any other way without following the rules will be illegal. An example is when sales
IntroductionThe fashion industry is one of the most dynamic sectors around the globe, and the dynamism arises from the diverse needs of the client base. Fashion is a personal statement and a symbol of societal status that also defines a person’s culture and individuality. As a result, clients are always curious about fashionable pieces that serve several factors while maintaining a particular budget. Although many clothes stores stock a variety of fashionable clothes, they do not capture the clients’ personality and individual needs because the designs are premade. Most stores such as Zara and H&M invest significant funds into identifying the unique needs of their clients. However, their reach in identifying these needs is not yet global, and this implies that a significant section of the target market
their favorite clothing stores. The platform intends to revolutionize the fashion industry by offering clients an opportunity to present their unique designs for customization. Online clothes from stores such as Zara and H&M are made using standard sizes that may not fit all body sizes within the standard measurements. Our online stores’ mandate is to ensure that clients have easy access to thigh-quality fashionable items that can be customized to fit their unique sizes. Therefore, our mandate will include offering the clients an opportunity to submit their sizes to our platform, whereby their clothes can be tailor-made to fit their unique sizes. Our highly skilled team will be on standby to take clients’ measurements and submit them to the famous clothes stores for customization.
Eat Lancet recommendations are developed to integrate healthy eating habits with the practices that minimize the harm to the planet Earth resulting from some foods’ manufacturing or farming approaches. The goal is to ensure that the biodiversity of the planet is preserved while people continue to eat delicious and healthy foods. This paper will examine Lancet’s EAT recommendations, compare this diet to personal eating habits, and discuss whether modifications can be made.My current diet is different from the EAT recommendations provided by Lancet.Firstly, my diet mostly consists of prepackaged or takeout foods, although I add fruits to my daily food intake. However, I do not consume a lot of vegetables, nuts, and legumes, as recommended in the EAT article. Also, EAT recommendations emphasize the need to limit the
consumption of red meat and dairy products, which I typically consume as well (“EAT-Lancet Commission Brief for Everyone”). I am accustomed to having dairy products, especially milk and yogurt, on a daily, and based on the EAT recommendations, and I should limit this consumption to smaller portions.It would be difficult to modify my diet to match the EAT-Lancet recommendations. Mainly, this is because I would need to change my eating habits, meaning I would need to get used to eating and shopping for foods that are different from what I consume daily. Additionally, with the EAT diet, many of the products need to be cooked or prepared; for example, vegetables taste better if they are in a salad, which would require more time for preparation. Currently, I do
not have much free time to dedicate to preparing food, which creates a challenge for me if I want a balanced and environmentally friendly diet. However, I could shop for vegetables that are already slides or buy salads and healthier foods from the places I already order from or shop at, which would make it easier to integrate these products into my diet.One aspect that I can easily modify is my shopping habits since I often tend to buy too many fresh products that I do not eat before they perish, and thus I have to throw these away. According to Lancet, with food, “the amounts wasted or lost have major impacts on human health and environmental sustainability.” Hence, I need to pay more attention to the way
contrast prompts me to change my eating habits and ensure that I only buy the foods I can consume to ensure that there is no waste and harm to the environment. In general, this article has prompted me to rethink my eating habits and my approach to food consumption and to make small modifications that will be helpful both for my health and for the well-being of the environment. In summary, my current diet is very different from the recommendations provided by Lancet, and there are several challenges linked to modifying it to suit these recommendations.
IntroductionWith the contemporary global concerns about sustainable development, the issues of food waste and environmental protection have become more visible and better tackled. With prevalent problems of insufficient nutrition and food insecurity due to the disruption of conventional food consumption traditions, sustainable eating is threatened (Huambachano, 2019). Indeed, human eating habits and the overall culture of food consumption are subject to analysis to identify patterns that might yield an impact (positive or negative) on the environment from both short- and long-term perspectives. Daily practices of consuming food, cooking, grocery shopping, and managing leftovers and waste comprise the whole behavior of individuals in relation to food. They are commonly associated with the environmental worldview that prevails in a person’s overall outlook. Thus, it is relevant to revise and alter
the environmental worldview to revise harmful or unsustainable eating habits by engaging in spiritual practices for better sustainable outcomes. This paper presents a reflective analysis of the author’s eating habit-informed environmental worldview, the health of their connection with nature, and probable spiritual practices to improve sustainable food consumption.Environmental Worldview AnalysisThe analysis of one’s environmental worldview should be based on the observation of practices and behaviors rather than assessed theoretically. In such a manner, the identification of a particular paradigm is more objective and realistic. For that matter, the basis for this analysis is the record of a seven-day eating habit journal that I have completed for the purposes of this project. The information recorder in the food habit spreadsheet allows for categorizing my environmental worldview as stewardship. This
conclusion is validated by the limited waste I produce after each meal, which helps protect the environment from pollution and eliminates the threat of overproduction in the long-term perspective within food systems. Indeed, most days, I did not produce any waste, while on other days, no edible food was thrown away apart from some fries. Moreover, the stewardship environmental worldview entails caring for the planet by managing the consumption of resources. In this regard, my combining of occasional home-cooked meals with ordered food contributes to the balanced consumption of food.In order to conduct a proper analysis of the environmental worldview based on my food consumption patterns, it is relevant to review my attitude from three core perspectives, namely philosophy, religion, and ethics. Within the philosophical continuum, my records
of eating habits indicate that I am more inclined to materialistic philosophy. In particular, the review of the food habit worksheet demonstrates that the majority of my meals are taken when I am alone, with occasionally shared dinners with my family. Moreover, I often order food from fast-food restaurants to obtain food quickly and to my liking without putting in much effort. I do not spend too much money on meals, which validates my materialistic motivation toward food consumption.When tackled from the point of view of religion, my eating habits indicate my alignment with pantheism, which implies the unity of the world and God. As evidenced by my food consumption patterns and the activities associated with them, I do not differentiate between the external world and God. I
do not actively apply religious consideration to the validation of my food habits. However, when eating, I perceive this time-spending as a spiritual practice of connecting my body with the world. From the perspective of ethics, I most closely relate to anthropocentrism. I limit my worries about buying groceries and cooking food or selecting food that is guaranteed to be sustainably produced. Instead, I choose easily accessible food items to satisfy my immediate needs. In addition, I engage in parallel activities, such as watching TV, responding to emails, playing on the phone, and others while eating, which indicates my prioritization of my feelings and satisfaction of my needs.Evaluation of the Relation to NatureAs my food habits imply, my relationship with nature is characterized by distancing and insufficient concern.
In the majority of my meal records, I do not know where the food comes from, where the ingredients for the meals were produced, or what the production methods are. I am not concerned with these issues when I make my daily food choices. The information that I obtain about some of the food items on my menu comes primarily from the official websites of the companies from which I order. It might not be objective and does not provide any indication of the impact of my food choice on nature. Moreover, I am more concerned with the diversity of my diet, which is evident from the different choices I make, although within the limited range of cuisines. Thus, the environmental footprint of my eating habits is not
a priority for me on a daily basis.However, the identified stewardship environmental worldview encourages me to pay more attention to the sustainable use of natural resources when consuming food. In particular, the stewardship environmental worldview implies integrating the knowledge about the consequences of particular production methods for the planet and the reduction of harm through habit improvement. This approach allows for shifting the priority from an egocentric attitude toward eating habits to a more nature-centered one. In such a manner, the choice of places to eat and the items on the menu (or ingredients for home-cooked meals) should be aligned with the maximum benefit for humans and minimum harm to the planet.Spiritual Eating-Related Practices for Healthier Relationship with NatureFirstly, one of the spiritual practices related to my eating
habits might be the initiation of family cooking evenings. There is much information online and on social media on cooking and promoting a healthy and nutritious diet with sustainable food management (Choudhary et al., 2019). Spending time on cooking will allow my family and me to connect, learn, and appreciate the nutritious food cooked ourselves. Moreover, I will have a chance to teach children about sustainable food consumption, thus making my contribution to the longevity of future generations. When selecting recipes and ingredients, I will be aware of the natural resources that are used to produce them and evaluate the threat to the planet. In such a manner, I will unite with nature and raise awareness about ingredients, their origin, nutrients, and health benefits. Moreover, this practice will
help me manage food waste by practicing recipes for leftover-based cooking. Overall, by cooking more often, including some outdoor picnics, I will improve my relations with nature.Secondly, I will transition to a vegetarian diet to eliminate the threats to the environment caused by meat production. Indeed, research suggests that “high meat consumption requires intensive farming and animal husbandry methods, which is particularly unhealthy” (Nemeth et al., 2019, p. 4). Moreover, in terms of spirituality and ethics, the refusal to consume animal-based foods will preserve animal life on the planet and reduce production-related damage to the soil and ecosystems.Thirdly, another important practice that might improve my relationship with nature is buying groceries from farmers with a proper guarantee of the production of food items using sustainable production methods. The
allows for a certain degree of unawareness about sustainability issues with limited harm to nature. The limited waste I produce, partial concern about the place and practices of ingredient production I exhibit, and my use of both home-cooked and ordered food validate the selection of the environmental worldview. Within this perspective, my relations with nature are inconsistent and characterized by limited knowledge and limited contribution to environmental protection and sustainability issues despite the lack of harm to nature on my side. To improve my relationship with nature, I will use such spiritual practices as family cooking evenings, transitioning to a vegetarian diet, and buying from farmers with obtaining information about sustainable production methods.
The emergence of new infectious diseases such as the Ebola virus has always put pressure on the health care systems resulting in high fatality rates. This disease is contagious and whose transmission depends on the interaction between the human host and an agent (CDC, 2021). This virus is classified in the filioviridae family and is responsible for destroying the blood clotting cells and weakening the immune system when someone is infected. Ebola was a contagious epidemic that affected many nations, including the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC), Sierra Leone, Gabon, and Italy (CDC, 2021). Therefore, Ebola’s pathophysiology, its negative impact on the community and remediation are elaborated.Analysis of the Ebola Virus DiseaseEbola is a deadly disease that exhibits symptoms such as fever, body aches, diarrhea, external and internal
bleeding. The infection is transmissible through direct contact with body fluids such as saliva, sweat, and blood. The virus was traced in the Ebola River in DRC after natives consumed the African fruit bat, which was identified as a reservoir for the virus (CDC, 2021). Considering the fact that the disease is contagious, it spread rapidly to other nations in that year, such as England and later on to Cote D’Ivoire, Senegal, Mali and Nigeria. This data indicates that this outbreak was a global pandemic that put pressure on the health system.Various epidemiological and risk factors contributed to the spread of this virus. Among them was a lack of preparedness to counter an emergency and public health literacy on the best preventative measures. When Ebola hit the DRC,
the country was underdeveloped and lacked the specialized equipment and infrastructure to contain the spread of infection (CDC, 2021). For instance, the traditional prevention method such as holistic care was practiced, making the tracing process impossible. For example, during the initial outbreak of the virus, nurses in one of the hospitals known as Yambuku mission hospital reused needles when the numbers of infected people kept surging due to a lack of equipment to contain its spread (CDC, 2021). Additionally, the treatment, management and evidence-based interventions to maintain safety were unknown.Public health literacy was also a significant challenge considering that citizens did not know the transmission channels and were overly exposed to the transmitters. For example, even after the fatality rate increased, people still hunted for wild meat for
consumption and fulfilled cultural ceremonies and rituals (CDC, 2021). This interaction still exposed them to the infection resulting in more deaths and infections. In addition, cultural practices such as burials exposed the people to the virus since many bathed their dead by hand and dressed them for burial without putting on protective clothes (CDC, 2021). The international health organizations quickly disregarded such practices, but the new measures were not observed.Ebola virus disease’s transmission route was the African fruit bat which carried the host, and when consumed, it caused the infection. Another transmission channel was the dead infected animal corpse which exposed the people to the virus when they came into contact with secretions, body fluids, and organs (CDC, 2021). Humans also transmitted the disease through direct contact with
the infected persons’ blood, saliva, and mucous membrane.The consequences of this infection on the community were detrimental, considering it deteriorated the people’s social, economic, and psychological wellness. When the infection rate became uncontrollable, many businesses closed down, and inflation became the new norm. In addition, most families could not fend for themselves, considering the majority of them lived below the poverty line (CDC, 2021). Such factors contributed to high rates of game meat hunting for survival, which worsened the situation. Another factor was a stigma for survivors who joined back after recovery since they were isolated and discriminated against as they were considered agents of transmission.This negative stereotype affected mental wellness since many people became depressed for being isolated by the community. Additionally, the surge in the rate
operational, indicating that it is accessible to everyone. Other prevention strategies include public health literacy educating natives on the transmission channels, the symptoms, signs and possible interventions to ensure they seek help at the early stages of infection (CDC, 2021). Additionally, encouraging better health practices such as avoiding consumption of game meat, washing hands regularly, avoiding contact with infected individuals and places may help reduce future outbreaks (CDC, 2021). The government should also invest in personal protective equipment to help protect healthcare workers from infections when such pandemics occur. These interventions will ensure that people know the basics of maintaining safety to curb the spread during an outbreak.
The editing in the first episode of the series Money Heist is in line with its thrilling plot and rapid action. In the first scene, as the character gets ready to exit her vehicle, the editing is quick, focusing on the items she is picking up. Similarly, the camera often focuses on objects, leading the viewer towards the items that will become an essential part of the narrative. For example, one can see the ringing phone before it is picked up. Moreover, the show uses rapid editing with close-ups and the use of objects that identify characters – guns, money, and other items that show one’s motives or their identifying trait.The characters’ close-ups are dynamic, often using dolly shots to slowly expose the background or move with the
Notably, the character in a close-up is rarely placed in the center of the screen. The shot is divided into thirds vertically – and the characters stay in the first or third part.Hand-held shots are also used, and they are consistent with scenes where characters feel insecure, aggressive, scared, or exposed. Moreover, when the characters are walking, the camera moves at the same speed. The change between steady dolly movements and hand-held “shaky” shots is needed to juxtapose moments focused on action and interpersonal drama. Moreover, tension is the primary source of emotion, and the editing keeps enough suspense by using close-ups of characters rather than an overview of the whole room.
Electric cars have only recently begun to compete with the internal combustion engine, but they have been actively used by drivers for more than a century. These cars were especially popular at the turn of the 20th century but lost their popularity when Ford’s moving assembly line increased the availability of passenger cars (Simpson 2021). The use of electric vehicles has several advantages, including their environmental friendliness, service cost, and interesting history of the emergence of exciting technology.The structure of an electric car is not inferior to ordinary passenger cars and may even be considered safer than the usual models. The main structural elements of an electric vehicle are battery, electric motor, transmission, on-board charger, inverter, DC converter, and electronic control system. The device of an electric car
implies the absence of a clutch and gearbox, which is why they accelerate more smoothly and climb the slope easier (Magnusson 2017). Such a car does not contain engine oil and spark plugs, which reduces maintenance costs. Electric cars also don’t make much noise, drive quietly, and don’t produce noise pollution. The engine also consumes no energy when the vehicle is stationary. The transmission of an electric car is quite simple. Thanks to the onboard charger, the vehicle can be charged from the household electrical network. Thus, a simple and understandable car device can serve as one of the reasons for their ubiquity.Climate scientists claim the electrification of vehicles is one of the best ways to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. Fully electric cars move with the help of
a large electric battery and do not produce exhaust gases. Electric vehicles are becoming more eco-friendly over time, despite the more intensive battery manufacturing process. Common gas-powered cars are the least climate-friendly option, as long-term costs and emissions cover a wide range. It reduces the risk of death from an accident and from the effect of exhaust gases on a person’s lungs. According to Dr. Tranchik’s estimates, the production emissions of electric vehicles will be compensated for six months, depending on the cleanness of the power system in which the car is charged.Electric cars enjoy less popularity than gas-powered vehicles due to their higher initial cost. The battery capacity price should also be considered since a car that can last longer on its charge will cost more. Nevertheless,
cars by 2025. A similar policy is followed by New Zealand, which is concerned about the state of the environment. The dissemination of such research would help reduce the financial costs of using cars.The spread of electric vehicles requires infrastructure development and increased accessibility. Despite the fact that electric cars are already becoming more common on the roads, only some countries are close to their widespread use. Nevertheless, electric machines will be an excellent replacement for traditional gas and will improve the situation of the environment.
Darwin’s evolution theory of natural selection explains how different organisms came to being and how others got extinct. In the theory, evolution occurred from one generation to another as they inherited physical and behavioral traits that allowed them to thrive in rapidly changing environments. This theory starts by indicating that in the olden days, there existed organisms with opposing traits i.e., either strong or weak traits. Geological and other environmental changes impacted the need for the survival of the species. As a result, the organisms with stronger particular traits would remain alive and end up passing the traits to their next generations as they breed. The organisms with weaker traits would get wiped out naturally resulting in the extinction of their generation (Flew 28). Darwin’s theory of evolution
was fundamental in discussing the unique occurrences and developments in human sciences. The theory in itself explains genetics despite the lack of its knowledge at the time of its formation.When relating the theory to the concept of human, life and the science surrounding it, it is clear to note how humans have made significant advancements in science with the intent of developing their world, remaining dominant, and understanding every concept of life to keep them ahead of anything that may want to wipe them out of the face of the world. Understanding the working of the human brain gives a clear indication of how the brain is so developed as compared to other organisms and why humans remain superior to other organisms. This explains why in every century,
new developments are made and new scientific studies are identified giving a difference to the world.Scientific Questions Supporting Connection of Darwin’s Theory and Human SciencesOne of the scientific questions is the origin of life and the extinction of some species. This question is used to identify the origin of humanity and the variation in the organisms that exist now to those that existed in the earlier centuries e.g., mammoths. It also tries to find out of humanity will last or we are also likely to go extinct. Through the process of obtaining answers, one can understand how evolution has contributed to changes in the life of different organisms as well as humans and how humans have gone to a great extent to dig deeper into the existence and
development at different ages and among different individuals).Proof of the Existence of A Link Between Science and SocietyThe videos indicate how information grew from one century to another and was built on the inventions of key researchers and enthusiasts. All the information was used as guiding principles in the different scientific fields and new information was added to the existing data. The changes observed from one century to another are majorly contributed by scientific advancement. Countries such as Britain that took science seriously rapidly advanced and adapted to the rapidly changing environments as compared to other countries and this is an indicator of the link of science and the society.
The organizational task entrusted with developing a structure within the population to decrease exposure to risks and cope with catastrophes is known as emergency management. Regular training, simulations, equipment evaluation, and community coordination in a crisis are essential aspects of emergency preparedness (Oliver et al., 2015). Forest fires, tremors, hurricanes, accidents, bombings, dangerous chemicals events, snowstorms, and flooding are just a few of the typical calamities that come under emergency management (Oliver et al., 2015). Mitigation, readiness, reaction, and restoration are the four primary stages in the above framework (Oliver et al., 2015). During the mitigation phase, management ensures that quick action is taken to resolve concerns before a significant tragedy (Oliver et al., 2015). This is an essential step since it aids society in minimizing human as
well as financial costs.In order to respond to a crisis in the quickest period feasible, the preparation stage encompasses planning, administering, coordinating, training, equipping, regulating, evaluating, and improving operations. As a result, the reaction stage entails organizing all relevant emergency services as well as planning for first responders (Oliver et al., 2015). It is crucial to determine the resources required and how to deploy them efficiently at this step. The population will attempt to rehabilitate the impacted region during the recovery period.Emergency Management and its DevelopmentA Congress Legislation was enacted in order to offer monetary support to a municipality in New Hampshire after a wild fire had decimated the area. Thus, the legislation mentioned above was signed into law in 1803, marking the first time the federal government
intervened to assist victims of a local disaster (Huang et al., 2021). During 1930s, the government authorized Reconstruction Finance Corporation, as well as the Bureau of Public Roads, so as to offer emergency credits for the maintenance as well as restoration of specific community amenities (Huang et al., 2021). Around this period, Tennessee Valley Authority (TVA) came into existence in order to generate hydroelectricity and, as a supplement, to diminish flooding within the district. Congress approved an essential piece of disaster management law at that time. The Army Corps of Engineers were granted more power so as to design as well as develop all flood control ventures in the United States by the relevant authorities (Huang et al., 2021). As a result, the incidents above served as a
Equine influenza is a respiratory disease that is highly contagious to horses and other animals in the horse family. It is caused by numerous influenza subtypes, a virus comparable to but distinct from influenza viruses seen in other animals. Contact with sick horses and infected clothing, equipment, brushes, gear, and so on transmits the virus swiftly. When the illness strikes horses, it is known to cause considerable losses. Horses may not display the corresponding signs when affected by the disease. However, it is possible to prevent the spread of the virus by vaccinating the horses, treating the sick horses, and using any other preventive measure. The essay will discuss the effects, ways of transmission, and how to treat and prevent equine influenza.Horses are affected by two varieties of
influenza viruses that steadily circulate and produce seasonal flu waves, influenza A and influenza B with two varieties of influenza viruses that steadily circulate and produce seasonal flu waves, influenza A and influenza B. Influenza stresses the letters H and N are used to categorize viruses. Letters H and N stand for hemagglutinin and neuraminidase, correspondingly. These are both proteins on the worm’s external that help in the virus’s raid of cells (Oladunni et al., 1657). Occasionally the bacteria exchange genetic data, acquiring original traits that human immune mechanisms have never seen before.Equine fever is a viral infectious respiratory illness that spreads quickly among horses and has a short incubation period (1-3 days). It is transmitted by diseased horses coughing, filthy buckets, brushes, gear, and so on. Coughing
horses volatilize the organism, which may spread the virus up to 150 feet and infect an entire barn in a matter of minutes (Blanco-Lobo et al., 933). Infectious horses may shed influenza for 14 days after being infected.Finally, many horses are symptomless virus shedders, which means they are resistant and will not become sick; however, the virus may still multiply and transfer to other horses.Because equine influenza respiratory indicators are comparable to other respiratory disorders, they cannot solely identify illness on clinical signs. The testing window is limited; the findings may be harmful if samples are analyzed very late in the disease’s progression. Diagnostic testing facilities isolate viruses mostly from nose swab samples acquired from ill horses shortly after infection. Serum sample testing can also be used to
influenza (Sacket al., 1185). Effective biosecurity strategies, methods to decrease pathogen spreading, and understanding of sickness symptoms are necessary safety precautions.Finally, Equine influenza may infect both horses and humans. It is easily spread through direct contact with sick horses and can swiftly infect a significant number of horses in a single grazing area. Familiarize oneself with the approved indications of equine influenza and keep an eye out for them over the winter season. If you believe that you have the flu, have your veterinarian take suitable samples and submit them to a specialist laboratory for examination. Adequate measures and improved knowledge will help to keep this highly contagious respiratory ailment at bay.
In the modern world, the nurse’s role is changing dramatically: From being a resident assistant to the treating physician, the registered nurse (RN) is becoming the critical link in the clinic. RNs help provide a continuum of communication between patients, their families, and medical staff, which means that treatment and recovery outcomes depend on the effectiveness of their work. Given the structural changes in the professional role of the registered nurse, I could not help but take an interest in this field. Thus, my career goal is to pursue a bachelor’s degree in nursing as the first step to becoming a professional nurse.Nursing has become particularly important in recent years and became especially important to the clinical system during the COVID-19 pandemic. By now, there are over 4.2
million registered nurses in the United States (USAHS). This large number represents about 1.3 percent of the nation’s total population, which means about one in 100 Americans is a registered nurse. This data shows how critical this role is to society, as a large number of people from various states would not choose the profession if it were not in demand. The Rafferty study indicates that “nurses can realise their potential as change agents in building a better future for health care” (Rafferty 475). Additionally, USAHS reports that the number of male nurses has tripled over the past 50 years, which also reflects a positive trend in this professional role and rapid removal of stigma.There has historically been a bias against nurses regarding their importance. Although the nurse’s
role is not controversial for patients who frequently encounter clinics and other stakeholders, healthy people can provoke stigma toward such staff. This prejudice has nothing to do with the current level of medical development since the nurse has long since ceased to be an adjunct to the physician but has been given a separate role, a theoretical foundation, and new functions. Opportunities for continual growth and helping sick people are features of today’s RNs that appeal to my career choice. Thus, my altruistic nature and desire to overcome stigma motivate me to continue my BSN training.Since my chosen career is feasible, I have to think about the organizational details of professional development. I have to spend at least four years to get my BSN, which is the standard
I have set for myself in terms of career advancement. However, once I receive my BSN, I have no plans to graduate, as I want to advance my knowledge continually. Professional development requires careful academic work on myself, but in addition, I will also need to save up some money. To put it another way, in the next four years, I plan to work hard on my education in order to fulfill my personal career goal.
Environmental sustainability refers to the point where renewable resource harvesting rate should not surpass that of regeneration and that the decline of non-renewable resources should require the same growth of renewable alternatives. The utilization of natural resources has increased significantly over the past few decades. Environmental sustainability is essential for the preservation of resources by the global community for the future generation (Ostad-Ali et al.). This entails the lowering of economic impacts that might be unfavorable to the environment, as well as designing a business that reduces the use of carbon. The production of cheap and clean energy that is available for all is the primary objective of sustainable development. In her article “The Obligation to Endure,” Carson warns the public about the consequences of modern industrial pollution.
Since environmental climate became adverse due to rising economic stability, variants of achieving environmental sustainability emerged, namely human contribution to the ecosystem by removing harmful substances from agriculture and the use of rainwater harvesting systems.The environmental climate has changed from being conducive to causing many adverse effects on the ecosystems. Manufacturing, which is commonly considered to be continuous development in different types of industries, tends to affect the environment in various ways, which results to change in the atmospheric climatic conditions. These, in turn, affect agriculture; for example, in the regions with manufacturing factories, “the farmers complained that they were unable to raise any pigs” (Carson 123). Both the manufacturing and processing sectors rely on the environment to attain their raw materials. Industries such as the papermaking industries
depend on trees as a source of raw material for their products (Oláh et al.). Consequently, it causes a tremendous decline in the number of trees available globally, and the trees are viewed to be of significance towards the reduction of the amount of carbon dioxide available in the atmosphere. Moreover, the attempts to return the trees and plants are unsuccessful, and their result is “animals have almost invariably gone along with the plants” (Carson 128). Subsequently, there will be developments of harsh environment and climatic change such as heavy rainfall and drought.The rate of development has increased within various countries to establish a stable economic background. It enables the creation of employment opportunities for individuals, which encourages capitalism to establish firms in various sectors of the globe.
The industries mostly dispose of their waste products into large water bodies. Consequently, it results in the existence of chemicals and other metals, which causes tremendous effects on marine creatures. The accumulation of chemicals in the oceans results in oceanic acidification, thus, making the sea inhabitable to marine animals. Yet, “future generations are unlikely to condone our lack of prudent concern for the integrity of the natural world that supports all life” (Carson 129). Hence, humans should develop some solutions for this problem to preserve economic stability and ecological integrity.One of the approaches in achieving environmental sustainability is by viewing people as a part of the ecosystem, which does not only use natural resources but contributes to the system. For instance, nitrogen is essential for the growth of
many crops, and many farmers use nitrogen fertilizer on their farms. Yet, Carson argues that “chemical insecticides must never be used” (129). This is due to the fact that the use of nitrogen fertilizer does not fit into an environmentally safe zone (Oláh et al.). Sustainable agriculture entails a system dedicated to seeking the sustenance of farmers and resources through promoting economically viable and environmentally sound farming practices. When farmers spread nitrogen fertilizers on their farms, some is washed into water bodies and fed on by bacteria. After the bacteria feeds on the nitrogen, they emit nitrous oxide into the atmosphere (Oláh et al.). The gas has global warming latent almost three hundred times that of carbon dioxide. There have been many attempts to control nitrogen fertilizers’ contribution
to global warming; however, it has not been a simple task. The rate of application of nitrogen in farming determines the amount of nitrous oxide released into the atmosphere. Therefore, to reduce the rate of nitrous oxide production, farmers must minimize the number of nitrogen fertilizers they apply to their farms. Unfortunately, not many farmers are willing to do this as it would reduce their profits.Another example of human integration into the local ecosystem can be seen in the Rajasthan rainwater harvesting system. The farmers managed to provide irrigation for the crops across the year by building small earthen dams called Johads. Those dams captured rainwater, which soaked into the aquifer and, therefore, was saved from evaporating (Singh and Bhakar). With the introduction of drill technology, people started
The Supreme Court ruled that Static Control’s claim of violation of the Lanham Act clause falsifying advertisement was valid. The underlying issue in the case was that the Supreme Court had to determine the meaning of the provision by applying the traditional principles of interpreting the statute (Campbell, 2020). The second issue is that labeling the claim by Static Control as a prudential standing question was misleading (Halbert & Ingulli, 2020). Lexmark bases the arguments on the prudential standing of Associated General Contractors. However, the case has strong grounds on statutory provisions that the Supreme Court had to ascertain in terms of statutory interpretation.The causes of the statute violations damage the plaintiff’s reputation since they fall within the zone of interest covered by the statute. The Supreme Court
Ethics is an indispensable component of the criminal justice system. That is because ethics is needed to define a criminal act and determine a proper punishment, and guide decisions and actions of judges, juries, police officers, and lawyers. More precisely, strict adherence to the principles of ethics ensures impartiality and protection of the rights of victims and criminals. The present essay addresses the issue of public corruption from individual, organizational, and societal perspectives.The concept of public corruption refers to the misuse of power by a public official to gain some personal benefits. The theory of ethical formalism that is represented in the works of Immanuel Kant and John Rawls argues that “the only thing truly good is goodwill, and that what is good is that which conforms to
the categorical imperative” (Pollock, 2018, p. 33). A categorical imperative, in its turn, could be understood as a rule of conduct that is ethically and morally right and obligatory with no exceptions. From this, it could be inferred that public corruption results from the breach of laws or rules that all members of a society should follow.Public corruption could be explained on individual, societal, and organizational levels. According to Pollock (2018), the most popular explanation of public corruption conducted by an individual police officer is the rotten-apple argument. This argument defends the position that an officer who misconducted is deviant and “it was simply a mistake to hire him or her” (Pollock, 2018). Gorsira et al. (2018) study reveal that public officials moral conviction on whether they should
refrain from corruption makes them more or less inclined to abuse power. When criminologists investigate cases of public corruption, they might use the individual explanation to claim that a police officer or a public official committed a crime since he or she has low self-control, poor education, a high sense of entitlement, or is cynical (Pollock, 2018). Therefore, the essence of individual explanation is that the society and an organization where a corrupted employee works are unrelated to the crime committed.An individual explanation of a case of corruption can be found in Luc Besson’s movie Leon: The professional . The entire story between Leon, the killer, and a 12-years-old girl Mathilda starts with the death of her family. Mathilda’s parents and siblings were killed by the corrupt agents
of the Drug Enforcement Administration with which her father cooperated. The police officers were interested in gaining benefits from selling the drugs by accessing them via Mathilda’s father. This way, from the perspective of individual explanations of public corruption, the officers misconducted because they wanted to retrieve personal benefits from the situation.The organizational explanation of public corruption argues that a person committed wrongdoing because of the micro-climate within his or her organization that contradicts the principles of ethics. As Pollock (2018) puts it, it is common for small workgroups to develop a culture that contradicts ethical norms and provokes corrupted behavior. In addition to that, organizational culture per se, both formal and informal, could cause corruption (Pollock, 2018). For instance, officers might not be trained to successfully detect
ethical dilemmas and solve them.Another feature that could cause public corruption on the organizational level is mistrust between employees and a lack of understanding and cooperation in a team. Pollock (2018) cites a study conducted by Elizabeth Reuss-Ianni on the issue of public corruption. The author has discovered that in the 1970s, in New York, there were tense relations between street cops and management cops (Pollock, 2018). The subculture of street cops was based on the fact that they cherished loyalties and commitments more than laws (Pollock, 2018). Hence, even though a decision to commit an act of corruption could be made only by an individual, the culture and climate within his or her organization could affect this decision.An organizational explanation of public corruption could be found in
Stephen King’s novel The Green Mile which was later filmed by Ferenc Darabont. Overall, The Green Mile is a story about prison wardens who had no chance to prevent the death penalty of John Coffey even though they knew that he was innocent. This novel contains numerous ethical dilemmas and is an excellent food for thought. One of the examples of public corruption conducted by the wardens is when they brought the prisoner, John Coffey, into the house of their boss, Hal Moores. They committed this act to help the boss and his wife, who was dying of cancer since Coffey had the gift of healing people. Even though it is strictly forbidden for wardens to take prisoners out of jail, three wardens cooperated and implemented their risky
plan since they had a culture of respecting and protecting each other. From this, it could be inferred that the prison wardens of block E committed public corruption not because they were flawed but because of their small group’s internal culture.The societal explanation of public corruption is that society, its norms, standards, and rules, made corruption possible. The fundamental idea behind societal explanations of public corruption is that it happens due to “lax community standards over certain types of behavior (gambling, prostitution) and lack of support from prosecutors and the courts” (Pollock, 2018, p. 201). Society makes corruption possible because “we want the police to enforce the law unless they enforce it against us” (Pollock, 2018, p. 201). Indeed, under such circumstances, it is hard to avoid corruption
because some officers might say that it was rational not to pay attention to the law violations of certain individuals.The case of corruption provoked by society could be observed in the documentary film The Seven Five, directed by Tiller Russell. This film tells the story of the former police officer, Michael Dowd, who controlled local drug dealers for ten years. Without a doubt, it is impossible to deny that this is the factor of Dowd’s personality that made him take money from the criminals. At the same time, Dowd noticed a crack pandemic in New York, and, thus, he realized that local people could tolerate drug dealers. Hence, to some extent, society forced Dowd to take bribes from drug dealers.Fortunately, there are ways to eliminate or, at least,
Marketing is one of the most critical aspects of every business, which makes organizations look for effective ways to attract new customers. However, not all marketing activities are fair or ethical, and targeting uninformed consumers is among them. One should explain that uninformed consumers are individuals who lack the psychological or mental maturity to make reasonable decisions and purchases. Examples of these people are children, the elderly, and individuals with psychological conditions. Consequently, it is unethical to target such consumers because this practice can provide these people with adverse outcomes.Many factors explain why it is unethical to target uninformed consumers. The first robust argument comes from the definition presented above. Since these people do not have psychological or mental maturity, target marketing can force them to purchase unneeded
vulnerable populations, meaning that they deserve a specific attitude. That is why it is unethical to target uninformed customers.In conclusion, the essay has presented robust arguments of why organizations should refrain from targeting children, the elderly, and people with mental conditions. Even though some people and businesses stipulate that these populations are suitable for marketing, it is better to avoid them. The rationale behind this statement is that uninformed consumers do not have psychological maturity, meaning that target marketing can force them to make unreasonable decisions and purchases.
The European powers had taken major parts of the world, including the Caribbean. In the 15 th century, the Europeans claimed the region following the establishment of Spanish settlements and conquest of the Aztec and Inca empires (Horne, 2018). Due to the conquest, it was easy for the Spanish to invade Mexico and Peru through exploration in strategic points of the Caribbean region. Following the Spanish invasion of the Caribbean in the 17th century, other European powers such as the British and French started settling in pivotal points such as the island of Tortuga and later moved to Jamaica (Horne, 2018). By mid-century, many non-Hispanic privateers had established permanent colonies and trading zones in Caribbean islands.The profitability in terms of wealth enabled rise of conquest to Caribbean region.
IntroductionBack to the Future is a unique film of its time, which has become a cult film thanks to its gripping plot and attention to detail. Screenwriter Robert Zemeckis created a movie about travel, pitting opposing personalities against each other who later became perfect partners.Thesis: Robert Zemeckis created an award-winning film that changed views on cause and effect and interactions through plot structure, character development, and setting.Body Paragraphs  * The plot structure of Back to the Future keeps the viewer interested in the film through logical cause-and-effect relationships.      + Each moment in the film is connected to the last moment and the next, weaving them into a unified structure.      + The scene begins with a ticking clock,
then shifts to the theft of the plutonium and a focus on Marty, who is unaware of what was stolen under his bed.      + Marty ignores the safety of the clock tower, but later it turns out that he was around when the tower stopped.  * Character development in the story is built on the opposites of Marty and Doc, who elusively turn out to be people with similar histories.      + Marty is relatively quick and restless, though Doc seems judicious and prone to over-analyzing the situation: together, their work is coherent and efficient.      + Marty uses teenage slang while Doc uses proper speech: their different characters allow them to see the
with characters from different eras.      + The differences in road construction quickly determine the time difference: in the ’50s, some were dirt roads.      + The film revisits the clock tower, which was in operation in the ’50s and stopped in the ’80s.ConclusionBack to the Future reveals to the viewer a new reality in which everything is interconnected: logical connections, people, and places. Zemeckis has created a unique story that amazes audiences with its details, developments, and shifting eras.
The topic of the project in question addresses the implications evidence-based practice (EBP) training among nurses can have on the scope of patient satisfaction with health care services. Essentially, the project seeks to meet five major objectives that tackle both the nurses’ and patients’ well-being in the hospital setting:  * The first objective of the project is to explore how nurses’ level of EBP knowledge and implementation affects the quality of services they provide to the patients. Since studies demonstrate that EBP implementation in the workplace contributes positively to the nurses’ sense of personal achievement, it is reasonable to assume that such an improvement will affect their motivation to perform work due diligence (Rodríguez-Nogueira et al., 2021). Hence, this project will help clinical specialists to explore the
peculiarities of this connection.  * The second objective of the project is to improve the overall level of EBP knowledge and implementation among nurses in general hospitals. Even if the intervention of the project does not present the expected results in terms of correlation between patient satisfaction and EBP training, the latter is still an asset for the clinical setting. Indeed, the EBP implementation remains one of the objectives for many general hospitals.  * The third objective is to explore the connection between the EBP training programs and nurses’ job satisfaction. Job satisfaction and motivation are some of the pillars of meaningful and efficient nursing practice and community outreach. For this reason, this project seeks to identify the extent to which improving nurses’ level of expertise
and self-awareness contributes to their mental well-being and dedication to the job.  * The fourth objective of the project is to develop and practice a comprehensive and time-efficient EBP introductory training for the nurses in general hospitals. One of the many reasons behind the lack of EBP implementation in the workplace is the nurses’ inability to find enough time for research and analysis. Thus, by presenting a three-day training program that takes nearly six hours to complete, the project may present insight into the patterns of meaningful EBP training in a busy hospital setting.  * The final objective of the project is to collect exhaustive feedback on the matter of patients’ satisfaction with the services provided by the nurses. Quality health care is one of the
The study showed that bibliometric analysis of evidence gathered from integrative reviews and analytical studies had substantial implications for nurse-related and evidence based policy changes. Primarily, this is possible through the use of integrative reviews in designing new programs (Benton et al., 2020). The collective database of the synthesized studies as suggested by the authors of the study, can be utilized by nurses to be empowered through evidence-based materials in the formulation of changes in universal health coverage. As such, the applicability of this information has a number of benefits for working nurses, as they will be able to employ concise and trusted resources when advocating or implementing changes to policy. I think that nursing practice can be vastly improved with the use of well-managed databases that employ
the lederly, emergency care, and more.Currently, accessibility to extensive and complete information that is formed through evidence-based research is limited due to a number of factors. In order to better provide such informative materials among working nurses it is essential to reduce bureaucratic processes and integrate technology into the process. Modern technology allows for low-cost and time-saving methods of information sharing, which will be largely beneficial for nursing. As mentioned prior, evidence-based research has the potential to reveal gaps in information in nurse-specific practices that would otherwise be unseen. I believe it is essential to make such knowledge accesibile and cohesive to promote better nursing care and work quality.
Early positioning and image problems encountered by Stella Artois in the UK market can be used as prominent examples of contradiction between the sale price and advertisement campaign. Although the brand was intended to be an expensive premium product, combining the high percentage of alcohol and lowering the cost created an impression that this product was designed for mainstream use. Considering that other reputable brands tended to diminish alcohol content and increase the prices, in comparison to them, Stella Artois gained a low-quality reputation. In this regard, it can be concluded that it is essential to analyze the entry market and potential competitors, examining the customers’ expectations and evaluating whether product differences might prompt the emergence of unexpected impressions.The market development model is an excellent guide for industry
growth, which allows for increasing the sales of beer. Considering the audience’s characteristics and the product’s attributes, following the suggested advice for the current maturity level might offer relevant insights into the elevation of category volume and brand sales. For instance, remaining aware of the customers’ preferred method of beer consumption can aid in understanding the market segment and providing the exact product that the target population expects to receive. In addition, it becomes possible to avoid failures connected to the presentation of irrelevant beer segments and product categories. Furthermore, as different social groups begin to consume beer, the brand can be adapted to fit their requirements, establishing new segments, promoting consumption changes, and compelling the market development to advance to the next level.From my perspective, the complication
in the launch of the brand in Mexico can be connected to the availability of the Water.org campaign. As this proposition was only available in particular countries, which excluded Mexico, it is possible to suggest that the customers were not interested in receiving the marketed promotion. Furthermore, it is possible that the characteristics of the campaign contributed to the failure, as customers were expecting different positioning for a new product, which openly addressed a serious issue rather than promoting its qualities. Considering that tremendous amounts of water are used for brewing beer, marketing water access through beer consumption could have resonated with the consumers, creating a negative disposition towards the brand.Introducing Stella Artois into the South African market included several considerable advantages for the company. Given that the
a highly prominent water complication as a marketing tool. Furthermore, South Africa remained at the first level of market maturity, meaning that introducing a premium brand contradicted the customers’ expectations.From my perspective, it would be essential to shift the focus on the additional access to water, attempting to mitigate the ethical conflict between water access and beer promotion. Furthermore, changing the usual approach could be highly beneficial for the South Africa campaign, as it would allow presenting the Stella Artois beer as suitable for bar consumption rather than a high-priced premium brand. In the future, as the audience becomes more familiar with the product, it would be possible to expand the span of the marketing campaign.
The paper contains a raft of expressions by 19 th and early 20th-century artists whereby they conveyed what was in their hearts rather than the reality of their art. On that note, expressionism is conveyed through intense feelings through the works done by paintings or sculptures. That period was characterized by treasuring of emotionalism in artworks, such as the romanticism period, which was characterized by drawings that represented the intimate aspects of human beings (Arnason & Mansfield, 2012). The spread of secularism widely in the regions of Germany and Austria.Several artworks in the chapter help the reader understand the extent to which artists would convey emotions. For example, The Lion Hunt by Delacroix shows the violence and robustness in society as depicted in the art (Arnason & Mansfield,
2012). Additionally, Munch’s The Scream reveals expressionism as the artist conveys the theme of desperation and alienation in society. Also, fierce expressionism was popular due to the representation of women’s sexuality, such as Nude Girl by Lovis Corinth in 1886, as shown in Figure 1 (Arnason & Mansfield, 2012). Thus, through the chapter, a reader can gain knowledge and interpretation of expressionism in arts.Figure 1: Nude Girl by Lovis Corinth in 1886There was a revolution in art in the early 20 th century, where young painters took a new turn in art. Painting groups creation of what was known as Die Brucke or ‘The Bridge’ association that was used to link all fermenting elements in art (Arnason & Mansfield, 2012). Some of the painters in the association, such
as Ludwing Kirchner, articulated other essentials of expressionism, such as empathy and the change of the new world. As shown in Figure 2 below, Kirchner drew Girl Franzi, who later became a model in the Brucke group.Figure 2: Seated Girl by Ludwing Kirchner in 1910In Germany and Austria, artists then began to make sculptures that showed the industrial revolution in the world and the spiritual culture that was practiced by communities. For example, Vasily Kandinsky drew Composition VII, which portrayed the boats in seemingly stormy waters, thus, representing biblical flood as shown in Figure 3 below (Arnason & Mansfield, 2012). The style started spreading widely, giving religion a chance to be embodied in art. Other artists, such as Gabriele Munter, started doing paintings that gave an element of
Sterile products for patient care are dependent on the effectiveness of sterilization and the unit design. Central processing aims to process medical and surgical equipment in an organized manner. They are also designed to safeguard patients from infection while reducing hazards to employees and keeping the value of the objects being recycled. Sterile processing facilities differ in size and complexity from huge, very sophisticated production settings that reprocess dozens of instrument combinations and devices to small, specialized facilities that reprocess a restricted quantity and variety of instruments (Swanson 245). In certain instances, sterile processing may occur wholly from where the equipment is used; alternatively, tiny remote clean production plants may be integrated within or next to a surgical suite’s semi-restricted zone. Irrespective of the location or kind of
reprocessing treatments performed in these areas, the fundamental operational principles and workflow remains the same.If someone is contemplating the construction of their ideal kitchen, design is sure to play a significant influence. Perhaps this means positioning the dishwasher adjacent to the sink for faster loading and placing the pull-out trash in an area preparing food or installing practical drawers to store goods that might otherwise accumulate on the counter. The argument is that design is critical. It is crucial that the Sterile Processing Department (SPD), where surgical instruments are processed and reprocessed every day, adhere to company standards set by organizations. These organizations include the Association for the Advancement of Medical Instrumentation (AAMI), the National Association of periOperative Nursing (APON), and the American Society for Quality (ASQ) (Neue).
One needs an SPD department, whether you’re treating patients at an academic medical center or an outpatient surgery center. The placement of an SPD department is crucial in building a workflow that enables an SPD department to turn over, handle, and supply instruments efficiently.Fig. 1. Nadeau Kara, “Experience is power”; Salary Survey confirms education, certification key to SPD recognition and career success.Before designing an SPD environment, it is a good idea to familiarize yourself with industry standards issued by associations like AAMI and AORN. They may assist with anything from the room’s layout to the amount of light and water required in the space. An SPD should have a distinct separation of dirty, clean, and sterilized tools with physical barriers, irrespective of the magnitude of your SPD (See
fig. 1). Having a process that is as predictable as feasible might be beneficial.The design of a sterile processing space is built on a dirty-to-clean workflow. Moving things from a contaminated to a decontaminated condition necessitates a one-way traffic arrangement for instruments and equipment. While the objects go through the process, this one-way movement is critical to preventing cross-contamination. To facilitate workflow, air circulation systems are intended to limit pollutants. In dirty work areas, it is done by providing negative airflow compared to clean spaces while also protecting clean work areas by providing positive airflow. There are several processes involved in cleaning specialized devices, making these operations very error-prone even if they seem straightforward on the surface. Complete separation from dirty and clean sections, proper ventilation, and the
space, counters, sinks, or other equipment required to support the optimal workflow are all critical in a sterile processing room. As a result of the FGI Health Guidelines Revision Committee’s (HGRC) goal to “support supportive places for patients and employees wherever services are provided” (Damien, 229). Reprocessing practices are critical to preventing health give a damn infection, and thus patient safety is supported by the revised requirements.Instruments and gadgets that may be reused must be disinfected or sterilized before being reprocessed as high-level disinfected or sterilized. The Spaulding categorization method classifies items as semicritical or critical based on whether or not they require high-level disinfection or sterilization. A “sterile” product has been sterilized to remove all microbiological life (Ninomura). Sterilized things are only regarded as sterile when all
defined conditions for confirmation of the sterilization procedure have been satisfied. Sanitary items are handled and kept in a way that does not undermine their sterility. The “event-related sterility maintenance” criterion determines whether the sterility of stored sterile items has been maintained.Cleaning removes bioburden (live germs left on a device’s surface after usage). Residual bioburden can spread germs or infections to the next patient who uses the device. Unclean instruments cannot be sterilized or efficiently high-level disinfected; hence the efficiency of any sterilization or elevated disinfection method depends on consistent protocols for removing or considerably lowering bioburden before processing. After cleaning, disinfecting instruments (William), cleaning via chemical (disinfectant) or thermal (washer-decontaminator) implies disinfecting devices to make them safe for employees to touch while processing continues. Inspected and packed
for sterilization after decontamination, high-level disinfected items are reprocessed without filling and must be dried before storing (see fig.2).Fig.2. William Anthony; “Guideline for disinfection and sterilization in healthcare facilities, 2008.”To comprehend the changes in sterile processing facility requirements in the 2018 FGI Guidelines (Stanton), it is necessary first to understand the history of sterile processing in the surgical suite. In 2010 and previous editions, the Guidelines mandated one “sub sterile” chamber with a sink and a thermal sterilizer in between each two operating rooms. Unwrapped tools were exposed to a reduced sterilization cycle so that they may be reused right away according to a technique known as flash sterilization. The instruments were brought into the operation room wet in an open pan after being hand-washed and flash-sterilized. One
or two unique instruments or an instrument that was accidentally infected during a process were the targets of this activity. Overuse of sterilization as a convenience or an alternative to acquiring different instrument sets emerged when sterilization procedures evolved. There were also severe worries about the growing size and complexity of flash sterilized instrument sets, and the capacity to maintain the sterility of instruments carried wet in an open pan.Traditional flash sterilization was eventually deemed unacceptable due to these concerns. With a strategy that combines social media, advertising, and traditional media outreach it is possible to make your website easier to find. The committee said that the phrase flash sterilization was obsolete and replaced with Immediate Use Steam Sterilization (IUSS). Substerile rooms were no longer necessary in the
2010 FGI Guidelines, but the design criteria were preserved for use when a project’s functional program required them. Unwrapped products intended for use in the surgery room were traditionally referred to be “flash sterilized” in medical jargon (Salabasheva). When using flash or emergent sterilization, a sterilization cycle would typically last between three and ten minutes with no or little dry time or cooling phase, making the sterilization cycle quicker than that required to produce wrap or terminally sterilized products.Open baskets were used in steam sterilizer chambers for flash sterilization, which put the target object into the sterilizer while it was still wet. The sterilized items were exposed to the outside world when the room door was opened, and they may be contaminated by poor treatment. When the sterile
object was being transported, the open basket didn’t shield it from ambient pollutants (Berg 229). In order to do this, it was common practice to place numerous steam sterilizers around the surgical suite, usually one between every two operating rooms, to keep the sterilizer as near as possible to the operating room.As a way to address concerns about only one sterile processing center, the infection facilities on-site on the 2018 HGRC and other domain experts looked at this requirement again. They wanted to make sure that the design of sterile production plants encourages clinical staff to follow professional standards and guidelines for cleaning, disinfecting, and sterilizing surgical equipment (Paul,48). When it came to sterile processing facilities, they took the dirty-to-clean workflow into account. They found that two rooms
were the minimal requirement: a decontamination chamber and a clean workroom. Specifically, according to the 2018 Guidelines, a two-room sterile processing center must comprise a chemical cleaning room and a spotless small office. These are kept separate by an interior wall with a door or roll window that can be closed and secured or a constructed laundry with a pass-through window or door.Fig. 3. Stanton Madeleine; “3-zone sterile processing” Harms the productivity and value of this modern workflow.There is wording in the 2018 Hospital and Clinic Guidelines outlining the minimal physical criteria for the disinfection room and the sterile workroom. As a result, a three-basin sink and counter, appropriate counter space are necessary for sophisticated equipment to be cleaned, rinsed, and sanitized safely and efficiently. Sterile storage must
be provided, whether in the clean place of work or a dedicated storage area. At first, the notion of a single-room sanitary processing unit to service the surgery suite seemed to be the solution. However, time and experience have shown that this approach is not the optimum design for supporting sterile processing best practices, and it was modified as part of the 2018 Guidelines editing process.Decontamination aims to prevent the preparation and packaging personnel from obtaining infections caused by bacteria on medical devices during the decontamination procedure. Inanimate objects exposed to potentially hazardous microorganisms can be made safe for continuing use by applying physical or chemical methods of decontamination. According to FGI, specific steps are to be followed during decontamination. Sterile Processing Department’s Decontamination Area should be used
to transport used equipment and supplies to avoid contamination of staff or the hospital (Rose). Closed containers, totes, or plastic bags should transport supplies and equipment, and equipment should be protected from the elements. Workers in the decontamination area must wear protective clothing, including a scrub jumpsuit wrapped by a humidity barrier, shoe coverings, latex or plastic gloves, and a hair covering (see fig 4). The face mask is recommended while doing manual cleaning activities when splashing is possible.Seavey, Rose. ” Sterile & Materials Processing Department.” Basics on Processing & Sterilization 4.2. 2016.The process of sorting starts at the place of usage. Handling contaminated materials should be avoided unless the device’s operator is already wearing complete personal protective equipment, such as while doing care inside the operating room.
Sorting should solely consist of eliminating throwaway sharps and disposing of other single-use goods in places where employees are not wearing any or minimum protective clothing. It is only essential to soak lumens, or different intricate patterns clogged with dirt or are incredibly bloody and cannot be washed or cleaned at the point of application (Rose). The detergent used should be compatible with the device’s components and appropriate for the soil it will be washing. Consult the manufacturer’s instructions. Many cleaning tools are available, but the most frequent include washer/decontaminator, ultrasonic, cart washers, and tunnel washers. All instruments should be inspected after cleaning before being packed for reuse or storage. The cleanliness of box locks, serrations, and crevices must be thoroughly examined.After objects have been cleaned, dried, and
examined, those that need sterilization should be wrapped or put in rigid containers and organized in instrument trays/baskets by the AAMI and other expert organizations’ criteria. These guidelines state that: Unless the equipment manufacturer or researchers offer detailed guidance or test data to the contrary, hinged equipment should be opened (Thomas). Items with detachable parts should be disassembled, and complex devices should be ready and sterilized by the device manufacturer’s instructions and test data. Devices with a concave outer surface should be placed to facilitate water drainage. Sterilization wraps and roll stock like paper-plastic mixtures of tubing enable the user to cut and close the ends to create a pouch. Self-sealing or high-temperature plastic or paper pouches are a few options for keeping surgical instruments sterile (woven and
nonwoven) (Adrianzen). Healthcare establishments of all sizes may use various of these packing choices. An adequate barrier to microorganisms must be included in the packaging to ensure that the sterilization can reach the processed item and that the sterility is maintained even after sterilization. Staff should have access to and use written and visual protocols when performing packaging activities to prepare things to be packed.Sterilization objects should be positioned such that the sterilizing agent is immediately exposed to all surfaces. Steam (or similar sterilant) must circulate freely around each item during loading (Waluk). The maximum dimensions, weight, and density for muslin fabric packets were 12 inches wide x 12 inches high x 20 inches long, 12 pounds per cubic foot, and 7.2 pounds for each cubic foot. When
free of contamination if the cover is still intact. Items wrapped in plastic do not need to be reprocessed if they are in good condition.In conclusion, since steam sterilization days, the essential stages in reprocessing surgical tools have remained unchanged. However, since the complexity and number of surgical instruments needing reprocessing have grown dramatically, modifications in how these and other equipment are maintained in the surgery suite and beyond have become necessary. This shift in sterile processing center needs demonstrates that the approach is practical. These operational changes have influenced the development of design specifications for sanitary processing facilities, regardless of their location.
Understaffing is one of the most widespread issues in the healthcare setting in the USA and many other countries. This is also one of the most burning issues in the healthcare facility under consideration. Being a certified nurse assistant, I have acknowledged the negative impact of understaffing on employees’ performance and their overall well-being, as well as patient outcomes. Nurses are exhausted, which tends to lead to medical errors and adverse effects on patients’ health or their satisfaction with the services they receive. Understaffing had been a serious issue before the outbreak of the COVID pandemic, but it became an unpreceded burden for the system during the pandemic (Lasater et al., 2020). To improve the situation, it is possible to apply the five-step process suggested by Cox et
al. (2014). This paper includes a brief description of the implementation of the five-step process to address understaffing in the hospital in question.The first step implies the identification of the constraint (the issue that deteriorates the quality of provided care). As mentioned above, understaffing is the most burning constraint to address as it leads to an increased number of medical errors, overall dissatisfaction and low morale of the staff, and inappropriate performance. As a result, patients do not receive high-quality care as nurses often have insufficient time to discuss the necessary issues with patients and families, conduct clinical procedures properly, and fulfill their tasks.Step 2 of the process described by Cox et al. (2014) encompasses the identification of the exact ways to address the constraint. Seasonality is one
of the characteristics of the problem, as the primary load is apparent in the so-called flu seasons. At this period, it is necessary to increase the number of working hours for nurse assistants who can perform multiple tasks, while nurses can concentrate on procedures that need skills assistants do not have. The assistants are often employed part-time, so it can be sufficient to increase the number of working hours of those who already work at the facility. However, it is critical to developing detailed guidelines and instructions regarding employees’ responsibilities. Each employee should understand what procedures and tasks to perform, and on what occasions when their services are not needed. It can be necessary to amend some job descriptions to implement change effectively.Step 3, as defined by Cox
regarding the time nurses invest in communication with them, the quality of provided care, and their overall satisfaction with the services. Brief surveys for employees can also shed light on nurses’ workload, burnout, and performance. Step 5 can be easily implemented in this process as contracts will be signed for the most intense period, so no inertia can appear.In conclusion, it is possible to address understaffing by increasing the number of nurse assistants on a seasonal basis. The utilization of the five-step process can ensure the effective implementation of change in the hospital under consideration. The collaboration and commitment of all staff members are critical. The model suggested by Cox and colleagues can also be used to solve other issues the healthcare facility faces.
Company’s Background InformationFarcargo is a business-to-business online-based logistics service company. The company conducts national wide and international goods delivery for its clients. The company was established in 2006 as a local delivery company where it conducts deliveries in the Seattle locality. In the beginning, the employees would do home and office deliveries for our clients for goods such as groceries, food, and shopping items, among others. However, in 2009 the company changed from local deliveries to national wide and international deliveries. The business operations also change from business to customer to business to business. Most of the company’s services, such as booking, billing, payment, and monitoring, are conducted online.The company was founded by Adams Johnsons, the Chief Executive Officer, who was assisted by five other senior management staff
as follows: 1. Chief Finance Officer – Janet Smith 2. Chief Marketing Officer- Peter Calgary 3. Chief Operations Manager- Susan Milles 4. Chief Human Resource Manager- Diana Jones 5. Chief Information Technology Officer- Steve WilsonFarcargo is an e-commerce business and thus does not require numerous brick-and-mortar stores to conduct its operations. The company has a main office in Seattle, its headquarters where it has centralized its processes. The company has well-established online and social media platforms where it connects with its existing and potential clients. E-commerce businesses use this platform to advertise its services and inform clients of their offers and discounts (Chung et al., 2018). Moreover, Farcargo has a website where its clients can log in using their registration details to monitor their goods in transit or
previous business deals. Farcargo prides itself in excellent customer service.Farcargo Current StatusAs of December 2021, Farcargo had a total of 18 fully contracted employees and two part-time staff. The company is worth $258 million as its 31st December 2021 financial reports. The company realized a revenue of $27 million in the year. Farcargo has experienced a 5% growth rate in the past three years and expects to exceed this rate by 2% in the next two years. The company is planning to relocate to a new facility, a two-story standalone building.The Company’s MissionFarcargo aims to transform global business operations by delivering reliable, affordable, and timely cargo transport services. The company aims to be a leading online delivery cargo company that encourages regional and international trade hence economic growth
and stability to our clients. Farcargo focuses on improving the courier industry to exceed global standards.The Company’s VisionThe company’s vision is to be a reliable and flexible business partner to its clients. Farcargo is determined to be available and offer flexibility in terms of operations, delivery hours, payment methods, mode of transportation, types of goods in transit, and location, among others. It aims at establishing flexible services to suit our diverse clients’ needs.Company’s Business TypeFarcargo is a business-to-business online cargo courier services provider. The company transports goods within the boundaries of a particular country or beyond its borders. Farcargo deals in road, air, and water transport. For each mode of transport, courier service companies use a variety of equipment in terms of size and shape to suit the
kind of goods being transported (Gramatikova, 2020). For instance, for road transport, the company owns four types of trucks of different sizes which enables it to transport different amounts and types of goods. This business is online-based, meaning that its customers conduct their booking, monitoring, billing, payments, and signing-off using an online platform.Farcargo CustomersFarcargo deals with different types of companies who wish to transport their products or any goods. It has one-time clients and regular or repeat customers. A significant number of the company’s clients are companies whereby that require us to take goods from one location to another. For example, manufacturing companies require it to transport raw materials from the provider to their firms and later hire courier services to transport their output to wholesalers or other
clients (Gramatikova, 2020). It also has individual clients who would like to transport personal goods such as cars or other products. Farcargo Company also gets government contracts regularly where it is hired by a government to conduct a delivery.Demographic InformationThe company’s headquarters are located in Seattle but have other regional offices in 40 countries globally. Farcargo conducts its operations in all seven continents but has most of its clients in the U.S.A, Asia, and Europe. In the three regions, Farcargo transports goods within the borders and across to other countries.Company’s Information Systems InfrastructureThe company’s information system infrastructure comprises four parts; the user interface, applications, business processes, and a database. This infrastructure is supported by hardware, system software, networking, storage, and data centers.User interfaceThis is the first and outer
view a user interacts with when working with a system (Gramatikova, 2020). The Farcargo interface is rich in color and graphics which guide the user to different functions. For example, the user interface has registration or login buttons, about us, Contact us, Our Services, and Enquiry buttons. The registration or log-in button assists users in easily key in their details for registration to the system or access to their account. The About us button leads a user to more information about the company, such as the company’s history, management, projects, and plans. Moreover, the contact us button allows the user to access the company’s contact information, such as telephone number, email address, and phone number. The user can also make inquiries from this interface which allows them to
do so through the inquiry button. The user interface is blue and has images of our transportation equipment, our staff, and the company’s logo.ApplicationsAfter accessing their account, users can then interact with different applications to perform different functions in the system. Some of the functions include booking, cargo monitoring, and retrieval of past business records. The application is also attached to a payment system that allows the client to pay for their services. The booking application is linked to an external calendar which assists clients in keying in the date of their cargo collection. The booking application allows the client to describe the type of cargo with words and pictures so that our team can choose the right equipment to use. Cargo monitoring is done through the application
whereby a customer can access the GPS linked to the transportation equipment. They can also access the contact of the staff in charge of their transportation to inquire about the goods. Through the application, clients can access their past business records which are stored in the company’s database.Business ProcessesThe system allows the company to perform several business processes with ease. Some of the business processes performed by the system include billing, scheduling, receipt retrieval, and signing off a deal. Once a client books for our services, the system assists the company in scheduling according to the different days and tasks keyed in. This helps to avoid task overlap and delay. The scheduling system also has a reminder that reminds both the user and staff of an upcoming project.
Farcargo relies on its information system for a significant number of its operations. Thus, the structure of the company’s information system is a crucial element of consideration. Farcargo uses a dynamic infrastructure for its operations so that it is in a position to address the growing demand of its clients. The company prefers to use a dynamic infrastructure for its ability to be highly responsive to the end-users and to meet its needs to use cloud computing to enhance speed and agility. This infrastructure ensures it delivers essential services such as the provision of traffic information and tracking of its assets with ease (Beynon-Davies, 2019). Farcargo’s information system is comprised of hardware, software, networking, and storage components in its infrastructure.Farcargo ensures that it uses updated hardware components to
avoid inconveniences such as malfunctioning devices or system freezes. The company uses hardware components which include computer machinery and equipment, in its offices and headquarters, where the employees monitor the progress of the operation. The computer machinery uses a power supply, memory, cabling, and circuit boards for proper functioning. Moreover, computers use peripheral devices such as mice, keyboards, speakers, printers, and cameras to enable the input and output of information in the system. These offices also have switches, routers, servers, and data centers which enhances their operations. In the company’s vehicles, the company uses cameras and microphones to ensure easy communication with the staff. Finally, our clients are required to use their personal computers, mobile phones, or tablets to access the company’s information system.The company’s software consists of
SummaryThis paper documents Farcargo’s information system implementation plan. It is divided into various segments, which include an overview of the information system, a description of the primary tasks undertaken during implementation, and a list of the resources required (such as personnel, hardware, software, and other materials and facilities). This document has been developed continuously since the system design phase. It was later updated in the development phase, and the ultimate copy was produced during the testing and integration phase. This document will act as a guide during the implementation of Farcargo’s information system.PurposeThe primary purpose of this document is to provide an outline of events and steps that the project team will follow during Farcargo’s system implementation. It also provides major tasks and how each should be carried
out to achieve the best. An implementation plan sets the dates for the accomplishment of various tasks and acts as a communication and training plan.System OverviewBeing an online-based organization, Farcargo requires a system that acts as its virtual office. Farcargo is a virtually based logistics company that has spread its operations globally. The company’s system should have a virtual assistant who acts as the receptionist, a billing department, a data keeping and retrieval section, operations and monitoring, and senior management. Farcargo aims at having an information system that allows users to interact with them as in a real physical office.System DescriptionThe Farcargo information system can be divided into three main parts, the user interface, application, and database. At the user interface, the system should allow the client to
register an account with the company where they can access their data. The system saves the clients’ data into a database where they can only be accessed by authorized personnel. The client is then able to access the organization’s services and make inquiries on various products offered. When satisfied, the client can book logistic service and the system automatically generates their bill. The client is required to make a payment through the platform using a special code generated during billing. The system then issues the client with a receipt and their booking is automatically scheduled on the system. The staff in charge of the delivery and the client can view the scheduled date and is sent a reminder by the system two days before the actual date.After our
staff has received the goods to be delivered, the employee should change the status of the schedule on the system to ‘in transit. The system detects this change and sends an alert message to the client. The client and the management can monitor the goods in transit by use of GPS technology and cameras inserted in the company’s transport equipment. The employee carrying the goods can communicate with the management and client in case there is a need to do so. Upon the arrival of goods to their destination, the employee updates the status of the contract to “delivered” and uploads a few pictures as evidence. The client should confirm the delivery and then change the status to “completed”. The company requests clients to make comments about the
services offered to ensure they are offered the best.System OrganizationThe Farcargo system structure is made up of hardware, software, and databases. Every user needs the hardware components to access the system. They include computers, mobile phones or tablets, and peripheral devices.Company’s Information Systems Infrastructure.A High-level Information System Block Diagram.Farcargo’s Business logic diagram.Farcargo’s Physical Layout Diagram.Key Network Infrastructure Elements.Description of ImplementationThe Farcargo information system shall require the development of a website, a desktop application, and an android application.

Security is an essential element to maintain during the system implementation process (Mahamad et al., 2018). Some features such as encryption, authentication, SSL secure communication, and authorization should be observed to ensure that the cluster is secure. Some of Farcargo’s system security features are1.
The system will provide one interface where a client will access all the components. To access their information, clients will be required to provide authorization and authentication on one interface. This will ensure the security implementation is simplified as all components will be viewed and interacted with in a consistent manner.2. SSL secure communication; this connection allows the configuration of connections to each end-user. For instance, SSL connection can be enabled for the client, peer-to-peer, HTTP connection, gateway senders and receivers, and JMX.Regional data post-processing; the system should allow for the formatting of return values for the operations that provide access to region values. During implementation, the security of the components shall also be enhanced. For instance, when installing servers with sensitive data at the new office, maximum
security from the company’s guards shall be placed during transportation and installation.

It is a film about the fragility of masculinity, men’s mental health, and how they are interconnected. Fight Club is a crude portrait of what happens when men’s insecurities turn into masculinity in overdrive. Thus, this film represents toxic masculinity. Fight Club shows men dissatisfied with the state of masculinity. The characters are different in that many of them were raised by their mothers because their fathers either left the family or got divorced. According to Ta, the result is that the characters see themselves as “a generation of men raised by women” (270). In their life there is not enough male education for the formation of their masculinity. It confirms the idea of phallocentrism, which is based on the image of castrated women. Women raise children so that they can enter into the symbolic order.Fight Club is a wicked satire about finding, nurturing, and destroying yourself. It challenges ideas of masculinity, adding to the image of a real man several features that can be called associative and setting self-destruction and a destructive impact on society as one of life’s goals. The victory of Jack’s subpersonality over Tyler on the roof of a skyscraper shows that the good in a real man can overcome the destructive element. The ability to self-sacrifice and responsibility for his actions in Jack, who has gone through the evolution of masculinity, inspires some optimism, but the finale remains open.
IntroductionThere are numerous problems in the world that continue to undermine all the benefits that the rapid social evolution and technological progress bring. One of the issues that should be addressed immediately by all governments is extreme inequality. Despite the successful implementation of a wide range of measures that helped fight such disparities in most Western societies, Latin American nations continue to struggle from a plethora of problems that are rooted in inequality. Nevertheless, recently some governments in the region have been particularly enthusiastic in developing new ingenious strategies to help the poor. I strongly believe that a dedicated analysis of such measures can ensure increased living standards in one of the world’s most diverse regions.The Global Importance of the IssueWhy does fighting inequality in Latin America matter
to the rest of the world? First, the region’s political life has been extremely turbulent for several decades. It means that some of the vital social institutions in various states are not efficient enough to ensure rapid and sustainable development. Such a situation leads to a wide range of social problems, including discrimination, drug trafficking, street crime, high levels of violence. All the above-mentioned troubles directly affect the well-being of millions of Americans. Drugs and illegal migration have been devasting various neighborhoods across the US. It is just one of the examples, as Europe and even some Asian countries also experience difficulties that are rooted in social issues in Latin America.What is more important, Latin American nations have high chances of successfully and quickly overcoming many of the
above-mentioned challenges. Governments in the region are generally enthusiastic about developing and implementing new strategies, as political parties constantly face severe competition. Thus, just like in the 20 th century, numerous social experiments (this time, predominantly positive) can change societies there in a due manner. Latin American nations that manage to find the efficient means to enhance the living standards of millions of citizens will become role models for numerous developing countries that currently experience rapid population growth (most of them in Africa). Therefore, the ability of Latin American nations to overcome difficulties and get rid of numerous constraints will ensure the successful implementation of similarly efficient strategies in countries where billions of people live.The Core of the ProblemMaybe the fact that few nations in the region are
high-income economies is the cause of many issues? It can not be so, as there are numerous nations in the world that are not rich but do not struggle with such a wide range of social problems. Therefore, there must be something unique about Latin America that hinders its development and does not allow it to reach the level of prosperity and well-being of other Western societies. It is undoubtedly the extreme levels of inequality that deprives millions of people living in poor neighborhoods of access to high-quality education, medical services, and cheap credit.Figure 1: LAC countries are some of the most unequal in the world Gini indices on the distribution of household consumption per capita by region, circa 2017.Despite the gradual decreases in income inequality that take
place due to multiple changes in taxation and legislation, there are other problems that underline social issues. Wealth inequality has always been a feature of most Latin American nations, as a few aristocratic families usually owned the most fertile land in the 19 th century. Therefore, unlike in the 19 th -century US, new migrants could not easily acquire free land and had to toil for the rich. Such disparities from the outstart hindered the development of a large middle-class that is instrumental in creating a free and prosperous society.Simply raising the taxes and redistributing the money to the poor is not an optimal solution. A much more complex and scientific, data-driven approach should be utilized in order to address the issue efficiently. New frameworks should be developed
and established that will seek to help people truly realize their potential by incentivizing them to use their strengths and talents.Fighting extreme poverty implies the utilization of a unique set of urgent measures and a wide range of strategies. Cheap credit or interest-free loans have already proven to be beneficial when they are granted to hard-working families that desperately need resources, such as tools, land, materials, or money to pay the rent. Once dedicated institutions or charities realize that a family will spend a substantial amount of money in an efficient way, it should ensure rapid transit of the low-interest or interest-free loan. Moreover, it is highly desirable to establish or encourage the creation of organizations that ask for money back only in case a poor family’s enterprise
is successful and starts generating income.Covid-19One of the factors that further exacerbates the inequality problem in Latin America is the Covid-19 pandemic and the numerous measures that seek to stop the spread of the virus. Therefore, all the above mentioned has substantially widened the income gap. According to Regional Human Development Report (2021), in these unprecedented circumstances, 22 million more people have fallen below the poverty line in the region, returning to 2008 levels. Moreover, lower commodity prices and slower growth in China, however, have reduced Latin America’s growth prospects (Messina & Silva, 2018). What is more, due to the fact that the middle-class is relatively small, few people have the opportunity to work from home, which is in sharp contrast with the situation in more prosperous Western
countries.Moreover, the Covid-19 pandemic hinders the chances of millions of pupils and students to continue the education process online. According to Delaporte et al. (2021), social distancing measures have led to an increase in inequality in Latin America. A large portion of families in the region have more than two children, which makes it hard for any family with income levels below average to provide each child with a laptop. Furthermore, there are numerous areas even within the city boundaries where the speed of Internet connection is not sufficient enough to ensure proper conditions for working or learning from home.The successful cases from the 2000s that featured the improved living standards of millions of workers in Latin America include Argentina, Uruguay, and Brazil. In the first two examples,
labor unions managed to contribute to the establishment of a safety net that helped many professionals finally get decent salaries. In Brazil’s scenario, the substantial rises in minimal wage helped fight the situation where millions of people living in the cities with high living costs had to toil for a few dollars a day. Therefore, there are multiple success stories that can be repeated despite the disastrous effect both the Covid-19 pandemic and the consequent economic repercussions had on the region.Figure 2: Despite declining in the 2000s, income inequality remains high in LAC. Income inequality (Gini index 1992–2018).Various Types of InequalityIncome inequality, wealth inequality, and extreme poverty are not the only types of inequality that people in Latin American struggle with. Various types of horizontal inequalities (based on
differences in sex, ethnicity, or race, just to name a few) are still a major issue. Women continue to earn much less than men and frequently face a “glass ceiling” due to numerous stereotypes. Ethnic minorities still lack recognition as active political and economic agents. Moreover, they are sometimes left behind in access to various social services.Governments in the regions do not allocate enough resources to the development of various facilities in remote rural areas, while, in fact, it is the most crucial measure that can really ensure the rapid enhancement of living standards. There seems to be a lack of truly independent politicians that are capable of staying determined to achieve long-term goals. Thus, the political systems in many countries in the region seem to lack the
real opportunity to represent large portions of the population. Sometimes even certain multinational corporations seem to understand more in the importance of creating proper living standards and working conditions that rapidly enhance productivity.Governments and technocrats have to fight numerous imbalances that do not allow for a more equal distribution of access to basic services and resources. The extreme riches that a minor portion of the population possess deprive them of the chance to employ a much more efficient investment-oriented approach to their numerous assets. It is difficult to realize what stands behind the lack of compassion that the rich show to the millions of poor people living in their countries. In many Latin American cities neighborhoods for the extremely rich are located just next to poor communities.Trust is
instrumental in the creation of a properly functioning state and creating a harmonious society. Walking along the streets in Latin American cities makes it vivid that the rich do not trust the poor and are willing to distance themselves as far as possible from everything associated with poverty. In many cases, the motivation behind such measures seems to go far beyond safety concerns. Therefore, in the 21 st century, it is crucial for every nation to find something that brings people together.States that used to have socialist governments provide a unique example. Despite the fact that after the fall of the Soviet Union inequality rates skyrocketed in many countries, it is clear that most of them did not encounter many of the issues that Latin American nations face.
In states that used to be socialist, people have relatively equal access to free or cheap health services and education. Despite the income inequality that can be extremely high, the poor and the rich continue to go to the same hospitals and to study at the same schools. The frequent opportunities (or necessities) to interact with people from all walks of life allow for much higher compassion levels.When each member of a diverse society can understand all the hardships that others have to go through, it makes a nation tolerant and cooperative. Consequently, it leads to rapid accumulation of wealth that can be then redistributed evenly. The success story of the US economy is not based solely on strong work ethics and efficient levels of market regulations. It
is also based on meritocracy, meaning that children of recent immigrants could become wealthy due to equality of opportunity.EducationEducation has always been considered instrumental in ensuring future success. Despite the numerous attempts to claim that the rich always enjoy better educational opportunities due to their parents’ financial resources, I strongly believe that it is definitely not the case in the 21 st century. The access to enormous amounts of free online information that people enjoy can ensure that they can become valued professionals in the labor market. Moreover, the free-market economy implies that numerous companies are in a constant struggle to enhance their profitability by various means, including the reduction of costs. Labor is still an important factor that influences prices for goods and services. Therefore, even small
and medium-sized companies are willing to hire professionals from countries with lower living costs.One important example concerning the change in the government’s attitude to education includes the numerous social programs in Brazil that helped incentivize school pupils from poor families to actually go to schools. In fact, their parents were paid if children attended the classes. According to Clifton et al. (2020), public spending on education, personal income taxes and social contributions are especially instrumental in reducing income inequality. Thus, sums that are insufficient for a federal government help motivate a large number of children to acquire knowledge and make the first steps that can lead to a successful career in a country where industrious professionals enjoy truly high living standards.Tourism and City EnvironmentThere are plentiful strategies that
governments can employ in order to fight inequality and all the numerous issues that are associated with it. One of the easiest and, at the same time, one of the most efficient options is bringing people together. Modern cities that feature great architecture, nice infrastructure, and a wide range of cultural sites, social institutions are all relatively safe all around the world. Once pleasant changes take place in a city that makes millions of tourists from different parts of the world go there, locals in most cases rapidly change their own perception of the place they live in.Although such strategies seem to be extraordinary and insufficient to address various social issues, they actually work great in the 21 st century. Especially in the case of Latin America, where
amazing climate, bright unique nature, and the proximity to warm oceans and seas allows for room for maneuver concerning the above-mentioned approaches. Tourists always bring a lot of dollars to the places they find exotic. That alone can be extremely beneficial for a struggling economy, as worldwide popularity as a tourist destination ensures higher incomes, enhanced infrastructure, and the creation of millions of new jobs.Figure 3: One of the most popular landmarks in Buenos Aires. The Floralis Genérica sculpture.Moreover, the rich that suddenly begin to enjoy the improved environment around them also start to invest in local real estate, purchase local products, go on vacation to places in their own countries. In the case of Latin America, it can help keep enormous sums of money in the country
that will boost various sectors of the economy. In any case, such a scenario is much more preferable than all of those dollars going to a handful of luxury brands and well-known resorts.What is more important, people in the 21 st century do not use the Internet on a daily basis just to perform daily tasks in a more efficient way. They actually rely on the thousands of opinions and images that are thoroughly processed by social media algorithms. One post of a truly influential blogger is enough to draw the attention of millions of people worldwide to any product, service, destination.Creating a truly appealing image of a neighborhood, a city, a country has become an extremely important goal of governments and local municipalities. People living in a
place that is admired globally are far more satisfied with their lives, even if the economy struggles. Thus, building new infrastructure that everyone can access, enhancing public space design, redevelopment and landscaping can help increase the living standards of millions of people substantially in a rapid and cost-efficient manner. The above-mentioned strategy is especially beneficial to Latin America with its pleasant climate, which will allow to later employ it in India and African countries.TransportTransportation is also an extremely important tool that can encourage people of all walks of life to finally meet each other and start interacting. Efficient and comfortable public transport has proven to be one of the greatest methods to fight inequality. Once the rich realize that they do not necessarily have to use their cars
all the time and occasionally use various other options in the city centers, it quickly enhances the perception of public transport in general.Even if extremely rich businessmen lack the motivation to actually start using it, there is another rapidly growing part of the population that is considered to be privileged in Latin America. Just like in Europe, numerous officials and other public sector workers can be incentivized to use public transport more often. Given the importance and current popularity of green technologies, technocrats and officials should jump at the opportunity and create a highly efficient public transit network.One of the greatest and brightest examples of the importance of new city infrastructure projects for society is the construction of aerial cable car urban transit systems that have recently become
extremely popular across Latin America. Although they are generally perceived as tourist attractions in Europe and the US, they play an important role in many countries in Latin America for a number of reasons. Some of the most populous and important cities in Latin America suffer from large differences in elevation of neighborhoods or neighboring cities (that in some cases exceeds 1000 ft.). Therefore, only aerial cable cars can truly help under such circumstances.Figure 4: Aerial cable car urban transit system in Bolivia. Teleférico La Paz–El Alto (La Paz–El Alto Cable Car).Arguably, the most important and the most popular of the recently constructed systems is Teleférico La Paz–El Alto. The longest aerial cable car urban transit system in the world that can currently boast of colorful 36 stations
of Latin American nations to fight various types of inequality. Despite the importance of eliminating extreme income inequality, new opportunities and new social tendencies allow for a far more rapid resolution of some of the problems with the help of ingenious methods and techniques. It is possible to enhance the living standards of millions of people living in enormous urban centers in different parts of Latin America by providing them with the opportunity to get an education and find a job with decent pay in the city center or online. Helping people in Latin American countries stay optimistic about their opportunity to start their own business or become successful professionals in a pleasant city is instrumental in eliminating extreme poverty in the region.
As a rule, the concepts of counterfeiting and terrorism are not seen as quite compatible, mostly due to the drastic difference in the end goals of each type of criminal activity. However, some terrorist organizations have sought to venture into counterfeiting, effectively expanding into massive illegal yet tremendously lucrative businesses. The notorious Italian Mafia has been particularly infamous for its efforts to capture the Italian market and seeking to divert the revenue stream to fund its nefarious activities (Beqiraj et al., 2020). Although Mafia’s activities can hardly be restricted due to the overwhelming power that it has already established in Italy, accurate tools for detecting counterfeits and preventing them from entering the European market must be incorporated into the current measures.Italian Mafia’s involvement in counterfeiting has been quite
prominent., mostly due to the overwhelming power that Mafia holds in Italy as its infamous organized crime institution. Among the key counterfeit-related activities in which Mafia has been engaged, manufacturing fake products for sale has been the main one (Beqiraj et al., 2020). For instance, in 2017, Mafia was involved in manufacturing fake olive oil for selling to EU countries (Bacchi, 2017). Though the described counterfeit endeavor might seem as insignificant, especially given the range and severity of crimes for which the Italian Mafia has been known, the specified incident has produced a rather ample impact on the trade between Italy and other European states. According to the reports issued in response to the specified event, cheap oil was “re-labeled as the more expensive “extra virgin” variety, prized
for its rich taste and health benefits, and distributed as such to retail stores in New Jersey” (Bacchi, 2017). The specified activities undermine the reputation of Italian food manufacturers and the related companies, therefore, jeopardizing the very basis of the state’s economy. Therefore, the problem of food counterfeiting must be managed so that Italian companies working in the food industry and exporting their goods can continue to flourish.In order to combat the issue, measures for identifying the instances of counterfeit and preventing them from entering the market must be designed. Unfortunately, an alternative solution that could be seen as more efficient, namely, fighting Mafia in the first place, is presently highly improbable. Since the Italian Mafia has practically ingrained itself into the economic and political context of Italy,
developing and installing devices for better identification of counterfeit products and removing them from the range of those circulating in the European market, the Italian government and the adjacent state bodies will be able to counteract the counterfeit efforts of the Mafia. Even though the Mafia itself cannot be managed currently, having implanted itself firmly into the political and economic structures, measures against counterfeit, such as more precise instruments for identifying it and removing it from the European market, must be incorporated into the current strategies. While presently, counterfeit remains robust and seemingly undefeatable, a set of coordinated actions may help address the situation.
Dances with Wolves , directed by Kevin Costner, was based on the book of the same name by Michael Blake, who thereafter wrote the screenplay for the film. The plot takes place during the American Civil War when a brave lieutenant John Dunbar finds himself in an abandoned fort and infiltrates Native American society. Even though the director’s crew extensively obtained guidance from historical consultants, for example, Doris Leader Charge, Lakota language instructor, it did not save the film from historical criticism. Dances with Wolves can be considered as ambitious and outstanding debut work of an inexperienced director who treated the image of indigenous Indians carefully and competently conveyed it in his project.The communal life of indigenous Indians has been portrayed accurately enough for a film not based
on real events. The film was actively praised for the fact that Costner managed to resist the typical portrayal of Native Americans and not limit the characters to simplified caricature. Most of the minor inaccuracies presented in the film did not significantly impact the understanding of the overall picture. Russell Means noticed mistakes in the use of the Lakota language when some of the male-Natives were speaking in the feminine way. Historian Joseph Roquemore also noted that the Sioux tribe’s attitude to weapons was misinterpreted to emphasize people’s traditional way of life (StudyMoose 2020). The movie’s historical inaccuracies were caused not only by the difficulty of portraying the Lakota culture but also by the biases of Costner and his desire to convey a certain image of the tribe.
Despite such mistakes, the director’s approach to portraying history was responsible, which helped him eliminate the stereotype of a noble savage in the image of a Native American.Kevin Costner’s love of Native American history was evident long before his directing of Dancing with Wolves , and at the age of 35, he decided to revive the Western with his project. He sought to overcome human prejudices about savage Indians in order to renew long-forgotten ties. Costner depicted the Indians not as a general group of people but as individuals to humanize them as much as possible. His desire to revive the interest and impact of peoples understanding the culture and life of indigenous peoples brings the Native Americans to the central plan.The cinematic techniques of Dances with Wolves
historical value and 4 points on the scale of entertainment value. The historical component expanded the understanding of the average person about Native Americans. Nevertheless, some minor inaccuracies, sometimes even made to create a certain image of the tribes, do not allow me to rate the film at 5. The entertaining component of the film can also be appreciated highly because the film has gained great popularity and received critical acclaim. Nevertheless, I would dare to withdraw the score for the timing, which could spoil the impression for some viewers.
Over the past years, the paradigm of medical care has embraced a patient-centered approach that prioritizes and anticipates one’s needs and prompts clinical intervention. Such a proactive attitude, however, has not yet become a pattern due to several financial and organizational barriers. Many hospitals claim to have limited resources for the implementation of preventive health care regularly, especially when it comes to the financial coverage of preventive interventions.The controversy, in this case, is the fact that the overwhelming amount of EBP research points to the socio-economic benefits of the anticipatory approach to health care. For example, in an article by Jennings and Eng (2020), the authors clearly indicate that “Increasing preventive cancer screenings in the U.S. is an effective strategy to reduce health care costs” (p. 245). Another
study concludes that the personalized preventive approach “is statistically associated with reductions in outpatient expenditures, Medicare expenditures in year 5, emergency department (ED) utilization, and unplanned inpatient admissions, accompanied by significant increases in evaluation and management visits and expenditures” (Morefield, Tomai, Slanchev, & Klemes, 2020, p. 75). Based on this evidence, it is reasonable to ask why the economic systems of health care overlook such a beneficial opportunity.In my opinion, the answer to this question addresses two major aspects: heavy reliance on patient autonomy in health decisions and the unwillingness to invest in telemedicine and digital solutions to preventive health. This reflection was, in fact, inspired by one of my patients who is receiving treatment for type 2 diabetes. This patient is a 68-year-old man, so the majority
of his medical expenses are covered by federal Medicaid insurance. He is a heavy smoker and drinks alcohol at least once a week, so he is at high risk of hyperglycemia and other complications of diabetes. Because of severe blood sugar spikes at his age, the patient is frequently admitted to the hospital with hyperglycemia and low blood pressure, which makes him faint. As a result, the patient is readmitted to the facility every two months with an average hospital stay of three days. Since it is already evident that the patient faints and struggles with blood sugar spikes because of a lifestyle incompatible with the disease, it is critical to question the preventive measures of the treatment.One of the potentially successful ways to accomplish the proper level
their health status before it is too late and they rush to the hospital. Telemedicine, including apps linked to a tracking device, is an extremely beneficial way to promote this change. Evidence suggests that a mobile-phone system for senior patients with type 2 diabetes contributes positively to the patient’s blood sugar and overall well-being (Sun et al., 2019). Procurement of such devices for a facility and software development yield financial advantages for the administration and patients in the long run, as hospital stay, readmission rates, and federal coverage of medical bills result in more frequent and costly expenses. Hence, it is high time for public health advocates to perceive telemedicine as a futuristic concept rather than a full-scale modern solution.
Organizational structure is an essential notion that brings the team together to manage the objective successfully. Five structural configurations help people to achieve team goals. Depending on the purposes of the group, it is essential to choose the appropriate structure. For instance, there are variations: One Boss, Dual Authority, Simple Hierarchy, Circle Network, and All-Channel Network. These structures are different by their nature, and it is vital to examine each of the five to determine the most effective structure for the team to accomplish its goals.One Boss structure is a situation where the leader charges responsibilities of all people. This structure is classic, and many companies apply it because of its simplicity and clearness. Indeed, it can have some substantial disadvantages, for example, slow communication, delays, and single
decision-making. The second structure is Dual Authority, where two individuals have the power to execute control over the group of people. Information flows through these people and reduces a boss’s control degree. This structure allows to free up time, but the added layer might slow the communication.Simple Hierarchy is another classic structure that suggests a middle manager reporting to the boss. In this case, the boss is responsible for communication with other team members through the middle man. This option limits access to authority; indeed, it is more effective than the previous structure of Dual Authority. Circle Network suggests the information flow from one team member to another; everyone can add to or change the process. This structural configuration might simplify communication, as every group member interacts directly
with only two other team members. There is no boss, and every group member has equal responsibility. However, one weak element in the chain can undermine the whole process.The last structural configuration is the All-Channel Network, which is about interdependence and the involvement of every team member in the process. All-Channel Network embodies multiple connections where everyone is dependent on each other. It is about diversity and equal responsibilities; however, decisions can cause misunderstanding and extra discussion with other team members. It also might slow down the process due to multiple opinions on the same issue. This configuration is often compared to football and basketball, where the result depends on every group member.As a teacher, I am part of three teams. The first is the One Boss configuration,
speed and simplicity depend on the chosen configuration. For example, when it is required to decide on the spot, the One Boss configuration might be a doubtful solution. Instead, several team members will accomplish the goal faster and more efficiently. In general, many educational organizations strive to give equal abilities to each team member; it creates a friendly atmosphere and contributes to the flow of ideas within the group.
In the development of nursing in Europe in the 19th century, the activities of an outstanding personality, the Englishwoman Florence Nightingale, played an important role. Florence was looking for an opportunity to help the poor and the sick. At that distant time, activities related to mercy, helping those in need, were considered an occupation not worthy of a noblewoman. The young woman sacrificed personal life expensive relationships with her parents but remained faithful to her calling. Furthermore, her values and commitment allowed Florence to become a historical figure in modern nursing, to whose leadership people owe accolades for paving the way of nursing’s place in our societies.Thanks to perseverance and perseverance, in 1851, Florence entered the community of the sisters of pastor F. Flender in Germany, where she
To analyze current policies aimed at addressing the opioid crisis, describe examples of the crisis, and suggest a few options to help solve the problem to the community. A stakeholder group of people in the community, including local policymakers, leaders, and concerned citizens. The United States of America is experiencing a severe crisis of opioid abuse. In 2019 alone, opioids took the lives of 50,000 Americans, and the economic burden from the problem is about $78.5 billion a year (National Institute on Drug Abuse, 2021). This issue concerns many stakeholders, from society and medical staff to individual policymakers and representatives of various structures like the Center for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) or the National Institute on Drug Abuse (NIDA). Although different structures and organizations are making many
efforts to stop the crisis, communities can also significantly contribute to solving the problem. Everyone present here can learn and do more than now, and then together community will save more lives. Today, I will present a description and analysis of policies against the opioid crisis, consider examples of the crisis, and propose several measures and actions that communities can take in this fight.It is important to say that there are several main directions for political action in the fight against the opioid crisis. Key actors such as the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) and National Institutes of Health (NIH) prioritize the following:  * Improved access to treatment, prevention, and recovery services;  * Promote the availability and use of drugs that prevent overdoses;
 * Healthcare surveillance for transparent reporting and collection of data to better understand the situation;  * Support research in understanding pain and safe methods of its management;  * Promoting different pain reduction methods (Collins, 2017; NIDA, 2021).Most organizations involved in the fight against the crisis are focused on the mentioned goals. Organizations include Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration (SAMHSA), CDC, Food and Drug Administration (FDA), and other entities. Some organizations add their own goals; for instance, the Healthcare Fraud Prevention Partnership (HFPP) also seeks to identify and stop fraud and other dishonest opioid activities (Healthcare Fraud Prevention Partnership, 2017). Programs in the States, in turn, monitor drug prescriptions and the work of pain management specialists (CDC, 2019). Thus, all measures aim to reduce
the chances of opioid abuse and maintain the nation’s health.The analysis aims to understand and evaluate policy effectiveness to provide informed advice for new policy decisions and actions. Analyzing the existing medical policy, it is worth paying attention to its successes. Some successes include:  * State programs in Ohio, Kentucky, Florida, New York, Tennessee, and other states, have helped reduce opioid abuse and mortality rates (CDC, 2019);  * SAMHSA provides professional training grants and Medication-Assisted Treatment (MAT) for vulnerable populations;  * The CDC conducts and supports studies that bring new knowledge on risk factors and other influential aspects and offer solutions.However, it is worth noting that the problem continues to exist. In particular, policies may have unintended consequences of using drugs other than opioids due
to insufficient attention to the causes of abuse (Lee et al., 2021). Therefore, the fight against opioids should be comprehensive and include measures to improve social conditions and community support.Let us consider some examples of the manifestation of the opioid crisis, which may be significant for policies to combat it. Examples:  * The opioid crisis began in the late 20th century when pharmaceutical companies convinced society that opioid-based painkillers would not be addictive and were prescribed in large quantities (NIDA, 2021);  * About 21-29% of patients with prescriptions for opioids due to chronic pain misuse them, and 4-6% of abusers later abuse heroin (NIDA, 2021).  * 8-12% of those taking prescribed opioids suffer from opioid use disorders (NIDA, 2021);Risk factors for developing opioid addiction include
improper or prolonged drug use, poverty, unemployment, personal or family history of misuse, risk behavior, contact with high-risk individuals, stress, and other causes (Mayo Clinic Staff, 2018).Understanding the risks, causes, and influencers for the opioid crisis, one can suggest several measures that communities can take. Proposed measures include:  * Collaboration within the community to raise awareness about the dangers of opioids, policies to combat the crisis, the possibilities of intervention, and the provision of assistance for overdoses;  * Creating an organization or public coalition that can help people with addiction, particularly through referral to treatment, providing drugs that prevent overdoses, and other measures;  * The creation of support groups in various areas help those who suffer from addiction, help those who suffer from chronic pain
It began after erroneous information that opioid-based drugs are not addictive spread. However, the use of such drugs carries a high risk of developing addiction and other disorders associated with opioid use. Various organizations and public bodies have taken many actions to combat the crisis. Key measures are drug prescription control aimed at reducing opioid use, finding other pain management methods, and similar efforts. Societies can be critical participants in the struggle by providing information, helping those who suffer from addiction or severe pain, and taking other measures. Thus, everyone present here can take some actions and help save lives.
Perishable food products can be preserved for a long time by applying a preservation method to them. Boiling fruits and berries with honey or sugars, urinating, pickling, pickling, and other methods have been used by people for a long time. Food preservation has become ecologically important with difficult economic times, including the COVID-19 pandemic (Sridhar et al. 1715). Various methods of influencing microorganisms have been widely studied and have found practical use, making it possible to preserve food products without spoilage for a long time. There are several classifications of food preservation based on microbiological and spoilage mechanisms, on which it is possible to describe the main methods of preserving products.The first group includes storage methods based on the basic principle: they aim at maintaining life processes at
a reduced level but with the preservation of natural immunity. This principle is based on the storage of fresh fruits and vegetables and live fish storage (Sridhar et al. 1718). In the second group are storage methods based on the principle of abiosis, which aims to destroy microbes in the product. These include pasteurization, sterilization, the use of antiseptics, antibiotics, and sonication.Storage methods based on the principle of anabiosis aim to suspend the vital activity of microbes in products. At the same time, such conditions are created under which microorganisms can remain alive but not viable. These include: creating low temperatures, removing water from the product – drying, creating a high osmotic pressure with salt sugar, increasing acidity, and creating anaerobic conditions (Sridhar et al. 1719). Finally, storage
methods based on the principle of cenoanabiosis are aimed at using antagonistic relationships between microorganisms that make up the microflora of the product. At the same time, conditions are created for the development of microorganisms, which change the properties of the product in the course of their life activity to improve its nutritional and taste qualities. The waste products of these microorganisms inhibit the development of spoilage pathogens (Sridhar et al. 1726). The pickling of fruits and vegetables in fermented milk products is based on this principle.However, more innovative approaches are available today since the ones listed above have been known to history for a long time. Ultrasonic technology and ozone treatment are applied to products sensitive to heat. Even nanotechnology for food preservation is also being considered
(Sridhar et al. 1726). Nanoparticles are used as antimicrobial agents or in the fight against foodborne pathogens. Ultrasound, in turn, increases the efficiency of proteins, reduces aging time, and is used for sterilization and pasteurization (Sridhar et al., 1723). Moreover, an impulsive electric field is one of the newest methods of processing products. Typically, it is applied in drying, using less time to process products (Sridhar et al. 1727). Unlike thermal drying, this method is less energy-intensive but requires more control.In addition to classifying methods according to microbiological mechanisms of action on products for their preservation, several other classifications are also distinguished in the food industry. First, each product is evaluated by its spoilage mechanism; secondly, conservation is limited to technologies related to the processing of products and
their packaging. Spoilage is a natural process for foods and can be measured by the rate of spoilage and its mechanism. There are perishables, semi-perishables, and non-perishables. The first group, as a rule, includes products of animal origin – meat, eggs, dairy products, and the last – nuts, beans, oils, and flour.The spoilage mechanism includes physical effects, microbiological and chemical, which trigger the corresponding processes in the product, reducing its edibility. These mechanisms often work simultaneously, not excluding each other. Moisture content, crystallization, and temperature are the main mechanisms influencing the product (Amit et al. 10). Microbiological processes include the appearance of microorganisms and the environment in which they are convenient to multiply: such processes are usually referred to as fermentation. Chemicals include proteolysis, putrefaction, oxidation, and rancidity
(Amit et al. 11). Each of the spoilage mechanisms can be stopped or suspended by various conservation methods.As a rule, the fight is against physical mechanisms, so this group has the most significant number of possible preservation methods. Pasteurization, drying, and many others – most of them have already been listed above. Biological intervention highlights only the process of fermentation; strictly speaking, fermentation is fermentation. In other words, the decomposition processes of organic substances with a lack of oxygen, which usually occur in living organisms, are natural, and the problem in preserving the product is only the need to ensure the correct course of this process (Amit et al. 12). Chemical methods involve control of the pH group and conservation. For example, canning with ethyl alcohol is used
is becoming increasingly important in the world. The studied classifications suggest a division according to microbiological processes and spoilage mechanisms. Both classifications offer solutions that have been used for many centuries and are innovative and relevant today. Attention is paid not only to the processing of products but also to packaging. In the future, it may be possible to extend the shelf life of perishable goods and look for more environmentally friendly and less resource-intensive processing options such as nanotechnology and ultrasound.
Diana Kendall claims the current perception of the class has been a construct of the media and based on the construction, the meaning of class is determined. Kendall argues that the media has legitimized inequality in the United States through the assumption, with television programs and newspaper articles creating and reifying class-based stereotypes. Furthermore, Kendall argues that class discussions in the media are rarely explicit; however, their portrayals generate perspectives that impact human behavior. The upper class in society is portrayed positively, while the lower class is framed negatively.On the one hand, the upper class contains individuals that should be emulated, comprised of caring and generous people, and those with criminal records have remarkably good lives (Kendall 10). On the other hand, the lower class is framed as
with personalized suffering portray people detached from the broader contributing factors like unemployment, ignorance, laziness, or otherwise responsible people for their misfortunes (Kendall 94). Therefore, courtesy of the detachment, the life quality of the low-class individuals continues to deteriorate since the uneducated and the poor’s needs are overlooked. With attention given to upper-class individuals, the needs of the poor are not voiced; therefore, their lives continue to be exposed to deterioration risks.
It should be noted that the Undercover Boss episode of Rita’s Ice showcases the interaction of the company CEO, Linda L. Chadwick, with several of her franchisees. The selected job positions for the analysis are franchisee owner and treat team member. The first job position is franchisee owner based on the example of Hezrron, and the second one is a treat team member position based on the example of Pastiche.The analysis shows that the first job position requires a wide range of entrepreneurial skills and abilities since the franchise owner is practically a business owner who needs to adhere to the corporate standards. The second position is solely focused on cashier responsibilities, which puts an emphasis on human interactions as well as the ability to conduct financial transactions.
The similarity of the two positions is manifested in the fact that financial competence and communication skills are critical in both cases. However, the first position also requires additional operational and organizational management capabilities. The data collection for each job position analysis utilizes one-on-one interviews on-site, which means that both practical observations and additional questioning can be done. The key challenges and issues can also be derived on site since the interview is being conducted while the job positions are being performed.Job Description 1Job title: Franchise ownerLocation: Toms River, New JerseyTerms: Full timeAbout us: Rita’s Ice is a restaurant chain based in Bensalem, Pennsylvania, which was founded in 1984.

Although the Monster can be considered a bad character due to murdering people, the creature has good traits as well. The Monster is described as ugly and strong but at the same time, inexperienced. Firstly, Frankenstein’s creature is described as “its gigantic structure and the deformity of its aspect … instantly informed me that it was the wretch” (Shelley). Despite his ugly and terrifying appearance, the subject did not have the intention to kill people. The creature can be compared to a baby who tries to examine the world it lives in, and its actions are just contractions to the cruelty of the world. Frankenstein’s monster is not a real monster; it just seeks love and attention that the world cannot give him. The creature’s emotionalism is a
positive feature as it allows it to understand people’s feelings and share them.The “Gothic” elements of the novel include supernatural motives, the architecture from the Middle Ages, and the spiritual aspects of human nature. Other “Gothic” elements consist of the strive for knowledge, the Monster, and the probable moral fall of men. I like that genre because I like looking at diverse issues from various perspectives. This novel allows me to look at the actions of Victor Frankenstein and the Monster and understand their motives and feelings. I also appreciate novels that aim to show moral aspects of society with the utilization of different symbols, such as the Monster.Mary Shelley’s husband believed that inappropriate social relationships are the result of people becoming evil. To make people bad, other
Press freedom is an essential part of the right that communities enjoy in the modern world. It gives the people the ability to understand the insight of the government and other crucial activities happening within the country. Liberty of media through forms such as electronics and social media promotes transparency in the government’s operations and also creates a criticism of the roles it plays in ensuring it serves citizens accordingly. Despite the advantages of having reporters, some nations have policies and constitutions that limit what they are supposed to cover and report. If the media goes against the regulations, their freedom is withdrawn and the respective individual subjected to the court of law. In the United Arabs Emirates (UAE), the free will of publication and expression is connected
to some limitation that makes it sensitive. To be able to unveil the truth on significant matters, journalism liberty should be expressed freely.In UAE, the freedom of opinion expression and other forms of communications are subject to the law, making it challenging for the media to publish some information that the regulation prohibits. The country does not allow any form of media to criticize the government and other allied nations. The restriction makes it difficult for journalists to report some critical affairs the nation is undertaking or expose unlawful actions in practice. This makes the government have restrictive measures to protect its interest from the though stipulated laws.Federal law No. 15 of 1980 does not allow any individual to publish and share anything before obtaining permission from the
authority. Article 14 of the law concerning publication does not allow the printing media to publish any material for any party that does not bear UAE nationality (Younies & Na, 2020). It is mandatory to seek authorization from responsible bodies to produce the documents. Furthermore, the authority decides what type of journal to be printed for selling in the country. Similarly, the law does not allow anybody to distribute the newspapers and other forms of publications within public settings or along main roads without approval from proper authority.The law permits the authority to perform editing to the printed materials through deleting or covering the sensitive parts that are not allowed to be published. Before distributing the materials to the public, both at the national and international level, print
houses are required to present a sample of the journals to the authority for verification (Shishkina & Issaev, 2018). In case the media house produces a journal and its content contain what is not allowed to be printed, the authorization will be denied, or immediate censorship is performed to remove the section.Even though the UAE constitution allows freedom of expression where it links it with the country’s law, the regulation does not permit the liberty of communication. Media can publish any material but with adherence to the requirements (“UA E’s Constitution of 1971 with Amendments through 2004”, 2017). In UAE, the only publication the print houses and journalists are free to share is pro-government documents and voices. Anything that goes against the authority needs approval and possible editing
before airing or sharing through social platforms.In 2012, UAE formulated a law to help in combating the effect of cybercrime in the country. In relation to the Federal Decree No.5 of 2012, the legislature has taken advantage of the bylaw to enhance its restrictive measures on the freedom of media (Younies & Na, 2020). The regulation limits the liberty of expression and publication of documents that are against the religion, ruling authority, and other sensitive aspects that the government protects. This makes the decree have negative impacts on the country’s print houses and journalism practices. Dissemination of information and images that are perceived to put in danger the security and interrupt the public order attracts heavy punishment to the respective reporter.Various news reporters in the country have been
arrested and persecuted concerning violation of the penal codes set by the UAE authorities. This practice makes the journalists lose their rights and freedoms in the country (Zayadin, 2021). Both local and international correspondents who go against the requirement can be charged and sentenced to prison for violating the regulations. The oppression media receives makes it difficult to exercise their freedom of the press, which results in the publication of distorted information for public consumption.In the country, journalists are not allowed to publish information about private individuals. According to federal law No. 3, media is only allowed to print any information with the consent of the targeted person. This regulation is aimed at preventing damage to the reputation of people in the country (“Supervision Policy,” 2022). It, therefore,
becomes challenging for the press to freely express their opinions about the respected individuals in the nation.In the current world of technology, people easily publish and access information through online platforms. This can lead to the circulation of misleading information that can cause harm to the public order or targeted individual. With the restrictive measures in place, destructive news cannot find its way to interfere with the security system and wellbeing of the people. Having the penalties, individuals would restrain from taking advantage of the technology to tarnish the image and reputation of the government and other persons.The practice is important in limiting cybercrime activities that can harm the victims mentally and financially. Increased technology exposes citizens to various dangers from preys willing to extort innocent citizens their
and promotes the secrecy of the government from reaching the people. Such federal laws as Federal Decree No. 5 of 2012 deny the media freedom of publishing materials about individuals without their consent. Similarly, the constitution guarantees the liberty to communicate using any form of media but subjects the freedom to the law. The country’s authorities are allowed to exercise censorship of the published materials before their distribution to the public. Violation of the penal regulations may attract heavy punishment on the journalists and media houses. In this age of technology, repressive measures are essential in ensuring the protection of the citizens from the effects of cybercrime activities that might destroy reputations.
The jurisdiction of the journalism operations is dictated by the constitution of the United Arab Emirates (UAE). According to Öztunc & Pierre (2021), the UAE is ranked 119 in the global press freedom data, classifying the country as one of the most suppressive regarding the liberty of expression. Activities such as government censorship, bad press, limitation of journalistic opinions, and sanction threats are examples of oppressive measures to freedom.Various agencies, including the Universal Declaration of Human Rights (UDHR) and the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and International Cooperation (MoFAIC), have created proactive measures to portray press freedom (United Nations, 2021). However, the restrictions such as judicial harassment and censorship indicate a significant gap (Constitution, 2004). The reason is that the constitution is the only major directive that is binding,
offering no absolute rights. Therefore, the advantages of giving partial liberty to journalistic activities are to maintain peace, control the media, and protect the repressive regime’s interests.The freedom of independent reporting is the first indicator of press rights. The UAE’s rank in the global mark index portrays a system afraid of journalistic independence. This factor indicates that freedom is suppressed to ensure that the government controls everything on communication and information sharing (Öztunc & Pierre, 2021). According to Momen et al. (2020), half of the media fatalities occur in countries not at war. The UAE is known for business establishment and unmatched infrastructure, indicating high levels of peace and prosperity (Öztunc & Pierre, 2021). However, the right to expression is limited by the constitution that is ironically supposed
to protect their freedom.A story published by the Canberra Times news coverage depicts the level of repressive legislation against the media. Prosecutors in the UAE charged a sports journalist for leaking pre-match comments before the match between the country’s team and Iraq commenced (The Canberra Times, 2021). The journalist was then imprisoned after being convicted of hate speech and disruption of public peace. It remains unclear how his reporting was a hate speech considering the fact that he was reporting about the probability of a win, lose or draw in that world cup qualifier match. Through this incident, other broadcasters were also fired as punishment for disloyalty to the nation (The Canberra Times, 2021).Article 30 of the UAE constitution indicates that freedom of expression shall be granted verbally,
in writing, or within the limits of the law (Constitution, 2004). It is accurate to argue that the sports journalist had not defied the law since they were giving their opinion considering the description of this law. However, federal law no. 5 of 2012 indicates that sarcasm, defamation, and upsetting the public order through sensitive expression is illegal and can attract a jail term (Constitution, 2004). This statute creates a thin line between what is legal or unethical since the basis of judgment will depend on who is offended.The constitution’s provisions have created a leeway for oppression by justifying censorship, bad press, and limiting opinions to protect individual interests. The importance of this system is to fake justice through the partial implementation of the mandate prescribed (Öztunc &
Pierre, 2021). Such fragmented provisions enable the government to falsify, distort or conceal information concerning matters directly affecting its citizens for political mileage (Constitution, 2004). For instance, most media platforms in the UAE have not intensively addressed the issue of journalists’ unfair imprisonment, judicial executions, and deportation for fear of being punished, as indicated in the law (Momen, 2020). Such patterns have enabled the killings, torture, and harassment of media personnel’s an underreported plaque resulting in the surging number of deaths and imprisonment reported in the country.It is illegal to criticize the government, its affiliates, or any constitutional monarch or governing authorities. The Federal Law Code, no. 15 of 1980, is a statute governing privacy to journalistic commentaries and Publication and is one of the most stringent laws
in the Arab world (Constitution, 2004). The regulation allows for censorship and the prior distribution of national and international periodicals. The code justifies the reason for the scanty resources available addressing the extrajudicial killings occurring in this country. Through this censorship, harassment thrives, making it easier for the government to popularize propaganda and sustain authority.Ideally, freedom of the press should include the right to publish articles without being monitored and provide journalistic commentaries. The importance of such a system is to support better governance, eradicate impunity, and promote factual knowledge. When the media depicts information with accurate data, citizens can identify issues in government and communicate them for overall societal change (Momen, 2020). They can also use accurate information to promote justice by calling offenders to face the
law despite their status quo. For example, even the president can be jailed in some countries if they violate the law (Momen, 2020). Such processes are promoted by factual reporting that is not influenced by external factors. Additionally, independent reporting promotes factual knowledge by disseminating information that supports a unified awareness system.Therefore, the importance of partial freedom of expression in the press is to serve the interests of governing officials since they control all information displayed to the public through strict limitations (Momen, 2020). Despite all the negative effects of this censorship, one advantage is that it has promoted peace, considering most of the evil done by people in government is not published or condemned in public. This suppression system has supported the federation of absolute monarchies by
push for reform in case they notice any misappropriations in their governing systems. Therefore, censorship and judicial threats have controlled how the media portray certain individuals considering that the constitution protects them. Laws such as federal law code no. 15 of 1980 require that all public publications pass through a government editing system to ensure that none of the things written tarnishes their image. Many other laws protect the rulers’ interest, including federal law no. 5 of 2012, which threatens those who slander the government’s image. This situation raises curiosity about whether the constitution is for the people or an extension to protect the government.
Improper management and decision-making by Enron led to great problems. Because of this, it is particularly necessary to study the fundamental principles of company management. They emphasize three most important aspect such as the planning, organization, and control of activities. Based on this information, management planning is a valuable part of the functioning of the organization. However, it may change the fact that not all changes and decisions of the company can be met without resistance from employees. Another performance indicator is the relationship between management’s performance and employees’ perception and organization.This aspect plays a unique role for the organization since good employee relationships and diversity in the workplace are critical for making the most profit. Communication and various barriers associated with multiculturalism can affect the inability to
increase the performance indicators of employees. This may manifest itself in the impossibility of adequate and correct communication of people among themselves, which requires the introduction of special measures to unite the team. Among them, the first may be the creation of a favorable atmosphere in the workplace (Lan et al., 2020). This measure implies the introduction of various team-building practices and the division of work tasks between groups.Management Plan RecommendationsFirst of all, it should be emphasized that with the help of the fundamental principles of management, the company can not only improve its key performance indicators and profits but also gain a leading position in the market. In addition, it will help in creating comfortable conditions for employees and will have a positive impact on the decision-making
process and result in increased performance. Factors that can negatively affect management are the lack of qualification of specialists, resistance on the part of employees, and the unwillingness of the company to change for the better. An essential step in the implementation of fundamental principles is organization and phasing to avoid negative consequences.Maintaining and monitoring the application of ethical principles to fundamental aspects of management is also critically important for business. For a better understanding of this process, it is necessary to take into account the rational decision-making model. It assumes that employees will work to increase benefits for themselves and the company while minimizing costs (Koechlin, 2020). Therefore, monitoring can mainly be carried out using surveys or analysis of key performance indicators for a given period of
Future DirectionsBased on a detailed review of the corporation, it is worth identifying clear vectors for future development. First of all, Automatic Data Processing makes software for managing the HR side of enterprises. This includes outsourcing of personnel management through the ADP TotalSource cloud platform, payment of salaries. In both segments, the company receives revenue from interest from the placement of client money in the bank. The company manages the payroll of clients, and until the employees of the serviced enterprises receive a salary, Automatic Data Processing can dispose of this money, this brings 3.7% of the company’s revenue. The latest report does not provide information on overseas sales (Bauer et al., 2019, p. 77). The Fiscal Year 2019 report indicated that overseas sales accounted for 14.2% of
the company’s revenue, with the remainder being done in the US. The combination of the above facts suggests that the company needs to move towards attracting customers and investors.At the same time, it should be noted that Automatic Data Processing has extremely effective tools for fulfilling such goals. Given that the company is tied to HR, investors expected a powerful drop in profits and revenues in the second, coronavirus quarter, when most of the economy was quarantined. According to the annual report, the company has approximately 810,000 customers, none of which contribute more than 2% of its revenue (Bauer et al., 2019, p. 98). This is an essential key because it strengthens ADP’s bargaining position: big clients like to haggle and demand big discounts.In addition, there is another
vital vector for the development of a corporation, namely technology. The bottom line is that at the moment the atmosphere in our country is favorable for the potential of corporations working remotely. The same affects Automatic Data Processing, which needs to be given maximum attention in modernization. In addition, technology allows not only to improve existing products but also to create new ones (Wolters Kluwer Editorial Staf, 2021). However, it is worth emphasizing that it is expensive and unprofitable to do it yourself, therefore it is intertwined with the previous goal. Finally, companies should pay attention to the process of connecting organizations, that is, combining them into common databases. In this case, the quality of the services provided by the organization will not suffer, but the costs of
maintaining Internet resources will significantly decrease.Potential Problems and RecommendationsDespite the stability and growth of the company, it is worth noting that it is worth considering potential problems that you may encounter. It’s important to note that while the company doesn’t disclose what percentage of SMB revenue it generates, it’s easy to assume it’s very high. Of the company’s 810,000 clients, 640,000 are small businesses, 70,000 are medium and large, and 500 are large corporations (Allman-Ward & Allman-Ward, 2018, p. 64). Another 65 thousand are companies outside the United States, probably quite large. In general, Automatic Data Processing certainly earns the main money in small enterprises. According to a survey by the American National Federation of Independent Enterprises (NFIB), American entrepreneurs need help. 22% of entrepreneurs plan to start
dismissing workers after money issued by the US government will end. Because of this, the revenue of Automatic Data Processing will decrease, which will slow down the development in the field of technology.The threat may be an increase in the number of enterprises that have closed permanently. Here everything will depend on the outcome of the debates of legislators in the US. In the long term, of course, they have shown a willingness to support small and medium-sized businesses, but the debate may drag on, especially in connection with the escalation of political confrontation in the United States. If aid arrives late or its volume is less than necessary, real mass bankruptcies of enterprises will begin. Automatic Data Processing pays $3.64 in dividends per share per year (Bauer
et al., 2019, p. 74). With a share price of $133 dollars, it turns out 2.7% per annum, which is not bad, but dividend payments are 94.1% of the company’s profit (Allman-Ward & Allman-Ward, 2018, p. 103). At the same time, according to the latest report, Automatic Data Processing has large debts: 33.413 billion dollars of debt against 4.368 billion dollars at the disposal of the company (Allman-Ward & Allman-Ward, 2018, p. 111). If ADP decides to cut or cancel dividends, then the stock will fall even lower than it is now and will slowly recover. However, the company does not have the worst business foundation, and the prospects it mentioned of a 3-4% decline in revenue and 14% in profit this year are already priced into the
lower, but it will take longer for them to recover. From the point of view of investors, who are the main source of income in the company, this will be a sign that it is profitable to work into the company.In turn, corporations need to redistribute their income so that most of it goes to technology. The fact is that it is equipment and technological relevance that are the main advantages of the company over competitors. It is necessary to improve this area, which is expensive and unprofitable for investment without investors. However, if the management ignores this need, then the corporation can give way to the leader quickly catching up with competitors.
An outstanding history concerning India touches on its moral icon, Mahatma Gandhi. Also called Bapu, Gandhi was India’s first prime minister after helping the nation attain independence through non-violence actions. Instead of using armies, Indians used fasting to compel Britons to leave the country, making it (India) very unique. Studies on ethics never proceed without mentioning Gandhi. Bapu holds almost the same respect as Aristotle on morality and the need for social stability. Bearing an association with Gandhi thus makes Indians very happy. Many people and organizations in the republic purpose to promote the first primer’s morality standards, with some attaining significant success. However, Gandhi’s philosophy on the nation’s social, economic, and political realms is highly corrupted. Therefore, the following discussion reviews the leader’s principles on morality, inter-religious
relations, and long-term influence. Covering the leader’s canons on the different aspects helps differentiate Bapu’s real stands from today’s tarnished interpretations.Morality has several meanings, including the system of standards and values differentiating good and ill. Ethics is the philosophical brand under which character is studied. Aristotle and Mahatma Gandhi are the two renowned morality leaders in history. The former was a Greek scholar with profound influence on global ethics, while Gandhi’s inspiration mainly thrives in India. Mahatma was India’s first prime minister after helping the nation realize independence through non-violent means. Several literary sources contain the leader’s values for the Indian and global citizens. However, Tushar Gandhi stands out as a reliable primary source for those seeking Gandhi’s philosophy on morality. The author is the great-grandson of India’s
first prime minister and provides straightforward narratives bearing the reality on the icon’s stands.Gandhi’s morality covers several subjects, including politics, parenting, integrity, social interactions, and the use of fasting as a tool. Bapu views political leadership as an opportunity to serve, not exploit people. The leader also maintains the need for politicians to remain below the law to protect its (the law’s) sanctity (144). Gandhi starts his speech by apologizing to the audience concerning the family’s inability to provide another icon. According to the author, almost all the individuals in the Indian government and political arena go against Bapu’s morality principles. Gandhi (142) refers to the current public insults among the Indian leaders in fighting corruption as a significant deviation from Mahatma’s principles. Anna is a public icon
who thinks that calling the other leaders names amounts to cleansing oneself. Instead of tarnishing the other party’s reputation, the speaker maintains that the best way is to ensure that one is clean and then use the proper channels to bring the corrupt folks to account.The use of fasting in contemporary India also goes against Mahatma Gandhi’s principles of morality. Gandhi (142) says that Bapu’s mission thrives on making the means and the ends equally important. Accordingly, the fasting public figures must know why they are doing that to cause the appropriate effects. To reiterate this account, Gandhi (141) provides a narrative featuring Bibi Amutussalam, one of the nation’s renowned female public figures. Bibi was a social worker in Noakhali and a disciple of Bapu. A social conflict
involving the destruction of an Indian temple in the village and the stealing of liturgical swords from the worship center by Muslims takes place during Bibi’s days, according to Gandhi (142). The disciple then tries retrieving the swords by going into the Islamic villages but fails. She then results to fasting to force the two conflicting communities to come together and the Muslims to return all the three stolen swords. The community returns two swords until the twenty-first day of Bibi fasting, during which society members seek her to take something.Bapu’s response on learning about Bibi’s actions implies the need for considerate fasting. Bibi refuses to eat until all the three swords taken from the destroyed temple are back. Coupled with the disciple’s importance in society, Bibi’s many
days of fasting make many people afraid. The two rifting communities also come together to take care of Bibi, who remains adamant. On learning about the incident, Mahatma Gandhi writes to Bibi, asking her to be clear on whether her fasting is to bring Muslims and Indians together or is meant for personal destruction (Gandhi 142). However, Bibi decides to maintain the fast against Bapu’s advice. Consequently, Gandhi responds with the following words, which show the need for consideration when fasting for the public good.“She is unyielding. And if she wishes to die, then let her pass on. She does not comprehend or recognize that the intention is to bring together the hearts and not retrieve the weapons. Let us not discard our time on her…” (Gandhi 142).Mahatma
Gandhi’s moral principles on the judiciary demand that the government’s arm remains fair to all the people regardless of the political class or social status. According to Gandhi (145), India’s judicial system lives significantly contrary to Bapu’s moral requirements. The author notes that many poor people go to prison for minor offenses, while the powerful operate over the law. Furthermore, even the acquitted low-class Indians continue staying in jail because no lawyers will help them get out. Many acquitted fellows need someone to deliver their exoneration letters from the courts to the prisons, but no one is ready to undertake the job. Instead, almost all the attorneys in India cherish working for the wealthy individuals exhibiting corruption cases. The lawyers use their influence and law knowledge to secure
the corrupt elite group’s freedom (Gandhi 145). Accordingly, India’s courts and lawyers fail to live by Gandhi’s moral philosophy and should change.Mahatma Gandhi’s ethics on parenting also want parents to control the amount of freedom granted to children. Gandhi (144) provides a narrative involving Bapu and Arun, his beloved grandson. According to the author, Arun wants to take his grandfather’s photograph after securing a camera. He requests the senior Gandhi to take the snap, but Bapu denies requiring Arun to pay five rupees for the photo (Gandhi 144). The requirement comes from the fact that Gandhi charges public members interested in acquiring his signed autobiography, a project that Arun manages. The Arun one day takes his grandfather’s photo when the icon is busy. On learning about the grandson’s
action, Mahatma confiscates the camera until Arun’s parents pay five rupees to the prime minister. The matter makes the great-grandson very hungry because he believes he should never pay for something he owns; the grandfather. Gandhi realizes Arun’s madness, after which he softly tells Arun that failing to do to his grandson what he does to the public denies him the moral authority to exercise the policy on others.Mahatma Gandhi’s moral principles object to the “eye for an eye” practice in Indian politics today. Gandhi (145) compares Anna and Manish and Mahatma, Hitler, and Winston Churchill to show the difference. According to the speaker, Anna and Manish present a mistaken version of Indian politics by engaging each other on the stage. Instead of retaliating, Gandhi (145) insists on
turning the other cheek to the oppressor for the sake of peace and morality. Nonetheless, the speaker notes that ignoring the accuser forms the best way to turn the other cheek and not give up one’s face for buttering (Gandhi 146). Consequently, the account reiterates Mahatma Gandhi’s non-violence actions, which Indians need to re-introduce for real ethicalness. Other moral values from Bapu’s ways include perseverance, moral victory, and conservation, which are lacking in contemporary Indian and global societies.Mahatma Gandhi’s ethics on inter-religious associations maintain the need to quit dogma-based religion and faith to a belief system that appreciates humanity and its shared origin. The former prime minister thus disregards violent religious systems that brand people and other religious groups as “others”. Other than taking religion as an alien
aspect, Gandhi maintains that there can never be religion without humanity, thus the need for humans to recognize the essence of free interaction. Mahatma serves as an example of what he preaches to the people about religions. For example, the leader remained grounded in Hinduism but often read and analyzed other religions’ writings and teachings (Howard 4). Moreover, Gandhi encourages his disciples and followers to engage in genuine conversations with the other religions to gather more knowledge about God and humanity.Bapu further accepts and supports intermarriages between individuals from different religious backgrounds, bringing a better understanding of humanity and making religion a moral issue. Howard further (5) reiterates Gandhi’s message that understanding various spiritual teachings promotes diversity in reasoning and knowing God. As such, the leader says that
experimenting on the other religions creates adequate views worth supporting interreligious associations for mutual respect and deep understanding, instead of mere tolerance (Howard 5). Gandhi’s teaching on the religion subject thus forms a crucial part in the contemporary world where people fight others on religion basis. Appreciating Bapu’s moral principles on religion provides an excellent way for the world to avert the many religion-attached wars, such as those between Christians, Muslims, Hindus, and all the other groups.Studying Mahatma Gandhi and his moral influence is crucial for the continued application of his values. According to Weber (147), Gandhism is significantly non-existent in the contemporary world, with Vinoba Bhave and Jayaprakash Narayan being two of the most significant followers of Gandhism in history. The lack of literary material concerning the
credited with the non-violence demonstrations using fasting and hunger strikes. The leader utilized this strategy to secure India’s independence, which he calls moral victory. India continuously shifts away from Gandhi’s ethical principles in several aspects. For example, the nation’s current politicians engage in corruption and public insults against Gandhi’s “cheek philosophy.” Other issues covered in this work concern Gandhi’s stands on interreligious links and his long-term significance.
The concept of “gender roles” is often applied to the analysis and comprehension of writings from various historical periods. These responsibilities appear to have been firmly defined during the Anglo-Saxon period. The poem Beowulf belongs to the epic or heroic poetry genre, which has poems that commemorate the characters’ brave and martial actions. Women are portrayed as belongings for the advantage of the men throughout Beowulf and are made to support the male characters. In addition, women are utilized as plot devices to advance the story tale of men. Women, on the other hand, are a minor character in the plot, their presence being overshadowed by the men.The queen of the Swedes was given no name, her identity being secondary to her status as the king’s wife, Onela.
The article of Zulaika (2022) presents the impact of COVID-19 lockdowns on adolescent pregnancy and school dropout among secondary school girls in Kenya. The cases of teenage pregnancy started in Kenya after the country-wide school closure that started from March 2020 and lasted until January 2021. Zulaika (2022) examine to what extent the pandemic affected sexual and reproductive health of adolescents in Rarieda subcounty. The study shows there was a limited involvement of health administrators on the issue of pregnancy among school girls. Teenagers lack sexual education and are not aware of different methods of protection. Health administrators should find this issue important as early pregnancy can be dangerous for girls’ health and lead to various socio-economic problems in the future. Moreover, if such a rate of adolescent
on girls that are going to school. Students should be educated for the basics of sexual education and for the side effects of sexual life. Furthermore, the article points out that infectious diseases can be spread rapidly if school girls do not know the importance of contraceptives. As such, there is a need to the national project of informing school students and their parents about sexual and reproductive issues. The effects of COVID-19 on teenage pregnancy are negative, causing additional social and economic problems not only for the pregnant girls and their families but also for the whole country.
In the prehistoric and ancient works of art, the representation of women and men reveals a massive imbalance in gender equity that favors men over women. The males were presumed superior and of great salience in the community, while the females were viewed as subordinates (Seejarim). The Venus of Willendorf is the first prehistoric art that presented women in art, and it was discovered in Austria. Perceptions of gender have been transformed into visual arts and representations. During the Old stage, men and women played different roles and responsibilities in the family (Seejarim). While men were assigned hunting, women were responsible for gathering, caring for children, and preserving racial conformity.Unlike most women’s artistic depictions, the Venus of Willendorf, found in Austria, celebrates the female body without sexualization. The
woman of Willendorf was seen as a fertility figure for recreation, fetish of good luck, and a representation of motherhood made by men for the appreciation of men (Seejarim). This is evident through the characteristics of Venus; she is soft, and round, her breasts are large, and her hips full.The Kouros statue represents the male gender, and it depicts them as powerful and muscular, suiting their dominating roles over the female gender. This artistic work represents the society that has been taken over by the boychild in the importance of leadership and supremacy in the community (Uçar). The Venus of Willendorf portrays the role women have been assigned in society based on their features like large breasts, enlarged hips, and round, signifying that women are responsible for giving
birth and caring for children. Being soft and having a prominent kneecap suggests that women are good at preserving tribal harmony, unlike the male gender in society.In addition, the Venus of Willendorf depicts that women were seen not to have any functional role in the community as they are only seen for their bodies and fertility increasing the tribes. The Kouros, on the other hand, clearly defines that the male gender is given the role of a leader in society (Uçar). They are also supposed to go hunting to provide for the family as it portrays the male gender to be solid and muscular, thus dominating the female gender. Kouros also evidently describes gender inequality in leadership since only the male child has been given the responsibility of
culture (Uçar). It is seen that Kouros body was not covered to show the ideal muscular body of the male gender clearly.In contrast, the body of Korai was fitted with loose garments to hide her curves and generally feminine features, seeming to protect her innocence. This suggests how well the male gender was conserved and looked at in ancient Greek society (Seejarim). Unlike the female gender, the males dominated society and were seen as the strong holders of the community, and their presence was always appreciated.
IntroductionThe patient is a 32-year-old woman who has missed her menstrual cycle over three weeks and continues visiting a tanning salon weekly. She does not take a folic acid supplement because she has no concerns about her pregnancy. The decision to have a maternal serum marker test is recommended to check the mother’s blood. It helps identify any birth defects or chromosomal disorders known as genetic pathology that could provoke developmental or cognitive delays in a baby (Wojcik et al., 2020). The primary care provider offers a plan of care, including 600 mg of folic acid daily and education on the risk of skin cancer.Pathology: Explanation and Plan of CareThe plan of care does not contain serious steps but taking supportive supplements and education on the possible tanning-related
risks like skin cancer. Ultraviolet radiation (UV) from human-made sources may affect the fetus’ birth weight due to nitric oxide exposure and the mother’s overall health (UVA reduces blood pressure and challenges the immune system (Botyar & Khoramroudi, 2018). The patient should consider the relationship between oncogenesis and pregnancy and consider folic acid to maintain birth defects.Teratogenic Effect of Not Taking a Folic Acid SupplementPregnancy is a period when a woman experiences many changes in her health and basic needs, and the task is to make sure the fetus receives enough vitamins. Folic acid is a common supplement during pregnancy to make new cells and prevent the development of the teratogenic effect. Folate deficiency leads to increased neural tube defects observed in 5 to 20 per 10,000 births
(Brown & Wright, 2020). In this case, the risks include brain (Down syndrome) or spine (spina bifida) defects because the woman does not take the supplement.Inclusion of a Maternal Serum Marker TestThe maternal serum marker test is necessary to check the mother’s blood and identify any birth defects in the fetus. The risks of neural tube defects exist because the woman has not taken folic acid during her first weeks of pregnancy. Thus, the primary care provider has to exclude the possibility of chromosomal disorders and predict the development of genetic conditions due to folate deficiency.Vulnerability of the Fetus Based on Trimesters and Teratogens and the Role of the Folic Acid SupplementThe patient has concerns about her possible pregnancy, which means she is in her first trimester. This
period is characterized by developmental changes like the formation of the spine, arms, legs, head, and heart. The second and third trimesters are less serious, with minor birth defects being developed. Such teratogens as alcohol, smoking, and unnecessary medications may be dangerous for fetus development. The woman should use the folic acid supplement to improve the neural tube condition and reduce teratogens’ effects.UVA and UVB Rays in the Process of Oncogenesis in Skin CellsUV radiation consists of UVA and UVB rays that penetrate deeply into the human skin, provoking genetic damage. UVA rays affect the dermis increasing the chances of wrinkles and immune suppression, and UVB, compared to sunlight, is a risk factor for melanoma and carcinoma (Botyar & Khoramroudi, 2018). This type of radiation destroys cell DNA
and text messaging or social media are the best digital health technologies in this case (Kuwabara et al., 2019). It is important to communicate on different topics about pregnancy.ConclusionIn general, this case introduces the woman with concerns about pregnancy and does not take anything to protect the child and create a favorable environment. Tanning is not recommended because of the risk for genetic disorders like skin cancer. Folic acid should be regularly taken to promote the fetus’s development and safe growth. Communication and education with healthcare providers are vital for this female patient.
Genetically modified organisms (GMOs) have become a part of all humans’ lives, but they remain a debatable issue thus far. Some people argue that it is not ethical to change any genetic information and play God (MacKinnon & Fiala, 2017). However, I believe that GMOs are only another advancement in people’s lives as the creation of machines, cars, or spaceships. GMOs (be it a plant or animal) are a part of my life as well, as I have consumed GMO-based products. I am not concerned about long-term effects as much as some of my peers since I find GMOs to be a product of selection that has been in place for centuries. People have noticed some properties they considered to be appropriate for them and tried to grow
IntroductionGenetics and genomics refer to two concepts that keenly study genes which are the basic operational unit of a living organism. Both genetics and genomics offer invaluable insights into the structure and function of the human body. The knowledge acquired from these two fields is vital in dictating the development of medicine and other health sciences. This essay is an analysis of these two fields and consists of six crucial sections. The first part differentiates genetics from genomics, enabling the distinction between the two disciplines. The second section offers invaluable insight into the role of nursing in the two fields. The third section highlights the ethical consideration in research into the two fields. The fourth dwells on the global utilization of genetics and genomics research while the fifth
is an analysis of the influence of various factors on the utilization of genomics and genetics in healthcare. The final section is the conclusion that pieces together the knowledge from all the sections and offers direction. Genetics and genomics are amongst the fastest-growing fields that highlight the next crucial stage in healthcare development hence their value is undeniable.Differences Between Genetics and GenomicsGenetics refers to study of genes and their functions in the inheritance of various traits amongst humans. This field analyzes how human beings pass down various characteristics to their offspring and the processes involved in the transfer (Marchant et al., 2020). This study also analyzes the impact of the genes transferred to various people. Genes are the primary unit studied in genetics and this term refers to
basic units of heredity. Genes carry instructions that direct the manufacture of various proteins within the body. These instructions coordinate the manufacture of proteins such as hormones, enzymes, cells, and muscles.These proteins are crucial in regulating various biological functions including sleep, growth and reproduction, breathing, digestion, and cognitive activity amongst others (Marchant et al., 2020). Genetics also identifies the diseases that can occur whenever an error is encountered in the ability of genes to direct the activity of the body. These diseases include cystic fibrosis, Huntington’s disease, and phenylketonuria and exhibit heredity (Marchant et al., 2020). This implies that the study of genetics can identify people at a high risk of developing these diseases and predict whether offspring can have them.Genomics on the other hand is a recent
terminology that describes the analysis of all of a human’s genes, referred to as the genome. It investigates the interaction of these genes with each other and the person’s environment. Genomics also studies complex diseases such as heart disease, asthma, diabetes, and cancer since these diseases are caused by genetic variation. Genomics aims to offer new possibilities for therapy, diagnostic procedures, and treatment for some complex diseases (Marchant et al., 2020). One of the most remarkable contributions of genomics is stem cell therapy that enables the replacement of the faultiest cells in the body using cells referred to as stem cells. These stem cells can develop into any human cell and are therefore cultured with this sole purpose. Once ripe, these cells are used to replace injured body
organs and ensure healing.The Role of Nursing in Genetics and GenomicsNursing ensures the role of genetics and genomics through its involvement in research. The nursing profession encourages the involvement of professionals in research initiatives that enable the growth of this field (Beery et al., 2018). Additional research enables the discovery of new knowledge that is vital in ensuring disease is combated. Nursing also contributes to genomics through the popularization of the alternatives presented by these specialties. Nurses are some of the most exposed healthcare professionals, dealing with many patients. Their widespread interaction provides them with an opportunity to impact knowledge to millions of people whenever healthcare scenarios befitting the genomics alternatives are presented. Nursing also provides nurses with an opportunity to venture into a specialty of genetics called
genetic nursing.The professionals within this field are called genetic nurses. The involvement of specialists within this specific field ensures that the specialty is accorded the serious focus it deserves. Genetic nurses are availed with ample time to focus on this field and propagate its growth through research and experimentation. The implementation of the techniques with a genetic background ensures that treatments with this base are fast-tracked and approved.Nursing ensures that the fields of genetics and genomics achieve practice and approval through the various nursing organizations. Global and national nursing associations have been at the forefront of ensuring that genetics and genomics are approved by the governments and global associations such as the WHO. This involves implementing their advisory mandate to the leaders in the healthcare fields and directing
them to approve genetics and genomics (Hickey et al., 2018). These efforts have put adequate pressure on these organizations to offer sufficient funding to this research and also approve clinical trials of the various suggested genetics methods. The increased attention by governments and healthcare organizations has in turn caused an increase in the usage of these services in general and the growth of this field. Accessibility for more people has also been made possible with developing nations also embracing this revolution in healthcare.Ethical Considerations with Research Involving Genetics and GenomicsWhen genetic and genomic research occurs, the data on the genomic sequence of individuals is required to be accessible to these participants. When this data is availed, it may reveal disturbing discoveries such as the possibility of developing cancer
within the next few years. This is worrying for a patient who was previously unaware of the possibility and may cause anxiety in the patient and their families (Coughlin, 2020). The ethical issue of whether human beings want to be aware of what is happening in their bodies arises here. Additionally, the individual may be informed of the possibility of the occurrence of a chronic illness such as diabetes from genetic research. This disease may fail to occur and cause unnecessary worry and panic for the individual and their family, causing widespread mistrust in genetics and genomics.Alternatively, the information about an individual may be discovered and withheld by the researchers. The aftermath of this is that a patient may develop the discovered condition and succumb to the disease
partly due to late discovery and inadequate preparation. In this situation, the researcher is seen to have committed ethical injustice to the participant and harm public trust (Coughlin, 2020). In other scenarios, the researcher may be required to reveal the data collected on the genetic differences between the individuals participating. The variations may display some individuals negatively with a myriad of conditions likely to affect them in the future. In the unanticipated circumstances when employers or health insurance companies access this information, they are likely to discriminate against people.Employers are likely to offer opportunities to individuals unlikely to develop a chronic disease that would be unprofitable due to sick leaves. Insurance companies are also likely to charge people with the likelihood of developing chronic diseases differently from others.
This creates the issue of inequality and possible discrimination based on genetic predisposition.How Genetics and Genomics Research is Conducted and Utilized GloballyGenetic and genomics research is conducted in willing individuals whenever the researchers have a specific hypothesis to test. The research requires the necessary approval from all the organizations involved including the government institutions involved. This research requires the involvement of high-level technology that enables the analysis of the data. Additionally, researchers must collect samples from their participants or patients, extract the genetic information, and carry out the tests required (Stark et al., 2019). Genetic research is conducted whenever researchers want to establish the impact of certain environmental factors on various human aspects. This research is also conducted whenever there is a need to establish the possibility of
certain individuals developing certain conditions. This is mainly guided by heredity whereby one family member contracts a certain disease and there is a need to rule out the possibility of others having the same disease.Genetics and genomics research has been vital in advancing cloning, a technique that replicates exact copies of desired organisms or cells. Cloning is vital in developing identical cells for a certain organ and replacing the damaged cells in that specific organ (Brown, 2020). Cloning identifies the exact genetic composition of the damaged cells and initiates protocols that generate replicas. This includes the generation of cells for a damaged liver where a researcher acquires cells from the victim.They sequence these cells and grow replicates of the liver cells before replacing them to ensure the patient
has a functional liver. Genetics and genomics have also been vital in the development of medicines for the treatment of various conditions. The study of the genes and the various processes involved has been crucial in enabling researchers to identify certain pathways that can be manipulated (Morrell et al., 2019). Upon identification of a pathway that is affected in the occurrence of a certain disease, researchers develop medicines that target this mechanism. The drugs rectify the error and prevent the occurrence of the anticipated disease or reverse the damage to assure health for the victim.Impact of Culture on Genetic/GenomicsGenetics and genomics are well-advanced fields in healthcare that have achieved massive challenges in usage due to cultural and religious beliefs. Some people may have access to these services but
avoid using them due to the belief that such scientific advances contravene their beliefs (Modell et al., 2019). Certain religions discourage their members from seeking scientific medical care due to the stigma associated with this form of healthcare. This includes using fields such as genetics due to the belief that modern practices interfere with their faith. They believe that scientific research is akin to competing with their supreme deity and that such investigations are too detailed for the liking of their supreme being. Some religions believe that science competes with the perfect work of creation executed by their deity. They encourage their believers to subscribe to the things taught and to disregard genetic and genomic medical aid, hence minimal usage.Some health beliefs are misled and encourage people to
wait in earnest for recovery and this has led to the deaths of people who could be helped. Some family values encourage the treatment of members who become enlightened and compassionate towards genetics with distaste. They treat these people as outcasts and discourage associating with these people within their spheres of influence. Some people, though knowledgeable, avoid association with genetics and genomics out of the fear of banishment due to traditions. The traditions highlight extensive reliance on outdated health practices. The culture of mistrust towards western medicine that birthed genetics and genomics is widespread in some parts of the world (Scherr et al., 2019). This is due to the dark history associated with western medicine such as human experimentation and torture. The dark ages highlighted a period of
promises to combat more diseases through prevention before their occurrence and cure before their deterioration. Genetics and genomics also encounter difficulties arising from family differences and religious differences. There is a need for widespread sensitization amongst all people on the importance of genetics and genomics. Further research into the two is also paramount to ensure more alternative treatment protocols are discovered and perfected for the sake of the patients.
The first farewell address to the nation in US history was made by the country’s first elected president, George Washington. In the fall of 1796, a letter of 32 handwritten pages was published in the Philadelphia Daily Advertiser. This address, which became Washington’s real political testament, is still considered one of the most important documents in American history. Washington’s address contained many ideas that for more than two hundred years continue to have a direct impact on US foreign and domestic policy, as well as on the process of formation of the American nation. The main thing that Washington did was that he refused to hold the presidency for more than two terms, although he had the right to do so: the amendment to the US Constitution that
legalized this rule was adopted only in 1947.Analyzing Washington’s farewell speech, it should be noted that the president not only said goodbye, but also gave instructions to the entire nation. He considered the most important element of the success of the state and society to be the preservation and promotion of peaceful coexistence with all forces. Such forces include not only neighboring states, but also different races and religions. Washington himself repeatedly refers to God’s laws, believing that they condemn any discord or disrespect (Sands, 2019). Just as in the Bible there is a ban on the creation of an idol, so the president did not advise becoming attached to any strong players in the political arena; instead, he insists on America’s independent incremental development.However, Washington’s position on
racial conflicts and divisions is highly ambiguous. On the one hand, the president proposes a respectful and peaceful coexistence of all representatives of the races to create a single full-fledged society. On the other hand, the founding father did not vehemently oppose slavery, which contradicts his stance in farewell (Hayes, 2020). This does not mean that Washington is acting hypocritically or having double standards, because it is worth considering the context of the times. However, there is a point of view in which racial coexistence should not be attributed to the values of the president.It is also worth noting that Washington has flagged potential red flags for the state, as well as issued several warnings to the nation. Washington warned that the most serious threat to American democracy
came from internal disunity rather than outside interference (Sands, 2019). He foresaw the possibility of foreign influence on the American political system and the coming to power of a president who, neglecting national interests, would become the personification of the threat of despotism. He pleaded with the Almighty to ease the impact of presidential mistakes and expressed the hope that America would forgive him (Sands, 2019). Washington has set a standard for its moral wear and tear, fearing that its self-importance could become a threat to democracy.Washington’s most far-reaching warnings concerned the threat of secession. In his opinion, if one group begins to dominate the other, then this can lead to a more formed and permanent despotism. This explains the point of view that it was defying Washington’s
Ghalib is an Indo-Persian poet that was writing in the Urdu language and became popular and influential in the XIX century. The lifestyle and conduct of Ghalib were inspiring people, saving faith and belief in their hearts during harsh times. The poem chosen for this assignment is “The “Godless” Lover.” The name of this work refers to the Islamic government dubbing Ghalib godless. Still, in many lines of the poet, one can find Koranic characters and reflections about the relationship between a human and the Creator. Ghalib, in this poem, emphasizes the meaning of God to his soul and puts special stress on the initial presence of God. All the people, according to Ghalib, are the result of creation that would not have mattered if they existed or
not without God. It is especially evident in the following lines:When there was nothing, there was GodIf nothing had been, God would have beenMy very being has been my downfallIf I hadn’t been, what would it have mattered?Various tones come across in the poem: negative and positive, and it might depend on the reader and his current condition. Ghalib states that God has always been there for a human, and even if there is no hope and it seems that the world has ended, God will be there to help each soul. The tone of the narrator depends on the perceptions of the reader, his experience, and his current state. The author of this paper tends to believe the poem’s tone is positive, and it reminds of eternal
and unbreakable things a man can refer to. Even if the process of human creation would not have existed, a human would still have been united with God.Robert Bly expressed similar thoughts with the help of different words. He stated: “Our perception of ‘things’ as real doesn’t quite fit with the idea that they don’t actually exist. One Muslim belief sees the universe we know as a mixture of the Existent and the Non-Existent. Things such as trees, streets, people, and clouds all belong to Non-Existence: they are only shadows thrown by a genuinely existent sun.” The genuinely existent sun here is God, and all the people, nature, and other inevitable items of human life are shadows. Staying close to the sun is staying close to God and
and truth. Listening to the poems discloses the meaning of the poem deeper and differs significantly from reading the text.Ghalib is a central figure in Indo-Persian culture as he transferred faith via his poems, raising essential questions for a human. The most important items for an individual are hope and the connection to it, seeking the answers to the initial existence of things, and staying devoted to it. Ghalib was an example of a strong person who never lost hope even after harsh moments of his life. The poem “The “Godless” Lover” underlines the attitude of Ghalib to God and God’s connection to human beings.
The issue of the internationalization of companies is a phenomenon that has consistently attracted the attention of researchers in the field of management. In the last decade, the focus has shifted from considering the benefits and risks of internationalization to studying the strategies of international companies operating and developing. However, it should be remembered that globalization acts as a kind of institutional environment for global companies, characterized by high uncertainty and risks and a non-monotonous, dynamic nature.The main incentive for the globalization and internationalization of the company is a significant expansion of market opportunities, both production, and trade.This is also connected with the benefits gained from implementing an international strategy, namely the growth of the company’s market, economies of scale and learning, and, of course, the advantages of
future.Given the benefits of international diversification, some firms choose not to expand internationally for several reasons. The most common of these is the reluctance to go beyond the domestic market of their homeland (Paul & Mas, 2019). This suggests either an unwillingness to face the risks of globalization or an initial calculation of opportunities, taking into account only the company’s home market factors. Moreover, an important reason for the rejection of globalization may be the awareness of problems faced with a foreign market, its characteristics, and potential consumers’ culture, religion, and customs. Thus, the global strategy has its colossal advantages and disadvantages that can push the company away from this approach.
Gnomial Functions Inc. wants to determine the most reliable forecasting technique for determining the sales level for the next eighteen months. The sales trend reflected a consistent increase over the last 18 months with minimal seasonal variation. However, the sales for recent months reflected had more significance on the following months sales (Wisniewski, 2016). Consequently, Gnomial Functions Inc. should use the weighted moving average to forecast the most likely level of sales.The weighted moving average used four weights to determine the likely level of sales in the next month. These weights ranged from 0.1 to 0.4 for the earliest and most recent months respectively. The most recent data received a higher weight due to its higher relevance to the future level of sales. Consequently, the weighted moving average
The modern world economy is so diverse and deep that it is very difficult to predict for sure when a crisis will break. Recession is danger, and danger is stress – in such a situation, the brain begins to rely on basic instincts of protection – to run, hide, survive. Crisis intervention is a relatively new discipline, the main task of which is to provide temporary emergency emotional assistance to victims of mental and physical violence (Colford & Cavaiola, 2017). Nowadays, there is a risk of economic decline which can seriously affect the entire population; hence, I would not like to experience recession since it would significantly affect my life.The crisis is a phenomenon that takes a toll primarily on the individuals who work for non-profit organizations. There
ArgumentPrivate companies have dominated the United States freight transportation system for a long time. They also control passenger transportation systems, but the control is shared with the government, unlike freight transport. Through fees, tools, and taxes, government transport departments can safeguard the public best interests in the passenger transportation industry. In contrast, government departments do not have a means to directly control or foster innovation in intermodal freight transport partly because of the resistance by trackers. In their book, Konings et al. (2008) suggest that the US government should be the catalyst for innovations in intermodal transportation. This argument can be justified by looking at a historical example of how a government-supported initiative has outperformed the free market-driven industry.Why the US Government Should Be a Catalyst for Innovations
in Intermodal Transport SystemsI agree with the author that the government should act as a catalyst for intermodal transport. The government brings tremendous benefits in transport and regulates limitations posed by the free market economy. This type of economy brings a problem of lack of interconnectivity and interoperability. This challenge is evidenced in intermodal road-rail transport because different parties use different resources. Private-owned intermodal transportation systems are different because they lack a centralized control unit that regulates the designs. Transportation is an essential aspect of the lives of Americans, and the time wasted when interconnecting problems occur leads to massive losses. For effectively centralized control to be achieved in such centers, the US government needs to step in and assist in innovation, ensuring uniform standards and compatible systems
are deployed everywhere.Additionally, I agree with the writer that the government needs to step in because it is able to pass information better. Intermodal transport involves several stakeholders and components, thus requiring an intensive flow of information (Kine, Gebresenbet, Tavasszy, & Ljungberg, 2022). An institution like a government capable of reaching all should be in control. In social-technical systems, evidence shows that governments outperform privatized institutions. The state plays 13 different roles in the governance of socio-technical systems: Observer, mitigator, opportunist, facilitator, lead user, enabler of societal engagement, promoter, moderator, gatekeeper, initiator, and watchdog (Borrás & Edler, 2020). Incorporating these in the transport industry would save a lot of wasted time and hassle.The US government has intelligence tools at its disposal, and it can do better work in
Historical BackgroundAn area of almost 653 thousand square meters, located in the territories of Southwest Asia, historically belongs to the state of Afghanistan. Afghanistan has no access to the sea or the ocean and is adjacent to other states from all sides. Thus, the country’s western borders are connected with Iran and Turkmenistan; to the north, it is adjacent to Uzbekistan and Tajikistan. On the southeastern side, Afghanistan is entirely bordered by Pakistan from the Gulf of Oman. Notably, the entire area of the state is located in the Iranian highlands, so much of the region is represented by mountainous and hilly terrain (Allchin, 2021). The Hindu Kush mountain system is the most represented there, as its hills, up to 7708 meters high, extend from east to west
of the country. However, this does not mean that there are no plains there. On the contrary, to the north of the country, close to Tajikistan, Afghanistan has the Bactrian Plain, which contains a unique geographic area in the form of an extension of the clay-sandy Karakum desert. There are also mountainous depressions and valleys along other borders of the country, representing valuable clay and sand resources for the population.Geographical reasons fully determine the local climatic conditions, the impact of which is clearly visible in the Afghan vegetation. Thus, the climate there is typical subtropical continental, with the predominance of monsoon winds. In the summertime, the weather is usually hot and dry, but the local conditions rarely become cold with the onset of winter. Afghan summer temperatures can
reach 122 ℉ while temperatures rarely drop below freezing in January (Allchin, 2021). While winters on the eastern side of Afghanistan are primarily cold, closer to the north and south, temperatures tend to be more comfortable and warmer. Most of the rainfall occurs during the winter and spring. At the same time, all river systems and lakes present in Afghanistan are brainless. This means that there is no system of underwater connections, and any flow of water is mainly related to its surface evaporation. As a consequence of a combination of climatic and geographic factors, the local flora is mainly characterized by aridity. Desert landscapes of the country, uniquely combined with mountainous terrain, give the country a large number of herbaceous plants, including cereals, legumes, and other flowering
crops.Afghanistan is, first of all, a country with rich ancient history. Paleontological discoveries suggest that Afghanistan appears to be more than five thousand years old, and some argue that it was inhabited as far back as the late Paleolithic period (Allchin, 2021). The extended history becomes the reason for the wide variety of nationalities that inhabit Afghanistan. The largest populations here include Pashtuns (42%), Tajiks (28%), Hazaras (10%), Uzbeks (8%), Charaimaks (2.6%), Turkmen (2%), and other underrepresented nationalities, including Arabs, Mongols, and Kazakhs (AFP, 2021). Multi-ethnicity is the reason for the bilingual and trilingual nature of the local population: Afghans are generally fluent in Afghan and Persian, both of which belong to the Indo-European family of languages. As of 2021, Afghanistan’s population was 40 million before the events
of the Afghan August (WPR, 2021). This diversity of multi-ethnic communities is reflected in the cultural and religious code.For example, most Afghans are typical Sunni orthodox Islamists. Among such followers, militancy, and bloody revenge, uniquely combined with hospitality, is often prevalent. The classical role of women as submissive mothers and faithful wives is also derived from this (Onsutti, 2019). In a sense, we can point out that Islam for contemporary Afghanistan is the bridge that connects disparate nationalities and smoothes out conflicts. Alternative religions are poorly represented and discouraged there: conversion to Christianity is punishable by death, and both Hinduism and Protestantism are prosecuted.Groups Represented in AfghanistanAfghanistan’s political life is associated with American and Soviet intervention, jihad, and terrorism. It might seem that the territory is the home
of all terrorists, but that is not the case. By now, the fundamental religious and political groups fighting for power in Afghanistan are the Taliban, ISIS, al-Qaeda, and the Northern Resistance, which have weakened noticeably since the American withdrawal from Afghanistan (Wolf, 2021). It should be said that until August 15, 2021, when the country finally came under Taliban rule, Afghanistan professed a republican way with its president and constitution. Although there was an ongoing civil war in the country, Afghanistan was gradually moving away from the vector of Islamic radicalism and allowing more civil rights to the population.With the arrival of the Taliban, most of the reforms and gains of the last decade had already been reversed, and the progress made toward recognizing women’s rights and minorities
had been erased. The classical Taliban movement is fundamentalist: their primary function is to inculcate in the Afghan people the formerly rigid order of Islam, with a strong recognition of clan ties and the five pillars of Islam. The Taliban has extreme political ambitions, as the seizure of power and the restructuring of the state require severe political initiatives from the group. ISIS may appear to be an ally of the Taliban since, from the outside, it gives the impression that the two groups have similar goals. Some similarities in functions do not guarantee a partnership, as the Taliban and ISIS are officially considered adversaries. The first mission of ISIS supporters apparently began in 2014 with Pakistan, when representatives promoted joining (Nazish, 2014). A year later, having reached
the peak of their geopolitical influence, ISIS leaders officially announced their entry into Afghanistan as an adapted Wilayat Khorasan movement (Paybarah, 2021). ISIS’s Afghan representation was based on refugees and migrants from Pakistan who took advantage of the hospitality of the Afghan people. Over time, ISIS Afghanistan grew in political and religious power, and the U.S., then still present in Afghanistan, facilitated the removal of key figures in the movement (Morgan, 2020). Unofficially, but in fact, it was an act of cooperation between the U.S. military and the Taliban to eliminate a common serious enemy. Ultimately, the Afghan ISIS was defeated, and the leaders were either executed or imprisoned. Meanwhile, on August 26, 2021, ISIS claimed responsibility for a terrorist attack at the Kabul airport as thousands of
refugees attempted to flee the country (Hubbard et al., 2021). The Taliban authorities reacted negatively to this act and executed the imprisoned ISIS members.Al-Qaida is also a representative of the Islamic terrorist organization present in Afghanistan, but the goals of this movement are different from the Taliban. Al-Qaida is known to have its origins in Bin Laden, a hardline, militant advocate (Wright, 2021). Al-Qaida is one of the harshest and most radical organizations: its members practice Wahhabism. Among the goals of this movement is the elimination of the Taliban, the spread of radical Islamism, and the formation of a worldwide caliphate. Thus, al-Qaida also has political ambitions, and their functions are more linked to the religious mission of Islam. Moreover, the creation of the Northern Alliance was triggered
enlisting the support of Western countries to fight the Taliban regime. There are reports that the Northern Alliance has close contact with the U.S. CIA, but the authenticity of this data is questionable. After 9/11, the power of the Northern Alliance declined rapidly and disappeared altogether with the end of the Taliban regime (Wolf, 2021). However, alliance sentiment persists in Afghanistan, and many people have not given up hope that the Northern Alliance will be revived and will be able to fight the Taliban effectively.
The YouTube video published by GP Synergy, “GP Training in Aboriginal Community Controlled Health Services,” sends a message that Aboriginal Medical Services play a crucial role within the diverse community. The services are essential for providing culturally sensitive and high-quality care to the target populations, often marginalized and underserved, ensuring they have everything they need to tackle rising health concerns. The comprehensive set of services provided by the medical facilities ensures that the patients from the Aboriginal community have access to affordable and convenient health care. One service can support multiple aspects of clients’ lives.The comprehensive approach toward culturally-sensitive care is especially relevant in addressing the social determinants of health (SHOD), which encompass multiple areas of the population’s health, well-being, and quality of life. SDOH includes safe housing,
neighborhoods, convenient transportation, racial discrimination and violence, education, income, job opportunities, access to nutritional foods, low-quality air and water, and language and literacy skills (Healthy People 2030, 2020). Therefore, the Aboriginal Community Controlled Health Services aims to address the health disparities and inequities that most Aboriginal patients encounter (Pearson et al., 2020). The professionals working within the Aboriginal Community Health Services framework underline the importance of patient education to ensure that the population is aware of its potential health challenges and knows about the necessity of early prevention and management.The prominent SHOD that is being discussed in the “GP Training in Aboriginal Community Controlled Health Services” video is discrimination. The health center workers acknowledge that many of their patients have experienced discrimination in the healthcare system and want
professionals entails consistent collaboration between themselves and their patients who feel underserved and misunderstood. To conclude, addressing the social determinants of health that affects the Aboriginal community is a demanding process that requires dedication and focuses on the unique needs of patients coming to a facility to receive culturally-sensitive care. Undoubtedly, the process will take some time because healthcare providers must be well-prepared and well-versed in the social determinants of health affecting their clients.
The cultural effects of Roman dominance over the Greek-speaking regions is a fascinating topic that has attracted great scientific interest, especially in the last couple of years. The impact of the interaction between two cultures varied in time and space and was definitely more prominent in places where Roman communities had emerged. These communities served as the so-called influence vectors, and their long residing alongside Greeks resulted in the transmission of Roman elements into public life.One of such elements was Roman names, the dissemination of which may be explained by the existence of networks of exchange and the sense of identity of name bearers. Rizakis (2019) notes that the introduction of the Greeks to the Roman system of naming with its further adaptation to their norms and the
Roman names adoption by peregrine Greeks are two different phenomena. However, they both are examples of the interaction process between the two traditions, which gradually led to the appearance of a common onomastic culture. This acculturation form, increased in the 2 nd century AD, showed wide regional variability, and the reception of it was different in different cities and social classes.These cultural transfers were mostly mediated by civic elites, as their purpose was to pass on their influence by name – both in a regional context and more broadly, on a system level. Tria nomina, in particular, and its use in the imperial period especially, as stated by Rizakis (2019), was a source of pride, power, and prestige. Due to this, some names became popular as expressions of
The ancient historical texts on Minoans published by Halsall reflect some facts about their history discovered much later than these accounts had been compiled. Namely, Plutarch’s story about Theseus demonstrates the notion of the lack of defensive works in Crete. According to this text, Theseus invaded the island’s port and captured it quickly since its citizens mistook his navy for their own. This detail could remind the truth: Minoans were merchants and did not develop extensive safeguards. Moreover, Herodotos’ text depicts the extinction of Cretans, which corresponds to the archeological data, although they mention the eruption as the main factor for the demise of Minoans.British Institute at Ankara’s video about Helen of Troy is quite informative about the representation of women in ancient times. As such, Helen was
perceived as the most magnificent and feminine person for many centuries in Athens as well as Sparta. Moreover, it is known that she became worshipped as a goddess in Laconia. Greeks often depicted Helen via the use of the most precious materials, which signified the importance of this character. This woman was traditionally perceived as a seducer and even the cause of sorrow in the Ancient Greek culture. Moreover, the image of Helen of Troy has surpassed time and is still used as a euphemism of beauty.Evelyn-White’s translation of Hesiod’s Theogony presents valuable knowledge about the Greek religion. Hesiod describes the gods as anthropomorphous beings who at the same time have natural power or represent parts of the universe themselves. For example, the Earth and the Heaven are
consorts that produce other gods, which are often associated with emotions or natural phenomena. The story about Heaven (Uranus) being castrated by his rebellious child, Chronos, is especially remarkable. The war of generations and overthrowing the elder by the younger is also present in Mesopotamian, Scandinavian, and other mythologies. Hesiod’s poem clarifies the Greek conception of gods: the primordial being and their offspring having unlimited powers in the world, and yet creatures with human emotions and motives.Women by Semonides of Amorgos, published by Temperance, depicts male Greeks’ expectations for their women. The author enumerates the types of women created by Zeus and primarily serve as an eternal punishment for mankind. Semonides describes females that are not beautiful in a sarcastic manner, yet he condemns women who care about
people can pray for the help of the divinities and expect it to be fulfilled. This notion suggests that gods can be both benevolent and cruel, and the fate of humans is always at their will. Moreover, this poem indicates that Aphrodite is a goddess of love who interacts with human relationships by exercising her powers. So, by begging Aphrodite to end the struggle and enter the fight, Sappho invokes the wreath of the goddess for a human being that has disappointed her love affairs.
The way of life of South Sudan honestly does believe bulls to be vital; they are utilized in numerous services and butchered to take care of the whole family. Grey Bull is a film that mirrors the social meaning of the bull to South Sudanese individuals. Grey Bull , composed and coordinated by Eddie Bell, is a short film of around 15 minutes that reviews the antagonism between Martin, a South Sudanese man, and the owner of his cows’ slaughterhouse.The foundations of Bell’s story look back to the 1800s when one more novice to Australian shores was thinking of himself in the set of history books. “The principal part of a thought was that I needed to make a cutting-edge Ned Kelly story,” the video director uncovers in
a discussion with Short of the Week.Grey Bull includes some strong creations, yet it is the strength of the story and the exhibitions that truly got many viewers’ attention. It is not difficult to see why director Bell won recognition for such a guaranteed film. At the point when relocation is a hotly debated issue around the world, it’s invigorating to be given a story circling a migrant that genuinely feels like it’s introducing a good perspective on one such excursion.A tale about leaving your past behind so you can zero in on your future. Grey Bull is a film that incites its crowd into taking on the perspective of its principal character and poses a few significant inquiries about displacement.The film has neither saints nor great intrigues,
making it exclusively about a man character emergency. However, in some way or another, the effortlessness of the visuals and nuance of the themes makes it agreeable to watch and adequately fascinating to rewatch once more. The visuals are dazzling to move the more oversimplified case. Every scene in this short film is without a hitch and intentionally shot with the viewer’s goal generally well.Every shot is calculated and sufficiently bright, frequently emphasizing the perfect thing with impeccable timing, providing a way to picturesque guidance, where the video director will deliberately place spotlight and upgrade on a particular setting, article, subject, or conceptual point to pass on a message or feeling in the scene.The shading reviewed in the film is fresh, great, and satisfying to the eye; no
blasts or channels are essential – each edge of this short movie is satisfying when watching. Away from the camera works, Grey Bull has a surface to the entire job, a belief, and a mood that intensely influences the audience’s feelings during the review.The climate or lighting assumes a severe part in each shot, frequently making the generally tranquil and tired film significantly more cloudy and toiling. However, this does not jeopardize the movie; it makes the occurrence considerably more reasonable and exciting. This is wholly built build-up by the strained and semi-off-kilter story of binding together and absorbing clashes with the living.The movie stays away from platitudes and tells a legitimate and consistent biography of a man loaded with inward struggle and compelled to pick either his
previous or future life. Grey Bull acts according to the usual short movie style: lay out the person, the contention, and the theme of the story, and let it work out so that it is straightforward. It is convenient and compacts while also finishing with the typical closure of a short film being somehow or another enigmatic or open-finished.The initial 3/4ths of the film’s length that relates to the primary and straightforward recounting of the story before the consummation is enthralling and somewhat relieving while as yet keeping the strained, abnormal feeling in the air that tends to be serene now and again. However, explicit focuses break the harmony and contribute to a reestablished sensation of contention that gets the crowd’s notice once more, all paving the way
movie, process it, and provide it with a considerable measure of thought. Grey Bull gives an exciting and novel story-driven experience that enraptures the personalities and feelings of its viewers while, at the same time, moving them nearer and further away to a compact completion, which permits them to process and think of their hypotheses that at last make the film simply that more intuitive.
IntroductionGroups are common in almost every aspect of human life. They can be formal or informal and are found at home, school, or the workplace. Groups feature people with shared responsibility and objectives. Collaboration is vital as the workload is spread among the members. Communication, sacrifice, and tolerance must be in plenty, given that different personalities are involved. Group leadership is an essential skill that determines the group’s success by creating a relaxed atmosphere, keeping the group focused on the goal, and mitigating conflicts.Type of Group: WorkplaceI work in the sales department as a supervisor managing 20 members. Our role is centered on pushing sales and making more profits for the company. As a group leader, I have the responsibility of ensuring that our objectives are aligned with
the overall company objectives. Unfortunately, my group is laden with some behavioral challenges such as time management and resistance to direction, which affect performance negatively.Encountered ProblemsMissed TargetsSome team members have been missing the weekly sales targets, and most of the culprits show no signs of improvement. At first, the issue was with three of them, but the problem has escalated and now affects almost half of the team. Because of this, the overall team performance has been compromised. As the leader, I need to address this to inspire everyone back to their winning moods.Poor Time ManagementPart of the reason why the team is underperforming is poor time management. The work policy stipulates that all staff should report to work at 9:00 A.M and leave at 5:00 P.M. However,
some of the staff in my group do not always observe time. Reporting late takes away some hours that could otherwise have been used to generate more sales and thus boost performance.Resistance to DirectionAs the group leader, I am responsible for developing strategies that I expect everyone to follow. While some members always cooperate in supporting me in the role, some have fashioned themselves as a resistance faction. The group often rejects most of my ideas during meetings and tries to pull the rest toward their position. This has hampered progress as we spend too much time on unproductive arguments and counterarguments.Low MotivationMy team’s motivation has been on a downward trajectory for the last two months, which is a worrying trend. The low motivation forms the foundation for
all the other challenges currently affecting members’ performance. This is a grave concern, given that performance is dependent on motivation as a significant factor. A preliminary investigation shows that my members are not satisfied with the current working conditions.The solution to the ProblemsThe identified problems are all behavioral and could be solved through some approaches proposed by behaviorism psychologists such as Ivan Pavlov and B.F Skinner. Human behavior is subject to change based on modifying factors such as motivation. Positive behavior should be reinforced to flourish, while negative behavior should be discouraged to diminish. As a group leader, I would approach the problems from a behavioral angle employing such techniques as classical conditioning, positive reinforcement, behavior shaping, behavior modeling, reinforcement schedules, and punishment where applicable.Classical ConditioningDeveloped by Ian
Pavlov, classical conditioning suggests that learning happens through a conditioned action triggered by a combination of unconditioned and neutral stimuli (Rehman et al., 2022). I would introduce weekly rewards attached to sales performance. The move is likely to make the members associate the rewards with their roles every time they meet the set target; they get rewarded. This will be effective in solving the problem of missed targets.Positive ReinforcementPositive reinforcement involves taking actions such as using rewards to promote good behavior and inspire a long-term positive character (Itri et al., 2019). The approach will apply to solving the problem of time management affecting my group’s current affecting members. I will recognize and commend members who report to their duties on time to inspire a repeated action that would
ultimately become a sustained behavior.Behavior ShapingBehavior shaping is a deliberate process aimed at modifying one’s character. Shaping my group members’ behavior could help check their resistance to my ideas. The process starts with changing their perspectives on how they perceive me as their leader. I should incorporate their suggestions rather than make unilateral decisions. By adopting a more approachable and collaborative behavior, my team members will reduce their negative perceptions of me and thus help neutralize resistance.Behavior ModelingBehavior modeling inspires character change by watching others do it and imitating their actions. The technique will be instrumental in solving the problem of missed targets. Most of the members who post low sales accuse me of being out of touch with reality. To solve this, I will join them to
teams. Competent leaders should identify problems affecting their groups and take preventive and curative measures. The science of behaviorism suggests some techniques that can be used to modify behavior. Classical conditional, behavior shaping, behavior modeling, and reinforcement are effective inspiring and sustaining positive behavior. While some organizations utilize punishment, this technique should be avoided as it only creates fear. Overall, group leaders have a responsibility of keeping members cohesive and focused on the shared objectives.
Gustave Moreau is a renowned Symbolist who invoked the motifs of ancient myths in his works. An example of such a work is Jupiter and Semele , which he painted in 1985 in France (Smith par. 1). The story expressed on the canvas originated from Ancient Greece, afterward assimilated and revoked by Romans. Namely, Jupiter, the supreme god of the Roman pantheon, fell in love with Semele, a mortal woman, whom he impregnated. His angered wife, Juno, tricked Semele into pleading with Jupiter to reveal his genuine appearance before her. This wish was fulfilled, yet the divine nature of Jupiter’s emanation was above the limits of what a human can perceive and suffer, so Semele died, and her child was cut out of her body. Moreau’s work depicts
this tragic plot and indicates the theme of the difference between humans and the divine by portraying Jupiter and Semele on the border of heaven and the underworld.The mentioned piece of art might seem somewhat baroque because of the excessive sumptuous details. The central figure in the painting is giant Jupiter with luminous thunders haloed over his head. He sits on a throne, enriched with Eastern-style figurines and jewel-like flora, and holds frightened Semele, who bleeds and looks like a marble statuette. Above the god, giant columns penetrate the heaven; in the down part, various divinities and phantasmagoric creatures abide. Nearby Jupiter’s throne, Moreau placed an eagle, two struggling females, and a fawn, which would be identified later in the work. Although there is a clear symmetric composition
of the painting, its multiple elements make it difficult to discern the dominant images.Indeed, the central detail might be said to be Jupiter’s enormous body and visage. He wears countless ornaments and gems, as well as symbolic objects of various cultures: for example, Indian lotus and Egyptian scarab. These artifacts might signify the despotic nature of the heavens’ sovereign, similar to that of the Eastern rulers and Egyptian pharaohs. Moreover, the stern and penetrating gaze, aimed at the viewer of the painting, demonstrates the resolute spirit of the god. Hence, in Jupiter, Moreau portrayed the saturated divine essence, which is all-powerful and looming over humans.Next, Semele is highlighted by the whitish color of her skin and gown; she is also a dominating detail. Her appearance contrast with that
of Jupiter: she is almost nude, with only some cloth laying on her leg. This image symbolized the nakedness of humans before the god, which is most likely Christian God, although Moreau uses symbols unrelated to Christianity. The newborn Dionysus, who is dispatched from Semele already, as seen by the blood of her body, is often compared to Jesus. Thus, Semele’s direct interaction with god demonstrates the inability of humans to conceive the divine because of the immense differences between them.Furthermore, three figures attract the attention of the viewer: the two sitting women and a half-man near Jupiter. From the left, the first female is Death holding a speared sword with blood on it and either covering her face from shame or removing tears with a piece of
her dress (Smith). Next to her, Pan with the hooved legs resides; he is another Greco-Roman divinity and a symbol of terror. Finally, the woman in medieval clothes and with a thorn wreath over her head is Pain or Sorrow (Smith). These characters illustrate the stable accompanying states of human living. Thus, one more time, the mortality, suffering, and angst of people are contrasted with God’s realm.Finally, it is necessary to outline the meaning of the depiction of the upper world and the lower domain. The divine part, which surrounds Jupiter’s throne, is embedded with picturesque architecture, vegetation, and angelic figures appear in it. In turn, the downside of the painting illustrates, for example, Hecate, who was a divine patron of witches and sorcerers. The other winged or
life. Moreover, Dionysus is also considered a god, which means that although the differences between the two worlds are immense, they still have a connection and are interrelated. Hence, whatever cruel and non-benevolent God might be, he is still present in the lives of people.To conclude, Gustave Moreau’s Jupiter and Semele is a complex composition with a meaning that is not clearly defined. However, this paper demonstrates that the dominant symbols and elements of the painting all play role in contrasting human and divine nature. Thus, Moreau’s presentation of the ancient myth has a completely new sense from the original plot, somewhat affected by Christianity, although depicted with Eastern aesthetics.
IntroductionThe justice system in the United States of America was designed to fulfill a number of specific social and moral goals. It fulfills a retributive purpose, punishing those that are deemed to be unlawful or morally lacking. Alternatively, justice is also procedural, determining how people in society must be treated. Justice can also be restorative, aiming to integrate individuals back into society. The understanding of which aims must take precedence depends on the person. Once a person serves their sentence and comes out of prison, it is generally expected that they will be able to become a normally functioning member of society, capable of following its rules and regulations. However, in many cases, people commit more crimes after being freed.These types of individuals are often called repeat offenders,
habitual offenders, or career offenders. Present systems of post-convict integration and the associated safety nets are considerably lacking, leading to many people struggling outside of prison. In most cases, repeat offender is not able to fully adapt to life outside of the criminal justice system, making them turn to the only lifestyle they are familiar with – lawlessness. Due to this fact, the US legislation also includes certain laws and guidelines for working with those who have previous experience with the justice system. The existence of Career offender guidelines is aimed at reducing cases of recidivism and discouraging criminal behavior. However, the actual effectiveness of such methods varies severely. This review will focus on discussing career offender guidelines and their effectiveness within the justice system.OverviewCareer OffendersFirst, the designation
“career offender” itself can be discussed. A person is considered to be a serial offender when they meet a number of criteria, including being over 18 years old at the time of a crime, being convicted of a violent or drug-related crime, and having at least two prior similar offenses (Burnham & Gorokhov, 2017). Meeting all of the above criteria makes one a career offender within the US justice system. When assigned such a status, it incurs a number of penalties with it, primarily focusing on the severity of sentencing. Usually, the minimum charge in court is increased, making any potential criminal repercussions more severe than they would have been otherwise (Burnham & Gorokhov, 2017). Additionally, the criminal history of a person considered a career offender is placed
in a heavier category. The combination of the two results in most career offenders getting spending more time in the prison system. An individual is able to challenge their designation, and not all people are eligible for the title of a career offender.While the career offender system was designed in order to prevent repeat offenses and discourage criminality, the actual sentence limits were not established using empirical data. All of the increased sentences provided under this legislation are estimates. Additionally, it can be noted that the career offender system overlooks many types of crime prevalent in society. Corporate crime, theft, and inappropriate actions against others are not covered by the repeat offender guidelines.This approach makes the system especially prone to be ineffective or to target certain types of
people more than others. Due to the correlation between certain living conditions, income, and poverty, drug, and violence-related sentencing disproportionately affects social groups (Blankenship et al., 2018). In particular, black people are much more likely to be prosecuted for drug-related offenses. In regards to the career offender guidelines, this means that black people and other people of color find it more difficult to leave the prison system (Blankenship et al., 2018). Even in cases where an individual is able to serve their sentence fully, the actual process of adjusting to normal life often becomes too difficult. A disparity between sentencing outcomes and treatment negatively affects the wellness of non-white communities. Black men, historically the most vulnerable demographic for the prison system, are separated from their communities and left
unable to integrate.Three-Strike LawThe three-strike law is a more general way of referring to systems such as the career offender guidelines. As evidenced by the name, these types of guidelines put heavy punishments on people after they have been found guilty three times. Designed in order to increase the punishment for repeat offenders, the actual way the laws are implemented depends on the state. Compared to the career offender guidelines, the three-strike approach focuses on certain types of felonies. Most states have implemented this law into action with varying degrees of severity. Life sentences are a large issue concerning the three-strike law, as the majority of people are committed to prison for life following their actions. In California, for example, no consideration is taken for the time between
each crime, meaning that a person can get a life sentence as a consequence of something they did many years ago.In addition, the three-strikes legislation also has other similarities with the career offender guidelines. The political aspect of criminal understanding is enhanced within this framework, and crimes considered to be more socially reprehensive become more likely to warrant increased sentencing Researchers also say that it is likely to be ineffective at preventing crime instead of working to promote social inequality. As discussed in work “Reimagining Criminal Justice”, the law was initially passed in order to keep socially detrimental individuals and outcasts away from others and safeguard the wellness of society. This meant that people such as murderers and rapists would have fewer opportunities to re-offend (Flores, 2020). However,
with the current version of the law, most people under its influence serve sentences for non-violent crimes. The Three-strike system does not fulfill its stated goals and actively worsens the livelihoods of smaller offenders.First Step ActThe third notable piece of legislation is the First Step Act. Compared to the two discussed before, this law is used to help repeat offenders improve their standing. Signed comparatively recently, in 2018, the act was promised to lead to less recidivism. The legislation was designed in order to cut existing unnecessarily long prison sentences while also providing criminals with a framework of self-betterment. In addition, it was designed to make the present prison conditions better. Inhumane and violent practices of prison are cut short by the new legislation, limiting the amount of
physical and mental stress prisoners fall under. Additionally, the First Step Act gives judges more freedom to assign lower sentences to repeat offenders. Shortly after the time of its approval, 3100 inmates had the chance to be released back into society after sentence reductions ( The first step act of 2018: An overview ). The effects of the act were immediate, with people starting to get shorter time in prison ( The first step act of 2018: An overview ). However, the actual overall effectiveness of the law remains to be seen, as it has not been fully seen through on a country-wide level.RecommendationI fully disagree with the present implementation of career offender legislation and similar initiatives. While the stated goals of more thorough punishment as a method
of deterrence are clear, their actual real-life effectiveness comes under heavy criticism. As shown by a number of researchers and examinations, the singular goal repeat offender laws consistently achieve is increasing the prison population. They are not conducive to reintegration into society, are destructive to communities, and don’t act as a sufficient deterrent. Currently, existing laws actively make it more difficult for people to move through the justice system. As noted by present research, the system of career offender guidelines is both largely inhumane, unable to reach their stated goals, and detrimental to society as a whole (Saltzman, 2019). The career offender laws target specific types of criminals, most notably those connected with drugs and violence, and make their sentences considerably harsher than they could have been.Black people,
due to the correlation between racial profiling, historical differences in crime statistics, and other factors, become especially vulnerable to charges related to drugs. As a result, some groups of people, and their communities, are affected more than others. The three-strike legislation, then, applies to a wider range of potential offenses, while not taking into account the time or circumstances of each one. Additionally, it fails to achieve its initial goal of keeping dangerous individuals in prisons while excessively persecuting others for non-violent offenses. Both systems can be noted as especially ineffective at rehabilitating people instead of focusing on keeping repeat offenders secluded from society within the prison system. Their combined effort disproportionally targets people of color and leads to a disparity in justice outcomes. Comparatively, laws similar to
Various cultures may imply certain practices towards medical preparations. Some of them may have no faith in modern medicine applications and prefer indigenous methods that have been in practice for generations. In Ghana, modern medicine is considered an expensive alternative to traditional curing methods. Due to doubt about its effectiveness and low health literacy, people are hesitant to consider it an option (Gyasi et al., 2016). This points to the negative impact of health beliefs in the region. Nevertheless, different ethnic groups’ health-related beliefs and behaviors can result in positive health and well-being and beneficial health results, significant and dangerous health consequences, or no detrimental health impacts and hence are harmless.In consideration of the medical administration, it is possible to point out several implications of health beliefs. One
of such implications is the limitation of medication administration to the doctors or medicine men in western regions and only when a patient demonstrates specific symptoms. In community medicine, the prescription should be done by professionals with modern knowledge, insight, and moral obligations in the form of Hippocrates’s oath. On the other hand, some communities may rely purely on cultural methods of medication administration. Treatment methods may be administered based on bodily elements such as humoral imbalances manifested as too much “hot” or “cold” (Taek et al., 2019). Consequently, “Cold” conditions are treated with “hot” drugs, while “hot” diseases are treated with “cold” medications, restoring equilibrium to the individual (Taek et al., 2019). This demonstrates how such cultural factors as health beliefs may result in a large disparity
in medical administration.Two potential adverse reactions from health beliefs could be considered an overdose and an underdose. The first refers to the inadequate ingestion of drugs purely based on previous experience that is not supported by reliable medical knowledge. After the development of the COVID-19 vaccine, numerous media influencers, without prior consultation with medical professionals, were abusing the vaccine injection by making numerous injections at unrecommended intervals. This behavior is dangerous as it may cause unverified complications within the body. On the other hand, underdose is also possible as people consider western medicine as deeply flawed and dangerous for consumption. They may consider lowering recommended dosages that sabotage the effectiveness of the drugs and have little to no impact on alleviating the symptoms resulting in prolonged sickness.One possible
a subjective perception of adherence which often increases non-adherence risks among older adults.It is possible to derive several intervention strategies that could improve adherence. These strategies include patient education, which can be characterized by telephone counseling sessions with professionals that would be recurrent and personalized (Kini & Ho, 2018). Another method is medication regimen management which could be used with patients that are hesitant to consume drugs due to the fear of side effects. It includes using combination pills so that patients will consume fewer pills daily (Kini & Ho, 2018). Nevertheless, it is necessary to consider that adherence will be determined by the practice’s or health system’s viability and availability.
Environmental FactorEnsuring the safety of a newborn child becomes the primary and most important task of parents. Especially in the first year of life, the child is unable to protect himself from damaging environmental factors. Examples of such harmful effects may be air and water pollution, excessive sun exposure, or dust and chemicals. This work analyzes the harmful environmental factors for a child under one year old and offers health promotion to protect newborns from harm.Sources emphasize that in 2012, almost two million children under the age of five in the world died due to the environment (“Children’s environmental health,” n.d.). The causes were respiratory tract infections, malaria, and various injuries and injuries. The most dangerous is that once experienced, illnesses and injuries can affect the child’s further
development and its formation in adolescents.The main environmental factor is air and water pollution.Adverse environmental impacts and pollution substantially impact morbidity, disability, and in some cases, death. Thus, among the aspects that are involved in this factor are air pollution, inadequate water, and hazardous chemicals and waste that also pollute everything. Among the dangers are “lower-respiratory infections, diarrheal diseases, brain damage and inflammation, blood disorders, and jaundice” (“Air Pollution,” n.d., para. 2). Air pollution can be hazardous during the mother’s pregnancy since already at this stage, the child’s health will deteriorate. In addition to chemicals, there may also be harmful particles of dust and dirt in the air, which can enter the newborn’s body through the respiratory tract.Polluted water or lack of clean water for the child and
family can be very serious. This problem is particularly acute in developing countries, where people’s access to water resources can be severely limited. It is important to note that newborns are given water only on the recommendation of a doctor in the first months of pregnancy. However, water plays a valuable role in the functioning of the child’s body and must meet specific criteria to ensure safety. Minimal consequences can be poisoning or allergies, which can develop into more serious diseases.Another factor of harmful effects on the child during the first few years that are involved in environmental pollution is harmful chemicals and garbage. This is because children begin to explore the world around them after getting the opportunity to become mobile. Therefore, one of the ways to
get acquainted with the new is a touch and a taste test. Hence, there is a possibility of stumbling upon substances that can be spilled on the street. Examples may be chemical poisoning or skin burn. Exactly the same properties are swinging garbage, which can harm the health of the child and affect the further development of the body.Health Promotion PlanThis part of the scientific work provides a health promotion plan that can which provide knowledge for caregivers on how to prevent and protect newborns from environmental risk. 1. Monitor what the child is doing both at home and on the street 2. Carry out water purification before use with the help of special filters. An alternative may be the purchase of bottled water, which will be intended
for newborns. 3. If possible, avoid places where there is a high level of air and water pollution near factories and production.In other words, it is necessary to maintain the necessary air quality, which is determined by the absence of excess gases, dust, and odors. To do this, it is essential to ensure constant ventilation in the room and to maintain a moisture balance in order to limit the occurrence of mold harmful to the newborn. All these actions are due to the fact that newborns have a high respiratory rate and a larger lung surface area in relation to their body weight. Due to the faster and more intensive immune system development, they are most susceptible to external environmental factors. 1. Ensure compliance with hygiene standards, which
also apply to being on the street or in a public place. 2. To avoid poisoning with toxic substances, it is necessary to thoroughly wash vegetables and fruits before giving them to a child. 3. Avoid tobacco smoke and the smoke from burning things.Consultation with the attending pediatrician is necessary about what actions should be taken in emergency situations and the basics that are important to ensure the safety of the child’s health.This article raises the topic of such danger for newborns and the growing spread of sudden infant death syndrome. This is influenced by multiple external and internal factors, such as the high vulnerability of the body, the negative impact of environmental factors, and exogenous stress, such as sleeping on the stomach or a soft bed, during
a critical period of development (Carlin & Moon, 2017). The source is a valuable source of information for highlighting recommendations for the care of infants. Thus, caregivers should take care of such aspects as proper sleep, a bed for the baby, soft bedding, tobacco smoke limitation, cohabitation, and immunization.This source provides information and recommendations in the event of a collision with air pollution. This problem is a threat to the health of society, especially to children. Due to the high level of urbanization, more and more infants are exposed to polluted air from vehicles and various industrial plants. The source emphasizes the importance of creating strategies aimed at preventing the adverse effects of pollution on children’s health (Gouveia et al., 2018). Moreover, caregivers should pay special attention to
Health promoters are a trained workforce whose primary purpose is to improve health through a variety of activities carried out by health promotion organizations. Individual empowerment, societal responsibility for health, and establishing an enabling environment for developing personal skills and boosting community action are among their top goals (Nutbeam, 2019). In the realm of health promotion, experts from various multidisciplinary health workers have agreed on the characteristics of effective collaboration and an interdisciplinary approach.Interdisciplinary teams’ most essential purpose is to bring together a variety of diverse viewpoints on caring and to use the talents and knowledge of many different individuals and sectors. Intersectional collaboration between different health professionals and the public and commercial sectors is critical for effective health promotion (US Department of Health and Human Services, 2018).
difficulties. Whether the issues are personal, interpersonal, or social in nature, social workers can assist in guiding and resolving many of today’s issues (Nutbeam, 2019). Registered nurses examine and analyze healthcare needs in order to decide the best service or treatment, the best healthcare provider, and the best equipment to deliver patient care (Pun, 2018). Thus, their skills and approach will be essential in the success of an interdisciplinary team tasked with health promotion.
Primarily, one should note that the country that I chose to perform the assignment is France. Undoubtedly, there are many consulates of France in the United States. However, to take the remains to the “homeland,” it is required to contact a special consulate general located in California, Los Angeles. In this context, a “mourner” should arrange a meeting in the office with a specialist two days in advance to discuss all the details and points regarding the dispatch of human remains and sealing an urn ( Shipment of cremated remains , 2019). Thus, the Consulate General of France in Los Angeles is one of the most relevant places to ask for help to remove “remnants.”Accordingly, I have to provide the following merchandise to the family in the future.
First of all, it is necessary to prepare a package of particular documents. For instance, they include a death certificate of a loved one in the US, a medical report, and a certificate of cremation and sealing. Moreover, an attestation of the absence of extraneous attachments and closed sealing of the urn, a certificate of the lack of infectious diseases from the deceased, and a permit to import remains will be required. It is also essential to have a person’s permission to request repatriation and a certified French translation of the death and cremation certificate. Secondly, this family needs an urn with the ashes of the dead, located in a special airtight container.Moreover, there are not too complicated requirements regarding the transportation of the urn in France. A
Healthcare facilities and their staff ensure to establish effective emergency preparedness and response interventions to respond to disasters, terrorist attacks, and pandemic outbreaks. According to McNeill et al. (2018), health emergency preparedness is the capacity of the public health system and community to prevent and respond to healthcare emergencies. With adequate preparedness, healthcare providers become better equipped to handle health emergencies when they occur. Healthcare and emergency preparedness among rural communities are still low despite awareness of upstream readiness and social determinants such as inadequate resources, remoteness, and limited access to healthcare services.How I Provided Nursing Care that Addressed the Psychosocial Needs of Rural CommunitiesI provided nursing care to address the psychological needs of rural communities during the pandemic to conduct door-to-door screenings and education on the COVID-19
virus. The hallmark of this exercise was to burst the myths and misinformation about the cause of the virus, its spread, and the adverse effects of vaccination. The door-to-door screenings and education proved instrumental in recommending the need for testing the vaccine to rural households. We managed to screen 200 people in two villages on the first day during the activity, with only 3% refusing screening services.Our health team came across an elderly patient who was gasping for breath during the screening services and rushed him to the emergency department. Upon arrival, we conducted a triage on the patient to determine the severity of his condition and later registered him to the emergency room. I did compressions in the center of the patient’s chest to press down about
two inches. I did this with my shoulders directly over my hands while keeping my arms straight to help the patient stay alive.My health team provided nursing services that addressed the psychological needs of clients by creating and expanding telehealth services. The telehealth services included psychiatry that involved video communication with rural communities. For instance, telepsychiatry services facilitated communication and monitoring of patients through technology in real-time. According to Butkus et al. (2020), video-based telepsychiatry services help meet patients’ needs amidst the uncertainties resulting from the pandemic at affordable rates. The intervention was crucial in integrating behavioral health care and primary care to mitigate the spread of the virus.How Social Determinants Contributed to the Health Status of a Vulnerable Client I ServedSocial determinants of health such as poverty,
low literacy, and unequal access to healthcare impact healthcare outcomes of vulnerable populations. One of the social determinants of health that contributed to the health status of a vulnerable client I served during my practicum experience is poverty. According to Khan et al. (2018), rural communities live on minimum wage and have generic poverty that influences access to care. This social determinant was reflected while I was offering door-to-door screaming in a mass testing exercise to mitigate the spread of the virus. I learned that the vulnerable client had limited resources to regularly visit healthcare facilities for screening and testing. As a result, the client foregoes preventive care and wait till their conditions are severe before seeking medication.More often than not, people living in rural communities have low
educational attainments and literacy levels. According to McNeill et al. (2018), low literacy levels are associated with less preventive care and high hospitalization. While working with the rural community during the pandemic, I discovered that the vulnerable client had low adherence to measures such as hand washing hygiene, wearing face masks, and social distancing that reduces the spread of the virus. The implications of low literacy on this population included increased hospitalization and emergency care use.Low insurance coverage among rural communities is another social determinant to healthcare. The vulnerable client I served during my practicum experience was uninsured and did not receive preventive services for cardiovascular diseases, cancer, and chronic conditions. Lack of medical cover also deterred the vulnerable client from seeking healthcare services when it is needed
due to the high costs involved. Overall, the limited insurance cover among the rural communities leads to inadequate access to recommended care and poor health outcomes.The Support Agency I Would Recommend for the Population in FutureThe support agency that I would recommend for the rural community in the future is the guide to Rural Health Care Collaboration and Coordination (HRSA). This support agency coordinates the efforts of community health centers, rural hospitals, local public healthcare departments, and other stakeholders to identify and address community health needs (Kearly et al., 2020). HRSA aims to improve access to healthcare by adopting coordination strategies to deliver quality care. The support agency will help rural communities improve their care outcomes by developing and strengthening care coordination.The Greatest Concerns about the Rural Population
debris and waste that contaminate water and food sources. Rural communities are adversely affected by floods that limit their access to medical services.In conclusion, rural populations’ health, healthcare, and emergency preparedness are affected by challenges such as poor coordination, limited funding, and geographical barriers. A wide variety of factors such as environment, income, and literacy determine the health of rural populations. The programs and policies to increase rural community preparedness to healthcare and emergencies should focus on addressing the underlying healthcare determinants to focus on upstream activities supporting resilience.
COVID-19 affected the world in various ways; however, the outcomes of the pandemic are not clear yet. One of such spheres which are still to be researched extensively, despite the colossal progress made so far, is healthcare. This is especially relevant for the mental health domain, as the major flows of resources in the healthcare sectors all over the globe are directed towards combating the main adverse physical consequences of the infection. Mental health issues receive significantly less attention; meanwhile, these issues are significant, especially for healthcare professionals, who suffer both physically and mentally from the enormous additional burden that the pandemic brought upon them. According to research, there is an “increased risk of acquiring trauma or stress-related disorders, depression, and anxiety” (Cabarkapa et al., 2020, para.3) for
healthcare workers. Moreover, statistically, the risks are greater for nurses and female workers. Two primary sources of these potential problems are fear of the unknown and fear of getting infected.In such a dire situation, healthcare managers need to find new stress-coping methods or models for their healthcare facilities and workers. There have been various strategies tried in such a situation all across the globe, depending on resources that healthcare facilities possessed, cultural, social, and historical backgrounds of the communities. Some of the more researched strategies will be listed and discussed in more detail. The three main strategies to cope with healthcare workers’ stress are self-coping strategies, psycho-social interventions, and workplace awareness (Cabarkapa et al., 2020). It is possible to use and combine these strategies depending on the available
resources of healthcare managers and their facilities.Regarding self-coping strategies, there have been six main coping behaviors identified and practiced among New York healthcare workers during the COVID-19 pandemic. These included physical exercise, talk therapy, yoga, faith-based practices, meditation, and virtual support groups; the practices are listed from most to least popular ones (Shechter et al., 2020). At the same time, around 14% of workers did not engage in any stress-coping practices. A healthcare manager can find information on such practices, structure them, and familiarize other healthcare workers to promote such coping mechanisms.Despite the existence of self-coping mechanisms, they may not be enough, and psycho-social interventions may be necessary to reduce stress-related problems. One example is the intervention strategy that was developed in China – the first country hit
of stress-related disorders on healthcare worker’s own health can be devastating; moreover, this can negatively affect the quality of worker’s services, therefore, putting patients in danger. Thus, it is essential to provide constant monitoring of healthcare workers’ mental health status. The study by An et al. (2020) suggested organizing regular screenings for healthcare workers operating in emergencies. Such practices can help both healthcare professionals and the patients they treat.
Like many other areas of life, music has changed along with society. The period between 1959 and 1963 was transitional, and at least two distinct markets emerged in the music industry (Covach and Flory 112). The first one was defined by the new generation of teenagers who favored dance music (Covach and Flory 113). The second market consisted of former rock and rollers who preferred folk music associated with social, political, and economic issues (Covach and Flory 113). Folk had a long history of addressing problems within American society, and its music appeared to be more dedicated to the community than commercial pop (Covach and Flory 118-119).Folk performers appealed to the audience and represented people rather than being above them (Covach and Flory 119). Almost anyone could play
One of the most significant forms of American folklore, which laid the foundation for such musical genres as gospel, blues, and jazz, was the spiritual chants of African Americans. The ancestors of African Americans were forcibly separated from their homes and brought to the United States to work on the plantations of the Old South. Descendants of hundreds of different tribes in Africa brought distinctive musical traditions that were destined to have a global impact on world culture. Spirituals were generally considered religious music, but they carried a much deeper meaning to the people who composed and performed them. African Americans faced severe restrictions even in arts and music. White planters tried to split the communities to prevent riots, and sometimes slaves were forbidden to speak their native
language (Music for emancipation of African Americans, 2016-2017). Music has become a primary way of expressing inner feelings, grief, sorrow, and a sense of oneness with brothers and sisters in distress. It is a story about the strength of the human spirit, pure reverence for ancestors, and faith in the future.Frederick Douglas was born in 1818 in the US state of Maryland into a family of slaves. He despised American slave laws and actively tried to shed light on the terrifying events taking place in the country. Frederick Douglas’s lifelong goal was to fight slavery in all its forms, advocate total emancipation, and raise the moral standards of society. He perceived musical creativity as a way of raising spirits, prosperous fighting for a hopeful future, and a manifestation
of cultural pride. Slave owners often did not understand the true meaning of this art and demanded the slaves sing for entertainment. Frederick Douglas documented in his autobiography how compulsory singing oppressed him in childhood and how different it was from singing from the heart ( Music for emancipation of African Americans, 2016-2017). In an endless sense of homesickness and grief over the cruel perspective of the planters, music became an origin of the declaration of Blacks’ beliefs and transmissions into the world. Exploring Douglas’ work and the history of African American culture requires saving these ideas in mind to better understand the origins of the music and its message to the world.William Edward Burghardt Du Bois was a prominent American historian, sociologist, and public figure. He was
born into an impoverished family of farmers, but his extraordinary talents helped him lift himself out of poverty and become the first black graduate of Harvard University. He was the author of numerous books and articles on the history of peoples of African descent and their struggle against racism, slavery, and the slave trade. His works include visions for independence and the development of the prosperous traditions of African culture, stories, and plays about the life of African Americans. In the music, he saw the true feelings of his ancestors, but precisely through the prism of the Christian religion. A serious analysis of spirituals began primarily with the works of Du Bois, his final chapter of The Souls of the Black Folk , named The Sorrow Songs (Music
were biblical, but the implications and meanings in songs were deeply personal. People could express their inner pain, protests, and the urging sense of the lack of justice. Gradually the Christian faith became the spiritual support of the slaves, which can be traced in the writer’s works regarding African American culture. The music of African slaves can be perceived from different angles, focusing on religion or, on the contrary, considering it solely a way to veil the true meaning from tyrants. The principal idea is unshakable: this is a monumental cultural heritage and the commencement of the prosperous crusade for freedom and equality.
The Roman Empire was largely polytheistic, suggesting that people acknowledged and honored several different gods. They thought that these entities had a part in the formation of Roman civilization and shaped the events of people’s everyday lives (Bartsch, 2020). Because of Rome’s geographical location, its population had regular interaction with Greek peoples who had expanded their territory into the Italian peninsula and Sicily (Beard, 2015). Many features of Greek culture were borrowed by Rome, with minor modifications to fit their requirements.According to Polybius ‘ interpretation of the Roman government, the monarchy was solidified in the office of the Consul. The tales of Manilus Hippomanes, Olivier de Noyen, and Julien Barneuve are connected through history in The Dream of Scipio by a philosophical musing claiming that man is accountable
the only ones who could acquire full citizenship. A kid born of a legal union between a citizen father and a citizen mother would be granted citizenship by descent (Beard, 2015). Citizenship in the United States can be obtained by birth or registration. People are generally born U.S. citizens if they are born in America or are born overseas to U.S. citizens. They may also obtain U.S. nationality as a youngster as a result of the marriage of one or both adults.
IntroductionThe detailed investigation of clinical cases is a critical necessity for a health care system interested in improving the quality of life of the population and improving public health. It should be understood, however, that as far as the patient is concerned, their diagnosis is not always obvious, as it is often associated with subjective experiences of their own deteriorating health, feelings of stigma, and any possibility of inaccurate clinical tests. It is true that laboratory tests are a scientifically reasonable practice to refine the diagnosis as much as possible, but the possibility of human or instrumental error is never ruled out. Therefore, a comprehensive approach to clarifying the diagnosis, using a synthesis of scientifically based and subjective aspects of the course of the disease. This paper consistently
evaluates an example of such a comprehensive approach, describing a case study of HIV infection.Background InformationAlthough it is not a societal issue, especially in light of COVID-19, humanity is exposed to several pandemics on a daily basis. One of these pandemics is HIV, as a huge number of individuals are exposed to this infection: according to statistical studies, the number of HIV-positive patients will exceed 37.7 million globally by 2020 (UNAIDS, 2021). People from every continent are exposed to the disease, which gives it pandemic status. HIV itself is an infection caused by the human immunodeficiency virus – during this disease, a pathogen from the class of retroviruses affects the patient’s immune T and B lymphocytes, resulting in lowered immunity. It is true that HIV has never been
the cause of a person’s death, but instead, death occurs due to critical immune suppression and the development of opportunistic diseases.PurposeThe purpose of this study is to determine a comprehensive approach to diagnosing HIV in a hypothetical patient.QuestionCan HIV infection in a suspected patient really be detected comprehensively?Hypotheses 1. HIV infection can be detected by obtaining laboratory tests alone. 2. The use of the comprehensive method increases the reliability of the diagnostic results.ProcedureEquipment Used  * History questionnaire.  * Rapid ELISA test kit.  * PCR test kit.  * Sanitary kit for physiological and clinical examination.Procedures 1. A hypothetical patient comes to see a general practitioner and talks about his or her concerns. The physician (after signing informed consent and consent for medical services) asks a
series of clarifying questions to narrow down diagnostic options. The end point is to determine a possible (but not exact) diagnosis and referral to the following stages of diagnosis. 2. The lab technician sterilizes the site for the blood sample, administers an injection, and draws a few milliliters of blood for analysis. The puncture site is treated with a disinfectant. 3. The blood sample taken in the second step is used for PCR testing. In addition, the man gives a semen sample for PCR testing.ResultsThis laboratory work explores three types of HIV testing. The first step uses a patient questionnaire, an example of which is shown in Figure 1 below. It is an extensive questionnaire that is completed by a general practitioner to clarify the diagnosis. In addition,

Thus, they should strive to ensure the well-being of every person in order to honor the Lord. In this regard, the current financial plan was designed in a manner that would benefit all the stakeholders involved, including healthcare providers of critical patients and consulting staff.The potential holes and unknowns in the project’s financial planAlthough the financial plan seemingly addresses most of the expenses that may occur during the project realization, there are still some unknowns that should be considered. As such, O’Connell
A house is more than simply a place to live; in fact, that is only one description of a house. A home is a place where one feels more comfortable and looks forward to living through every day. A house is constructed not with stones or timbers but with the link of family. A person may own every materialistic property on the earth, but it would be not very sensible if he did not have someone with whom to exchange it. In other terms, expressing pleasure is also linguistically tied to home. Additionally, home is more than a physical location; it is a state of mind. They share a sense of joy and pleasure with their family members.A home is when one understands they are around individuals who
can run them nuts in a second and make them feel good in the very same second. Home signifies that no matter what one is experiencing or how difficult life becomes, there will always be someone watching out for them. When a person is secure enough to provide an honest account of themselves, they know they will be accepted definitively. For myself, I can single out a few places where I feel at home. This work was written with the aim of explaining one’s own concept of home and a place where a person feels at home.For me, home is made up of memories of memorable moments that contributed to shaping and teaching me. As a result, my house is also people, and when home takes on a
human figure, it is referred to as a family. I feel that family is a relative concept that is determined by connections rather than blood (Hess). No matter where I go in the future, this atmosphere and these individuals who have shaped me as a human and shown me how to behave will always be a strong foundation for me. I know I can always return home. Indeed, the spirit is where the household is.Since college is where people spend most of their day, I feel at ease. My classmates, whom I have known for many years, are also at the same school. For instance, I have a friend in the same class as me who is like a sibling to me. We communicate a lot, and he
home is the place where I can return at any time, and if not all, then one person can definitely help me. Home is a sense of calm and security, and for myself, I single out such a factor as communication. The house is the place where you studied something for a long time and communicated with people who, as a result, became close to me. Feeling at home is an essential feeling for every person because it gives people support and faith in themselves and their loved ones.
The coronavirus pandemic, which broke out all over the world for almost three years, completely changed the way of life of the modern world. Many researchers, journalists, and writers cover this topic and talk about various situations that can sometimes lead to shock. O’Connor Meg wrote about one of these cases in the article “Maricopa county moved homeless people to Sweltering parking lots in response to COVID-19”. This analysis aims to study this material in order to identify what actions were taken incorrectly and what consequences this entailed.People without permanent residence have become a particular threat to the spread of the pandemic. This is because this group has nowhere to live, and they often have close contact with each other, do not follow hygiene rules, and have minimal
access to medical care. One of the opinions is that it is necessary to limit its causes with this problem. In other words, it is necessary to increase the level of social assistance to the homeless, increasing the availability of housing and social benefits. On the other hand, it is believed that homelessness and unemployment are psychological phenomena, and external factors cannot significantly contribute to their elimination. Thus, the COVID-19 pandemic and the situation of the homeless have become particularly acute in the United States of America.The incident described in the article under study occurred in Maricopa County. There, next to Arizona’s biggest homeless shelter, Central Arizona Shelter Services (CASS) has been hosting tents with homeless people for a long time (O’Conner para. 1). As a measure to
combat COVID-19, the state decided to relocate and encamp the camp near the encampment as part of Maricopa County’s, which was now located in the open air. Thus, hundreds of people were forced to change their habitat to a fenced asphalt place without shade in the triple-digit summer heat.As an example of a victim of homeless resettlement, there was the case of Elisha McKinley. Even though the woman has almost found a place to live, she was moved to the camp a few months ago. Moreover, McKinley faced police misconduct, as they threw away a cart that contained birth certificate, IDs and house-warming gifts from her daughter (O’Conner para. 5). In addition, although the government initially assessed these measures as temporary, permanent lamps were installed, from which people
were expelled, preventing many of them from returning to the same place.All these measures were taken to contain the outbreak among the homeless part of the population, but the government managed to keep the situation under control. In addition to the absurdity of bringing people out into the open under the scorching sun, this decision was met with great doubt both from society and the state authorities. This factor became stronger after it became known about the death of three people in the fenced parking lot.Moreover, despite the negative in the direction of moving homeless people to the parking lot, social services request to change the zoning permit, that is, to increase it. This decision should attract a more significant number of people without a home. However, like
for homeless residents, but this is only a tiny fraction of the entire infected homeless population.Therefore, this work carried out an analysis of the article about the not entirely fictitious actions of the right of Phoenix. The authorities, in the fight against a new coronavirus infection, moved homeless people to a fenced parking lot in the heat. This action led to the death of several people, which led to a wave of discontent from the general public. Because the pandemic is still not defeated, many people are losing their jobs and applying for unemployment benefits. Therefore, service providers and the state government need to work out measures to solve the potential problem. One of the positive trends has become the distribution of housing rental assistance.
Homelessness is a major social, economic, and, most importantly, healthcare issue. There are currently hundreds of thousands of homeless people in the United States. If homeless people have already suffered greatly from a number of diseases before the pandemic, such as tuberculosis, HIV, drug addiction, and alcoholism, today COVID-19 is most prevalent among them (Canoso, 2021). The current American healthcare system is difficult to navigate under, even with the best of circumstances. For homeless people, the only medical care is being provided by hospital emergency departments. Emergency departments are costly and, since most homeless people do not have insurance, the money spent caring for these people can reach millions of dollars (Jain, 2021). However, even this amount of money does not solve the issue of homelessness; it only
provides a temporary solution for people on the streets suffering. The current system of providing healthcare to the homeless is exceedingly expensive (Jain, 2021). In addition, it yields little to no actual result in caring for these people. This system requires a drastic change of the approach of solving the issue of homelessness to ensure people’s safety and sustainability of the economy.The complexity of caring for homeless people and the issues that led them to this state requires a highly coordinated partnership of major healthcare organizations. According to Tsai et al. (2017), homeless people, provided with improved housing outcomes and primary care services, move to a stable, healthy state relatively fast. As such, relocating the money to provide shelter and improve housing for homeless people would ensure a
positive result of spending the budget to care for the homeless. However, this solution is unobtainable in the nearest future, and until the majority of homeless people can be housed, the rate of homelessness will continue to grow. In this case of unavailability of sheltering or housing, mobile street medical teams could bring healthcare to the people in need. This would require the cooperation of major healthcare organizations to design and develop such teams. Such a measure would ensure the efficiency of spending the budget to provide healthcare. Funding the teams of physicians to provide the availability of medical assistance to homeless people would require the budget that is already being spent; however, it would yield actual results.The change that can both provide effective care for homeless people
IntroductionIn the United States, each state has its specially established laws regarding immigration on top of the governing federal laws. Consequently, some states have tougher immigration rules than others, depending on several factors. Some of these factors include demographics, geography, religion, history, and lawmakers. The state immigration policies shape the lives of immigrants in terms of education and socioeconomic status, among others. While Alabama and California have a relatively high immigrant populations, Alabama has tougher immigration policies than California.Immigration LawsIn Alabama, the immigration policy regarding access to education is more unfavorable to undocumented immigrants compared to that of California. According to “Alabama state immigration laws” (2019), a new immigration policy requires schools to run checks on the immigration status of students to track and collect data. This controversial
policy restricts immigrants from accessing public and state-owned schools (“Alabama state immigration laws,” 2019). Furthermore, despite the court having halted this law, Alabama education institutions are still causing havoc for immigrant students by making it impossible to access equal education as other students.California, on the contrary, ignores federal laws to run policies that favor immigrants’ access to education. The state prohibits running checks for immigration status during the administration of students in schools. Indeed, California passed the Dream Act, which allows immigrants to pay equal tuition fee rates as other Native Americans (“California laws protecting immigrants’ civil rights,” 2019). The policy allows immigrant students to pay in-state tuition fee rates as those of public universities (Migliarini & Stinson, 2021). The in-state immigrants can also apply and enjoy tuition
fee-related financial benefits given to all students. For undocumented students, alternative ways of identification are allowed during the sitting of graduate exams.Theories of PowerAlabama’s strict education policy against immigration could be explained by the state autonomy theory. In-state autonomy theory, a state politically operates towards retaining its territorial integrity against the indigenous or ethnic demands for independence (Svarstad, 2018). Alabama’s political powers retain their territorial power by denying the immigrants the chance to grow in terms of education. By limiting their level of educational access, the state ensures that the minority will forever remain dependent on the majority.Pluralism, on the other hand, explains the large acceptance of immigrants in California educational institutions. Pluralism is the recognition and acceptance of diversity in a political body (Svarstad, 2018). This power
theory permits the coexistence of various lifestyles, convictions, and interests. California’s political system supports diversification by allowing immigrant students to access equal education as the Natives so long as it achieves a stable and democratic political power. The state promotes power across various elite groups, including minorities.Other Factors Explaining the DifferencesDemographic is a major factor that explains the differences in immigration policies between the two states. In Alabama, at least 3% of its general population is immigrants. As of 2019, 27% of the California population was composed of immigrants (Kashyap, 2019). The higher population of immigrants in California pushes the states to create a positive environment for the majority as opposed to Alabama. Furthermore, most of the immigrants in California are located in urban areas, in contrast to
the majority of Alabama immigrants who live in rural areas.Socioeconomic status, history, and access to power are other factors that explain immigration law differences between the two states. Due to the lack of access to quality education and other public benefits as restricted by immigration policy in Alabama, the immigrants maintain low socioeconomic statuses compared to those living in California (Kashyap, 2019). In terms of history, California has a long history of having the largest number of immigrants, especially from as far as the 17th century (Kashyap, 2019). Alabama, on the other hand, has a shorter history of hosting immigrants hence the reluctance to embrace the ethnic groups. Lastly, California has easy access to power for immigrants considering their high population, which gives some immigrants a chance to
be in political seats. Vying for a political seat in Alabama is impossible for immigrants, especially with the restricted I.D. application procedure.State of Migration Patterns in the StatesThe existing immigration policies in the two states have altered the patterns of migration, with California having vivid and Alabama with fading patterns. The tougher immigration laws in Alabama have significantly reduced the growth of the immigrant population in the state. In the past 20 years, Alabama has started attracting a sizeable number of immigrants due to high potential growth for the group (Kashyap, 2019). However, the recently aligned policies have made it harder for immigrants to access education, health, and economic stability. The lack of these major factors that play a great role in human development has seen a reduced
pattern of immigrants moving into the state. Although Alabama legalizes same-sex marriage, the patterns of migrations are likely to go graphically down in the future.California started to attract immigrants highly in the 1970s, and recent policies have increased the number of immigrants entering the state. In the United States, California is known to have the highest immigrant population, and the number is still growing in recent years (Kashyap, 2019). The favorable policies create a positive environment for the growth and development of immigrants in the country. The legalization of same-sex marriage in 2008 also played a role in pushing up the pattern of immigrants in the state. Furthermore, with more expected favorable immigrant policies, the patterns of migration to California will rise in the future.U.S. Supreme Court Prigg
v. Pennsylvania, 41 U.S. 16 Pet. 539 539 (1842)The Pennsylvania statute of 1826 was deemed lawfully wrong for penalizing a slave owner that crossed jurisdictions to recover the slave. Edward Prigg, a citizen of Maryland State, was penalized in the court of Pennsylvania for forcibly taking a negro woman from the county to Maryland State. Margaret Morgan, a Negro slave, had escaped from Maryland to Pennsylvania in 1832. Morgan was the slave of Margret Ashmore according to the laws of Maryland. Prigg, as an agent and attorney to Ashmore, caused Morgan to be kidnapped and brought back to Maryland.The Pennsylvania law indicted Prigg for breaking the law which protected negro women from forcibly being taken and used for the slavery trade. The Pennsylvania court charged Prigg with felonies
and imposed various penalties, including a sum of not less than 500 000 dollars and a jail sentence of not less than seven years which would be served under hard labor conditions, among other provisions. Prigg pleaded not guilty, and the case was moved to the Pennsylvanian Supreme court.The supreme nullified the statute judgment by citing that the ruling had violated constitutional provisions. According to the U.S. constitution of 1842, slaves were the property of the owner so long as the owner legally acquired them. Therefore, Prigg was not wrong for using whichever means possible as an attorney to help Ashmore recover her property, Morgan. In this case, the Pennsylvania State had to alter its case ruling as it violated constitutional law. The state changed its law by
In the article “The influence of peers during adolescence: Does homophobic name-calling by peers change gender identity?” the authors claim that negative name-calling among peers can lead to a change in gender identity. Firstly, this is because negative experiences with peers of the same sex result in the need to identify with peers of the opposite sex. Secondly, during the period of growing up, the adolescents’ identity is not yet fully established. Therefore, they are constantly re-evaluating whether the identity formation is going in the right direction. DeLay et al. (2018) recognize that homophobia can be directed at homosexual and heterosexual adolescents. This is presumably because the purpose of victimization is to hurt someone’s feelings, not point out real flaws.Gender identity development is a critical stage in developing
The first mention of a homosexual act is found in the Old Testament Book of Leviticus. And it is said there about this in a prohibitive manner: “Do not lie down with a man as with a woman: this is an abomination.” (Leviticus 18:22) The Apostle Paul says the following: “Just as men, having rejected natural intercourse with women, burn with lust for one another: men do shameful deeds with men, preparing for themselves the retribution that they deserve, having gone astray.” (Rom 1:27) First of all, when talking about homosexuality – the scriptures talk about “intercourse” or “lust,” but not about orientation in the sense that homosexual people today have in mind – an equal love relationship between two partners of the same sex. Homosexual relationships have
books of homosexual relationships with a relationship with women. Homosexuality existed in the ancient world and the Middle Ages – but it was never understood as an equal union.In the Christian world, the execution was supposed to be for sodomites. In England, sodomites were executed until the New Times; for a long time, homosexuals were one of the targets of the Inquisition. The Code of Justinian in Byzantium provided severe punishments for them: up to castration and the death penalty. Given the high religiosity in the authorities, such persecution was supported by religious overtones. However, there was no equal modern understanding of the union, even at the level of a philosophical idea: such events were a deviation from the norm and were not perceived fundamentally.
A hospital-acquired pressure injury (HAPI) is a localized injury of underlying tissue or skin that some patients suffer during their stay in a hospital. HAPI is typically a result of prolonged immobility of patients, leading to unrelieved pressure upon bony prominences. In combination with shear, this pressure is linked to other variables such as age, perfusion, nutritional status, hematological measurements, sickness severity, and diabetes (Rondinelli et al., 2018). Despite the recent decline, the number of patients who acquired pressure injury during their stay is still over a million in the USA (Tschannen & Anderson, 2020). The development of HAPI increases patients’ risks of dying during the hospital stay by 2.8 times and dying within 30 days after leaving the medical facility by 1.69 (Tschannen & Anderson, 2020). Additionally,
hospital-acquired pressure injury is accompanied by substantial pain and suffering, delayed functional recovery, as well as extended time for healing and hospital stay (Tschannen & Anderson, 2020). Even though much research has been done on the subject, HAPI remains a significant issue for elderly patients and a costly challenge for hospitals.During the patients’ time at the hospital, the primary care for them is provided by and the responsibility of the nurse practitioners. Since pressure injuries are proven to be preventable, the early recognition of the modifiable causes of the development of HAPI and taking corrective measures can stop the progression of the disease (Rondinelli et al., 2018). As such, working directly with patients enables nursing professionals to identify the symptoms and stop pressure injuries from developing. Failing to
assess and prevent HAPI in patients accurately can lead to a severe impact on their lives and delay the healing process (Rondinelli et al., 2018). Furthermore, slow healing results in even longer hospital stay, which in turn facilitates the worsening of HAPI and increases healthcare costs.Within the framework of the assignment, for constructing a PCIOT question, each of its elements is further identified and described. The patients suffering from hospital-acquired pressure injuries are typically considered to be the older generation. The injury is acquired during their prolonged stay in a hospital, affected by their immobility, nutritional status, and sickness severity. One of the evidence-based solutions that can be applied to reducing the rates of acquiring and developing pressure injury in elderly patients is the minimization of shear and
The framers of the Constitution did not believe that citizens would take an active part in the political life of the country. While many freedoms were incorporated in the Constitution, its framers doubted whether people were interested enough in politics to follow its makings. It is true that in those times, information was limited; however, nowadays, mass media help people to be well-informed about political events. Moreover, the media act as a watchdog on the governmental powers (How Does the Media Affect Politics). Informational agencies report the events and let readers make their minds about them or share their views (How Does the Media Affect Politics). However, it always pays not to rely on the media too much and take pains to follow the political life of the
Olivier Armantier’s et al. article, “How Economic Crises Affect Inflation Beliefs: Evidence from the COVID-19 Pandemic,” was published in the Journal of Economic Behavior and Organization on July 24, 2021.

Although this paper is an independent work, Armantier et al. (2021) complemented other research in the field analyzing economic changes during the COVID-19 recession. A feature of
with numerous graphs and tables presented in the article.I liked the study by Armantier et al. (2021) because the authors look at non-traditionally triggered crises and household responses. In addition, through comparative analysis with past crises, Armantier et al. (2021) determine the spread of the crisis due to erroneous assumptions about inflation to other areas of the economy (Armantier et al., 2021). For example, the Great Recession was predominantly a strong negative demand shock driven by a falling house and stock prices. I also liked that the authors found evidence for strong polarization of inflation perceptions and identified differences between demographic groups.
With the widespread use of digital technology, email has gained particular importance. With email, communication has become much easier, as people have been able to communicate with colleagues, relatives, loved ones, and business partners and representatives of organizations, literally in real-time, avoiding all the difficulties of “physical” communication. However, what is interesting is a study of the extent to which such communication has been modified with the advent of the phenomenon of email.In the context of interpersonal communication, two effects should be highlighted. First, email has meaningfully broadened the scope of communication so that communication is no longer only realized in the real world but can easily be continued online as well. This has changed the perception of interpersonal communication and greatly simplified the availability of communication. Meanwhile,
Despite numerous calls to concentrate on customer satisfaction or improve work engagement, countless American corporate executives remain obsessed with their companies’ financial growth. Even so, making a profit is the only way the world can tell if a company is doing things correctly. Furthermore, if a company ceases to make money, it may cease operations entirely. Clearly, some businesses lack the financial resources to fully capitalize on available product market growth opportunities. Others do not have opportunities that are commensurate with their financial means. Sources of finance and product-market opportunities influence how quickly a company can grow.To understand how fast a company should grow, a manager must first investigate the relationship between “inflation, capital costs, profitability, growth, and the market value of a company’s common stock” (Fruhan, 2014,
para. 4). The profitability of a company depends on two factors: the expected return on equity (ROE) and the cost of capital. If ROE is predicted to surpass the cost of equity capital, more growth will only have a positive impact on the business’s operations and health.On the other hand, if ROE is not expected to exceed the cost of capital, then the company should consider a strategy of rapid negative growth. Insufficient earnings combined with the necessity to do little more than finance inflation-induced revenue growth can be devastating for the firm’s value (Fruhan, 2014). Businesses in this situation should contemplate a rapid slowing growth program if they are unable to increase revenue.However, in order to maintain properly set growth, a company must meet inflation expectations and
The chapter in question tells the story of how global trade has enriched and changed cultures. During the analyzed period, many wealthy rulers and merchants began to demonstrate their power by acquiring exotic works of art. Ideas and books circulated, and cultural exchange was extremely active. People became more tolerant of diversity and more aware of how diverse the world around them was. Ties between different cultures were strengthened because of the continuing strong globalization. European influence had spread so far that the norms and habits of people from the West were beginning to be considered universal and objective (Adelman et al., 2021, p. 597). The key term of the era becomes the Enlightenment, marking a period of triumph of human reason. People begin to think that they

The world has become highly integrated due to the spread of international trade. However, not all countries were willing to change and only agreed to adapt to the new norms. The Islamic and Chinese worlds generally maintained their identities, but America and Oceania could not resist European cultural pressure.
Silke, A. (Ed.). (2019). Routledge handbook of terrorism and counterterrorism . Routledge.The book describes the main acts carried out by the group, as well as its fundamental motives. In that way, the source includes information on the 1978 bank robberies and other violent actions that ultimately led to the Sri Lankan Civil War. Additionally, LTTE’s objective to create an independent and separate state for Sri Lankan Tamils, who the government had previously oppressed, is reviewed. The research source is relevant for investigating the goals of the terrorist group, as well as explaining the establishment of an independent Tamil state. Therefore, it would be helpful for my analysis of LTTE’s emergence process.Thurairajah, T. (2021).

The article highlights ways through which the Sri Lankan minority groups acknowledged their right to an independent state and how such groups shared their ideology beyond their country. The source’s relevancy to the exploration of the group’s ideology is evident, as it explains its impact on the rest of the world. It was useful in the process of defining the concept of Tamil nationalism in my paper.Sauerborn, D. (2017). Political violence revisited: The liberation tigers of Tamil Eelam .

Specifically, his role in the establishment and progress of the terrorist group are discussed. Furthermore,
the paper also mentions LTTE’s connections to other terror groups. Understanding the leader’s intentions and the organization’s total impact on other groups is relevant for an in-depth investigation of LTTE.

Moreover, the paper explores possible reasons for LTTE’s fall and the factors that had contributed to it significantly.

The introduction of computer technologies in modern society involves many activities that seemingly do not have a connection with computer technologies themselves, such as the recruiting process. With the rise of corporate culture and the development of a more competitive market of candidates, a detailed candidate selection process required a more straightforward solution than manual filtering. Recently, after assessing the possibilities of wide application of newly developed AI technologies, Human Resource managers started using program software to reduce the workload associated with the selection process. The article by Pardes explores how the candidates learned to manipulate the technology in favor of their own interests.The article starts with an interview with the person who discovered the consistent patterns in the operation of the software’s candidate selection system, Shirin Nilizadeh.
According to Pardes, a friend approached Nilizadeh with concerns about her resume. Alizadeh’s friend has come to the conclusion that her resumes do not reach HR managers as they inexplicably seem to lack something. Through a series of enhancements to a collection of random resumes, Nilizadeh defined that using certain words not necessarily associated with required qualifications can increase the candidates’ position in the resume-ranking program. While Nilizadeh’s interest was related to academic purposes, many platforms offer the candidates a chance to improve their resume with all kinds of hacks, such as inserting relevant keywords in invisible font. It turns out that there are many ways for the candidates to increase their chances of to interview, from including the names of prestigious universities to using competitor company names
and copying the job description details.Further in the article, the author explains that focusing on efficiency can result in over-dignifying technology. One of the interviewees in the article, Joseph Fuller, suggests that excessive use of artificial intelligence in the recruiting process can create “a high-tech pathway to discrimination” (qtd. in Pardes). Therefore, without knowing the necessary keywords or using the different formulations for the existing skills, a substantial portion of job applicants may never proceed to the next stage of the selection process. According to Julie Schweber’s perspective featured in Pardes’ article, software filters as many as 75% of applicants based on the resume meeting the specific job criteria. The issue is worsened by the fact that third parties offer paid resume enhancement and applicant tracking systems, influencing
malicious or harmful purposes. Therefore, while the use of technology seemingly increases objectivity in the decision-making process, the potential manipulations can equal the outcomes of nepotism, corruption, and bribery.Lastly, I decided to choose this article because it displays the weaknesses of technological systems and their improper application in modern society. It was interesting to learn about the influence of the nuances between human and machine perceptions in reading the text typed in white color on white paper. Acquiring the additional perspective from the recruiting process can benefit me in identifying potential mistakes and threats in my future career as an IT professional.
Good Country People is a short allegorical story, written by Flannery O’Connor, about the dual nature of religious workers, loneliness, and egocentrism. Indeed, even the characters’ names possess a hidden meaning about their appearance, personality, or life. The story commences with the description of two old ladies and their children who belong to two different social classes. Mrs. Freeman is a maid in Mrs. Hopewell’s house, and the former was described as a woman with two primary unpleasant facial expressions for the public. Since the story was told from Mrs. Hopewell’s viewpoint, she was presented as a calm, polite, and tolerant person, noticing but forgiving other people’s flaws, including her daughter Joy, who chose the formal name Hulga. Their bitter coexistence was interrupted by a 19-year-old handsome man,
Manley Pointer, who sold Bibles door-to-door and claimed to have the same heart disease as Joy but appeared to be a criminal. Through symbolism, O’Connor was able to convey the characters’ unique features with their names, connection to parents with Hulga’s wooden leg, Joy’s mindset with her glasses, and Pointer’s non-religiousness with the hollow Bible.The first symbol is the characters’ names that partly represent their fates and personalities. For example, the reader is not provided with the first names of Mrs. Freeman and Mrs. Hopewell. They acquired their last names from marriages, indirectly pointing to the only function that women could have in the South at that time, indicating the forced fate that is opposite of their actual situation. For instance, Mrs. Freeman is not a slave, but
she is not free because she is a maid, while Mrs. Hopewell is hopeless. The women’s personalities were revealed in their dialogues and their children. Both are polite and consider themselves good individuals who sometimes have to endure other people’s rudeness or ignorance. Mrs. Freeman’s daughters, Glynese and Carramae, red and blond girls, whom Joy associated with Glycerin and Caramel, indicating a lack of respect for their chosen life path (O’Connor 2). Moreover, Joy was never joyful in reality; thus, she changed her name to Hulga to complete the image of an ugly person to avoid the traditional path of all South women. Specifically, she seemed to want to avoid marriage and childbirth.The second allegoric element in this story was Hulga’s wooden leg. This symbol represents her inability
to become independent of her mother. Indeed, she still lives with her parent, is unemployed, and does not have relationships with other people. It appears that she was born with a congenital heart defect that, in the best-case scenario, would allow her to live until her forties (O’Connor 5). Still, Mrs. Hopewell wanted her daughter to get married at the right age. However, an accidental gunshot wound at the age of ten became a pivotal point in Joy’s life when she was implanted with the wooden leg and escaped the usual fate of her female counterparts. Despite a PhD degree, the girl did not work and lived with her mother, waiting for her own death. The appearance of Pointer gave her a tiny hope for a new life.
However, the girl’s dreams did not become a reality because Hulga was deceived by the young man and lost her artificial leg. Nevertheless, the disappearance of her prosthesis was an allegory for the opportunity to detach from the parental home and start an adult life.The third allegoric element of the short story was Hulga’s glasses that Manley stole along with her wooden leg. Hulga’s glasses are her vision and ability to see the world clearly, both literally and figuratively. However, she was ready to refuse her beliefs for this man. Thus, she allowed him to take away her glasses during the moment of intimacy: “when her glasses got in his way, he took them off her and slipped them into his pocket” (O’Connor 13). Since Pointer escaped, Hulga
was left without glasses because she no longer could look at the world through the lens of her old mindset.The fourth symbol was the young man’s suitcase with two Bibles. Indeed, one of the Bibles was an empty container for whiskey, cards, and condoms (O’Connor 15). The hollow represented not only Pointer’s absence of Christian beliefs but was also an allegory for the insincerity of some religious workers, who talk about God and are simultaneously involved in sinful acts. Furthermore, this picture and the young man’s altered behavior not only ruined Hulga’s hope for a different future but also confirmed her atheist believes.In summary, O’Connor’s Good Country People represents the issues of the dishonesty of religious workers, the difficulty of detaching from parental supervision, and the obsession of
SummaryToday opioids are the most commonly used drug in the United States. For a long time, opiates have been used as effective pain relievers, but their relaxing effects started making people abuse them recreationally. Opioids cause a strong feeling of euphoria, which leads to the risk of using recreational substances. Addicted people have a constant desire to increase the dose, which is a severe medical and social problem. The United States is facing one of the worst drug crises in history. More than half of deaths are associated with prescription opioids: heroin and fentanyl (Coon et al., 2022). The number has risen nationwide amid the COVID-19 pandemic. The crisis has acquired enormous proportions and become a brake on the economy and a threat to national security.Forms of Treatment
It is necessary to help a person acquire a sincere desire to battle for life. Rehab centers remain an effective chance for an addicted person to return to a healthy, drug-free life. It uses a unique rehabilitation program that allows one not only to overcome addiction but to return to a healthy lifestyle and realize its value (Brown, 2018). To provide effective motivation, the psychiatrist should learn all the necessary data about the addicted person. It will require the assistance of relatives and friends who can tell about the psychological atmosphere, patients’ habits, interests, and family relationships.
IntroductionThe United States has a history of discrimination and inequality toward African Americans. Even after President Abraham Lincoln outlawed enslavement and won the American Civil War in 1965, prejudice toward black people remained engrained in both the northern and southern cultural structures of the United States (Jaffa 260). American subconscious biases endure over time and pervade organizational settings, social systems, individual neural processes, and tendencies of regular contact. The recent nationwide riots against police violence have resulted in a sea change in discourse and views regarding America’s institutional racism. The assassinations of George Floyd, Ahmaud Arbery, Rashard Brooks, and Breonna Taylor, among others, have fueled calls for transformation to the enforcement and justice system (Clark et al. 150). Numerous Black parents and Black-led organizations have advocated for these
improvements in neighborhoods across the nation for generations. This essay analyzes some of the actions parents of color may take to realize an end to racial discrimination and violence in the United States.Advocating for Systematic EqualityIn America, prejudice is a financial, institutional, and social system. That system purposefully marginalizes and alienates Black people while preserving and growing clear and persuasive privileges for white people, resulting in increased possibilities for employment, schooling, accommodation, and inequality in the criminal justice system. To begin healing and moving toward true social equality, racial minorities must confront not only recent injustices but also hurts dating back to the country’s founding.Since the nation’s establishment, segregation has served a significant part in developing the United States educational, health care, property, employment systems, and practically every
other aspect of society. Elizabeth reminds Black children throughout her narrative of the evils of racism in America’s history in her narration:These narratives served as a teaching tool for young African-Americans about their physicality and susceptibility. The stories served as introductions to fear and hopelessness. The stories served as the fertile basis for their fury. These narratives taught children that anti-black prejudice and brutality were never far away. They witnessed these infringements numerous times up close and on their smartphones. (Elizabeth 307)For instance, parents of color have demonstrated the abolition of institutional racism along school and district lines in education settings. For example, in Brooklyn, New York, parents from many ethnicities collaborated to abolish talented monitoring initiatives favoring universal courses (Smalls 362). Allies should also advocate for measures
that promote equal access to the difficult and advanced curriculum for all kids in their state governments and local education boards.Joining Movements against Racist ViolenceBlack Lives Matter has always been more interested in human rights than civil liberties. BLM has fought for a fundamentally restructuring of civilization in which Black people are not subjected to deliberate marginalization. Nonetheless, the revolution’s quantifiable influence on the constitutional environment cannot be denied. Since 2013, these activists have cumulatively caused major change on a local and national level, including the ouster of prominent fraudulent magistrates (Clark et al. 150). In her text, The Trayvon Generation , Elizabeth enumerates the racist violence against George Floyd as follows:I am unable to breathe again. A knee placed his entire weight on his neck for eight
minutes and forty-six seconds. “I’m having trouble breathing,” followed by, “Mama!” George Floyd broke down in tears. “Mama… I’m done!” exclaimed George Floyd. His mother had been deceased for two years when he shouted out for her during his lynching. (Elizabeth 307)In Chicago, organizations such as BYP100 and Assata’s Daughters resulted in Anita Alvarez losing her re-election. She unexpectedly declined to prosecute police officers associated with 68 fatal shootings (Clark et al. 152). The BLM protest’s continuous work on police misconduct contributed to the publication of four groundbreaking US Department of Justice findings confirming rampant police misconduct in Baltimore, Chicago, Ferguson, and Cleveland (Clark et al. 159). Additionally, the revolution’s wider societal significance has been immeasurable.Speaking out against Prejudice and Lending Support to Fellow Black ParentsRacism is institutionalized
in the finance, schooling, and even commercial sectors. It pervades practically every facet of human interaction in cultures, adversely impacting black people. For example, African-Americans are underrepresented in leadership roles across commercial sectors, face barriers to affordable housing, are numerous in the criminal system, and their medical encounters are markedly different from white and non-black residents (Cain 156). Discrimination and inequality manifest themselves in various ways, from overt exclusionary behaviors to the most covert policies.Voting laws and proficiency exams were documented examples in the United States, which compelled individuals to spend on their right to vote and disqualified those who could not read. This disadvantaged strategy members of low-income neighborhoods. Therefore, parents of color could empower black, indigenous, and people-of-color (BIPOC) to form support communities to share their
stories and brainstorm methods to combat racism (Ali et al. 3). In the case of Darnella, who filmed the murder of George Floyd, the event must have been traumatizing, and as such, forums like BICOP would help her heal from the aftermath of the scenario (Elizabeth 310). Elizabeth explains that the incident was dehumanizing and traumatic in her narration as follows:Darnella Frazier, a 17-year-old Minneapolis lady who witnessed George Floyd’s killing in action on May 25th while on her regular jog to the corner store, recorded it on her handset and uploaded it to her Facebook page at 1:46 a.m. with the caption “They executed him straight in front of cup foods over the south on 38th and Chicago!! (Elizabeth 310)Additionally, by employing leadership opportunities for fellow Black
of various ethnic backgrounds joined to eliminate talented surveillance measures favoring universal education. Additionally, through associating with movements such as the BLM, he has worked for a fundamental reorganization of society in which Black people are not subject to deliberate marginalization. For example, BYP100 and Assata’s Daughters worked to defeat Anita Alvarez’s re-election bid in Chicago. As a result, she surprised many by declining to charge police officers involved in 68 deadly shootings. Nevertheless, the efforts of Black parents have had a demonstrable impact on the administrative and institutional frameworks and cannot be disputed.
Social responsibility entails policies that organizations put in place as part of a company’s governance projected to ensure the corporate’s functions are effective and beneficial to all stakeholders. These guidelines help protect the environment, improve the quality of life for societies, and provide a conducive working environment through recognizing and appreciating talented and hardworking employees. This increases customer loyalty as clients feel they are helping the business support worthy initiatives, thus, enabling more access to funds and allowing more investors to join and support the company.The business rewards employees through meaningful praises, which makes them appreciated. It provides workers a chance to lead by example while giving them the capacity to make decisions without interference, demonstrating that they are trusted and capable (Yang et al., 2019). Additional monetary
motivations comprise yearly or semi-yearly bonuses. Additionally, paid time-off and cash prizes help to boost performance while encouraging feelings.The company exercises CSR by adopting a business code of ethics, which shapes workers’ behavior on morals, standards, environment, self-esteem, and customer service. The organization has established dependable systems to protect staff and avoid accidents and injuries (Tamvada, 2020). It also ensures suppliers are aware of and meet the expectations of responsible conduct concerning issues such as affordable costs. For instance, screening dealers to define their past behavior and discuss what the company expects.The only change in CSR that I would suggest is how the organization handles employees’ creativity. I would encourage the company to set a stage for brainstorming, thus, encouraging new ideas and creativity (Tamvada, 2020). Regarding complaints
Purpose: The purpose of this evidence brief is to prove that the utilization of registered nurses as primary team members interacting with patients during telehealth visits in an outpatient setting will improve patient outcomes. 1. PIO In the outpatient clinical setting, will the utilization of registered nurses as a primary team member to perform telehealth visits improve patient outcomes? 2. Background: Due to the increasing demand to access care, there is increased demand for telehealth during the pandemic. The issue is to meet the demand. Registered Nurses need to become Primary Team Members to interact with Patients during Telehealth. 3. Objective: The objective of this research is to discover information on how registered nurses can play a role as primary team members during telehealth visits through Evidence-Based Practice
to improve patient outcomes. 4. Search for evidence was done in databases CINAHL Plus, Pubmed, ***Search words used were “registered nurse and telehealth”, “ role of the nurse in telehealth,” and*** The selection criteria of articles were English language and peer-reviewed articles. was The specifics of articles used were within the last 10*** years, with a majority of them in the last 5*** years, incorporating all evidence levels, I to VII 5. Summary of research-based evidence:     1. Yliluoma, P., & Palonen, M. (2020). Telenurses’ experiences of interaction with patients and family members: nurse–caller interaction via telephone.         1. Nurses’ capabilities and communication skills, including their ability to listen and be sensitive to their patients, nurses’ control of
the interaction to keep it relevant improved telephone interactions with the patients. However, background noises when a caller calls, communication problems such as inadequate communication, callers’ inappropriate behavior, inability to conduct an assessment, callers’ inability to describe the symptoms, issues such as family members providing different information than information provided by callers, technical issues, lack of appointments to accommodate all the callers, and long queues all these make it difficult to have effective interactions (Yliluoma & Palonen 2020).

The article discusses that Telehealth is not just a phone call, but it is a resource for patients
and families and nurses play an important role in providing those services to patients via technology. Nurses are a good resources, and they can provide effective care by using good communication skills and competencies (Mataxen & Webb, 2019). Level V     3. Robeznieks, A. (2021). How to implement telehealth in your practice with equity in mind.         1. Many people are interested in utilizing Telehealth but there are several barriers on both patients’ and clinicians’ sides. Patients lack digital skills and literacy, have no access to the internet, or limited data plan which makes it difficult to have a quality telehealth visit. Similarly, many healthcare settings are unable to provide video-enabled devices to their clinicians, use difficult apps,
or have security issues (Robeznieks, 2021). (Expert Reviewed)     4. Javanparast, S., Roeger L., Kwok Y., Reed RL. (2021). The experience of Australian general practice patients at high risk of poor health outcomes with telehealth during the COVID-19 pandemic: a qualitative study.         1. This study explored the experiences of telehealth for vulnerable patients in general practice during the pandemic. The significant findings of this study concluded that patients are satisfied with telehealth for its convenience and efficiency. However, patients expressed that this only works if the patient and provider have already developed a relationship prior to the transformation of care. Another finding is that the common use of telehealth is for medication refills, follow-ups and reviewing diagnostic
results. (Javaboarast, Kwok, Reed & Roeger, 2021) Level VI     5. Song, Y., Reifsnider, E., Zhao, S., Xie, X., & Chen, H.

This study is to explore the results of medication adherence rate and disease process on patients with rheumatoid arthritis via customized telehealth education versus patients discharged home with standard care instructions. The telehealth education includes disease process, treatment goals, how to take medication properly and side effects. The results of this study concluded that customized telehealth education after discharge leads to a better medication adherence rate and, therefore, better symptom control
and prohibits the progression of the disease. (Chen, Reifsnider, Song, Xie & Zhao, 2020) Level II     6. Asiri, A., AlBishi, S., AlMadani, W., ElMetwally, A., & Househ, M. (2018).

Although telehealth is typically associated with remote care in therapy and related procedures, the paper by Asiri et al. (2018) establishes that telehealth can also be used in a surgical context. Specifically, the authors of the study prove the importance of incorporating telehealth as the device for patient evaluation after the surgery, thus, assessing the efficacy of the surgery and the extent of its success. Moreover, the threat of nosocomial
infections and the associated concerns can be avoided with the help of the proposed technique. The study proves the role of telehealth in modern nursing.     7.

Journal of Medical Internet Research, 22 (9), e20786.         1. The study assesses the extent of telehealth efficacy in the environment of the COVID-19 pandemic. According to the results of the study, the range of telehealth applications by APNs has expanded to embrace a variety of patient-specific needs, which has led to a rise in patient satisfaction rates. Compared to in-person
visits, the use of telehealth has proven to be much more popular with patients as the tool that allows APNs to establish a rapport with the target population quickly. Moreover, the accuracy of the diagnosis and the opportunity to minimize medical errors when performing the assessment of a patient and to administer the required treatment have been noted as important factors in improving the performance of APNs. 6. Summary of expert evidence from professional organizations, experiences, or experts in the specialty     1. The Future of Nursing: Leading Change, Advancing Health. Institute of Medicine. (2011)         1. In the section “Examples of Redesigned Roles for Nurses”, the Department of Veterans Affairs recreated and extended nurses’ roles in the
health care system to collaborate with Advanced Practice Registered Nurses, and the result exceeded its expectation. RNs are assigned to coordinate care and chronic disease management, while APRNs are the primary care providers. The result of this collaboration showed VA patients are getting better care, as evidenced by many quality-of-care indicators in comparison to Medicare patients. (Institute of Medicine, 2011)     2. Jnr, B. A. (2020). Use of telemedicine and virtual care for remote treatment in response to the COVID-19 pandemic.         1. Representing an important voice in the community of experts on the subject matter, Jnr (2020) explains in his paper that the role of nurses in promoting the use of telehealth in the healthcare context is
vital in fighting the coronavirus pandemic. The study outlines the challenges associated with providing virtual care and offers solutions based on the promotion of nurse-patient communication. In turn, Telehealth is seen as a central tool in assisting nurses in building connections with patients. According to the results of the study, telehealth and other tools for remote healthcare during the COVID-19 pandemic has a largely positive effect.     3. Lowe, G., Plummer, V., O’Brien, A.

(2012) details the significance of support and professional performance by advanced practice nurses in the healthcare setting. Specifically, the
research illustrates the role of APNs in the healthcare context has been debated quite profusely and shaped significantly over the past decade. However, the authors agree that the role of an APN in the nursing setting should expand to include of patient education and raising awareness. However, the authors also warn that, with the blurring of the lines between nurses’ roles, certain ambiguity about the functions of an APN emerges. Therefore, the study encourages examining the expansion in the range of APNs’ responsibilities and functions, implying that alleviation of the workload may be needed.     4. Woo, B. F. Y., Lee, J. X. Y., & San Tam, W. W. (2017). The impact of the advanced practice nursing role on the quality of care, clinical outcomes,
that APNs have a critical function in the context of modern healthcare. Specifically, APNs contribute substantially to the extent of a patient’s access to critical care by improving the efficacy of communication and precision in service delivery. Furthermore, the study proves that the inclusion of APNs into the critical care context leads to reduced length of hospital stay, as well as an increased rate of patient satisfaction. Promoting innovation in the hospital setting and encouraging autonomy in nurses, APNs contribute to a significant rise in the efficacy of critical care. Thus, the research establishes an important shift in the perception of APNs and their function in the nursing context, transforming their role in critical care toward a more meaningful one.
Epithelial tissues of the body represent the tissues lining the surfaces of skin, digestive organs, and respiratory organs. They can be found anywhere in the body where a barrier is needed to be formed, with things being able to pass across the created barrier. Because of the wide coverage of epithelial tissues in the body, there are many types of diseases affecting the tissue, and it is essential to know them to understand how the disease affects epithelial tissues. At this time, let’s focus on eczema as one of the widespread concerns of epithelial tissue.Put simply, eczema also referred to as atopic dermatitis, is a condition that affects the skin, which is made of epithelial tissue1. It makes the skin red and itchy and can first manifest in
people as early as childhood. It is important to note that eczema tends to transform into a chronic condition for many people and can disappear and flare up periodically, often depending on environmental factors. Unfortunately, there is no cure that can help clear eczema entirely and make it never reappear. Although, there are several treatments and self-care activities that can help relieve the itching and redness and prevent new flare-ups on a short-term basis. Examples of good practices for eczema include avoiding harsh soaps, moisturizing the skin on a regular basis, as well as applying medicated creams and different types of ointments.Getting to know the symptoms of atopic dermatitis can help identify the signs early to engage in preventive and management efforts, according to a doctor’s recommendations. While
the signs and symptoms of atopic dermatitis can vary from one person to another, they typically include dry skin, itching of different extents, especially during the night, the appearance of red to darker-colored patches, usually on the hands, feet, neck, ankles, wrists, as well as inside the knees and elbows’ bends. The skin affected by eczema usually appears thickened, scaly, and cracked, and due to scratching, it can often be raw, swollen, and highly sensitive to different external factors. Also, one may check for signs of small bumps that can leak fluid and crust over when being scratched.When it comes to the age differentiation of eczema, the onset of the disease is often at five years old, with the highest incidence taking place between three and six months,
happen to people of different ages, although the percentage is much lower than those mentioned for children.The burden of disease can be different depending on its severity as well as the ways of management. However, pain and itchiness of the skin can be quite cumbersome, preventing a person affected by eczema from doing everyday things2. Also, because eczema can often have an unpleasant appearance, some people can be self-conscious about it and get embarrassed, which is quite unfortunate3. Therefore, the problem with eczema is that it can significantly reduce the quality of life and health. Not only is sore and itchy skin annoying, but it also does not perform its protective function effectively, which causes a problem for the overall health of the body.
IntroductionHard disk failure is common among computers and leads to severe damage. The failure results from various causes, including human error, computer hardware failure, malware corruption, media damage, and exposure to heat or water. Changing the HDD before it wears out completely is prudent to protect other hardware and software components (Fernández-Fuentes et al., 2022). While tech-savvies easily replace the HDD, persons with little knowledge of computer hardware find it difficult to replace it. The persons with little knowledge include first-time computer users and those who rarely interact with computer hardware. Novice computer users can follow this instruction guide to effectively change HDD without causing any damage to the computer hardware and software components.These instructions will allow the readers to change the HDD from a faulty computer step
by step and switch on the computer to test the new HDD. While changing the HDD seems easy following this instruction guide, the computer user should have basic computer knowledge. The assistance should be sought if the users interact with computer hardware for the first time. Appropriate assistants include computer experts and authorized computer hardware dealers at the place of HDD purchase.Overall StepsHDD can be upgraded in a fully functioning computer or a faulty laptop. To get started, the readers must ensure that their critical data is backed up in a secondary device such as flash disks or cloud-based storage like Google Drive. The computer must be switched off by following the appropriate booting process. After that, the power supply should be disconnected to avoid any instant of
electric shock. Proper instructions, as indicated on the HDD guide book should be followed. The users should avoid placing the new HDD near heat or magnetic fields that interfere with the storage mechanism. Before inserting the new HDD remove the existing HDD carefully. The computer should be allowed to boot up upon replacing the HDD. The process takes about fifteen to twenty minutes and should be done in a well-ventilated room at average room temperatures.List of Materials and Tools NeededBefore starting the process of changing the HDD, several tools and materials are required. The tools will help avoid static electricity, dust, electric shock, and other hazardous conditions to the computer and the user. Therefore, the user must acquire a list of protective tools before starting the process. The
following list of tools is needed when changing the HDD in a computer.  * Anti-static mat to shield the users and computer equipment from static electricity discharge  * Anti-static vacuum cleaner to cause suction to remove dirt from the computer equipment  * Anti-static wristband to be worn on the writs to prevent static electricity build-up.  *   * Philips-head screwdriver to tighten and drive out screwsThe readers should also ensure that appropriate materials are available before the process. The following list of materials is needed to get the process started.  * A can of compressed air  *   * A can of refrigerant-based propellant cleaner  * A new hard drive diskList of StepsThe following steps should be followed when
changing HDD, and the readers should remember to disconnect the power supply and carefully read the HDD’s manufacturers’ instructions.Back up data on the existing HDDBacking up of data should be done if the existing HDD still works. You can use an external USB or online using OneDrive or Google Drive.Obtain a full, bootable Operating system copyYou should do this step if you replace a primary HDD and are not using a cloning tool. The software can be bought on a DVD or downloaded on a flash drive by creating recovery media.You should decide between an HDD or an SDD (Solid State Drive)Although SDDs are faster and more durable than HDD, they are more expensive. However, the two operate similarly, and you can choose either depending on your budget.Choose
the right driver for your computerDifferent types of computers require different types of HDDs with varying sizes. If you are replacing a laptop’s HDD, you need a 2.5-inch HDD, and if you are replacing a desktop’s HDD, you need a 3.5-inch HDD.Shut down your computer by following the right procedureFollowing the appropriate computer booting process help protect the data and prevent damage to the existing hardware. Unplug the computer from the power supply upon shutting it down.Ground yourself before opening your computer’s system unitUse the anti-static wrist band while standing on the anti-static mat to avoid improper handling of the electronic components. The tools help avoid damaging the computer by electrostatic discharge.Open the system unit caseThis step varies depending on the computer being worked on: desktop or laptop.
If you are working on a desktop, you need to twist off the screws using the Philips-head screwdriver. Meanwhile, laptops either have special cases with special doors for easy insertion and removal of HDD or need unscrewing of various components and battery removal.Locate HDD in the system unitHDDs are often screwed within a cage in the computer’s system unit. Upon locating the HDD, identify power and data connectors and disconnect them from the HDD.Make sure you have removed all the screws and disconnected the HDDUse the Philips-head screwdriver to remove all the screws attaching the HDD to the system unit. If the computer case does not support the drive, you can use your hand to support the HDD. After that, carefully slide the HDD out of the cage
cloning software, but the DVD tray should be ejected first if the recovery media is on a DVD. In case of a USB, insert the USB before turning on the computer. The computer automatically boots up into the Operating System (OS) installer to boot up from USB or DVD drives.Follow on-screen instructions to reinstall the OSUpon reinstalling the OS, the computer automatically re-registers the OS. With a fully operational computer, you can restore the backed-up data. The computer is ready to use, and can be run through diagnostic test to identify any error. Remember to keep the old HDD somewhere safe in case you need it for future use.
The human mind and consciousness present many challenges to researchers, and numerous studies allow them to discover different phenomena, especially in the field of self-awareness. The documentary “Human Consciousness” (2014) from BBC provides viewers with an insight into different experiments which scientists conduct to explore the aspects of the functioning of the human mind. The most notable experiment in the documentary was the mirror self-recognition test, and current research shows that it is highly influenced by sociocultural factors.Despite the fact that the mirror self-recognition test is fairly simple and does not require many resources, it enables researchers to understand the capacity of people to recognize themselves. Essentially, the aim of the mirror self-recognition test is to measure the ability of a child to be aware of themselves. The
experiment takes place in accordance with three main stages, which should be strictly followed. The first stage involves letting the child approach a large mirror and spend several minutes looking at their reflection. The next move involves the parent of the child placing a small mark on the child’s cheek close to the mouth where it can be visible. The third stage implies once again placing the child in front of the mirror and allowing them to see the reflection. The child passes the test if they touch the mark, which proves that they are self-aware and can link the image of the mark visible in the reflection to the actual one on their body. The film experiment showed that children start to demonstrate the signs of self-recognition
only starting at the age of 18 months.At the same time, as the current research suggests, sociocultural factors also play a major role in the ability of the child to pass the mirror self-recognition test. The study conducted by Cebioğlu & Broesch (2021) explored the cross-cultural aspect involved in the test. The purpose of the study was to establish whether children who were raised in different social and cultural had different passing rates for the mirror self-recognition test. Additionally, the research aimed at discovering whether confounding factors such as motivation had any effect on the ability of the child to pass the test. Specifically, the researchers recruited 57 infants ranging in their age from 18 to 22 months. The infants belonged to two different sociocultural environments, namely, rural
discovered that factors such as the motivation of children to show the mark did not affect the experiment. In other words, self-development was the only factor that affected the ability of the child to pass the test successfully.The mirror self-recognition test demonstrated in the “Human Consciousness” documentary enables researchers to gain insight into human self-awareness. Experiments demonstrate that children younger than 18 months old tend to fail to pass the test. At the same time, the results of the research conducted by Cebioğlu & Broesch indicate that sociocultural factors also have great significance when analyzing children’s ability to recognize themselves.
According to Kant’s philosophy, the distinction between a person and a thing runs through several basic criteria, largely related to independence and dignity. A thing is only a means to finitude, that is, to any completion, while man contains completion in himself. Man differs in his finitude from the infinity of the world, but he is valuable in himself and cannot be used as a means. This determines autonomy, that is, the independence of a person. Implicit autonomy determines the inner ability of a person to do anything and, accordingly, the ability to distinguish between good and evil. According to Kant, a person, in contrast to a thing, has a moral navigator that is common to everyone. It is because of the opportunity to master the concepts of
good and evil and use them morally a person differs from a thing. A person cannot be used as a means and therefore, unlike a thing, has no value.Dignity should be perceived as an innate and inalienable trait of any person, regardless of social institutions, class, and experience. At the same time, dignity is not only an internal concept since it is something that can be given by one person to another, such as respect or favor. This means that the concept of human dignity may not always be strictly intrinsic. Concepts about the transfer or innateness of dignity can have a significant impact on medical practice. A doctor who believes that it is they who give dignity to other people by paying attention to them runs the
risk of falling into misconceptions that distort moral representations. At the same time, a physician who professes equal human dignity and believes it is intrinsic is able to respect the patient’s autonomy. However, this, in turn, can create treatment dilemmas if patient autonomy conflicts with the specialist’s professionalism. In any case, a medical worker who professes human dignity as an inalienable value follows key principles of bioethics such as autonomy and justice more closely.By the uselessness of dignity in medical practice, McLean means that talking about criteria for dignity in bioethics only distracts from the primary immediate goal of treatment. Somerville argues in her book that when dialogue in bioethics comes to a general agreement, the term dignity seems useful and relevant. If it is impossible to agree,
I trust that people create relationships according to the interactions’ risks and rewards. A person deliberates or unconsciously assesses the risks and benefits of action and chooses the most rewarding activity. Money, love, power, or societal approbation are examples of concrete and intangible rewards and drawbacks (Cox et al., 2021). Since people base relationships on rewards, each member of society tends to demand more gains from a relationship. Individuals are never born good or evil; however, they are influenced to develop certain attributes based on particular demands. Individuals are driven to labor for fundamental necessities such as food and shelter (Cox et al., 2021). Others obtain motivation from personal, cultural, societal, or economic conditions.In this regard, people are not born evil or good but motivated by biological, social,
and economic factors. Individuals with quick actions and adaptability use agility to maximize their potential. People may also maximize their potential by adopting a positive attitude toward all events and confronting problems front on (Cox et al., 2021). Contemporary issues such as alienation, poverty, and insecurities significantly influence human relationships. Society must foster equity, cooperation, and respect among cultures and social groups to obtain control and achieve stable relationships.Administrations have an obligation to guarantee economic and social security to the citizens. To guarantee financial stability, the government in socialist ideology sets preparations for equal income distribution among working people (Cox et al., 2021). Other social provisions include free education, retirement benefits, social grants, and accessible healthcare services in allocated cases, such as maternal care. Additionally, states provide and
ensure the maintenance of public goods and services such as roads and security. A state’s responsibility is to safeguard its inhabitants against internal and foreign conflicts (Cox et al., 2021). The government safeguards civilians from economic, social, and political attacks through policies and the law. I think states should cushion vulnerable groups such as women, the elderly, and youths by providing free services, employment opportunities, and incentives on particular goods and services. The government should also nurture potential talents to help generate income, particularly the youth.The current government has initiated many programs that work for the welfare of civilians countrywide. For instance, the education for all movement has benefited many people regardless of age, gender and ethnicity. Nevertheless, wealthier individuals and localities profit from the system more than
the poor and ordinary Americans. Some shortcomings include the health and safety of the average citizen. The government spends significantly on internal and external security, but many neighborhoods live in absolute fear due to violence and insecurity. I think the capitalist economic system is appropriate for the State. However, it needs reforms in the labor force regarding individuals with less competitive skills. For instance, providing alternative sources of employment to vulnerable groups such as the mentally and physically unstable. My ideal State entails equality and democracy in distributing social and economic services to have healthy and happy citizens willing to boost the economy through hard work and devotion.My views are inspired by Josephine Shaw Lowell, a social worker during the 19 th century. Lowell is famous for her
charitable activities and reform in social work. She always believed in and promoted equality while helping vulnerable groups. Despite coming from a wealthy family, Lowell saw the challenges and hardships of minority groups and dedicated her life to establishing institutions and reforms in social services. She had a realistic perspective of society where the rich and influential continue to flourish despite the lower citizens’ efforts. Her motivation came from empathy and willingness to sacrifice to improve the poor, sick and mentally disturbed lives through better education, health services, and cleaner prisons. Since government systems were not involved in most aspects of citizens’ welfare at the time, Lowell took it upon herself to make a difference. I would like to follow in the footsteps of creating a better society
through social work and state reforms in the field.Sexual orientation, gender, class, and race are significant predictors of social attitudes among populations. These factors may hinder effective community service at institutional and interpersonal levels. Individuals struggling with sexual orientation may have divergent views on social services, such as resolving social interactions (Cox et al., 2021). Race and ethnicity can also challenge fieldwork since most vulnerable groups come from minority ethnic groups and may pose challenges during communication and general interactions. When addressing serious issues affecting their communities, the groups may exhibit xenophobic sentiments and unpleasant conduct (Cox et al., 2021). Discussing personal experiences and thoughts is challenging when people have different perceptions of each other. Nevertheless, social work involves good interpersonal skills, which I possess and will apply.The
The secret of IKEA’s success on the global market lies in its perfect execution of all components of the marketing mix. The company has adapted its strategy to each market with precision, flexibility, and creativity that made its products highly recognized. The ingenuity of its marketing mix proposal can serve as an example for other companies in Europe and worldwide. In this paper, the four components of IKEA’s marketing mix will be discussed.This Swedish company has gained renown for the quality, accessibility, and innovativeness of its products. First of all, the firm’s pricing strategy is focused on affordability, as the structure and logistics of its stores are optimized for a maximum price reduction (O’Neill, 2021). Promotions of this store chain are widespread through all communication channels, ranging from
company is its products. Its home furniture is easy to recognize for its style, modularity, and reusability (O’Neill, 2021).

IKEA’s drive to provide its customers with products they desire gave it an immense competitive advantage in Europe and worldwide.
Allergic rhinitis is an intermittent or persistent inflammation of the mucous membrane of the upper respiratory tract, characterized by nasal congestion, discharge, itching, sneezing, and a combination of several symptoms is possible. In this situation, a 35-year-old patient presented with nasal congestion, eyelid edema, conjunctival erythema, allergic folds and spangles, and inflamed nostrils, which confirms her diagnosis (Seidman et al., 2015). A medical specialist identified some of the symptoms listed.The hypersensitivity reaction is the first type since allergic rhinitis is determined by it. The allergen, having entered the body for the first time, causes the appearance of specific antibodies, immunoglobulins, which are fixed on the surface of mast cells. Upon repeated contact of an already sensitized organism with an irritant, IgE-dependent activation of mast cells occurs (Hoyte &
Nelson, 2018). This process causes the release of histamine, heparin, and other inflammatory mediators responsible for the manifestation of allergic reactions. In fact, pathophysiology implies that the initial intake of the allergen causes the production of IgE by plasma cells.Three subjective conclusions from this situation are: the patient experiences constant sneezing, considers the complication of infectious diseases and describes improvement away from home in a different climate. A specialist established objective conclusions: firstly, eyelid edema and allergic sheen caused by venous edema of the lower eyelid. In other words, allergies give inflammation to the eyes. Secondly, inflamed nostrils and an allergic fold indicate a stable runny nose. Thirdly, the constancy of these signs shows the constant close presence of a source of irritation.First of all, it is necessary
to pass tests for sources of irritation, which are taken by the method of a swab from the nose. Based on the findings, pharmacological treatment with antihistamines and corticosteroid nasal sprays and decongestants is then prescribed to reduce congestion and symptoms (Hoyte & Nelson, 2018). Equally important are environmental control and nasal irrigation (Schuler IV & Montejo, 2021). Finally, as a consequence, as little contact with known allergens as possible should be ensured. In this case, the symptoms appeared around the same time as the cat appeared in the house. Since humans often show hypersensitivity to animal saliva, this option is very likely to be used as a hypothesis.Thus, the following approach is required. First of all, pharmacological treatment with intranasal antihistamines and reduction of contact with the
Neil Foley talks about the role of Mexican Americans in the history of the U.S. in Mexicans in the Making of America. The author gave his view of these events in the first chapter, “The Genesis of Mexican America,” where he presented the history of the appearance of Mexican Americans and the silent conflict between the two countries. The author’s central claim is that the American government created an image of lazy Mexican immigrants who cross the border to murder and sell illicit drugs; this stigmatization affected Mexican Americans, too (Foley 34). However, the truth was that white settlers from the southern states were illegal invaders in Texas in the 1830s because they refused to obey the country’s laws (Imery-Garcia 12). Discrimination against Mexican immigrants and citizens was
rooted in the 1846-1848 war and the treaty’s approval, which included Texas and Mexican people living there into the U.S. territory and being denied their rights.It was interesting to learn from this chapter the viewpoint of many people in the United States about Mexico as a country of cruel and uneducated people. Indeed, it points to the erased memory of the Aztec Empire, the abolition of slavery in Mexico much earlier than in the U.S., and the annexation of Texas. The 1846-1848 war between the two countries was an unfair, violent act of the U.S. government towards a weaker neighbor, which suffered economic downfall at that time (Foley 24). The new legislation after the war gave people the choice of returning to Mexico or becoming U.S. citizens with
When many people have a chance to interact simultaneously, especially in learning settings, it may easily lead to the occurrence of conflicts and arguments. The talkative or negative members undoubtedly impact the atmosphere within the team (Jacobs et al., 2016). It seems that “the show-off” might negatively influence the moods of all the members, considering that it is easy to get irritated by such a type of behavior (Jacobs et al., 2016). In addition, show-offs’ aim is to impress people around them, especially a group leader, and to do so, they usually opt for talking without a stop or boasting, which distracts other members. It is a common issue in group settings as such members desire to attract attention to themselves as they might be insecure or not
may be an obstacle for reaching a productive learning atmosphere as, eventually, people will be irritated and not have acquired any helpful knowledge during the lesson. The constant involvement of the show-offs in the educational process is likely to annoy other members so that they will develop hatred for such type of behavior (Forsyth, 2019). Furthermore, the show-offs can easily prevent the group from reaching the set aim by distracting them through their foolery and over-involvement in the whole process. Overall, such members can harm the group’s productivity and effectiveness in learning as they opt for attracting all the attention to themselves without giving other individuals opportunities to realize their potentials within the settings.
The problem of unauthorized termination of life is the source of numerous debates. On the part of religion, this problem has several flaws at once, the most important of which is the commission of a great sin before God, who gives people life. Moreover, the negative consequences of euthanasia are the devaluation of human life, violation of the equality of people before the law, medical duty, and the structure of the doctor-patient relationship. Thus, it can be concluded that the spread of the popularity of euthanasia will lead to a complete loss and restructuring of the system of human values. This paper examines the case study of George, who has fallen ill with a severe illness that will eventually completely deprive him of mobility. Because of the negative
emotions that have overtaken and the understanding that the disease is incurable, the man thinks to solve the problem by euthanasia. Hence, using literary sources, a scientific paper analyzes the problem of intentional death and religious considerations.In the modern world, despite the relatively progressive development of medicine, people are faced with diseases that, unfortunately, do not respond to any treatment. In such cases, the blow that the disease inflicts both physically and mentally can be tough to bear. Because of the fear of losing self-care and dignity, people are thinking about euthanasia or, in other words, voluntary suicide. However, this statement contradicts God’s attempts to restore the Christian religion. Thus, this scientific paper explores a thematic study about a man who has lost hope and is thinking about
euthanasia.The case study, which is the basis of this research paper, presents the reader with the story of a middle-aged man George. He leads an average lifestyle, works, spends time with his family, and devotes time to his own interests. However, one day a man begins to experience muscle weakness and immunity to muscle coordination. Subsequently, he gets injured, and when he goes to the doctor, he gets a far from satisfactory diagnosis. According to the results of further tests, George is diagnosed with such a severe and terrible disease like amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). This disease is expressed in the disruption of the nerve cells of the brain, which are responsible for the muscles and spinal cord (Westeneng et al., 2018). The most famous representative of a
person with this disease is the great scientist Stephen Hawking (Westeneng et al., 2018). Deviation leads to the complete demobilization of a person, but aspects such as smell, touch, sight, hearing, and taste remain.George was informed that ALS currently has no treatment, and its development can only be suppressed by certain drugs, but scientists have not yet found ways to stop the disease. This news can plunge into deep shock and depression and cause a lot of strong negative emotions and confusion. That is what happened to George, who was terrified of being a wheelchair user and delegating all the responsibilities of fulfilling basic needs to his family members. The idea of becoming dependent and losing control of his own body did not give the man peace of
mind, and therefore he began to think about making life easier for his relatives by resorting to such a measure as euthanasia.The problem of using euthanasia is acute in modern society. In the United States of America, this measure has been legalized in nine regions (Hoehner, 2001). The main argument held by supporters of this intentional termination of life is to get rid of prolonged agony to death thanks to the development of medical technologies (Orr, 2001). Despite this, the spread of this method of death can lead to high medical costs for the families of patients, since due to low legalization rate, euthanasia is a costly service. The opposite is the opinion of Christianity, which denies euthanasia. For this faith, the main emphasis is placed on the
fact that the near-death period is characterized by love, compassion and reconciliation, and care, which euthanasia deprives a person of.The main problem with regard to euthanasia on the part of the Christian religion is the fact of violation of the law of God. Thus, the Christian doctrine emphasizes that God gives a person life and determines when to take it away. Euthanasia implies that patients decide the date of their death themselves, which is equivalent to one of the main sins of religion – suicide. Despite the fact that euthanasia involves the introduction of a particular drug by a medical specialist and not by a patient, it is the patient who is responsible for the decision taken in this case. Sources also emphasize that “Doctors may help their
patients to die a dignified death from natural causes, but they should not kill their patients or help them to kill themselves” (Anderson, 2015, p. 1). Thus, in the eyes of religion, this action is also a sin since it can already be considered as intentional murder, that is, the decision to take someone else’s life.In addition, the scientific literature provides several main reasons not to support euthanasia. One of them is the introduction of risk for the weak and defenseless. Moreover, giving the doctor responsible for taking someone’s life can significantly negatively affect the doctor-patient relationship. In addition, it is also worth emphasizing the violation of relationships within the patient’s family and will violate such fundamental concepts as human dignity and equality before the law (Anderson, 2015).
Supporting the Christian point of view, people should not help others to kill themselves but provide the necessary level of care and support to soften and bring calm into the life of the patient.On the one hand, in the light of the Christian narrative, George’s sufferings can be interpreted, as already mentioned, with an emphasis on the sinfulness of the world. This is due to the fact that euthanasia is considered suicide and cannot be justified by religion. On the other hand, the fear of future loss of control over their lives and loss of dignity significantly affect the patient. When considering the emphasis on the hope of resurrection, then the experiences of a man can be interpreted as a desire for a speedy meeting with the almighty.
Therefore, George may feel the unwillingness to be in this world as a burden for his family, and in some ways, the motivation of a man can be understood.The Christian worldview highlights human life as the most critical value. When turning to religion, a person becomes fully aware of how sinful thoughts about taking his own life are because this is the prerogative of God. Thus, George’s view of the problem of living with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis may be changed. To facilitate the patient’s thoughts, shifting his thoughts in a more positive direction is necessary. Hence, it is necessary to show how important he is to his family and how priceless the moments spent with them will be until his death.Further, based on the above, the Christian faith
The airline industry has been hit particularly hard by Covid 19. The virus outbreak has caused the governments of most countries to implement restrictions on traveling (Impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on Aviation, 2022). Thus, the regulatory implementations have negatively affected the standard revenue, business practices, and practices of airline companies. First, passengers were less keen to travel due to the testing regulations, limited resources, and the lack of need to travel for work. Another cause was the regulation themselves that implied a reduction in Covid-19 cases through quarantine measures. The low demand has caused the airlines to lose revenue ($372 bn), which was an unprecedented change in the industry (Economic impacts of covid-19 on Civil Aviation, 2021).Flights were being canceled, and employees were laid off due to
The offered case study revolves around the change process within the Norwegian hospital X. The central idea was to go paperless and shift towards using the most innovative ways to work with patients, including electronic patient records (EPR) and electronic care plans (ECP). The proposed reconsideration was associated with numerous challenges linked to the nature of new technology and staff experiences and skills. For instance, nurses training to acquire knowledge of how to use new approaches was complicated by the lack of time and the absence of experience. Also, nursing assistants were unfamiliar with paperwork and documents, which was an additional limitation. However, it is possible to admit the positive nature of the outlined change and its possibility to promote positive outcomes. Several reasons from the case can
help to prove this statement.First of all, the change can be analyzed using Lewin’s model, implying three major phases. These are unfreezing, change, and refreezing typical for all processes. Thus, Norwegian hospital management followed the model, which served as the basis for positive outcomes. Preliminary meetings with the staff and discussions helped to clarify existing expectations and fears. During this phase, the top management and health workers created a shared vision and agreed to engage in the change process, although there were some factors that could be viewed as barriers to attaining success. Moreover, the benefits of integrating the EPR and ECP were outlined, contributing to the growing interest and motivation to participate in the process. It means that the successful unfreezing phase was one of the success
factors influencing the change process in the selected hospital.Another positive aspect of change was the staff’s engagement and readiness to overcome difficulties. Thus, the integration of new technologies was viewed as something inevitable, which helped to establish a positive attitude toward the scope of change. Additionally, regardless of some problems discovered during the reconsideration of the unit’s work, the staff remained optimistic about outcomes and the possibility of achieving the current goals. It means that the organizational culture, values, and philosophy were considered and employed to create the basis for change and support it. At the same time, the case shows that project members and workers supported each other during the most critical moments and were ready to do extra work to ensure the change continues and there
This fact might be surprising, however, the survey conducted by the Pew Research Centre (2021) reveals that from 2015 onwards the number of people using cell phones is gradually increasing. More precisely, in 2015 cell phones were used by 95 percent of respondents and in 2021 this number increased by 2 percent (Pew Research Centre, 2021). Undoubtedly, the growth is not drastic, but still, it exists. What is even more curious, only 85 percent of respondents use smartphones (Pew Research Centre, 2021). Therefore, it is a mistake to assume that cell phones are leftovers from a long time ago. Instead, people still need them, and the company is capable of presenting a cellphone of good quality and reasonable price.Cell phones are commonly used in companies as a means
of communication between employees. The problem is that since the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020, many organizations transfer a significant share of employees to remote work. People who work from home are more likely to use personal smartphones and messengers to communicate with colleagues. From another point of view, the situation is gradually going back to normal and the shift of employees to remote work could be considered a temporary threat to our idea.To make the product more competitive, it is necessary to focus on its technical characteristics. Since 2019, American companies have widely introduced 5G smartphones (Gallagher & DeVine, 2019). 5G devices transmit signals 10 times faster in comparison with 4G ones. Therefore, it is necessary to incorporate this 5G technology into our new cellphone.To
check whether there will be demand for our newly developed cell phones, we should survey potential consumers. The questionnaire will contain characteristics of the companys and competitors cell phones. The respondents are required to choose between the proposed options.The company targets both organizations and individual consumers. One of the most effective ways to reach this audience is to employ paid advertising in media (Silva et al., 2020). This method would help to increase the traffic on MMs website and, hence, promote the cellphone. One example of paid advertising is advertisings on websites and in search engines. As for social media, the company should prefer putting ads on Facebook and Twitter, because Instagram and YouTube are less popular among the target audience who are working adults and business owners.One
An article published in Ahram Online provides information about the controversial statements of TV host Ibrahim Eissa regarding the journey of Al-Miraj. El-Sayed Gamal El-Din, the author of the article, first provides a brief overview of the event, followed by reactions from the officials and community, as well as background on past news related to Eissa. Additionally, the article provides information about the upcoming prosecution concerning the statements of the TV host.First of all, it is necessary to evaluate the article in terms of codes of ethics considering ethical news values. In terms of accuracy, the material presents facts, and the author does not present his personal opinion on the issue, which makes the article the most devoid of bias. Most importantly, El-Sayed quotes statements from the TV
host and various stakeholders without commentary, which eliminates subjectivity. In terms of confirmation and tenacity, the reporter gives not only statements but also opinions of the community, presents the prospect of prosecution, and also gives background information about Eissa. These factors allow the reader to compose a more comprehensive perception of the event beyond the immediate news.The author also respects diversity, citing the opinions of both official bodies and religious communities for whom this event is important. In terms of dignity and reciprocity, The reporter uses non-emotionally colored vocabulary, which corresponds to the journalistic style. Additionally, El-Sayed tries to provide as much information as possible about the event and the reaction that it caused in the community. This factor also corresponds to the value of community, as it
reveals the possible impact of Eissa’s statements on society.However, concerning equity, the article does not seem complete enough, as it focuses more on the reaction to this event. Within the framework of the information provided, it is not entirely clear whether there are supporters of the statements of the TV host or whether the community as a whole reacted negatively to his statements. Accordingly, in this regard, the value of sufficiency is also inadequately addressed since not all information resources are covered.Based on the analysis of codes of ethics, one can also conclude the objectivity and credibility of this material. Objectivity prescribes that all parties affected by the event have an equal right to be covered in the article. However, within the framework of the article by El-Sayed,
not enough attention is paid to the opinion of Eissa himself, as well as his possible supporters. This factor can make the article biased, and additional information about the past actions of the TV host can create a negative perception of the protagonist of the story among readers. In terms of credibility, the article meets the requirements of journalistic standards, as it provides information resources and quotes, and does not refer to abstract assumptions.A coherent theory of truth can be applied to this news report as the information presented in it is consistent with other beliefs. El-Sayed celebrates the opinions of the religious community, revealing the common opinion on the event, which makes it acceptable within society. It is necessary to keep in mind that the covered event
in the article refers to religious beliefs that are extremely significant for the major part of Egyptian society. This material, therefore, can be considered from the point of view of utilitarianism, which involves reporting events with the goal of the least harm to the largest population. In this situation, the lack of information from possible supporters of the TV host may be a desire to satisfy the interests of the majority of society and not offend their feelings.An article published in the BBC reports that those accused of killing a Black man in Georgia were found guilty of hate crimes. Bailey says the three men who killed 25-year-old Ahmaud Arbery because of his race were convicted of the crime. The author gives an overview of the situation, provides
the opinion of both lawyers and prosecutors, and also talks about the significance of the event for the family of the victim.Within the framework of codes of ethics and adherence to ethical news values, this material meets higher requirements than an article in a local publication. First of all, the facts presented are objective and provide complete information about the situation, including the identity and age of the participants, their motives, and the events of the trial. Additionally, the author of the article mentions persons who declined to comment, which corresponds to the principles of accuracy, confirmation, as well as sufficiency. The inclusion of several parties in the report also meets the principles of equity. Even though the story received a wide public outcry and a negative reaction,
the author does not forget to cite the opinion and lawyers of the accused to reveal the full picture.However, the most important aspects that make this article more ethically valuable are the additional involvement of the victim’s family and the presentation of their opinions. The reporter notes that she “spent weeks reporting from Georgia on the killing of Ahmaud Arbery and it’s hard to overstate the importance of this guilty verdict for his family” (Bailey). The following is the value of this judgment to the family and community, which adds to the history of tenacity, and respects the values ​​of dignity and reciprocity. Additionally, the reporter notes the value of his work for society and individuals. It is also important that the article is devoted to the murder
The researchers base their conclusion on three well-designed case studies touching on various software applications. The case studies include evaluating bone fractures following traffic accidents, bone injuries caused by a spade, and gunshot wounds on the head, which offer valuable data on enhancing contemporary forensic investigations (Buck et al., 2008). The modeling software and haptic device used for the study boast high precision, low friction, superior fidelity, and output capacity of six degrees of freedom. In the present world, these are top-notch specifications for such discourses. However, replicating the study to verify the findings may prove a challenge due to the high cost of assembling all the specimens and equipment utilized therein (Pinzon et al., 2016).The researchers do well to draw their interpretations and conclusions from the gathered
virtual excursions. Thus, the user can handle and feel 3D digital information, which is significant innovation and improves current technologies. According to Joukal et al. (2015), there may arise controversies surrounding the use of haptics due to fears of corrupting operating systems and online hacking to manipulate investigation findings. Such possibilities may impact the reliability of such devices in criminal justice proceedings. In terms of ethics, the machines make investigations much more expensive to conduct due to costly equipment and training for personnel involved (Fahrni et al., 2019). The costs may hinder the quest for justice in some cases, primarily in low-income areas. Nevertheless, the innovation is evident, and the researchers do well to draw solid conclusions based on their three well-designed case studies.
Imbalances and ExcessesWaterThe amount of food taken was recommendable on the first day, but the nutrients were not well distributed among the types of foods chosen. According to the principles of water should be taken regularly at least eight glasses a day. Water helps flush out harmful substances in the body, keep our bodies hydrated, and help us lose weight (Knight 1). Water is also vital because it aids during digestion and forms part of all the body fluids. Not even a glass of water was included among all the diets chosen for the three days.ProteinsThe foods containing proteins consumed on the first day are well distributed even though they have high calories. The foods containing proteins on the first day included cheeseburgers, eggs, and yogurt. The sources
on the second day, milk and chicken breasts, are also sources of proteins, but they also contain calories. The source of proteins on the third day has the highest amount of calories which is dangerous. Proteins are vital in the diet in that they are the construction blocks of a lifetime; each cell in the human body comprises protein. The basic arrangement of protein is a hindrance of amino acids. One needs protein to help their bodies heal cells and produce new ones.Sources of proteins should not contain large amounts of calories as they are harmful to health. Human bodies store up excess fats when we eat more calories than we use up. If this behavior becomes, frequent one may put on more weight. Adding weight may lead
to obesity, which is a source of other health conditions that are harmful to the body. Calories in excess are unhealthy, so the daily diet should contain minimal calories or do more physical exercises so they are broken. Principles of nutrition suggest that to uphold a steady weight, the vigor that is put into people’s bodies must be the same as the one utilized during physical roles and bodily activity (Villegas 30). There are also minimal foods eaten over the two days that are sources of proteins like chicken and yogurt.PotassiumPotassium is a mineral required by all of the body’s cells. Since it contains a modest electric charge that activates frequent cell and neuron actions, it is also known as an alkali. Potassium is an organic mineral that
might be present in several meals and taken as a supplement. Its principal objective in the blood is to contribute to maintaining steady fluid balance in our cells. Sodium keeps fluid heights stable outside of cells. Potassium also helps in muscular contraction and supports regular heart rates.Vitamins A and EVitamins are minimal in the diet because their primary sources are fruits and vegetables, which are minimally included in the diet. Another low-supplied mineral in the three da diet is minimal. Vitamins are essential because they are preventive foods. They prevent our bodies from disease b increasing the immune system. Fruits should be included in the diet eaten fifteen minutes before the meal. Taking them before eating ensures that the appetite is boosted.IronThe only meal in the diet that
supplies iron is the cereals taken on the second day. Iron is essential for the formation of blood. About 70% of the cell’s Iron is contained in blood, including in blood cells and deoxygenated blood, found in cardiac tissues. Red blood cells are required to deliver oxygen and nutrients to the muscles in your blood. Myoglobin receives, stores, transports, and releases muscle fibers into the atmosphere. About 6% of the body’s Iron is found in proteins required for breathing and carbohydrate metabolism, as well as enzymes associated with the manufacture of keratin and transmitters. Iron is also necessary for healthy immunological activity. All the foods containing calories are energy sources, so energy-giving foods were well supplied throughout the three days.CaloriesCalories were supplied in excess, and it is advised
that the individual increase daily physical activities to ensure that they are used up. All the junk foods contain a high amount of calories. Calories are essential for the body because they are the primary sources of energy, but they should be taken in controlled amounts. Thus, to conduct the basic operations of life, the person’s body requires calories.ZincZinc is a vital nutrient in the body, and the body does not naturally manufacture it, so supplement foods are recommended. It is a nutrient found in the body and helps the body’s immune systems and metabolic rate. Zinc is also important for remedying injuries and improving the sagacity of the palate and scent. Through diverse nutrition, the body acquires adequate zinc. Zinc can be acquired from various foods such
as chicken, red meat, fortified breakfast, and cereals.Proper Diet RecommendationsThe nutrition principles require people to avoid canned foods because they are not suitable for their health. Packaged meals are highly damaging to your health since they include a variety of dangerous components. People may want to fill their bodies with delicious healthy grains and fresh foods while avoiding empty carbohydrates and hydrogenated oils. Consume 100 percent whole grains meals such as whole wheat tortillas, whole grain bread, and brown rice to provide the system with more consistent energy.Breakfast is the essential dish of each day, so it is mandatory to have it! Taking the mornings to eat a well-balanced meal will be extremely helpful to your health. A well-balanced breakfast increases your metabolism and gets your day started
on the right foot. A poached egg, a cup of milk, whole wheat bread, fresh produce, and a cup of coffee are all excellent options. One feels full and energized the entire morning, and you will not go for harmful snacks like crackers.The principles of nutrition will be used in panning for the other meal. A good breakfast should contain the following whole grains, such as waffles or cold grain whole cereals—lean proteins that include eggs, lean meat, legumes, and groundnuts. Fruits should also be included in the morning meals. Cereal is an intelligent option since studies show that people that eat cereal for breakfast ingest fewer carbohydrates are much less likely to become obese than those who eat other breakfast meals. Cereals, on the other hand, are
not all evenly distributed. The rest of the no heavy meals are required when the breakfast is heavy. Supplementary foods rich in calcium, potassium, Iron, and vitamins should be consumed.Sources of Iron comprise; liver, but it is not recommended for expectant mothers, beans like red kidney beans and chickpeas, groundnuts, dehydrated fruits like the apricots, red meat, and finally soybeans flour. Anemia, a condition characterized by low blood in the body, occurs when our diet lacks Iron. Girls who shed a large amount of blood throughout their monthly cycle (heavy menstruation) are more likely to develop anemia and may have to replenish with Iron. Calcium accounts for around 2% of the typical individual’s physique. The teeth and bones contain most of this; the remaining is kept in the
muscles or plasma. Calcium is necessary for a robust skeletal system. It is also critical to the health and operation of other physiological mechanisms, such as neurons and physical access. Dairy meals like cream, yogurt, butter, and calcium-fortified products like various tree kinds of milk (for instance, nondairy milk and rice milk) and morning cereal are sources of vitamins and minerals like calcium.Various periods of life necessitate different quantities of calcium: small children, teens, and old ladies all need more than the approximate spend. Although potassium and sodium are closely linked, their actions in physiology are opposed. Both are necessary micronutrients that are important for metabolic equilibrium and have been related to the development of serious illnesses, particularly heart disease. High sodium consumption affects the cardiovascular system, contributing
increases individual and community performance. Nutrient education is an essential component of a broader approach to boost food safety and reduce hunger. Nutrition is one of the most significant fundamental animal needs. Consequently, there is no such condition that might result in considerable health difficulties to reserve the rights of consumers. To safeguard customers and test for misuse, a range of scientific approaches have been proposed, which is vital especially for canned food consumers.
In every firm, regardless of the industry, the gathered raw data needs organization, summarization, and visualization to turn the data into useful information. Evans and William (2014) show that statistics entails the knowledge associated with data gathering, organization, examination, clarification, and presentation. From a biblical perspective, statistics entails summing up and numbering. In Numbers 1:2, the Lord commanded Moses to, “Take ye the sum of all congregation of the children of Israel, after their families, by the house of their fathers, with the number of their names, every male by their polls” ( King James Bible , 2017). The authors further point out that about Six Sigma, statistical understanding is significant since it helps comprehend possible data trends, patterns, and changes in a specific time (Evans and Williams,
2014). As a healthcare administrator, this knowledge is essential since it will assist in understanding how my organization compares its performance relative to its rivals, business units, and best-in-class benchmarks while acknowledging the association among various metrics.Descriptive statistics represents how data is numerically and visually presented and might include charts, histograms, and frequency distributions in the organization and presentation of information. Database software like Access and Microsoft Excel facilitates how data can be summarized by every employee (Evans and Williams, 2014). As a healthcare administrator, the application of descriptive statics will be essential since it helps in minimizing the overall time required for inpatient admission, treatment, and discharge from the appropriate hospital department. Furthermore, under my administration, the application of such software will allow my subordinates to quickly
access patient information on the precise admission and discharge times. That will significantly help my subordinates to control the severity of a patient’s health condition. Further, as Cox et al. (2014) show, by application of the theory of constraints, in tandem with statistical measures understanding, healthcare facilities can also provide patients with the needed care and grow their revenues. As such, under my administration, the employment of statistical measures will be critical. That will be the case since it will enable my facility to afford its patients with on-time appointments, allow for efficiency in the rooming process, and facilitate smooth handoffs.The most significant descriptive statistics and formulas are mean, median, mode, and variance. Denoted by the Greek letter µ, mean is a summary representation of the whole dataset
using a single number as the typical value (Kros and Rosenthal, 2016). Also known as the arithmetic average, the mean is also used to measure central tendency (Kros and Rosenthal, 2016). The Median represents the principal value or what is referred to as the 50th percentile (Evans and Williams, 2014). Under my administration, the median value will be the central value when half the data will be below it, and the remaining half value will be above it when the dataset will be arranged. Furthermore, in an odd number observation, my administration will show the median as the middle number of the sorted numbers. An even number observation becomes the mean of the two middle numbers (Evans and Williams, 2014). When using Excel, the median value can be
The work of a clinical or medical office worker is characterized by a combination of a large number of administrative operations with medical activities. Primarily, these professionals are office assistants filling out paperwork and interacting with staff (“How to become a medical office assistant,” 2021). As a result, I will be approaching interviews for this job in a professional business style. While the fitting suit can be expensive, I already have the proper formal attire. Using my black formal suit, shoes, and minimal accessories, I can make the right impression without reducing my budget. In warm weather, I can go to an interview right in a suit, and in cold weather, I can add my usual outerwear, for example, an overcoat.Work clothes, theoretically, may require additional investments and
purchases. All healthcare workers, including office workers, must wear a special uniform called scrubs, consisting of a short-sleeved shirt and trousers. This uniform is relatively cheap, and a single set of scrubs can be found on Amazon for about $20-$40 (“Medical assistant’s uniform,” 2019). Most of all, in this context, one needs to take care of shoes since these specialists sometimes have to stand or walk a lot. A good pair of closed-toe shoes can cost around $100, but I have tennis shoes that fit the dress code (“Medical assistant’s uniform,” 2019). However, it must be taken into account that many medical institutions issue uniforms on their own, considering them as consumables, so the choice of purchasing a uniform will depend on the rules of a particular hospital.
In less than two decades, Amazon has changed the way consumers think about online shopping. Before the launch of Prime in 2005, two-day shipping was virtually unheard of. However, nowadays, millions of people are users of this service. In the beginning, free two-day shipping was Prime’s biggest selling point. But as Amazon expanded, the promise of free two-day shipping came with a host of caveats. For example, the company does not deliver small goods, such as razors or hair ties, separately. Instead, customers must purchase $25 worth of items before Amazon ships those items. As for the clients, they are dissatisfied with such conditions. Del Valle (2019) argues that the Prime service is like a gimmick that gives shoppers a false sense of security till they go to
the checkout and see a delivery date much later than expected. In turn, this solution is beneficial for the company, as it reduces the cost of delivery.To understand its motives, it’s important to descry Amazon’s warehousing. With the spread of the pandemic, consumers have become more likely to use online shopping. Waddell and Singh (2021) note that between 2015 and 2019, Amazon opened an average of about 75 new warehouses per year, ranging from huge warehouses and fulfillment centers too much smaller delivery stations. In turn, in 2020, Amazon opened nearly 300 new properties, allowing users to shorten the waiting time for an item.In addition to the quantitative aspect, it is important to consider the qualitative one. According to Organized chaos: Behind the scenes of Amazon’s inventory management
system, Amazon has created a well-thought-out warehouse ecosystem that also helps speed up delivery. Thus, goods received at the warehouse are placed not by category, as is customary in most systems, but by the availability of free space. For example, a separate tube of toothpaste can be stored next to a car battery. Bowersox (2019) notes that first, it speeds up the product placement process and the order-picking process. Secondly, such storage allows a rational use of space in the warehouse. Moreover, robotics is used in warehouses, which also speeds up the process.Consumer Reports conducted an investigation into Amazon’s warehousing, from which the following conclusions can be drawn. According to Waddell and Singh (2021), first, Amazon opens most of its warehouses in areas with relatively large populations of
vans, more dangerous streets for children, and other quality-of-life issues such as traffic congestion and almost constant noise. Amazon is capitalizing on a national legacy of racist policies that have divided cities across the country for generations and have disproportionately impacted the health and environment of communities of color. Thus, the huge warehouses that are popping up in many communities exacerbate existing problems, from noise to localized air pollution.
The years between 1901 and 2000 provide enough evidence of the Surrealists’ artwork. The contradicting conditions between dreaming and reality are the rationale behind the introduction of surrealism. According to Anirudh (2017), the surrealism movement involved literature and visual arts that made headlines between World War I and two. Surrealists initiated a philosophical and artistic movement that examined the workings of the mind throughout the 20th century. Artists hoped to change people’s lives by striking a balance between a rational understanding of life and one that recognized the unconscious and the power of dreams. To physically show their imaginations, many surrealists now use automatic drawing or writing. In the past, artists used mysticism, ancient cultures, and indigenous art knowledge to connect with their minds. This essay will discuss
surrealism, the agenda behind Surrealists’ movements, and how cultures and dreams can be interpreted through artwork.The agenda with Surrealists was to promote mind emancipation as well as artistic expression liberation. Artists intended to show that what a person thinks or what is in the mind can be pulled out through art. Different types of art such as bizarre have been remarkably successful in promoting artwork by trying to express different mind states. Surrealists attempted to tap into the unconscious mindset to reflect the creative potential. Experts who despised rationalism and literary realism and were heavily influenced by psychoanalysis believed that the rational mind stifled the power of the imagination by imposing taboos. The Surrealists’ desire to tap into the unconscious mind, as well as their interests in myth
and primitivism, influenced many subsequent surrealism movement groups and styles existing today.The timing of Surrealists’ artwork was efficient because it related to what was happening throughout the century. Max Ernst (1923) used an imbalanced armor figure to show how authority could be overthrown anytime. Ernst’s art was timely because the government at that time was fighting colonization and independence, therefore exposed to security instability. The Persistence of Memory art by Salvador Dali (1931) reveals the soft and hard sides of life. At the time of publishing, Dali showed the need to assess and utilize time wisely as things could rapidly turn around. Surrealism is important today because it allows individuals to do things they haven’t been able to achieve since its inception (Omerovic, 2021). Surrealism was a literary,
unexpected and the uncanny, the rejected and the unconventional mindsets. Surrealism activists aimed to capture the unconscious state of mind to reflect in paintings. Artists who were influenced by psychoanalysis and detested rationality and literary realism believed that the logical mind limited the power of the imagination by establishing cultural taboos. Surrealism has been one of the most influential and subversive movements of the twentieth century, flourishing in the 1920s and 1930s, while offering room for improvements. Surrealism aimed to gain access to the subconscious mind and convert the stream of thought into art. The art industry has a variety of specializations in which artists chose and major professions, surrealism is one among the specializations.
Lady MaryLady Mary Wroth was a member of a distinguished literary family during the Renaissance. She was the niece of Mary Herbert, an eminent writer and patron during the 16th century. Mary married Robert Roth, but their marriage was unhappy. In the meantime, Lady Mary began to vent her grief with the help of poetry. Thus, her sonnet In this strange labyrinth represents the author’s throwing about the mysteries that love keeps. The significance of Lady Mary for literature is that she was the first female poet in England to write a complete sequence of sonnets called from Pamphilia to Amphilanthus.“In this strange Labyrinth how shall I turn/Ways are on all sides”The image of one who is lost in the labyrinth of love and is desperately looking for
a way out is common in the sonnets of the Renaissance. In many gardens at this time there were labyrinths that played the role of an entertainment event. Thus, the very name of the sonnet personifies the labyrinth in which every lover rushes about. The lyrical hero describes the difficult situation in which he found himself with the help of the words “In this strange Labyrinth how shall I turn/Ways are on all sides” (Wroth). Different paths diverge in all directions, but none of them seems right.The origins of the labyrinth referred to in the poem find their origin in the myth of Theseus. The hero was saved by a woman named Ariadne, who gave him a golden thread so that Theseus could find a way out of
the labyrinth of the Minotaur.“Leave all, and take the thread of Love”However, Lady Mary in the sonnet uses a labyrinth to create a metaphor for suffocation, which crushes her own desires, forcing a woman to be silent and do housework during the Renaissance. The symbol of modern conventions of that era are destroying her and do not allow her to live a full life.The heroine does not have the right to tell Amphilanthus about her love, however, she is unable to avoid her feelings and vows to ‘leave all, and take the thread of Love’ (Wroth). This thread symbolizes divine love for Christ. It allows her to find the only way back, but the thread is too thin and the heroine can easily go astray. Thus, the labyrinth
SummaryKnee injuries are very common, especially in sports medicine, and can have severe consequences for the patient, limiting their movements and impeding daily routines. There are four ligaments connecting the thigh and shin bones: medial collateral (MCL), lateral collateral (LCL), posterior cruciate (PCL), and anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) (National Library of Medicine (NLM)). The last one is the focus of the current study. The ACL is located in the middle of the knee joint and keeps the shin bone in its place behind the end of the thigh bone (NLM). When one overextends a knee joint, receives a hit at the side of it, or quick stops and changes direction while running or landing from a jump, the ACL can be overstretched or torn (NLM). An ACL injury
can also occur with other knee injuries, such as a torn MCL or knee cartilage-meniscus (NLM). ACL injuries most frequently occur in the middle of the ligament or when it is pulled out of the thigh bone (NLM). Thus, the ACL is an important but vulnerable part of the human body.Most patients with ACL injuries require professional medical help and surgery. When an ACL injury occurs, the gap between torn edges prevents them from healing on their own (NLM). Therefore, patients undergo ACL reconstruction (ACLR) – the replacement of the torn ligament with a graft (Fineberg et al., 2000). Grafts can be taken from the patient’s body (autografts) or a cadaver (allografts) (Johnson et al., 1992; Frank & Jackson, 1997). These grafts are commonly harvested from a patellar
tendon or a hamstring tendon (Johnson et al., 1992; Frank & Jackson, 1997). Other allografts sources include Achilles, tibialis anterior, and quadriceps tendons (Shino et al., 1986). However, a bone-patellar tendon-bone (BPTB) autograft is widely accepted as the most suitable and reliable (Kurosaka et al., 1987; Noyes et al., 1984). Despite other kinds of grafts gaining popularity, it is still the most common choice for ACLR (Lee et al., 2008). Thus, a bone-patellar tendon-bone (BPTB) autograft as a method of anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction (ACLR) was chosen as the object of study.Although BPTB grafts are widely used for ACLR, little research was conducted to identify and study all of its possible complications. According to Almazan et al. (2006), intraoperative incidents and complications during ACLR with a BPTB autograft
are quite frequent due to the procedure’s complexity. However, the researchers concluded that all of them occur due to technical errors during graft harvesting, tunnel placement, or graft fixation and are preventable (Almazan et al., 2006). Serious intra- or post-operative incidents and complications, such as a patella fracture or a late patellar tendon rupture, are very rare (Marumoto et al., 1996). Moreover, Stein et al.’s research (2002) demonstrated that even such incidents caused minimal changes in patients’ outcomes when they followed post-operative rehabilitation guidelines. As Milankov et al. (2012) noted, it did not affect their mobility, and most of the patients continued to engage in sports activities at the same or even higher level after nine months since ACLR. In brief, ACLR with a BPTB autograft is a
complex procedure with several risk factors, but intraoperative incidents are preventable and generally have short-term complications.However, some researchers registered certain long-term complications after ACLR with a BPTB autograft. They include the high incidence of anterior knee pain and kneeling pain (Feller & Webster, 2003). It affects patients’ lifestyles, limiting their mobility and the variety of available activities. The incidence of anterior kneeling pain in Saudi Arabia might be even higher than the one registered in international studies. Therefore, the aim of the study is to know and determine the incidence of anterior knee pain following anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction using bone-patellar tendon-bone grafts among the Saudi Arabia population.DiscussionAnterior knee pain is a frequent postoperative complication after ACL reconstruction with a BPTB graft. It is often combined with the
knee pain (Tsuda et al., 2001). Their study has shown a decrease in anterior knee pain rate to 17% (Tsuda et al., 2001). Some of the researchers focused on graft choice and studied its influence on the incidence of kneeling pain. Ibrahim et al. (2005) and Pinczewski et al. (2007) emphasized the higher level of anterior knee pain and other post-operative complications among patients with BPTB grafts compared to those with semitendinosus and gracilis (STG) grafts. It makes one question whether BPTB grafts are the optimal choice for ACL reconstruction or an additional risk factor for anterior knee pain and kneeling pain.
AbstractPreventative health care is founded on the premise that lifestyle choices, environmental factors, and genetic predispositions all have a role to play in the health outcomes of individuals. Therefore, the main aim of preventive care is to address these factors and prevent diseases from happening. The methods for increasing preventative care are explored and a project proposed that can be standardized across all healthcare facilities. Some of the methods have been studied and are presented in the current literature. Examples include primary care visits, clinical decision support systems, and cognitive-behavioral therapy. The applicability of each of these methods can be evaluated from a project management perspective where the recommendations involve the implementation of a single comprehensive program that incorporates all of them. Therefore, the project lifecycle approach is
used for this exercise where four stages are implemented: initiation, planning, execution, and control/monitoring.IntroductionPublic health is a major concern for many countries, as illustrated by the devastating effects of the recent coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic. Lifestyle choices, environmental factors, and genetic predispositions all have a role in the health outcomes of individuals. Therefore, there is a need to target these factors to prevent diseases. This is the essence of preventative care as practices across the world. The focus of this paper is on identifying and implementing methods of increasing preventative care measures. Principles of project management are used, including identification and definition of the project scope, highlighting the roles and responsibilities of stakeholders, and identifying critical resources needed to achieve the set goals.The implications for this research include that
it helps put into practice the ideas proposed by previous work in this area. In its relation to previous work, a critical examination of available literature reveals methods that can be applied to increase preventative care measures. The research strategy involves a systematic review of literature to gather ideas about the viable options and use these ideas to develop practice recommendations.Project StatementThe project focuses on preventative care, a subject that has been approached from multiple perspectives in literature. For instance, AHRQ,( 2018) labels preventative cases as a means of achieving health equity by eliminating the health inequalities in a country’s population. However, the basic idea is that preventative care is the best approach to a country’s health outcomes since it prevents diseases and pandemics from devastating the population.
According to Ngwewondo et al. (2020), the COVID-19 serves as a perfect case study for illustrating how preventive measures work. In their research, the authors established that most of the respondents scored high in preventative measures and positive health-seeking behaviors. While such findings highlight that preventative measured were undertaken, a large population still suffered from the symptoms of COVID-19.In other such contexts as the United Kingdom (UK), some preventative measures included the creation of an innovation hub that focuses on increasing preventative healthcare. During the pandemic, the hub was used as a vaccination center and proved effective (HHM Global, n.d.). Such innovation has led the stakeholders to contemplate the creation of similar facilities as a preparation for future pandemics. Therefore, there is a need to examine the effectiveness
of preventative measures and find a means of making them even more effective.Problem SignificanceThe significance of this project is manifested by the recent health problems facing the planet, including infections and pandemics. As mentioned earlier, these health outcomes are subject to the environment within which we live. Therefore, this endeavor serves as a blueprint to be used by the relevant stakeholders to implement better healthcare practices. The importance of preventative health measures is outlined, and the methods to increase its measures are recommended. The implications of the project include that the policymakers in the healthcare sector will adopt the proposed methods. Additionally, preventive care requires the relevant authorities to make the required investments (Health Business, 2019). Therefore, the proposed project should get all stakeholders informed on what pathways
to follow to increase preventative health measures.Literature ReviewThe current literature on preventative care has often focused on its benefits and approaches, often emphasizing that it is the best way to approach some of the major health problems facing society. According to Hostetter et al., (2020), primary care visits have been known to influence health behaviors, but links between these visits and preventive interventions remain unclear. In this case, primary care visits are perceived as a mechanism for receiving preemptive care in such forms as vaccinations, colonoscopy, and mammography. The conclusion reached is that at least one primary visit a year will increase evidence-based preventative care measures without any increase in costs. The same observations have been made by Sabety et al. (2021), who finds that primary care visits
improve the quality of care, patient outcomes, and improved delivery of preventative services. The outcomes of this form of care include lower rates of hospitalization and fewer emergency visits. As a result, the overall cost of care is also greatly reduced. Therefore, primary care visits can be considered one of the most effective methods of increasing preventative care measures.Decision support systems are considered a critical method for increasing preventative care measures and outcomes. A study by Bowen (et al., 2017) expresses that a decision support system improves the performance of preventive health quality measures where care is done elsewhere, and patient exceptions are captured. While this study focuses on performance, the bottom line is that the clinical decision systems effectively capture patient data and identify those eligible for
preventative care. Preventative visits were also found to increase after implementing the clinical decision support systems for the population used in the study. Other studies have focused on specific health problems where these systems where the findings indicate that clinical decision support systems improve recognition and management (Kharbanda et al., 2018). In their study, Kharbanda et al. (2018) found that innovative systems had the potential of pooling useful patient-specific data that could be printed and shared among different users. Additionally, the systems contained guidelines for preventative measures and approaches that could be followed by the practitioners. Therefore, decision support systems for clinicians can be an effective method for increasing preventative healthcare measures.Another method that has been covered in the literature is cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT). According to Suganuma et
al. (2018), unguided internet-based CBT has proven an effective method for preventative healthcare for mental health. However, the researchers have presented a pilot study to examine its acceptability and feasibility. The evidence from the study shows internet-guided CBT to be an ideal approach even though it has failed to gather the necessary attention. The rationale is that the use of technology in CBT should not be any different from face-to-face therapy sessions. However, the internet only changes from traditional practices in the mainstream delivery of the services. Even though mental care is the focus of this study, the findings can be generalized over other major health issues. Smartphone delivered CBD has also been investigated by Bakker et al. (2018), who finds that the use of apps to track
health issues help in increased preventive care outcomes, including anxiety, depression, and other elements of mental health. The bottom line is that CBT, either delivered traditionally or using new technologies, should be an effective tool for increasing preventive care outcomes.Primary ContentOverview of ProjectBased on the literature provided above, this project seeks to aid in the implementation of preventative care methods. The project can be labeled as a guideline for holistic preventative care, a tool that allows health professionals to select and apply the right method to specific case scenarios. From a project management perspective, the project will be implemented in four stages: initiating, planning, execution, monitoring, and monitoring/controlling.Project InitiationThe initiation phase comprises a project charter and a stakeholder register. The business case for the proposed tool is presented
in the problem statement section (Brown, 2021). The scope includes handling major health issues, including cancer, mental, diabetes, and transmittable infections. The deliverables for the project are a fully functional program with the relevant supporting technologies and a practice guide for practitioners. Funds will need to be invested in clinical decision support systems. It can be estimated that the project can be accomplished in less than a year.PlanningPlanning for the project requires the development of a project management plan. In this case, the plan is to create a comprehensive guide for practitioners, which will be accomplished in stages (Brown, 2021). First, all professionals are trained on the mechanisms of the tool, including how data is gathered and utilized. Second, a supporting IT infrastructure is implemented, for which further
training is required. Third, a pilot test for all key features is conducted. Lastly, the project is launched, and its use commences. At this stage, it is expected that any transferable data from other health records will be transferred and used accordingly.Execution PhaseThe project plan is put into action as outlined above. However, the execution phase will require the team to conduct other activities, including stakeholder management and team development (Brown, 2021). As a novel project, the healthcare facilities are required to be informed and educated in all stages of implementation to help the members acquaint themselves with the program and its functionality. Quality assurance tests are also conducted continuously, and corrective actions are taken.Control/MonitoringThis phase focuses on monitoring the progress of the entire project and correcting any
deviations from the project scope, goals, and objectives. Project management exhibits uncertainties that cannot be fully captured during the planning phase (Brown, 2021). It means that keeping a close eye on the project is the right approach to keep the project on track. All milestones have to be accomplished within the set time. Additionally, the budget constraints are to be observed, which explains why control and monitoring are critical necessities in project implementation.Industry ResponseThe healthcare industry will be positively influenced by this project in that it will find a more effective tool for pursuing the goals of preventative care. Today, scholars and practitioners agree that preventative can help reduce the costs of care and emergency visits to hospitals if proper preventative measures are implemented. The best-case example used
in this paper is the innovation hub established by John McAslan + Partners in the UK, where primary visits were also used as an opportunity to vaccinate patients (HHM Global, n.d.). However, each facility has different practices and approaches, some of which have not been evaluated in terms of their efficacy. Therefore, this project can be conceptualized as an effort to standardize preventive care practice across all healthcare facilities. The primary assumption is that all facilities and stakeholders in the industry are keen to pursue preventative care. Most importantly, the policymakers in these organizations are perceived to be willing to incorporate well-researched solutions to a real-life healthcare issue.In terms of response, it can be expected that initial skepticism will be felt until the practitioners are sure of the
The origins of slavery in the American territories and why it came to beFrom 1526 until 1776, complex pressures shaped the structure of slavery in the United States, and historians have proposed multiple ideas to explain how slave trade evolved. Slavery was strongly related to labor demand in European colonies, particularly in the Caribbean and South America’s labor-intensive sugar plantation industries of Great Britain, Spain, France, and the Dutch Republic. Slave ships transported captives from Africa to the West and indigenous peoples were enslaved in North American colonies on a smaller scale (OpenStax, 2019). However, Indian slavery effectively stopped in the late eighteenth century.How slavery was handled differently in each colonial territory of British North AmericaEnslaved people worked in various sectors, including breweries, shipyards, plantations, and timber yards.
The issue of tribal sovereignty has been scrutinized over the years, the treatment of tribes ranging from supportive measures and attempts of integration into the broader community to outright persecution. In this connection, the law about tribal gaming can be seen as a positive step towards recognition of tribes’ unique way of life and self-determination. This essay discusses the question “how tribal gaming act can add to the sovereignty of tribes?”Under the Indian Gaming Regulatory Act, tribes were given the right to determine what gaming activities they wanted to engage in, and in most cases, the permission was granted by the state. Gaming activities could embrace tribal rituals or games of chance, depending on the wishes of the tribes and had to be agreed to by the state
Individual freedoms and national security are sometimes seen as two opposites. However, in ideal, national security should reflect the balanced relationship between the two mentioned concepts. Moreover, the principle of the prevalence of individual freedoms over the national security underlies the democratic idea. Individual freedoms include individual rights and are protected by the US Constitution (Longley). This paper argues that individual freedoms should never be sacrificed in the name of national security.This essay proposes that the protection of individual freedoms by maintaining national security is a fundamental principle and goal of democracy. US President Joe Biden notes, “I strongly believe that democracy is the key to freedom, prosperity, peace, and dignity” (Biden 3). Unlike authoritarian or totalitarian systems, a democratic system puts individual freedoms ahead of national security
idea of the nation. Every citizen is part of the nation and their freedoms should be sacred.Thus, it was discussed, how individual freedoms should never be sacrificed in the name of national security. The necessity to sacrifice individual freedoms is usually promoted by authoritarian regimes whose real purpose is to meet the interests of the regime. On the contrary, in democratic states, individual freedoms are fundamental and cannot be violated under any circumstances. These freedoms are sacred and ensure the integrity of the democratic states.
Infertility is one of the most common problems these days, and it means that a person does not have a chance to get pregnant for several health issues. Many couples in the United States may face this problem, and the causes can vary from congenital diseases to acquired physical or psychological trauma. This body condition does not always affect only females but also males can suffer from this issue. Genetics has a strong influence on infertility, and it may be connected to people of all ages and nationalities. Around 18% of women in the United States between the age of 21 and 52 stated that they had faced infertility in their lives (Mancuso et al., 2020). I believe that environment plays a significant role in this issue. People
should be more cautious about their health to predict health problems that may cause the inability to become pregnant or impregnate a partner.The causes of infertility are diverse and might not be seen by non-professionals. For instance, age plays a significant role as the older males and females are, the more chances of receiving infertility. Moreover, hormones play an important role in pregnancy, and when any type of disbalance appears in the human body, problems with pregnancy might arise. Obesity or anorexia can also indicate infertility as the human body spends crucial resources on other areas to support life without giving a chance for women to become pregnant. Some physiological problems like anomalies of the uterus or ovaries may also become the main cause of the issue.The percentage
of male infertility is not high compared to the opposite gender. Nevertheless, 7% of men suffer from this problem, and the causes of these cases are different (Krausz et al., 2022). Around 20% of those males who cannot impregnate their couples are suffering from genetic factors that were transferred throughout generations. When males check their health conditions and diagnose infertility at early stages, they have a chance to overcome this problem and protect the ability to procreate. Low sperm production may also happen due to psychological factors like depression or any type of disorder.The percentage of females suffering from infertility is higher, and it is usually related to diseases that cannot be treated. When women become diagnosed with several health issues which do not allow them from becoming
person a chance to continue becoming pregnant or impregnate their partner. However, sometimes it is possible to solve the problem by using medicines, surgical procedures, and In vitro fertilization (Repping, 2019). Moreover, a psychotherapist can help deal with psychological problems that are barriers to conceiving a child. Every case is unique, and only doctors can decide if any treatment would be useful or not.
The healthcare system is currently under significant strain due to the COVID 19 pandemic. The problems of supply and staff shortages in healthcare have existed before but have now worsened. In particular, the issue of shortage of medical supplies is noticeable in the outpatient surgical setting where I work. This problem is directly related to the existing principles of building supply chains in healthcare, which should be subject to change. In this situation, John’s Kotter steps in leading change can become a framework for bringing positive results.The main advantage of this theory is the holistic approach to making changes. Most importantly, Kotter’s theory includes eight steps that are based on the formation and communication of a vision of the need for change (Beauvais & Spahn, 2018). Additionally, this
theory is most useful, as it allows innovation to be introduced at a structural rather than purely organizational level. With regard to the described problem, this aspect is the most significant. Eight steps suggested by Kotter that could help in the successful implementation of changes are described below. 1. The first step is to create a sense of urgency for change. Kotter notes that it takes about 75% of supporters to successfully create a sense of urgency (Beauvais & Spahn, 2018, p. 255). This can be achieved through discussions with other nurses and providing information on how the shortage of supplies negatively affects the quality of care and patient outcomes. 2. Successful implementation of change requires building a coalition through the practice of effective leadership. On the issue,
you need to work with representatives of other healthcare units and organizations to acquire more supporters. At this stage, it is important to find influential associates who could make the problem public. 3. At this stage, it is necessary to create a vision and a strategy corresponding to it. In particular, it is important to provide people not only with evidence of the existence of the problem and its consequences but also to indicate the overall goal of changes. Additionally, it is necessary to articulate how changes in supply chains, as well as a focus on planning and forecasting, can make a significant difference. 4. After that, it is important to communicate the vision, for which it is necessary to use every opportunity. Structural changes are needed in
ElementsDiamonds by Rihanna was first heard on Elvis Duran Show on September 26, 2012, availed for online download an hour after being released to the public, and was released as the album’s lead single the following day. Sia wrote the song for Rihanna, who holds the song’s copyrights and worked on it a year prior; therefore, the song is owned by an independent contractor (Anggraini 12). Unapologetic is Barbadian artist Rihanna’s seventh studio album, and the song “Diamonds” appears on it (Anggraini 7). Using Sia’s demo vocals as a guide, Rihanna imitated her inflections to the precise tiniest detail. It was only after Benny Blanco heard the finished track to the Australian songwriter did, she realize the vocals belonged to her alone.InspirationIn Diamonds , Rihanna contemplated the existence
Amazon has grown to become one of the most important companies in the US. Millions of people rely on the highly efficient deliveries and cheap prices. Moreover, the company has turned into one of the largest employees, as numerous Amazon fulfillment centers are scattered across the country. With such scale, a wide range of issues inevitably arise. Recently the multiple complaints concerning the way Amazon treats it workers have managed to draw public attention. Therefore, a dedicate analysis is need in order to understand what kind of working conditions and atmosphere the IT giant provides.Key Problems: Job Dissatisfaction and High Turnover RatesGuaranteeing $15 an hour may be a nice incentive for people in poor neighborhoods, but only in the short run.

IntroductionEvaluation information is one of the main factors in decision-making in various spheres of public life. The data containing results of evaluation procedures gives a specific characteristic of the advantages and disadvantages of various processes, working performance of employees, the effectiveness of production, and more. Therefore, the requirements for the evaluation methods are high as they should be reliable to serve as the basis for introducing changes, revealing weaknesses, and constructing new strategies for the development of different life spheres. Although evaluation information may be subjective or non-representative, it is an essential source of concentrated facts, which is crucial for people of different professions to make quick decisions when it is necessary.Evaluation Process from the Integrated Theory of Influence PerspectiveEvaluation as human activity has several factors that influence
it and have affected its forming in the past. Firstly, it is a language used for evaluation, which affects the perception of all the judgments and interpretations and thus predetermines the effect of such evaluation (Kirkhart, 2000). Concerning the unique elements of the language that allow evaluators to express their opinion in a certain way, suspending goals regarding people’s opinion on the information, they can even be invisible (Hopson, 2000). Therefore, the process of evaluation itself can be affected negatively by the evaluators who use it unfairly.Concerning the development of the evaluation as a process that triggers essential consequences, the main point in its evolution is the following. An integrated theory of influence was designed to create a new framework for evaluation processes and make them more profound
(Kirkhart, 2000). The theory regards three aspects – “source of influence, intention, and time frame” (Kirkhart, 2000, p. 8). An integrated theory of influence considers both the process of evaluating its repercussions or using the evaluation information.Evaluation information is helpful in numerous situations as assessment of any kind always leads to consequences such as making decisions and triggering changes. Concerning the theory of influence, this type of information has a wide range of implementation opportunities. Kirkhart (2000) mentions two types of influence of the evaluation information on all the connected spheres – process-based and results-based. Hence, although the interpretation of evaluation results is a separate process, evaluation information determines the directions of future development of both the processes (operational performance) and goals (strategic performance).Moreover, evaluation information can affect
different processes through another aspect related to it – intention. This means that the intentions of the primary evaluation process are not less important than the process itself because they partly reflect the purposes of the evaluator (Hopson, 2000). In other words, the evaluation intentionally depends on the purposes of the person who performs it (Kirkhart, 2000). Thus, stakeholders of the evaluation process may affect its result by placing the particular request.On the other hand, the influence of the intention of the evaluation process is not limited by the case described above. According to Kirkhart (2000), the intention of affecting the processes connected to the object of evaluation may be unintended. More specifically, this kind of influence is even more influential and may cause more powerful and profound
changes than the intended evaluation. Therefore, stakeholders of the evaluation process may be affected in a completely unexpected way, meaning that evaluation is a phenomenon that evaluators cannot fully control although they initiate it.Additionally, the influence of evaluation may differ depending on the time. To be more exact, evaluation consequences may vary in a short-term and long-term perspective and diverge drastically (Kirkhart, 2000). However, this fact only highlights the significance of evaluation information and its functionality for the party that uses it. Hence, management of the business, members of state structures, and ordinary people may experience the effect of the assessment in a wide range of ways, unexpectedly, at any time, because it cannot be controlled.The usefulness of evaluation is best expressed by the fact that it is
widely utilized by the business. Pinch (2009) claims it is hard to think of an organization that does not use evaluation. However, regarding business, evaluation processes often become overused, making evaluation information not a valuable tool of performance assessment but a negatively perceived obligatory routine (Pinch, 2009). At the same time, if the evaluation takes place regularly and the gathered information is systematized, the evaluation turns into research that can be helpful for business or any other interested party (Pinch, 2009). Hence, the factor is substantial for the effectiveness of the evaluation procedure and its positive impact on the assessed unit because it reflects the level of devotion of people to their sphere of activity. Moreover, the higher is the level of professionality of the person who interprets
the evaluation data, and the better are the perspectives of the assessed object. In other words, people affect the evaluation outcomes more powerfully than they assume in both positive and negative ways.Evaluation is an essential instrument in research and drawing conclusions. Therefore the evaluation of informational research systems may have broader consequences than commonly thought, as we live in the era of information (Saracevic, 1995). Due to the inability of some systems to ensure their safety and reliability, the evaluation immediately showed its importance for the early information research systems (Saracevic, 1995). Then, under the influence of evaluation information, the information research systems were developed to better suit the users’ needs (Saracevic, 1995). Moreover, the standards regarding the level of reliability of particular sources of information and their
relevance have been developed due to the increase of the information flow (‘Information literacy ~ IEM’ , 2021). Nowadays, IR systems have proved their functionality and tremendous capacity to help researchers find the necessary information – and this has happened because the evaluation processes were appropriately used, aiming at positive changes.The variety of opportunities to implement evaluation to reach particular goals is almost unlimited because every human-related process can be standardized and classified. For example, evaluation can be used in higher education to calculate and compare the effectiveness of different types of testing of the students’ knowledge (Jonson et al., 2014). Despite the sphere of use, evaluation has experienced drastic changes during its development and has been reconceptualized and challenged to better understand its effects (Cummings, 2002). Thus,
evaluation process. The number of opportunities to affect the object of evaluation, employees of the company, citizens of the state, or any other group, subject, or process intentionally or unintentionally reveals the functionality of the evaluation process. Therefore, evaluation information can be helpful in many business cases for developing solutions to problems at the governmental level or just assessing the students’ level of competence in a subject.
IntroductionIntel Corporation (Intel) is a semiconductor computer circuits manufacturer based in the United States. Intel, also known as “Integrated electronics,”- the company’s name, is headquartered in Santa Clara, California. The company operates through segments such as The Internet of Things Group (IOTG) and Mobileye (Hall, 2021). It sells platform goods, including chipsets and the central processor units and system-on-a-chip and multichip packages. In addition, the company offers high-performance computing solutions for embedded and vertical applications in the retail, industrial, and healthcare markets, as well as solutions for assisted and autonomous driving that include computer vision. It also provides platforms that optimized workload and related solutions to cloud service providers, business and government customers, and communications service providers. Cloud services providers, original design, and equipment manufacturers are all served
by the firm. Intel Corporation has formed a strategic agreement to utilize and develop artificial intelligence approaches for improving drug discovery. The paper describes the Supply Chain ESG as how Intel corporation creates a positive impact on the global environment.Intel Code of Conduct (COC)The Code of Conduct establishes the company’s standards for how it coordinates its activities to create and deliver products, protects the value of Intel and its subsidiaries, and interacts with customers, suppliers, and distributors. When performing Intel-related business, it is the obligation of every individual at Intel to follow the code, the employment guidelines, and other applicable regulations. The company does business with unwavering ethical standards and honesty, treating distributors, suppliers, customers, fairness, respect, and honesty in all business interactions.Intel and its subsidiaries require all
employees to comply fully with internal investigations, comprising the provision of truthful information, except where the act would result in disclosing the participation of the in concerted activity under the National Labor Relations Act of the United States. Staff who fail to do so may face disciplinary action, comprising termination, depending on the applicable local legislation (Hall, 2021). Employee involvement in inquiries into suspected violations of the United States National Labor Relations Act is voluntary, albeit encouraged.Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR)Intel’s dedication to sustainability leadership and corporate responsibility is firmly ingrained in the company’s culture. The company does not create an encompassing and positive work environment where every staff feels like they have a sense of belonging and a voice. Still, it is also proactive in its initiatives to
minimize its environmental impact by using natural materials and resources efficiently and responsibly. The company also wants to use its leading position in the global digital ecosystem to assist the industry and company in achieving more progress in corporate responsibility, including governance, social impact, and environmental sustainability. Intel’s 2030 “RISE” strategy aims to utilize the company’s leading position in the global technology ecosystem to build a more inclusive, sustainable, and responsible society, powered by technology and employees’ skills and enthusiasm (Ganusov, Iyer, Cheng, & Meisler, 2020). It aims to double the number of females and the minority groups underrepresented in higher employment ranks over the following decade.Supply chain responsibilityEffectively controlling and enhancing performance throughout the company’s supply chain lowers risks, enhances product quality, and aids the staff in
meeting the social and environmental objectives of the company. This adds value to the business and its consumers. Intel has several rigorous initiatives to educate and educate the suppliers that support the company’s worldwide manufacturing activities to guarantee that the supply chain is accountable, respectful of human rights, and resilient.The company’s accelerating responsible standards and accountability across sectors via leadership and partnership with suppliers. Intel’s worldwide strategy of supply chain aims to establish a responsible, robust, and varied supply chain that allows customers to generate data-driven technological solutions, suppliers, stakeholders, consortia, and fellow travelers (Bowersox, 2019). Intel functions with approximately 9,000 tier-one suppliers in 89 states to deliver direct production materials, intellectual property, manufacturing equipment, machinery, delivery, and travel services, packing services, office supplies, and software (Ganusov et
al., 2020). Other companies produce, assemble, and test some of the corporation’s products and components.Environmental SustainabilityIntel has developed technology critical to tackling the world’s sustainability issues. The business is always looking for innovative methods to improve energy management and reduce emissions, including conservation, efficient building design, renewable energy, and other initiatives (Bowersox, 2019). The company considers key issues such as smart energy efficiency regulations, policies geared towards managing chemicals, and climate change solutions.Chemical Management PoliciesChemicals are critical to semiconductor industry innovation. Intel is dedicated to chemical management that protects its employees and the environment. The company’s chemical policy is in line with the protection of the environment, chemical safety, and technological innovation in the United States. Advances in chemistry and materials science enable Intel’s technical innovation. Intel’s manufacturing
The ten interesting events in my community are church construction, launching of radio stations, inter families football competitions, construction, and launching of health institutions, and ceremonies such as funerals and marriage. The other two important events are church baptism activities and wrestling matches among male children between 10 to 17 years. Among the six subjects, I am not familiar with inter families football competitions, but I find it to be the most exciting event.Inter families’ competition is the most interesting event in my community. Seven families combined to form a team of seven players. This competition is normally organized by the community leaders with the goal of promoting talents and also creating a better future for the young people. The competition only involves youths from the age of
18 to 30 years. One of the leaders elaborated that this program is purely for the youths who are seeking self-discovery. These competitions are held during the school holidays between December and January.Regarding this interesting and important event, I had already known a few things. I know that this competition program is sponsored by The Association for Talent Development. Again, this program creates employment for young people; three of my cousins are currently working with the American Federation of Women. Conversely, one thing I may want to know is how the pandemic affected event’s plans and challenges they have faced during the pandemic.Talent identification and employment creation make this event interesting since it helps fight joblessness among the youths. In an interview with Mr. Bowers, the chairman of
the great community event, Mr. Bowers explained that the COVID-19 pandemic policies implementation by the state interrupted the event plans. These COVID-19 pandemic policies included lockdown and curfews and social distancing. Lockdown prevented the events, financiers, and sponsors from attending football training, while curfew reduced football training hours. On the other hand, social distance did not allow the full football teams to practice, thus reducing the effectiveness of those teams. Apart from financial challenges, Mr. Bowers also mentioned that they lack spacious fields to accommodate all players concerning the social distancing COVID-19 policy by the state.According to my own research, I found out that COVID-19 indeed disrupted the event activities and plans. On watching the current videos played by Mr. Bowers in his office, it was evident that
instead of 14 players, the field could only accommodate eight players. In comparing the previous and current football training sessions, there was a difference in audience volume. And this had a negative impact on supporting talent and employment creation since the audience included the event sponsors who could not attend the event to identify the talented individuals (Dönmez et al. 6). The recorded football match in 2019 backward was much better than of 2020 and 2021. During these two years, the players did not have enough space and time to train as a full team, thus leading to poor performance. The poor performance due to insufficient training has also led to the sponsor’s reluctance towards supporting the event.Based on my analysis, the COVID-19 pandemic affected the inter families
the training hours (Dönmez et al. 2). Mr. Bowers’s figurative language truly revealed how painful the pandemic cost the event. From my angle of view, Mr. Bowers should approach the national government to grant them a permit to conduct the inter families’ competitions regardless of the pandemic policies placed by the state. He should do this because this event has created jobs for the youths and earned revenue for the government.
Different circumstances under which medical staff has worked led to varying types of leadership strategies being developed. For example, the COVID-19 pandemic highlighted the role of clear communication and the handling of prompt preparation in top healthcare leaders (Nicola et al., 2020). Another key tactic includes the use of external change agents that ultimately promote excellent organizational decision-making (Alagoz et al., 2018). Moreover, one study explained how implementing positivity-related and open-minded approaches as leaders can improve their employee’s resilience, providing an additional source of motivation (Wei et al., 2018). Hence, effective healthcare leaders must adapt to various external changes and strategically communicate with their coworkers.Several departments can be interacted with through the role of a healthcare administrator. One of them includes the in-patient department where multiple approaches from
The creation of intelligent devices provoked further development in this area, which led to the emergence of the Internet of things. Such devices are controlled in the same way using mobile applications, which creates additional sources of problems with the safety of their operation. Since most consumers lack technology security literacy, this problem poses a threat to users (Allifah & Zualkernan, 2022). Also, there are no available and understandable to the end consumer security standards for such Internet things that could influence the choice of purchase. As a result, the article identifies the main security risks, demonstrates previous attempts to build a ranking model, and suggests developed directions in this area.The first such devices began to appear in 1985, gradually increasing the consumption rate, but by 2006, many
were noticeably concerned about the security of these devices. Because they were controlled by Internet access, they could be easily compromised (Allifah & Zualkernan, 2022). 40% of homes have at least five devices with Internet access, and the same 40% have at least one device with several vulnerabilities (Allifah & Zualkernan, 2022). Many authors and works are given in the article, where various loopholes and problems of the Internet of Things are proved. At the same time, there were appropriate safety labels, but the consumer could hardly understand them if he did not have the appropriate in-depth knowledge.Determining the relative safety of devices of this type is a rather complex multi-criteria task, especially given the different orientations of each of these devices. The models under consideration often adopted
a hierarchical analytical process as a method for solving such multiobjective problems (Allifah & Zualkernan, 2022). This method can combine qualitative and quantitative characteristics of a device, evaluate internal consistency, and have a transparent framework for comparing devices against criteria.The article proposes the construction of such a safety rating with the condition of its understandability for the end-user. Such an approach will create a criterion by which the user will make a more informed decision about the purchase. The method is also built on AHP, offering new solutions and insights in methodology building (Allifah & Zualkernan, 2022). Finally, the article also provides an example of the application of this technique.AHP is a goal-based approach against which criteria are built. Each criterion has its weight compared to others or
relative priority. Based on the priority of criteria or sub-criteria, their contribution to the overall goal is evaluated. This method is widely used in various cyber security systems, information security, decision validation, web applications, cloud storage, networks, and mobile applications (Allifah & Zualkernan, 2022). The methods often focus on privacy, attack prevention, authentication, security, access, and integration.Most intelligent systems or devices in a brilliant homework with cloud storage and a service provider. In addition, wireless data transmission methods are used: Wi-fi, Bluetooth, ZigBee (Allifah & Zualkernan, 2022). Accordingly, given that each device is unique in its tasks, the task of the security risk assessment is to identify the main commonalities for the purpose of an integrated approach. Recently, there has also been a trend to use third-party local
devices as a gateway, access to which can be restricted by the user, and as a result, their use is more secure. Also, most devices offer mobile applications to manage them.What are the common vulnerabilities of consumer smart home devices when viewed as IoT peripherals? What are common network vulnerabilities when used with smart home devices? What are the common vulnerabilities of the cloud when used with smart home devices? What are common application vulnerabilities when used with smart home devices? (Allifah & Zualkernan, 2022).To assess this issue, the article’s authors turned to the most researched and frequently used digital libraries that provide functionality for various technologies and devices. Peripherals are attacked by potential Internet access and default passwords, undocumented Secure Shell, end-to-end network layer delays, and more
(Allifah & Zualkernan, 2022). As a result, attackers can gain access to control, listen and write personal data. If many privileges are granted to such devices, they pose a danger in their operation, and if an attacker can replace the voice, then in matters of control over them. Many companies cannot continue supporting the device due to closures or the creation of new models, which also raises the issue of security.Dangers can occur at the network level, hardware, cloud, and mobile. It is recommended to change passwords more often, update device software, and introduce additional authentication steps on the network. Developers use machine learning to detect third-party intrusions. Cloud security is related to the threats of information transactions between the device and the cloud. It is also recommended
for the four selected criteria and will be able to make an informed choice of the best device.The authors argue that although only one empirical study was evaluated with this model in this article, it can be adapted for other devices. The model’s flexibility is explained by a preliminary study conducted on the sources of vulnerabilities in most devices in the smart home (Allifah & Zualkernan, 2022). Sufficiently wide multi-criteria sub-criteria, each having its weight, make the system universal regardless of the operational purpose of the device.
Net Present Value (NPV) reflects the amount of cash an investor or funder expects to receive from a project after inflows are recouped through all sorts of costs. This figure can be understood as the investor’s total profit generated once the payback begins. NPV gives a clear indication of whether a project is worth investing in based on likely costs and potential risk. NVP has many more advantages over other investment criteria.The rules that apply to NVP include common sense and the reasonableness of the investment and take into account return criteria. Since the calculation of NVP involves a time horizon, it is already profitable over static measures. Accordingly, the first advantage of NVP is its connection to the idea of an expected value, which will be less
To properly manage business outputs, it is crucial to examine the external environment of the industry in question. The 7-Eleven organization could greatly benefit from implementing the I/O Model of Above-Average Returns, which relies on the examination of the firm’s external conditions. As such, the first stage involves the analysis of the industry and competitor environment, creating a clear picture of the general atmosphere (Hitt et al., 2007). For the 7-Eleven corporation, the competitors are such large-scale convenience stores as Walmart and Target. However, as the overall industry grows and generates a significant amount of revenue, it creates a positive atmosphere for further development.Another factor to consider is the industry’s attractiveness, as it must possess a high potential for the firm to generate above-average returns. In the current
it is vital to be skilled in international trade and branch management.Finally, to implement the selected approach, it is necessary to establish which actions will be performed to achieve the above-average returns. For 7-Eleven, it would be beneficial to use the company’s strengths in this endeavor, namely the existence of other international branches and the successful history of operations in the US (Lee, 2021). By relying on the previously obtained knowledge and integrating global expansion into the organization’s goals, 7-Eleven might perfectly utilize the formulated strategy and earn above-average returns.
Iran is a theocratic republic in the Middle East (ME) and one of the most controversial states in the region. A diverse population includes many ethnicities, such as Persian, Azerbaijani, Gilaki, and others, being a significant factor contributing to the development of the highly divided society with the various interests and political aspirations. The continuous instability in the state, the efforts to acquire weapons of mass destruction as well as Iran’s connection to the terrorist groups, give plausible reasons to discuss its sponsoring of global terrorism. This essay will analyze the reasons for Iran’s involvement, the state’s foreign policy, and its support for the specific terrorist groups, which influence the ME as well as the whole world.Due to the particular features of the theocratic regimes, in the case
of Iran, the inclination towards terrorism can be explained by two pillars of the Islamic doctrine underlining the constitution. Firstly, the obligation to support jihad – the holy war waged on behalf of Islam as a religious duty (Merriam-Webster, n.d.). Secondly, the mission to spread the Muslim faith, which is expressed in backing the proxy organizations (Spindlove&Simonsen, 2018). Since the establishment of the Islamic Republic of Iran in 1979 as a result of the Iranian Revolution prepared by the Mujahedin-e-Khalq (MEK), the secular regime of Shah Mohammad Reza Pahlavi was overthrown. Thus, the Islamic principles in the regime started to play an even more crucial guiding role under the religious leader Ayatollah Khomeini.Beyond the abovementioned Islamic motives, the critical implications for Iran’s foreign policy conclude in the anti-US
and anti-Israel actions, posing a threat to their citizens. In Bush’s speech in 2002, he named Iran an ‘axis of evil,’ thus, accusing the state of the hostility. However, already in 1989, after Khomeini’s call to kill Rushdie, the British author, the relations between the Western powers and Iran were not favorable. According to Spindlove&Simonsen (2018), the US considers Iran the main sponsor of terrorism and indicates the impossibility of establishing normal relations between the states until the changes in Iran’s behavior. The relations with the state in the region are complicated by the propagation of Islam as well as by the explicit desire to destroy Israel.The specific examples of Iran’s involvement in sponsoring international terrorism can be observed in the ME region and the West. Iran assisted
IntroductionThe nature and form of war change, but its fundamental nature remains constant. Nearly two decades of continuous irregular warfare against violent extremist organizations worldwide — the demand for skill in irregular hostilities continues. The leaders search for the best strategy for dealing with irregular warfare and preparing soldiers for operational actions. The path to changes can be the introduction of the Performance Triad and improving of the leaders’ personal qualities, taking into account the peculiarities of irregular warfare.How Leaders can Implement the Performance Triad to Help Prepare their Organizations for Irregular WarfareIrregular warfare is different from conventional ones and therefore requires special training. Irregular warfare, which is different in form, describes types of violence conducted by sub-state actors, including terrorism and insurgency (James D. Kiras, 2009, p.
3). Irregular forces on one or both sides almost entirely suppressed the ongoing conflicts after the invasion of Iraq, renewed Taliban insurgency in the 2001 war in Afghanistan, conflict in Darfur, the Lord’s Resistance Army uprising in northern Uganda, and the Second Chechen War.Conducting effective actions in irregular warfare requires even more diligent use of the physical resources of soldiers; here, the Performance Triad can help. It is a comprehensive plan to build preparedness and resilience through public health initiatives and leadership engagement. Army Medicine has the privilege of maintaining, restoring, and improving the health of the entire Army family and helped the Army create the Performance Triad (Sleep, Activity, and Nutrition) initiative. Sleep is critical to the proper cognitive and physical functioning of the body. For soldiers,
lack of sleep can slow down the execution of orders both on and off the training ground, harming soldiers and units. Keeping fit is the key to making a soldier ready for action. Staying active and adhering to safe and effective training principles allows soldiers to fulfill their job responsibilities and become more potent fighters. A healthy diet provides exercise, increases energy and stamina, shortens recovery times between activities, improves focus and concentration, and helps soldiers feel better.The goal of the Performance Triad is to positively influence and maintain the health, readiness, and resilience of soldiers, and the entire army family. The pilot program, which began in 2013 and ended in 2014, reaffirmed the importance of committed leadership as a foundation to support soldiers and practice healthy sleep,
activity and eating habits to support preparedness and resilience. The widespread implementation of this strategy will help strengthen the physical and moral training of soldiers, which is especially important in irregular warfare.How the Execution of Mission Command during Irregular Warfare Will Have Different Challenges than during Conventional ConflictsThe increasingly complex security environment suggests the need for a revised understanding of irregular warfare. The problem of irregular cooperative solutions is in this combined routine: reactive adversaries such as terrorists, insurgents and criminal networks, advances in technology and other phenomena on a large scale such irregular infections, even more deadly, capable of causing widespread chaos. These emissions are entangling populations through the skillful use of communications, cyberspace, and technology so that their impact spreads to regional and global levels. Many
of them manifest themselves, in essence, as a struggle for influence and legitimacy.The Focus is on addressing the underlying economic, political, cultural, or security conditions that fuel the population’s grievances, rather than on applying military power directly against the military and paramilitary forces of adversaries (Department of Defense, 2010, p. 20). The Cold War experience shows that long-standing traditional warfare – troop movements, partner interactions, public relations, partner logistics, security assistance, intelligence, and counterintelligence activities, and training – complement and mutually support objectives. However, due to the nature of complex and amorphous attacks, these competitions are unlikely to end in a sudden military victory. Fixing, reducing, regulating the conflict and its causes can be determined as success. Joint strength thus must find multidimensional approaches in tandem with other
partners to resolve the problems. Complex political, cultural, religious, and historical factors and the various populations involved in all conflicts are difficult to understand deeply enough. Understanding the complex features and causes of irregular warfare can contribute to the formation of the right strategist, both for soldiers and leaders.How Leaders May Have to Adjust their Leadership Attribute of Intellect during Irregular WarfareThe army leadership requirements layout the attributes and competencies expected of every Army leader – character, presence, and intellect. These attributes often reflect personal experience and long-term development and are not immediately gained from direct training events. At the organizational level, they directly relate to how a leader behaves, influences organizational change, and guides the unit through obstacles and setbacks. Since irregular warfare usually results in protracted
and unpredictable conflicts, the government should adjust the leader attributes to ensure maximum organization support and mission accomplishment. In irregular warfare, success requires a mindset that focuses on how to influence the population to support the HN leadership positively (United States Air Force, 2013, p.21). Intelligence consists of a person’s ability and knowledge. Intelligence enables leaders to be creative and engaging to understand what is happening, judgments, tasks, and actions. Intelligence enables leaders to reason analytically, critically, ethically, and culturally sensitive. Intellect participates in consideration of intentional and unintentional consequences of decisions made by the leader. Effective leaders must anticipate second and third-order the results of their decisions.A leader’s mental ability affects how well he thinks and leads others. Every leader must be self-aware of their strengths and
limitations and apply them accordingly. Leader development is the deliberate, continuous, and progressive process – founded in the Army Ethic – that develops Soldiers and Army Civilians into competent, committed professional leaders of character (Department of Army, 2017, p. 7). Innovative problem solutions tend to be inquisitive, trying to figure out why something is happening the way it is or asking questions if something might work better. Innovative leaders prevent complacency by finding new ways to challenge subordinates with alternative approaches and ideas (Department of Army, 2019, p.56). To be innovative requires creative thinking, using both adaptive (based on experience and prior knowledge) and innovative approaches (development of completely new ideas). Innovative leaders prevent complacency by finding new ways to challenge their subordinates.To be innovators, leaders rely on
Vitamin D plays a significant role in regulating phosphorus and calcium absorption in our bones. Far from this regulation, the nutrient is also essential in facilitating communication among cells within our bodies. The other significance of vitamin D in the body is that it can be manufactured when exposed to sunlight. These characteristics distinguish the vitamin from other nutrients since it can be obtained from sun exposure apart from food and dietary supplements. Compared to other nutrients, what characterizes vitamin D makes it a super nutrient.What sets vitamin D apart from the other nutrients and arguably makes it a super nutrient is that, unlike other nutrients, it can be obtained by exposure to the sun. Exposure to the sun is the most effective way the vitamin can be
obtained (Klioze, 2017). The potential magic associated with the nutrient is that it acts as a potential hormone in over a dozen of cells and tissues throughout the body. In so doing, the vitamin helps the body regulate essential gene expression and rapidly activates the already-expressed proteins and enzymes (Klioze, 2017). For example, in the heart, vitamin D binds to a certain receptor of the same vitamin, generating a calming protective effect.With a considerable amount of research on the nutrient focusing on the significance of the vitamin on overall health, some epidemiological studies have uncovered a deficiency torrent of vitamin D. Based on the read report; findings show that between 50 and 75 percent of Americans have insufficient vitamin D levels in their bodies (Feldman et al., 2018).
A growing body of evidence shows that an individual’s chance for optimal health is increased if the nutrient levels are adequate and vice versa. However, important to note is that “Just because low vitamin D and disease are correlated does not mean that one causes the other” (Feldman et al., 2018). Contrary, the same scientific reports have shown that approximately 75 percent of breast and colon cancer can be prevented by maintaining sufficient vitamin D levels (Klioze, 2017). Several reasons exist why vitamin deficiency is widespread in the U.S. and the world over.Unlike other vitamins, vitamin D is one of the few nutrients the body can make. However, compared to the others, 40 percent of body exposure to ultraviolet B rays, between 15 and 30 minutes, results in
of fortified cereals (Feldman et al., 2018). Combined, both a glass of milk and cereals can only generate 200 IU of vitamin D, a one-tenth amount that can be acquired from thirty minutes under the sun (Feldman et al., 2018). Hence, it becomes physically impossible to eat your way out of vitamin D deficiency.Vitamin D is arguably fast becoming a super nutrient, with its importance growing exponentially in the past few decades. Scientific research shows that insufficient vitamin D can be associated with widespread health consequences. However, as shown, just because low vitamin D and disease are correlated does not mean that one causes the other. Contrary, by maintaining sufficient vitamin D levels, some major health complications can be prevented.
Following the 9/11 terrorist attack orchestrated by al Qaeda in 2001, America’s world transformed forever. Conspicuous changes included a fresh era and a new term called Homeland Security. Despite the lengthy pursuit of al Qaeda leader, Osama bin Laden and his ultimate killing by the Navy Seal team, the security threat to America’s homeland still continues. As demonstrated by more than 50 terror incidences, some thwarted while others successful, the U.S. must always remain watchful and continue to safeguard the country (Oliver et al., 2015). The principal strategies for responding to any terror occurrences and natural catastrophes are all anchored in local responders. Homeland security remains an organizational and administrative response to actual and potential threats. Therefore, National Incident Management System (NIMS) aligns with the homeland security structure
in various ways.Firstly, following the 9/11 attack, the Homeland Security Act ordered every level of a government agency to NIMS for responding to any type and size of emergency. The objective of this direction was to provide a synchronized, unified, and joint response during any disaster. As part of efforts to reinforce homeland security, NIMS has a crucial component called Incident Command System (ICS) to address all disaster-related issues (Oliver et al., 2015). NIMS seeks to allay every friction and accelerate emergency arrangements encompassing various responses from many concerned institutions by acting as the common, scalable, and adjustable system used by involved parties. Moreover, its compulsion was strengthened in 2003 by Presidential Directive 5 on homeland security.Secondly, NIMS can fit into homeland security by offering a comprehensive, national
tactic to case management pertinent across functional disciplines and every jurisdictional level. NIMS has matched this role by becoming appropriate across an entire spectrum of potential hazards, incidents, impacts, irrespective of complexity, location, or size (Oliver et al., 2015). It has improved cooperation and coordination between private entities and the public through various incident management undertakings and offering a unified standard for general incident handling.Thirdly, NIMS offers a reliable framework and method to enable management across all levels (local, state, and Federal) to collaborate to prevent, recover from, respond to, prepare for, and alleviate impacts of incidents. Explicitly, regular utilization of NIMS lays the foundation for effective and efficient responses from solitary agency fire reaction to a multijurisdictional natural catastrophe or bombing response. For instance, state agencies, which
The suggested strategies to mitigate the effects of coronavirus in accordance with the example of Iceland could be considered as an interesting approach. This strategy acknowledges its apparent limitations, such as the resilience of the Iceland community, geographical idiosyncrasy. However, currently, this strategy might not be a valid method to address the high margins of infected individuals in NATO countries. It is certainly true that quick response and high testing rates would contribute to the deterrence of the effects imposed by the sudden growth of the number of infected. However, it is similarly meaningful that the population would be willing to undergo such a measure. Moreover, despite the financial support efforts, some countries belonging to the organization might not be able to financially withstand the high amount of
Israeli government approached the problem of monitoring the infected with the creative solution of digital epidemiological investigation (Amit et al., 2020). This technology allowed tracking potential contacts of people that were infected and act accordingly (Amit et al., 2020). However, it is arguable that this methodology could address the geographical limitations introduced in the case of Iceland. It would be difficult for NATO countries to strictly monitor all entrances to their borders. Therefore, an analog in the form of digital tracking may solve the problem with the need for strict borders control and provide necessary tools for timely reaction to the new outbreaks. Nevertheless, it would require funds both internal and external in order to build new or reconstruct the existing infrastructure for the stated purposes.
The introduced Canadian perspective on the provisional agenda of the North Atlantic Council seems to cover key points that concern Canadian security. Increased presence in the world peace operations and maintenance of tight relationships with other NATO members, especially remarkable is the smart defense approach that considers the military and economic needs of Canada. Although, it is difficult to judge the extent of the Syrian threat to Canadian interest during the outbreak of coronavirus, which seems to continue even today. Therefore, it would be essential to review the proposed question for a more effective approach to the defense of Canadian interests. Nevertheless, this act protects the interest of both Israel and Canada and will positively impact their relationship. Furthermore, it is notable how the Canadian government is willing
The current issue with Nike stems from its corrupt corporate culture, which puts women in a position of weakness. It allows powerful men in charge of the company to abuse and suppresses them, preventing them from reaching the positions they deserve without being harassed or denigrated. There are four potential ways of dealing with a problem: absolving, solving, resolving, and dissolving (Ackoff, 2019). Given the scope and the long-term aims for Nike and society in general, the only acceptable solution would be to dissolve it. The process of dissolution revolves around removing the underlying causes for the problem to exist in the first place. Absolving means ignoring the problem, solving – giving the women that were harmed some sort of compensation without making changes, and resolving – giving
The deep socio-economic divides in American society have impacted the unemployment rates even before the COVID-19 pandemic; however, the virus has exacerbated the issue. There have been two distinct experiences during the pandemic: first, people with graduate education, who kept stable jobs through working remotely; second, those who either lost or got reduced in their jobs with no safety net (Blustein et al., 2020).The key determinants of work availability are power and privilege, unevenly divided across racial, gender, and education lines (Blustein et al., 2020). The national socio-economic gaps lie between those who have a college education and those who do not (Galea & Abdalla, 2020). Within the framework of education access, race and ethnicity represent a major division plane between Americans. The black demographic faces racism in
4% now. However, for the black population, the unemployment rate reached 16.8% in April 2020; later, stalled at 10.9% in October 2020 and then only lowered to 6.9% in January 2022 (Bureau of Labor Statistics, 2022).In contrast, the white demographic presents a steady decrease within six months from April 2020; by October 2020, unemployment more than halved from 14.1% to 6.0%. Higher education, stable jobs, and support networks contribute to the higher-than-average unemployment rates for the black demographic (Galea & Abdalla, 2020). This statistic demonstrates the uneven struggle to recover from the pandemic-induced and general unemployment.
Formal InstitutionsPolitical SystemItaly is a European nation found along the Mediterranean coastline, with Rome as its capital city. Kings initially ruled the Italian up to the Second World War. Nevertheless, in 1946, Italians decided to overthrow the empire, and the nation became an independent state. The initial State continued until 1992, when scandals devastated Italy’s main political parties. Due to those major improvements in the parties, the era is known as the Second Republic, even though there were no constitutional changes (Capussela, 2018). Sergio Matterella is the current president of Italy, even though it is a ceremonial duty.Legal SystemItaly is a republic with a constitution composed of 139 reports demonstrating society’s elementary ground from 1948. The reports are into three main groups: essential philosophies, human rights and responsibilities,
and republican organization (Capussela, 2018). The national assembly and regional members elect Italy’s presidents by secret ballot. Parliament elects Presidents for seven-year terms to prevent re-election by the same parliament.There are three government systems in Italy, including legislative, judicial, and executive. As the head of the council, the prime ministers oversee and executive authority to the Council of Ministers who carry outlaws and other political decisions (Capussela, 2018). Acts are typically presented to the parliament, but in cases of urgency, bills can get approval through decrees or if the national assembly offers the council the responsibility to act.Economic SystemThe Italian economy consists of established industries in the North owned by private companies and a less established, heavily subsidized agrarian in the South afflicted by poverty and poor infrastructure.
The manufacturing of slightly elevated consumer products by midsized and small commercials, most of which are kinship, is a major booster of the Italian economy. In addition, Italy possesses a substantial subterranean economy, constituting approximately 17 percent of the GDP (Capussela, 2018). Farming, service industries, and infrastructure are possibly the most dominant regions to find these events.Italy falls in third place economically in Europe, but its extremely high public bills and structural growth constraints have made it sensitive to financial sector scrutiny. Since 2007, Italy’s community bills have continuously risen, surpassing 131 percent of the GDP in 2017 (Capussela, 2018). However, shareholders’ fear about Italy and the broader eurozone disaster subsided in 2013, reducing Italy’s administration bills borrowing rates.Informal InstitutionComponents of the CultureAccording to research, Italian is the
State’s official language, and almost 93 percent of people speak Italian as their native language (Morretta et al., 2020). Italy’s languages include Sardinian and Piedmontese. Roman Catholicism is Italy’s most commonly practiced religion (Morretta et al., 2020). It is unsurprising, provided that Vatican City is found at the center of Rome and is the place of Roman Catholicism and home of the Pope.Several architectural styles emerged in Italy but not limited to Renaissance, Baroque and Classical Roman (Morretta et al., 2020). The Colosseum and the Leaning Tower of Pisa are examples of the global’s most known structures in Italy. Most individuals view Italian cooking as an art, which has impacted food culture globally. For instance, pasta, wine, and cheese are predominant in Italian cooking. Pasta is found in
various forms, including popular varieties such as spaghetti, lasagna, and linguine.Context of CultureItaly is a high-context society, and the majority of Italian cultural interaction relies heavily on physical indicators. A significant part of the content in high-context principles is hidden in the bodily setting of the person (Morretta et al., 2020). For example, the speaker believes that no explanation is necessary because the person to whom they are speaking should comprehend what they are trying to express.Hofstede’s Cultural DimensionsThe concept is used to identify cultural variations between nations. Some of the Hofstede cultural aspects in Italy include individualism and power distance (Burton et al., 2021). The individualism aspect addresses people’s opinions of various groups in their environment. When a person is individualistic, they perceive themselves and their close
family as vital. In contrast, collective individuals are concerned with the welfare of a larger group, including their corporation, and prioritize their own needs.Italians thrive in individualism because they prioritize their close family over their friends and would rather do business with individuals they recognize and rely on when there is a need. The in-group then makes decisions, and meetings are mostly intended to tell the rest of the group about the results. On the other hand, power distance refers to the degree to which those at the bottom of the hierarchy embrace and even anticipate authority to be dispersed unfairly (Burton et al., 2021). This aspect demonstrates that Italians demand a certain amount of power distance. On the other hand, they like making fun of authority, and
breaching rules appear to be an Italian pastime.Resources and CapabilitiesNatural and Geographic ResourcesItaly has many natural resources, including crude oil deposits, pyrites, fluorspar, potash, pumice, coal, asbestos, and mercury, to mention a few (Cimini et al., 2020). The country’s mineral resources, such as petroleum and other rare earth elements, impact the Italian economy. Italy is a country found in a boot-shaped peninsula that extends outwards into the Adriatic Sea and Tyrrhenian and other water supply sources in the Southern part of Europe.The county’s geographical position has a significant impact on its heritage. The sea surrounds Italy, and its core is subdivided into sections by mountains. The Alps, which extend across the State’s summit, are dotted with long, thin icy lakes, and the Apennines Mountains extend from the South
to the Western end of the Alps down the peninsula (Cimini et al., 2020). The wooded slopes West of the Apennines resides several of Italy’s ancient cities, especially Rome.Technological AdvancementItaly has dominated the European Union and financial markets, certainly bringing severe economic issues. However, Italy is the second-largest producer among the twenty-eight European Union member nations, close after Germany (Cimini et al., 2020). Italy is at the vanguard of the Fourth Industrial Insurgency facets, particularly in the information insurgency. Italy falls in the top 10 in the world regarding robotic intensity or the number of factory robots per worker, significantly outnumbering countries such as France, the United Kingdom, and Spain, with 132, 71, and 160 robots.Development of InfrastructureItaly is concentrating on massive infrastructure projects to boost its economy.
The Italian directorate declared withdrawal limitations on 130 construction projects regarded crucial for reopening the country’s economy and modernizing its infrastructure network on the same day that the European Union reduced its 2020 GDP prediction for Italy to fall by 11.2 percent (Cimini et al., 2020). Italy’s major projects include; A proposed motorway between Rome and Latina, the expressway construction joining central Italy and Liguria, and the Ionica state route with links to the Port of Civitavecchia, which is just a few cases.International TradeImportsItaly usually imports engineering and metal items, particularly from France, the United States of America, the United Kingdom, and Germany (Bontempi et al., 2021). Imports of vehicles, minerals, and chemicals are also significant products to the Italian economy. Italy imports energy and crude oil, especially
from the Middle East and North Africa.ExportsMetals, fine machinery, and metal products constitute Italy’s two largest exports. Italy is also a well-known exporter of apparel and footwear and scooters, automobiles, notably luxury motor cars and motorbikes. Pharmaceuticals, other chemicals, and various culinary goods are exported from Italy (Bontempi et al., 2021). Italy distributes approximately 56 percent of its goods to other European Union nations, primarily Spain, Germany, and France (Bontempi et al., 2021). However, the United States of America and Switzerland are also important trade associates of Italy.Trade AdvantageItaly is among the five States which enjoy a trade export surplus in the European nations. Italian firms are determined to retain their export edge. They invested majorly in new production technologies such as robots, factory automation, and additive production,
which boost output and lower prices (Bontempi et al., 2021). Invitalia and State agency offers broad benefits to both Italian and foreign corporations through funding initiatives of all kinds in vital sectors such as factories, environmental protection, and tourism.Economic Trade ConditionsItaly had a Gross domestic product of approximately $1.85 trillion in 2020 and a per capita Gross domestic product of about $31,630 (Bontempi et al., 2021). Italy falls in eighth place economically in the current world ranking. Due to the Corona infection and the Italian administration’s containment actions, Italy’s GDP will reduce by approximately 8.9 percent in 2020 (Bontempi et al., 2021). Nevertheless, the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development anticipated that Italy’s GDP would grow either in 2021 or 2022, with about 4.5 percent in 2021 and
about 4.4 percent in 2022.International Trade PolicyBeing a part of the European Union, Italy follows EU legislation that applies throughout the EU. Import obstacles based on tariffs come from both national and EU rules (Bontempi et al., 2021). Even though some limits exist to particular categories of goods, the European Union’s international trade policy is largely flexible, for example, agricultural goods. However, Italy is a member of the European Union and the World Trade Organization. Hence, it uses the Technical Barriers to Trade team to deliberate on some critical trade issues and research the choices and executions of the regulations.Instruments of Trade policyItaly is a European Union associate; therefore, products easily move between associate states just after establishing the internal market (Bontempi et al., 2021). Even though the
unrestricted distribution of goods subsists within Customs Union, the Common Custom Policy exists for products brought from other states, enabling uniform customs taxes to be applied irrespective of the origin member state.Foreign Direct InvestmentFDI Flow and StockForeign Direct Investment flows in Italy withstood an overall negative trend, increasing by 2 percent, maintaining a trend that began in 1998. Between 1990 and 2001, its outward FDI stock increased sixfold, making it a net outward investor. Italy’s FDI stock spreads geographically inbound and outbound in the Netherlands, Switzerland, and France (Bayar & Ozturk, 2018). In 2020, Italy’s inward FDI stock was valued at approximately 469.29 billion dollars compared to 443.53 billion dollars in the past year (Bayar & Ozturk, 2018). The Foreign Direct Investment to GDP ratio is low, implying
Considerable musicians have represented soul music, and James Brown was one of the most prominent. Southern soul became extremely popular towards the end of the 1960s, and Brown had his first success in 1956 (Covach and Flory 218). Initially, Brown worked as a stand-in for Little Richard, and his first record, “Please Please Please,” was quite thriving (Covach and Flory 240-241). Brown used to sing lead vocals, and his early musical style resembled that of the 1950s doo-wop (Covach and Flory 242). However, he began to develop the soul style in 1960 with “Think,” characterized by horns and a driving rhythm section (Covach and Flory 242). In 1964, Brown introduced “Out of Sight,” which represented the hard-driving soul style featured in his later songs towards the 1970s (Covach
Janina’s language in the novel Drive Your Plow over the Bones of the Dead is unique in many ways, as she unravels the mystery surrounding not only the murders but her personality. However, one of the most notable traits that the reader may notice on the first page is Janina’s use of nicknames as substitutes for any person or animal’s name. While many people use nicknames for friends or people they dislike, Janina’s approach is built on her feelings towards her name and names in general. She states, “I believe each of us sees the other person in our way, so we should give them the name we consider suitable.” She considers names “polyonymous” and adheres to this rule for every character she encounters.As a result, each person
IntroductionThis paper aims to analyze the Japanese advertisement found on the website Ads of the World . This ad promotes a product called “Toilet Quickle Deodorant Coat Sheet,” which is intended to help housewives get rid of unpleasant odor in the toilet. An analysis of this ad shows that it cannot be standardized for the US audience; instead, it should be adapted because of the language and cultural differences, such as variations in the use of appeal and comparisons and the importance of diversity.Main bodyPerhaps, the most apparent reason why this ad needs to be adapted to the US audience rather than standardized is the use of the Japanese language. In this ad, the Japanese language is used in the speech of the actors delivering the information to
the customers and the signs on the screen. While the actor’s speech can simply be translated into English, the signs on the screen have to be adapted. This is because the Japanese language uses characters that appear much more compact than English words. Therefore, simply writing the Japanese words in English would change the layout of the images that support the information delivered by the speakers.The next rationale for adaptation is that this ad is filmed in the format of a weather report familiar to Japanese housewives. In the US, the format for such programs is different to a certain extent, which means that this ad may appear less familiar to American housewives. The ad also shows such a common feature of Japanese etiquette as bowing, which is
not used in the US and, therefore, should be removed when adapting the ad to the American audience.The way the message is delivered in the Japanese and American cultures is also different, which further supports the need for adaptation rather than standardization. In particular, in Japan, advertisements use indirect communication to convey their messages and let the audience decide for themselves what they should think about the brand. This is because Japanese people, in contrast to Americans, have negative attitudes to hard-sell practices, so ads using direct communication would be ineffective in this country. In addition, Japanese ads do not tend to use comparisons. In contrast, US advertisements use direct communication to convey the brand value to the audience and often compare different brands in their campaigns, for
example, in the advertising campaigns of McDonald’s and Burger King. The ad under review does not say explicitly that the advertised brand is the best in the market and does not make any comparisons; it only offers a brief explanation of what the product is used for. In order to adapt the ad to the US audience, advertisers should explicitly state their message about the value of the brand.Furthermore, the advertisement needs adaptation rather than standardization because of the differences in the use of appeals in the US and Japan. Japanese advertisements appeal to the audience’s sentiment, while American advertisements appeal to logical reasoning. Thus, Japanese ads primarily contain images that invoke viewers’ emotions, whereas American ads use testimonies, logical arguments, and spokespeople to persuade people through rational
explanations. The ad under review clearly depicts the peculiarities of Japanese culture in advertising. It does not cite any specific facts, such as what ingredients contribute to the elimination of odor or what specialists in the field of hygiene say about this product. Instead, it appeals to the audience’s emotions by targeting the pain point addressed by the advertised product – the unpleasant odor. In particular, the woman on the left represents a Japanese housewife who voices concerns similar to those that housewives all over Japan are supposed to have. While this approach may work in Japan, it can appear ineffective in the US because of the audience’s expectations of a logical explanation of why they need this product. To adapt this ad to American viewers, it can
be standardized for the US because of significant differences between American and Japanese cultures and languages. Therefore, the ad should be adapted in terms of language, communication strategy, type of appeal, and racial representation. In particular, because of the different writing systems of the English and Japanese languages, the ad’s layout should be changed for a better appearance for the English-speaking audience. It should also contain more factual details about the product and can include testimonials and direct product comparisons.
John Smeaton was an English engineer who designed bridges, canals, and lighthouses. In the given article, written by Andrew M. A. Morris, the author demonstrates how this renowned engineer employed parameter variation in a far more broad context as part of an analytical procedure (Morris, 2021). Morris stresses the three distinct goals of such a process, including optimization, theory testing, and maxim development through exploratory testing.As the writer puts it, the fundamental point of this study is that Smeaton accomplished more than enhanced engineering processes by systematizing prior artisanal ways, as was the traditional interpretation of Smeaton’s method established by technology analysts in the 1990s (Morris, 2021). Rather, he claims that his method creates a link between science and technology by including both theory testing and practical testing
This paper is devoted to the study of judgmental forecasting. It contains general data about this type of forecasting, cases of its application, examples of its most effective use, and its advantages and disadvantages. As an example of judgmental forecasting, the Delphi method is proposed, which involves identifying a consistent assessment of an expert group through an independent, anonymous survey of experts in several rounds, which involves reporting the previous round’s results to the experts. Resources such as the book Forecasting: Principles and practice by Hyndman and Athanasopoulos, and Sniezek’s article “A comparison of techniques for judgmental forecasting by groups with common information ” are used to support the presented data.What is Judgmental ForecastingIn cases of the extreme complexity of the problem, its novelty, insufficiency of available information,
or the impossibility of mathematical formalization of the solution process, one has to turn to competent experts. The solution of problems by experts, their commenting, the formation of quantitative estimates, and the processing of the latter by formal methods is called the method of judgmental forecasting. Hyndman and Athanasopoulos (2018) assert that this method involves a set of logical procedures aimed at obtaining from experts the data necessary for the preparation and selection of rational decisions. In the theoretical aspect, the legitimacy of using judgmental forecasting is confirmed because methodologically correctly obtained expert judgments meet two criteria for the reliability of any new knowledge: accuracy and reproducibility of the result. Therefore, judgmental forecasting is created by experts based on their experience and assessments.Judgmental forecasting helps to formalize the
procedures for collecting, summarizing, and analyzing expert opinions to transform them into the most convenient form for making an informed decision. Moreover, this method of forecasting is continuously developed and improved. Currently, judgmental forecasting, in combination with other mathematical and statistical methods, can minimize the risk of making the wrong decision.Where is Judgmental Forecasting used Most Effectively?According to Hyndman and Athanasopoulos (2018), judgmental forecasting is applied in certain cases. Firstly, when an object or some phenomenon cannot be described mathematically. Secondly, it is used when there is no reliable, accurate, statistical information about the object that allows the use of objective methods. Thirdly, when there are no means for mathematical processing. For example, if there is no computer equipment, software, or qualified personnel. Fourth, it is a suitable
For example, by asking a group of people about what they are looking for in a product, companies can gauge their direction in developing specific product features.Advantages and Disadvantages of Judgmental ForecastingLike any other phenomenon, judgmental forecasting has both advantages and disadvantages.AdvantagesThe undoubted advantage of judgmental forecasting is that it is universal and applicable to various forecasting objects. Moreover, it is relatively simple from a methodological point of view and does not place high demands on the quality of the initial basic information. Sniezek (1990) notes that the scope of statistical forecasting methods is limited to short- and medium-term forecasts. On the contrary, judgmental forecasting will allow to make long-term forecasts.Disadvantages
American slavery arose as a way of exploiting labor within capitalism but gradually took shape in an autonomous socio-economic and political structure. Over time, a liberation movement began, which implied the illegality and unethical “ownership” of people. However, even after official emancipation, the slaves were dependent on the state and slave owners in the past, with a lack of resources for subsistence. Without documents, financial resources, and moral support, it was difficult for new members of society to integrate into a standard life. Additionally, discrimination and lack of inclusion as a phenomenon continued to exist.Slavery was abolished as a result of the Civil War between the northern and southern states. The passage of the Thirteenth Amendment to the US Constitution in January 1865 brought a permanent end to
Defining a historical context of juvenile delinquency studies can provide valuable information about society’s progress concerning juvenile delinquency in such aspects, as parental responsibility. Comparing the acts that were acknowledged as juvenile delinquency in ancient times and modern society can determine whether current policies effectively prevent youth from misbehavior. This essay will compare how juvenile delinquency was perceived in Ancient Greece with the way modern society approaches juvenile offenders.Firstly, searching for the historical origins of the juvenile delinquency concept could quickly become confusing because, historically, such a concept only occurred at the beginning of the modern era. While there is no significant data on youth misbehavior in ancient times, some available sources suggest that misbehavior was encouraged among young men (Bates & Swan, 2021). In particular, because masculinity
and physical power were highly appreciated in Ancient Greece, one could determine that the society was pushing male youth towards violent behavior.Exposing the youth to violent behavior and stories from a young age contributed to the unruly behavior of youth In Ancient Greece. According to Regoli et al. (2020), many stories from Ancient Greek culture focus on complicated parents’ relationships with their children that end with the killing of the children. Therefore, the author suggested that juvenile delinquency was sourced in one’s relationships with parents. While other sources suggest that in punishment measures, youth were treated as adults, according to Bates and Swan (2021), the issue of juvenile delinquency could not occur at that time due to close family connections. Furthermore, as corporal punishments were common in families
at that time, the state did not have to define specific punishments for youth misbehavior. The only policy related to juvenile delinquency existing in ancient Greece was the law that prohibited the youth in ancient Greece from beating their parents. Thus, for example, in cases where a young man committed misbehavior, he was primarily responsible for his parents, and they decided the punishment measures, which mainly featured corporal punishment.Exploration of the historical context of juvenile delinquency in the ancient period helps define one significant difference in parental engagement in modern society. In ancient Greece, the state encouraged parental responsibility for the child’s misbehavior, and parents could choose the punitive measures themselves. On the other hand, parental engagement in juvenile delinquency is limited in modern society. Moreover, parents, educational
for juvenile delinquency in modern society will never include corporal methods.In conclusion, this essay explored the historical context of juvenile delinquency and compared how the state approached juvenile delinquency in ancient and modern times. The essay defined that young Greeks were exposed to violent behavior from an early age in ancient Greece, and many had problematic relationships with their parents. Moreover, as the state held parents accountable for the children’s misbehavior, parents were the ones who chose the punishment measures, often resorting to corporal punishment. In modern times, the state prohibits corporal punishments due to their ineffectiveness and limits parental engagement in juvenile delinquency, and offenders are judged based on the severity of their actions.
The percentage of uninsured people in my state, Washington, is among the lowest. Particularly, it was 6.6% as of 2019, which is considerably lower than in Oklahoma (14.9%) or Texas (18.4%) (Kaiser Family Foundation, n.d.). In my opinion, the connection between the socioeconomic status and access to care is evident. The fewer opportunities a person has in terms of financial provision, the less possible it is for them to afford high-quality health care. Individuals with low income are highly likely to be uninsured or eligible for Medicaid. As a result, such citizens do not seek health care as often as it is needed. Frequently, they only address specialists in emergency cases, neglecting many other issues that require prevention or treatment.I think that the main reason why the percentage
Kantian ethics is the clearest example of non-consequential theories in philosophy, and by extension, in law. Support for the theory often comes from adherents of imperative social order ideas such as utilitarianism. In Kant’s philosophy, the ideas of non-consequential ethics are most clearly demonstrated by the moral and ethical phenomenon he formulated and called the categorical imperative.This concept, as conceived by Kant, is the formulation of how a person should act, striving to partake in genuinely moral behavior (Kant & Abbott, 2021). The imperative directly addresses the acting person, who makes specific moral choices according to the predetermined rational ways. It advises a person to strictly and urgently, most attentively, treat the maxims of their behavior, namely to the subjective rules of practical reason. According to Kant, the
always determined circumstances, the actions of specific people, acquires a particularly sharp form. This conflict arises at the forefront of Kant’s non-consequential ethical position. After all, a specific person cannot live and act otherwise than focusing on circumstances, building their own subjective maxims of behavior. Perhaps they have no reason to be guided by universal morality, and in this case, the universal moral law–the categorical imperative–becomes just an idea and a chimera.
Korean Popular Culture and the Selling of Place by Youjeong Oh examines the use of K-pop music and Korean dramas with an aim to promote the rural and urban places in South Korea. To facilitate this, the book provides a framework insight on ways in which South Korea has aggressively used a number of aspects such as K-pop, K-drama, K-food, plastic surgery, and tourism to develop multiple strategies. In addition, the book expounds on the crucial relationship between urban planning and Hallyu. It uses an academic point of view to bring out the role of Korean cities through its production of television and music programs to boost their images and attract tourists. The book does so by documenting, historicizing, and using visuals to support the narrative of Korean
culture.Pop City examines that pop culture features place selling facilitated with two separate domains: Korean globalization and political centralization of Korean culture. Based on the book, the local elections put in place in the 1990s enhanced the desires among the cities to develop and promote their rural areas. A good example is Wando County, a rural village that invested approximately $8 million and used its historical sites to create a K-drama that resulted in an increase of 50 million tourists with an income of $160 million in 2008 (Oh, 2018). The same case has been used in other rural areas where they use Korean entertainment to attract foreign tourists and sponsors. The elected local leaders also portray the political dimension. The local council has the authority to pass
the city and governor’s budget. With such authority and mandate, they have had the capacity to promote drama sponsorships. It means that the local government has a political centralization to dominate the decision-making process without the residents’ consent.In addition, Pop City analyses the process of culture featured place marketing. The book illustrates that the urban spaces in Korea are produced and sold in a similar way K-pop and k-drama are promoted using spectacular images rather than using the cultural and physical qualities that are in existence. For instance, the Anseong city attempted to commodify to be featured in the television show the Baudeogi; the city invested $9 million to develop the region and ensure that the city’s cultures stand out, such as dancing, singing, acrobatics, and circus performance
(Oh, 2018). The action was nullified as the locals claimed “that the spending of taxpayers’ money should be cautious, the local council, in particular, asked for a formal process to collect citizens’ extensive opinions.” (Oh, 2018). However, it is important to note that most of the K-dramas have featured different marketing regions through pseudohistory, artificial images, and fabricated representation that creates a fantasy of the reality. Hence, Pop City has demonstrated selling places through the consumer exploitative, image-based, and speculative nature of the Korean pop culture. It enhances shaping the commodification of the rural and urban regions.Furthermore , Pop City illustrates the reasons K-pop is a popular means of entertainment globally. K-pop is popular as the production uses desirable images that create an intimacy that is appealing to
the consumers; it includes visual quality, associated products, and idolized locations (Oh, 2018). It enables the consumers to create a relationship with the television show. Secondly, they use an idolized system that strongly influences K-pop. In Korea, entertainment agencies strategically produce idols who appear in films, television shows, dramas, and music. It states that “When releasing a new idol group, the gihoeksa invests a significant amount of effort in crafting unique and marketable images for it.” (Oh, 2018). The idols are used as marketing products that are used to captivate the consumer’s mind and sell the designed items such as K-pop places, music, drama show, and merchandise. The success of the idols towards the competitive market enhances profit generations.Furthermore, the book illustrates the diverse aspects of using human
geography to market Korea’s urban areas and K-pop. It defined human geography as “emotional engagement with a place turns visitors into agents of value creation on its behalf—that is, into facilitators of place selling.” (Oh, 2018). It emphasizes that for a consumer to engage with K-pop music and K-drama, the entertainment needs to be invested with the consumer’s emotions and bodily experiences. These aspects can be achieved from different places through displaying emotions of desires, love, longing, and tensions. Hence, it explains how tourists visit the K-pop music and K-drama sites to engage in an interpersonal and precognitive way, as demonstrated in the emotions of these pop. Human geography plays a significant role in pop culture, capitalizing on these emotional qualities and the way humans enact, feel, and
extending their cultural involvement with the physical location.Moreover, the book examines the extension of Hallyu disclosure through connecting with the urban placing. According to the reading, the Korean culture industry began during the existence of Hallyu due to the unanticipated global fame of the Korean culture that was led by the acquisition of the new markets. For instance, the K-drama series Jewel in the palace produced in 2003 reached over 60 countries (Oh, 2018). It impacted the industry to grow through attracting new industry players such as recording labels, entertainment management agencies, producers, and idols. It recognizes that the supply rather than the demand drives the Hallyu hype. It is because “Despite the risks involved in the oversupplied race, both the cultural producers and place marketers appear confident
features place selling mediates through two separate domains: Korean globalization and political centralization. The political centralization is acquired through the local government having the power to promote their regions through drama sponsorships. In comparison, the globalization aspects are illustrated on the K-pop power to use their culture to earn profit and sell the place. Such reasoning and documentation of the book with supporting evidence create a well-designed, innovative, and creative reading. It is recommendable to any reader interested in the Korean culture, urban planning, and sociology of the Hallyu.
Labor racketeering can be defined as the illegal use of unions and authority for self-interest. Union labor corruption was perpetrated by, performed in collaboration with, or under the direction of organized criminal syndicates. The beginning of the 20th century set the foundation for labor racketeering and became a law and societal concern (Jacobs, 2020). Until the late 1970s and early 1980s, there was no systematic governmental or enforcement agencies effort to mitigate the issue (Jacobs, 2020).During prohibition, criminal groups chose to generate profit from selling illicit spirits, which maintained the alcohol demand and earnings high. When prohibition was abolished in the 1930s, the mafia’s advanced business-running methods remained (Jacobs, 2020). The most potent groups turned their focus away from alcohol to business, including narcotics, gambling, and prostitution (Jacobs,
English is the simplest form of communication available between people from different parts of the world. It remains an indisputable fact that most people continue to speak with an accent even after many years of learning the language. This fact generates a vast wave of discrimination, especially from native speakers. The truth is that even they begin to twist their language to achieve a certain uniqueness and dissimilarity, especially in the creative sphere. The accent, which is so difficult to get rid of when speaking another language, is that our ear gets used to filtering out frequencies from childhood that are not needed to understand native speakers. It is essential to realize that speaking with an accent is normal, that this is not a reason to discriminate against
a person. Still, on the contrary, it is an excellent opportunity to help them improve their language.The policy of multiculturalism, which is the parallel coexistence of different cultures, is adjacent to the social movement “The English only movement.” The latter actively advocates establishing uniform norms of the American literary language for whites and African Americans (Park Hong). Various political and socio-economic measures designed to rid the country of racist prejudices have not yet been crowned with success. In modern sociolinguistics, a special place is given to language as a social practice that establishes power relations between representatives of various racial and class groups.The feeling of their alienness, “otherness” in a largely still segregated American society generates tensions between immigrants and the indigenous population. The color of the skin,
the size of the eyes or nose remain an unbreakable barrier separating the world of immigrants from the rest of Americans. Although in recent decades, there has been a significant improvement in the material and social situation (Park Hong). The Asian experience is not the only one that shows that language discrimination is still intense, although its boundaries are significantly blurred (Kim 4). Immigrants from Russia, Latin America, and the Middle East constantly face discrimination. It is mainly due to the complexity of their native language, which is not so easy to master perfectly (Ingham). The English language will be perceived very poorly in such conditions, even with many years of study experience.Linguistic appropriation as one of the forms of cultural appropriation is perceived in the USA as
of corners about a conversation with an accent. It is not important where you are from, South Asia or the Middle East, Africa, or Russia; this will not become an obstacle to dialogue.The asymmetric relationship between Americans and immigrants is directly reflected in linguistic phenomena. With any level of English proficiency, you can be understood and heard, not only in the USA but also around the world. It is necessary to let go of the fear of talking and writing on social networks in a language that is not native to you. It is a critical awareness that leads to language freedom in the USA.
There are many different scientific approaches to language studies; one of them is the prescriptive method. This principle can generally be described as a set of rules that prescribe speaking or writing. Crystal (1987) notes that prescriptivism is a perspective that chooses one of the interpretations of a language as the standard and extends it to the entire society. This variation is most often found in formal speech and literature. An alternative perspective is a descriptive approach based not on standards but on the actual situation. The proponent of this method simply describes the facts of linguistic variousness (Crystal, 1987). They act as an observer, not constrained by the official framework.Although these methods are opposite in meaning, each of them can be applied in the appropriate context. Crystal
(1987) notes that exploring these methods often leads to an unrealistic depiction of the opposite side, the formation of prejudice and confrontation. However, both approaches should exist together, combining the positive aspects of each other. While the prescriptive approach allows the design of society to be arranged, the descriptive approach allows the recording of real language changes (Crystal, 1987). This, in turn, allows combining logic and the natural order of things.However, not all language changes are received positively due to misconceptions. The clearest example is the belief that change means deterioration, as the old generation constantly complains (Crystal, 1987). In addition, language changes are associated with a decline in the quality of education and the negative impact of the media. Nevertheless, the author selects sufficient counterarguments to all
Delegation is the key to success in any type of organization, yet it can be a serious problem in church management. Many ministry leaders, used to working independently, find it hard to imagine that others can handle tasks more effectively. However, as the church grows, it is impossible to do without the help of additional church staff or volunteers. When leaders perform all tasks alone, their energies are spent on tasks that are not part of their duties (Kouzes & Posner, 2017). This decreases the effectiveness of church leadership, which is not acceptable. This problem is all the more urgent when the church leaders are not experienced and young. They may think they have the energy to manage all areas, but the reality is that multitasking can quickly
stress them out. To solve the problem outlined, it will be optimal to use a systematic approach characterized by a full analysis of the situation and making rational decisions based on it.Key stakeholders are senior pastoral leadership, specific church leadership (elders, deacons), and volunteer leaders appointed to participate in the delegation process. When delegating responsibilities to others, it is necessary to explain to them what is expected of them and, in addition, to define their responsibilities in detail. The optimal solution is to provide a culture of empowerment in which leaders quickly encourage and empower employees and volunteers to participate in various initiatives.Young leaders often provoke the situation when they perform too many tasks. They are happy to help employees because such demand creates the illusion of their
indispensability, value, authority, and trust on the part of the team. Inexperienced leaders do not leave time to tackle higher-level and higher-priority tasks by getting involved in every problem. The leader may take it upon himself to solve the employee’s problems, justifying his actions with his incompetence. However, such motives also lead to the trap of reverse delegation. In such a situation, it is better to assign responsibility for the task to an employee who can solve it under the guidance of a more experienced team member.The essence of a proper delegation is to plan the task and organize the work process to achieve the goals as quickly and efficiently as possible. The problem of excessive workload can lead to quick burnout of the manager, frustration with the
subordinates, or simply a dulling of attention. This leads to a decrease in the motivation of subordinates and a decline in the efficiency of their work. Inexperienced leaders risk falling into the trap of reverse delegation: when they will be forced to do the work for a subordinate himself in the end. At the same time, the volume of tasks, the solution of which is left to the leader, is constantly growing. The diagram below illustrates the key reasons why delegation problems arise (Figure 1).Figure 1: Fishbone DiagramBad leadership is costly to companies that profit from their operations. For example, employee turnover costs $5,500 per employee (Bartram, 2019). It costs a quarter of a million dollars per year in a company of 250 people (Bartman, 2019). Certainly, in
the case of a church, these financial numbers have little applicability, but the purpose of its existence is to attract followers. If inexperienced leaders make fatal leadership mistakes, decreased attendance and less employee satisfaction with their time in the church are expected.The 5 Whys method will be appropriate to solve the problem of delegation. The first question is, why does the delegation problem arise? The answer is that this issue emerges because of ineffective management. The second question is, why is ineffective management common in churches? Mistakes arise from the inexperience of employees and their lack of knowledge of key leadership principles. The third question is, why is it important to delegate in the church? This mechanism is necessary because it allows for more effective management of the
to others, church leaders are actually allowing them to serve. Knowledgeable leaders achieve better results by calling on people with diverse talents and abilities to help them. The ability to delegate to another creates space for joint discussion, for collegial work. And this is precisely the skill, the effort, because, without humility, it is impossible to participate in a dialogue. Without delegating, it is impossible to let the other participant in the collaborative process share his or her vision and knowledge. Delegation of authority can improve the functioning of the church and make it easier to serve young leaders who do not yet have all the skills needed for successful leadership.
Changes in the global management paradigm have affected one of the most important components of management – the leadership process. The technological and information revolution has led to the fact that most businesses have the ability to scale their activities to a global scale. This gave the leaders, on the one hand, the opportunity to enter global markets. On the other hand, it led to the need to design business changes in such a way that the company was ready to win against an unlimited number of competitors at every stage of development. This implies the first requirement for a future business leader: a company mission that does not provide for the pursuit of global leadership will not lead to success. Therefore, the design of change should be
The concept of leadership is an integral element in the system of international relations, which largely determines the course of the world’s political and economic processes. According to Ratanjee (2021), “the topic of developing a global mindset and exposing leaders to multicountry and multicultural experiences is gaining increasing interest” (pp. 2). It is clear that transformational leadership in the leadership process is strongly suggested for future leaders. Bonsu and Evans (2018) state that “embracing cross-cultural transformational leadership is strategic to business growth in an era of globalization, efficiency in technology and information dissemination, and parity of education and skills” (p. 50). With discernment and charisma, transformational leaders are able to inspire those around them to change their expectations and motivations in order to move towards higher goals.
Goals and objectives outline desired outcomes and, thus, are often used interchangeably. However, the effect, timeframe, and specificity of the two terms set them apart. Nickels et al. (2019) define goals as broad and long-term outcomes that an organization seeks, while objectives define the measurable, specific, and short-term strategies for attaining the identified goal. For example, the criminal justice system uses goals to task the police, correctional agencies, and the court with the strategy to execute, including deterrence, rehabilitation, retribution, restoration, and incapacitation. Therefore, the criminal justice system particularly addresses criminal behavior with the objective of protecting people’s rights.In an era of rapid change, diversity, and complexity, leadership and management are critical to the survival of any agency. Besides, the ability to lead and manage strongly permeates every
Robert Putnam makes the case that the United States has lost social capital and civil society over the last quarter-century after explaining the importance of social capital and civil society in democratic societies. Tocqueville during his visit to America said, “Americans of all ages, all stations in life, and all types of disposition are forever forming associations. There are not only commercial and industrial associations in which all take part, but others of a thousand different types—religious, moral, serious, futile, very general and very limited, immensely large and very minute…. Nothing, in my view, deserves more attention than the intellectual and moral associations in America” (Putmann, 2000, p. 65). Even though Putnam admits that determining the significance of a few countertrends without additional research is difficult, he concludes
that critical factors such as social trust are eroding at an alarming rate in the United States. He then goes into great detail about this erosion, and he concludes by outlining the research required to investigate these theories thoroughly.This important book demonstrates that social capital decreased dramatically in the United States after the mid-to-late-1960s due to generational succession, the rise of television and urban sprawl, and the increasing demands placed on people’s time and money, among other factors. Numerous social problems have been implicated from the same, and as a result, ranging from poor educational outcomes to economic stress and tensions between and among social groups. The most likely solution to this problem is to re-establish social capital in the manner of the Progressive Era but using contemporary
approaches.Societal norms of reciprocity and trustworthiness have developed due to the accumulation of social capital, defined as “connections among individuals’ social networks.” Social capital is regarded as having the same value as physical and human capital. In the same way, social networks are regarded as having the same value (Putnam, 2020, p. 19). According to the author of Bowling Alone, there has been a decline in social capital in contemporary America. The book investigates the causes and consequences of this decline and potential solutions.According to Putnam, there is a critical distinction between social capital that bridges everyone and bonds bind everyone together, including only those people. Outward-facing networks, as opposed to inward-facing networks primarily concerned with their members, are more likely to contain more inclusive social capital networks.
social capital might restrict freedom and equal opportunity must be considered for this project to be successful. Because social capital is often easily created when it is in opposition to something or someone else. It is imperative to develop bonding social capital, which is unfortunately much more accessible to develop than other types of social capital. It is necessary for those who are oppressed to build bridges of social capital to advance through increased generalized norms of reciprocity to achieve greater social mobility. Readers are required to develop new forms of social capital that are not currently available to complete Putnam’s final challenge.
Leadership is one of the most significant aspects of advanced nursing, included in most educational programs’ curriculum and inevitably occurred in practice. Indeed, solving a problem identified in a healthcare organization enables a practitioner to develop convincing arguments to encourage others to take actionEast Orange General Hospital, create plans and execute them, and evaluate the efficiency of interventions (Hickey & Giardino, 2021). In my practicum site, East Orange General Hospital, the problem of the impoverished population’s refusal to attend the follow-up visits with their doctor has been recently identified. Consequently, my practice hours completion is focused on creating interventions and solutions to the issue, and creating a plan with proper strategies is vital for success. This paper aims to explore the project management design and leadership styles appropriate
for the efficient addressing of the issue of the impoverished population skipping the follow-up appointments.The problem of the impoverished beneficiaries who do not attend their follow-up visits is critical for the East Orange General Hospital because most patients represent that population, and their behavior negatively influences the services’ quality. Skipped appointments are severe for the organizations because they reduce efficiency, increase costs, and waste the previous treatment results (Dantas et al., 2018). The issue must be addressed on the healthcare organization’s end with the practitioners, physicians, and administrators involved. The initiative’s implementation requires an execution design that includes diverse leadership approaches and project management techniques where multiple activities can be performed and evaluated simultaneously. The SMART objectives and evidence-based practice implementation are the design approaches for creating a
project to address the problem of impoverished patients skipping their follow-up visits (Sipes, 2020). For instance, the objectives must be formulated based on the recent evidence, with the related actions necessary to achieve them.The strategy’s focus is the population that needs an intervention to change their behavior towards attending the doctor. As the beneficiaries interact with their physicians, nurses, and administrators, a change in their practice is required to decrease the number of missed follow-up visits. The Statement of Work (SOW) must include separate action plans for each stakeholder; thus, the leadership styles to address them can vary (Sipes, 2020). In interaction with the administrators, autocratic execution is appropriate as they must follow the action plan to achieve results (Spiva et al., 2021). In contrast, physicians aware of
aspects of their patient’s life and health conditions can use different influence tactics; therefore, the leadership style suitable for them is transformational. Nursing practitioners’ role in the project is to communicate with the impoverished population and encourage them to change behavior towards attending the follow-up visit. Consequently, they would benefit from the visionary leadership style through which the person in charge would support their willingness to impact patient outcomes.Several practice changes must be implemented to address the issue of the East Orange General Hospital’s impoverished patients misattending their follow-up visits. Patient education performed by a physician should explain the importance of the additional appointment and the consequences of skipping it (White et al., 2021). Nursing practitioners can influence patients’ decision-making by discussing the priorities of the impoverished population
representatives and sharing information about the costs of treatment that a timely follow-up visit could prevent. From the administrators’ perspective, practice change includes new protocols of notification, such as the increased number of SMS and phone calls.The barriers to successful project management and realization are uncertain hospital attendance policies frequently updated in the East Orange General Hospital due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Furthermore, the patients’ reaction to practice change is unknown and might result in adjusting all execution strategies and the project’s activities (Sloane et al., 2018). A plan facilitator with various actions and participants must be the one with access to all units and authority among the stakeholders (White et al., 2021). My preceptor was willing to develop and execute the agenda; thus, they took the role.The
project’s success depends on how the entire team will deal with the barriers, the facilitators’ ability to notice and address the issue timely, and the execution’s efficiency. Indeed, in the case of the COVID-19 lockdowns or other side reasons for the impoverished population’s inability to visit the hospital, physicians, practitioners, and administrators would be forced to change their activities. The autocratic leadership style would be beneficial for the latter to change their follow-up notifications or switch by following the new instructions (Sipes, 2020). Transformational relationships between the executors and physicians would allow the doctors to create individualized tactics to reach patients, such as telemedicine recently adopted in several East Orange General Hospital units. Lastly, the visionary leadership style applied to nursing practitioners will help them keep trying to
The healthcare setting typically incorporates a plethora of factors that cause nurses significant stress. Specifically, nurses must manage very tight schedules, handle a tremendous amount of information, and tend to the needs of a large number of patients. The need to provide constant support to patients and ensure that they receive emotional support has necessitated the development of coping mechanisms that shield nurses form stress to an extent. Learned optimism, which can be defined as a conscious effort to recognize pessimistic ideas and choose not to be consumed by them is one of such responses.At first glance, learned optimism might seem as an artificial attempt at avoiding confrontation with real-life concerns. However, on further inspection, especially after considering the challenges that nurses must confront regularly in the workplace,
one will have to recognize the need for a tool that allows nurses to keep their resilience (Chang & Daly, 2015). In this respect, learned optimism as the means of keeping one’s composure and maintaining a positive outlook in the settings that involve high levels of stress and pressure is vital for maintaining mental and emotional well-being.Therefore, as a coping mechanism for managing stress levels in the workplace, learned optimism allows a nurse to avoid a range of complications associated with mental health. For example, the use of learned optimism an as coping mechanism for stress management can prevent a workplace burnout from developing. In turn, workplace burnouts currently represent a major threat for nurses due to the continuous rise in the number of patients and the extent
of workload. Therefore, the application of learned optimism as the means of releasing tension and reducing stress rates leads to a drop in the probability of a burnout (Kahlert & Brand, 2017).Finally, one must mention the positive effects that learned optimism has on the emotional well-being of nurses. Due to emotional exhaustion, working in the healthcare setting implies dealing with devastation that may lead to emotional numbness (Chang & Daly, 2015). The specified outcome is particularly dangerous for nurses since providing emotional response and being empathetic to the needs of patients is one of the facets of a nurse’s workplace performance and, thus, one of the key requirements to meet. In turn, with the rise in the levels of a workplace burnout, a nurse is unlikely to meet
to them is emotionally taxing and often devastating. Therefore, the strategies that allow managing their mental health more effectively, particularly, the ones related to meditation, contribute to nurses’ psychological and emotional well-being to a major extent. Since learning optimism as the coping strategy that allows nurses to keep their spirits high helps to avoid the described concerns, it should be recognized for the benefits that it provides to nurses.
The legal issue of consent is quite an interesting topic for discussion. The main aspect of this concept is consent, which plays an important role in this process. To study this aspect, the Georgia vs case can be applied. Randolph, which affects the seizure of evidence without approval from the suspect. This work also explores what exceptions, in addition to the absence of a concent from a search warrant, can be applied to computers or other high-tech evidence.Before proceeding to the consideration of cases related to digital information, it is necessary to understand what Georgia v. Rudolf case is. The accused was accused by his wife of using narcotic substances and the woman promised to provide evidence of the accusations that were in their common house. However, if
the spouse consented to the search of the property, the man refused and resisted him. Thus, the police got access to the necessary evidence, which was later collected after receiving the order and the husband was accused of cocaine possession. However, the court ruled that since the wife had no recognized authority in the law to give consent, she gave the police no more grounds for justifying entry than they would have had in the absence of any consent at all. Thus, there was a violation of the Fourth Amendment, and the compensation claims of the state were not summed up to outweigh it.The Fourth Amendment, which is the central legislative concept in this case, prohibits unreasonable searches and detentions. Moreover, it implies the issuance of search warrants
only if they are issued by a court with sufficient grounds. However, research shows that “the Supreme Court has never explained what makes an expectation of privacy reasonable, and scholars regularly complain that this standard is incomprehensible and unworkable” (Tokson, 2020, p. 1). Therefore, if we apply this aspect to Internet technologies and electronic information of a person, the police cannot obtain this information without the direct consent of the accused. This also applies to the fact that the security authorities cannot follow the consent of the roommates or neighbors, since these proofs are not their personal property.Moreover, thus, it can be concluded that the seizure of evidence is lawful with the permission of one person, when another, who will try to hide them and at the same
time is present at the scene and clearly refuses to give consent illegally. The Fourth Amendment supports the fact of unauthorized actions for the uncoordinated acquisition of digital information and without a court order with the necessary amount of substantiated evidence.Therefore, using the case of Georgia v. Rudolph (2006) as an example, it can be concluded that law enforcement agencies, with assistance, can seize the necessary evidence on electronic media without consequences for the Fourth Amendment. The Fourth Amendment gives people the right to be secure in their houses and papers (Garrett & Stoughton, 2017). This is an inherent right that balances the governments need to investigate criminal activity while preventing unnecessary and unwarranted police intrusions. However, it is a limited right and is not applied to all
searches and seizures. Furthermore, it is a personal right and can be claimed only by the person who is the subject of the search.On the other hand, the amendment prohibits unreasonable searches and considers many circumstances at the same time. An example would be the case United States v. Verdugo-Urquidez as a reasonable justification for the search, a set of circumstances were given and the assistance and cooperation of foreign agents was emphasized (Bailey, 2018). The Fourth Amendment in this instance did not have its force in relation to the search of property belonging to a non-resident alien and located in another country. An exception in the absence of content may be the assumption by law enforcement agencies of the validity and evidence of their actions in accordance
The phrase that caught me most from the video is from Isaiah, stating that Samuel has taught him that one person can play t-ball and hit it hard when sitting down. This is a powerful statement indicating that people can be prejudiced despite having good intentions. Samuel’s family did not realize the struggles disabled people go through before he was born (PinehurstPictures, 2010). The child’s image hitting the t-ball also showcased a powerful issue, that disabled individuals should be treated similarly to other people and given equal opportunities to give them the chance to perform optimally.I was intrigued to see children like Nathanial Orellana learning in a normal classroom. His mother determined they sought school actively to ensure he received the best care considering his autism (PinehurstPictures, 2010).
Parents face a myriad of extra challenges raising disabled children to give them advantages that would help them compete with their peers in society. The video illustrates that communities and the government should provide parents with a variety of schools to determine the best for their child’s disability.Children with disabilities require special care but should be allowed to interact with others if their illness would not worsen based on these connections. Engagement is a crucial tool for child development as it requires them to be attentive and active, propagating greater achievement due to increased enthusiasm. Nathanial raises his hand to answer a question because each student is engaged in the classroom. His enthusiasm to answer the question shows interest and a desire to learn, traits associated with high
In this aspect, people without developmental problems may not see the issues they face and should work hard to help them optimally function in society. Keith Jones also showcases an important faction of society. He claims that individuals should not expect children to develop good social skills if they stay for eight hours in a classroom without adequate interaction (PinehurstPictures, 2010). It is crucial to recognize that inclusion would work well if children were given a chance to interact frequently despite their differences.
Songs of Song is a depiction of the value, beauty, and meaning of work and love between a man and a woman. The Song relays stories of an ideal image of family, work, and life by showcasing lovers who court, marry, and then work. King Solomon, who is the author of the Song, explicitly communicated the themes of hardship, pleasure, beauty, joy, passion, diligence, and family.At the beginning of the Song, a woman is expressing her love for her man. While at it she also informs that her skin has become dark as a result of hard work in the family vineyard. She says that her brothers made her work hard there. Although this Song is about love, one cannot fail to notice that work is also given
center stage. In addition, dark skin had a different meaning from the present-day racial connotation. Dark skin was used to describe people who toiled in the sun for economic reasons. Perhaps, they were mostly the peasants who ranked low in the economic hierarchy. In this Song, however, the woman’s beauty has not diminished by hard work. As she puts it in Song 1:5, “Dark am I, yet lovely,” King James Version. Moreover, the woman is not regretting her job for it has prepared her for the future when she expects to tender for her own vineyard as well (Song 8:12). Later, she will leave her brothers and get married and have her own vineyard.In many civilizations, work has always been construed as an enemy of beauty. However, the
biblical perspective brought out through the Song depicts work as an essential beauty. Not only does King Solomon builds a palanquin for himself, but the Song also praises the loveliness of workmanship. Thus, as expressed in Song 3:10, it is a labor of love. Ultimately, the Song reiterates that apart from being a means to an economic end, work is also a foundation of aesthetic ingenuity.In the Song, the woman is in pursuit of her beloved, a man whom she describes to be the finest of men. She receives information from her friends that the man is at his obvious place of work where he is shepherding sheep. His work, however, does not make it hard to interact with her. The arrangement of their work allows them to
freely interact as a family. This is in contrast to how work is today where family interaction time is dictated by job demands and an employer’s goodwill.The man and the woman proclaim their devotion to each other through the Song. He intones of her impeccable beauty and she sings how madly she is in love with him. When springtime arrives, they both sing in its glory and he invites her over to his place. In ancient Israel, springtime was a time to work on the farms. It was the time when crops were pruned to guarantee good harvests. It was also during this time that the young grapes were more attractive to foxes and animals. The two lovers, thus, find joy in chasing the foxes away from the
farms. This is a glorious picture of finding pleasure and happiness at work.A keen observer will notice that this form of work is in contradiction to what God told Adam in Genesis 3:17-19. After the man had sinned against God, He cursed the ground and commanded that food will only be produced from it after painful toil. It is evident from this verse that this was not God’s original meaning of work. Therefore, the kind of work elaborated in Song is an exemplification of how God desires people to live and work. It is a fulfillment of Isaiah’s, “They will build houses and dwell in them; they will plant vineyards and eat their fruit” (Isaiah 65:21). This is an indication that God’s kingdom does not mean that work
Most people during the Victorian era valued the virtues of society. Victorians believed that they were fixed and certain as guiding behavior to people all the time. The virtues included morals that one can be judged according to his behavior. Any betrayal of ethical standards was termed lousy behavior and could deserve punishment. These beliefs have become misguided, undesirable, and inappropriate in modern America (Schlereth, 2018). They have shifted to values that no longer have classical ideas of wisdom, justice, courage, or cleanliness (p. 691). They have become sexual connotation where people practice prostitution and other immoral behaviors.In previous years, there were low rates of crimes that have continued to rise. Victorians practiced moral principles in their lives, which maintained good morals and behavior. Currently, morals have changed
and translated to destructive behaviors that contribute to higher rates of crimes (Schlereth, 2018). Victorian speaks about morality and the best ways of devising it. In modern America, a character has been substituted, and most youths indulge in immoral behavior.In the Victorian era, women were illiterate, immigrants were not socializing with others, while now women are educated, and immigrants share ideas with natives. Men used to work for wages and get involved in politics while women engaged in domestic work and childrearing. In literature, each era had a different theme according to the way we understand life (p. 693). The Victorian era focused on industrialization, imperialism, domesticity, and cultural identity (Schlereth, 2018). Modern literature focused on the theme of loss, despair, and politics. Victorian era, most people were
Christian and valued religion heavily compared to the current American.The Victorian era and modern American have similarities in how the people live in the two ages. In the two generations, people practiced moral behavior cherishing virtues in society. The two value the social, economic, and political life, and the individuals participate in them (Schlereth, 2018). The eras impacted the world of literature and changed people’s lives on how they see literature (p. 695). For example, Elizabeth Barrett Browning wrote a poem, ‘The cry of the children’, which has a message about industrialization on child labor. The poem narrates child labor which had become popular due to new machines and workplaces. All people were able to socialize during the Victorian era to learn formal and informal skills. Most people
get involved in literature where they write poems that could talk of their current situations and life experiences.The Victorian and modern American eras have impacted changes to human life. For example, in England, the rate of indictable offences reduced by 50% and the population grew from 19 million to 33 million, the number of crimes reduced from 92000 to 81000. The people learned moral values and the virtues that correspond to better social, economic, and political life. In the two eras, men and women understood their roles, learned formal and informal skills, and could interact and socialize. People developed morals, and they were hardworking and successful in business. The Victorian era brought change, innovation, and invention that contributed to current technological advancements.The modern American misses a lot from
The article’s thesis statement is supported by the further reading authors investigating the case of a strange change in Professor Wilson’s lifestyle. Indeed, the reasoning behind such a decision was complex, and it includes elements of achieving maximum sustainability in the tiniest space possible. In addition, the article mentions that he shares his experiences during the nights when his ecology-focused students are invited to stay in the dumpster with him.The article caught my attention with a few details. First of all, the scenario where a respected scholar lives in the dumpster reminded me of an Ancient Greek philosopher Diogenes who lived in the barrel. Hence, it was interesting to investigate the topic and find if there are any similarities between the two. Furthermore, giving personal details and the
the interior of the dumpster does not look that bad, and the best thing is that Wilson is able to lay there comfortably. Therefore, personally, living in a dumpster is an option for times when I feel like I need to be alone. But lack of commodities associated with the home kitchen and bathroom is why I could not choose the dumpster as a place of my permanent residence.
Both lookism and extreme body modification are inherently linked to unhealthy and unrealistic beauty standards of modern society. This trait aside, however, the two are very different in its manifestations and direct consequences. Lookism is merely the act of considering someone whose appearance is not what most people would regard to be beautiful. It focuses on exhibiting negative judgement to people that do not fit the standard and is thus oriented outside of the person who engages in it. Extreme body modification is the act of changing one’s body in order to look in a way that deviates from the norms that society sets on appearance (Good, 2016). To contrast these two, one does not look pleasing in appearance, while the other intentionally marks oneself in ways that
Customer loyalty is a positive perception of the company and its products. The loyalty ladder is the structural model that implies the different levels of customer engagement in the selling process of a company’s products (Gerami & Vahid Yazdanian, 2018). Usually, the researchers define five levels of customer loyalty: suspects, prospects, customers, clients, and advocates (Gerami & Vahid Yazdanian, 2018). The loyalty ladder is an efficient tool to establish long-term relationships with clients. Different companies apply various marketing strategies to move customers from one level of the ladder to another.A loyal customer predominantly buys goods and services from only one brand, not paying attention to its competitors’ offers. Such a customer is the main driving force of the business, in the long run, helping to build a positive
image of the company and advertising it for free in his inner circle. Therefore, creating a loyal customer base and assessing customer loyalty is a top priority for a company that plans to remain in demand on the market for a long time.In today’s e-business, the loyalty ladder is exceptionally vital in attracting customers online. The e-marketing strategies allow more advanced methods to build efficient loyalty programs. For the analysis of the practical appliance of the loyalty ladder, two brands of organic cosmetics were chosen: Pacifica and Annmarie. Both retailers provide online opportunities and loyalty programs for customers. Considering their activities from the perspective of customer loyalty, the brands’ programs aim at different ladder levels. The first online brand, Pacifica, offers a digital gift card ( Digital gift
card , n.d.). A gift card of over 50 dollars in total is beneficial for the customers due to the random gift of over 75 dollars ( Digital gift card , n.d.). Thus, the card attracts new customers and benefits the current clients. Moreover, the cards have a thematic design relevant to many celebrations.The marketing strategy used by the brand aims at the recurrent buying of the customers. The program addresses the prospect’s and clients’ levels from the loyalty ladder perspective. However, it fails to establish the advocates’ relationships with the clients. Considering the variability of the brand, which can be found online, the strategy is poor in terms of long-time loyalty. The customer is not directly involved in the brand. Thereby, the chances of choosing other brands
The Prince, written by Nicholas Machiavelli, is an important contribution to the modern concept of politics. In a sense, this work contradicts the philosophical tradition of ancient political thought in which political practice is overshadowed by the idealization of governments and utopian cities. On the contrary, in Prince, Machiavelli (2014) establishes that the real implementation of politics implies real situations with real people whose behavior, decisions and actions usually are not necessarily moral. The main theme of “The Prince” by Machiavelli is monarchical rule and survival. This work was regarded as a guide for politicians on the use of ruthless, self-serving cunning and inspired the term “Machiavellian”. Machiavelli (2014) discusses in detail how a ruler should act in various situations or circumstances and establishes that the main goal
IntroductionIn the first section of the reading provided, various matters determine the human good. According to the book, one can be happy depending on the decisions made and actions taken regarding the choice made about an issue. For example, if one builds a house, they will feel happy, and if they also feel healthy, the aspect of good is also revealed. In other words, the writer is trying to help the reader navigate that the human good can be achieved under everything as long as the subject is affiliated with the person behind it. Human beings choose some of the factors to define their happiness and aspect of goodness (Aristotle 8). Most people choose general instruments of life such as wealth, flutes, and many others.Assessment of Important Issues,
Themes, and Concerns of the ReadingsComplete good is determined by self-sufficiency, which means a person will live according to the estimated limit when dealing with matters. The aspect of human good can be extended from one party to another, such as from parents to their children or friends to friends (Aristotle 8). According to the inner picture portrayed by the book, it seems human beings are structured in political, social, and economic settings that come in different formulas for achieving the common good. Happiness can be an agreeable subject, measured by what people feel concerning the completeness of human anatomy and general ways of living. Some elements such as the interdependence that people have with the environment can be associated with human good. Therefore, what is spoken or
conveyed during sensitive societal settings defines the completeness of human beings (Aristotle 9). For example, if one is educated and has the roots of success, it means that the people who have been backing the person may benefit from the same, hence building the goodness more.The sketch of good can be drawn by showing what one has and what one lacks. The degree to which people seem to be satisfied by normal happenings such as rainfall, weather changes, and relationships with others can be a measure of good (Aristotle 9). A carpenter example is given to show the extent of discipline they have when it comes to measurements. In this matter, people have to do what appears more logical even if it may not be what they wish.
These factors will be a limit to human beings, and they show the restrictions that are important in life.Some questions may arise from this context, and the reader may be baffled by the issues discussed in the book. First, how possible is it for human beings to be good to everyone if every aspect of the common good is self-centered? Second, can all people be the same in terms of traits that make them happy? And if they must be happy and do human good, what about the deficits left more so the environment such as plants, pets, and world animals? Thus, interrogating such issues in one’s mind may help one understand the account of human good and life perspectives.Critical Analysis of the TextThe author has given a
defense of the account of the good by supporting it with various elements. The main idea here is that the conclusions that people make from given premises will be harmonized by the true accounts of the subject matter (Aristotle 10). The truth must be compromised with false, and therefore, the clash between the two variables is seen in terms of the reaction and outcome of the matter. To understand the human good that the writer is talking about, people must think about the external, bodily, and soul perspectives. These three elements may notably categorize the metrics that can define the accounts of good in human life (Aristotle 10). The soul is often considered to offer a full account of the good from what people reason and decide to
do with their reasoning.The author means that the soul is more powerful than the body in that the cognition of the account or the outcome of a task is articulated from the soul. It is important not to overlook the body as the doer. The context brought to light is that accounts of human goods are structured and reasoned by the soul before getting to the external perspectives. Happiness is a form of justifying the accounts of human good since many consider it a virtue (Aristotle 12). For example, if one is asleep or ill, they may not be feeling happy about it as some consider sleeping a measure of laxity while others say that illness is brought by evil. In short, human beings must engage in societal
frameworks that define the ways of living, and the cultural essence is felt significantly at this point.Active people always feel happy about the level of engagement they have daily. For example, a person working in a busy food outlet may feel pleased by the nature of their job for various reasons. First, it enables them not to see a long day and keeps them focused and developing their minds and souls. Second, the personal interactions with the guests during food and beverage service may make them learn various aspects of life (Aristotle 12). Hence, they may feel like they have a significant role in teaching others the same. These factors make people happy, and they are considered the root sources of human good.Happiness is achieved in various ways,
according to the text. By reading the topic well, indeed, one may not be able to differentiate whether happiness is achieved by learning or habituation (Aristotle 12). To elaborate on this matter, it is more reasonable to say that it is cultivated from both. Here, a reader has to understand a critical point on this note. First, creating own happiness is a way learned from life exploration. Second, habits that one has grown with may be a determining factor in achieving happiness. For example, if one knew that going to church is one way of becoming morally stable in society, then such people may be active in religion as they feel it strengthens their human good. By this point, it will be true to say that they have
achieved happiness from habituation.Though, by keenly reading the book, one may wonder why happiness was not given as the super element of human good, assuming that it is a gift from God (Aristotle 11). This question probes one to investigate the possibility of having achievements that may not make one happy. The other concern from the topic is the level of happiness that one has to achieve, given that it can be a matter of self-efficacy and sociological well-being. The issue of fortune is a contentious matter at twilight since the book may not unveil the natural state of fineness that can be entrusted to bring human good.While reading the topic, it is clear that happiness is an activity of the soul, as mentioned earlier in this essay.
Some goods determine the necessary conditions for happiness. The writer means that if one is healthy, wealthy, or successful, one can be triggered by the inner spirit from the soul to feel happy (Aristotle 14). These accounts of goods in human anatomy make it possible to achieve happiness. The political setting in the current society makes people express their happiness, and therefore, the metrics involved may be as forms of human goods. For example, diplomatic tensions probe people to start analyzing the power a given country has over the other. This, people, become happy when they notice their side is winning while the other party is losing.Similarly, a successful person may not be prosperous in matters in life, and that at some point, levels the human way of
living hence, creating ways for people to experience good. If one had a breakthrough almost in whatever undertaking they came across, but they fail in the end, no one can say they die while happy (Aristotle 14). Therefore, the author means that happiness must be simultaneous with life aspects driven by cultural and ethical cues.There is concern about whether a human being may be happy during their lifetime through the book. For a reader to understand this, they must think about whether it is possible for one to be happy every time. According to the facts of life, the dead knows nothing, and therefore, they cannot feel happy when they do not live anymore. That brings the focus on whether or not human beings can be happy during
their lifetime. It is important to consider the matters that make one happy and the duration in which the issues last to answer the question. For example, if one lived in blessings that made their life to be bright, it means at that point they were happy, and they had been satisfied by the human good.However, these kinds of people may at one point suffer from misfortune or unfortunate event that distorts their happiness significantly. From the understanding of the chapter, it is normal to experience both evil and good when one is living (Aristotle 15). Therefore, human beings can never be happy all their lifetime due to the uncertainties that come from time to time. However, a significant portion of human life is characterized by happiness from
is the relationship between human good and social well-being. Does it mean that it is difficult to have everyone happy and satisfied in their life? And if it is hard to please everyone, what measure of human good or the level of the subject can neutralize life situations so that everyone is happy? From researching the above elements, it will be easy to establish human good that drives people towards happiness and breakthrough in life.
Levels of culture can be displayed in different planes and depths. According to Edgar Shein, who developed the concept ‘levels of organizational culture,’ and Edward Granter who later expanded on this concept, the culture of the entity can be seen in four levels: super-structural, symbolic, discursive, and cognitive (Granter, 2019). In other words, the levels of culture in enterprises are developed due to external economic and social influences, artifacts such as logos, story rituals and events, values explicitly expressed by the organization, and underlying assumptions. This paper aims to assess the levels of organizational culture for Macomb Community College.Artifacts in Macomb Community College show that it promotes concentration, attentiveness, and responsibility, which is reflected in the logo. Looking at the architecture of the buildings, some of which use
chrome-plated modern high-tech structures, one can assume that technology and science are the main focus of educational programs. Nonetheless, the central older building and a park with large trees create an atmosphere of solitude and introspection, which is more in line with the study of fine arts and social sciences. Equally important, the college has a high culture of mutual help and respect and cherishes community relations, which is reflected in the developed bus route system available to students.On the value level, many signs within the college, including parking signs, library signs, and other clues, point to a love of order and organization. Probably in this college, teachers appreciate the composure and commitment shown by students. On the level of assumptions, the college probably seeks to avoid accepting
The story of King Uruk, or Gilgamesh, is widely recognized as the first known explanation of the relationship between humans and gods. In other words, The Epic of Gilgamesh is the first mention of mythology in our world. To be more exact, the piece’s primary focus is on King Uruk’s transformation from a horrible ruler to a kind one when he is forced to face mortality.As stated, the main character of this story is the King of Uruk, who now serves as a reminder that in the early times, humans used to feel the same as we did. According to Anneberg Learner (2021), this writing is older than Bible since it is “four thousand years old in its oldest form.” Therefore, The Epic of Gilgamesh describes the life
humanized by the prostitute sent by the gods. Still, one fatal mistake of Enkidu and Gilgamesh leads to the first’s inevitable death, and when the King of Uruk realizes that his friend is dead, he starts seeking immortality.Overall, the story’s main idea is that the gods created immortality only for themselves, while humans will always be followed by death. Eventually, as Gilgamesh’s chance to live forever was stolen by a serpent, he finally realized his treasure, knowing the past and ability to return back to his city. At the end of the story, the town survives its ruler, which is why such a powerful message leads to the human population remembering it ever since.
Motivation is the process whereby an individual’s endeavors are stimulated, guided, and maintained toward achieving a goal. Thus, the responsibility of management is to monitor and direct workers in a company (Usmonovich, 2021). This is required since it is a method of inducing individuals to work, which they are capable and equipped to do freely. Even though most people have to work for a livelihood and a job is an essential part of everyone’s lives, administrators must be apprehensive about employee motivation concerns for various reasons. Managers have several valid reasons to be concerned about motivating employees.Firstly, individual success in a company is viewed as a product of talent and inspiration. Additionally, the ability is influenced by education, expertise, and learning, and its development is a difficult and
This tote is perfect for mothers with teenage children who are constantly on the go but want to look stylish while doing errands and during family activities. It is high-end yet durable and keeps the owner’s personal belongings organized in a portable and secure way, making it easier to get outside in the shortest time.Product SelectionAccording to the survey data, in the target audience, the most popular brands are Channel, Pucci, and Kate Shade. Therefore, the audience is torn between products in which the quality matches the price and luxury products with unreasonable prices. In order to justify the high-end price, it might be helpful to use a high-quality leather material and equip the bag with extra pockets for organized storage, as most luxury bags miss that feature.
Marx’s thesis on the fetishism of commodities focuses on society’s tendency to place value on commodities based on contributed labor, which inevitably causes domination of the products over people. Furthermore, the fetishism affects the social interactions between the customer and producer: the valued objects are independently exchanged for the respective purposes. Such exchanges of objects occur independently of human needs or decisions (Ritzer, 2011). In this case, it is essential to note that the term fetishism does not suggest any sexual connotations; it only explains people’s inclination to devote themselves to the mentioned principles.In modern society, we have fetishized technological trends in the same way that Marx’s thesis suggests. For example, Apple products are known to be highly appreciated for their “high-quality” and “accessibility”. The labor that goes
system become disconnected from their actual worth.Marx’s thesis fails to explore how a commodity gains its value purely from the amount of labor included in the process. This could be outlined as a critical disadvantage to the thesis, as it ignores a central perspective that aid in changing the materialistic values of society. Another detail that was not mentioned in Marx’s work is related to the nature of commodities, why some are more valued than others. Still, the Manifesto of the Communist Party and Marx’s thesis provide a solid foundation for analyzing modern socio-economic relations.
Mary Breckinridge was a strong individual who, despite all her suffering and terrible losses, dedicated her life to helping people and preventing others from experiencing the disasters that she had encountered. During her lifetime, she made a tremendous impact in the development of nursing and medical research. These are the reasons why I want to write about Mary Breckinridge and her achievements.Mary Breckinridge was born February 17, 1881, in Memphis, Tennessee, but raised in many places, including Kentucky, New York, and even St. Petersburg, since her father was a congressman and U.S Minister to Russia (Breckinridge, 2021). In 1904, after her first husband died, she decided to become a nurse (Breckinridge, 2021). Mary still tried to create a family afterward, and after ten years of nursing, she retired
and gave birth to a son and a daughter from her second husband (Breckinridge, 2021). However, the tragedies continued to follow Mary, and her children died soon after the birth (Breckinridge, 2021). After the disasters, she left her husband and volunteered as a nurse in World War I, finally deciding to devote her life to saving lives (Breckinridge, 2021). After the war, Mary worked mainly in Kentucky and continued her education at the Teachers College of Columbia University in New York City (Breckinridge, 2021). In 1923, she went to England to study at the British Hospital for Mothers and Babies to become a qualified midwife (Breckinridge, 2021). Also, in 1925, she established a private charitable organization, the Frontier Nursing Service (FNC), which significantly decreased both maternal and infant
impact on midwifery and nursing education continued even after her death. Today, people from around the world come to the FNC School of Midwifery and Family Nursing to study her model of rural health and social service delivery (Brewer, 2018).It is hard not to admire Mary Breckinridge for her contribution to nursing, despite all the tragedies she encountered. Even after losing her kids, Mary did not let the disaster break her spirit but devoted herself to reducing suffering from other people’s lives. I truly believe that everyone can learn from her example.
The introduction of new levels of nursing education is a major reform that has contributed to the complexity of the field. Traditionally, nursing schools provided degrees of a Bachelor’s level associated with the basic skills required by this profession. However, today, aspiring nurses have access to high-quality Master’s programs that further develop their competencies. In this regard, a question may reasonably arise regarding the actual value of such degrees. In fact, Master’s programs in nursing are essential for healthcare, as they align with the growing importance of nurses and the contemporary view of the system. Bachelor’s degrees provide students with the basics of the profession, its fundamental concepts and practical skills. These aspects alone form a full-fledged, competent nurse who is capable of doing their job. In other
Mearsheimer justifies the reasons for Modern European war by the existence and disposition of poles of power, which affect the determination of states to engage in hostilities. He considers the multipolar system the most conducive to rivalry because states’ authority is not distributed evenly (Mearsheimer, 2014). Furthermore, it is most predisposed to instability, as relations between countries change from hostile to sociable and vice versa. Such frequent transformations contribute to the constant emergence of wars. Moreover, they prevent a rational assessment of the capabilities and intentions of adversaries.An unbalanced multipolarity is the most unbalanced form because it is characterized by a hegemon pursuing as much power as feasible. Other states are fearful of such urges, and therefore their policies can be more aggressive. Mearsheimer (2014) argues that wars
The question of whether media has any benefits in learning has been made and substantiated many times in the past. This has attracted a great debate, with some responders, such as Richard Clark, holding that instructional teaching methods influence learning and not media directly under any conditions. Similarly, the antagonists hold that media is molded into certain attributes of media, which instead influence learning (Clark, 1994).Various students apply these attributes of media as they are thought to enhance their cognitive process development. At the same time, protagonists such as Robert Kozma hold that media will influence learning through the application of technologies such as computers, telephones, and television in teaching and learning (Kozma, 1994). This paper, therefore, will explore Kozma’s perspective on the great media debate and provide
the rationale for why Kozma’s viewpoint is favorable.An instruction method links and enhances cognitive processes that are essential in achieving learning. Clark (1994) mentions that instructional technology seeks to evaluate the necessity and type of instructional method that is vital in providing psychological support to learners in the learning process. Clark’s argument on whether media contributes positively to learning introduces the economic perspective of media and its attributes.According to Clark (1994), on the replaceability challenge, Clark asserts that if various media or their attributes lead to the achievement of the same learning outcome, then the cheapest instructional method should be employed. Clark (1994) proceeds to argue that the replaceability test explains the ability to replace a different set of media or attributes with another that is less expensive,
although it leads to the attainment of similar learning results. Therefore, Clark’s argument that media has no effect on students’ learning outcomes can be justified.Kozma’s argument in the media debate brings about the concept of learning as a constructive, cognitive and social process. According to Kozma (1994), learning encompasses where learners utilize available materials to come up with new knowledge through interaction with the surroundings and integrating the new knowledge with that already in the memory. From this viewpoint, learning is perceived to be a result of integrating learners’ cognitive resources with their surrounding resources. Consequently, this brings up the concept of media and learning as the interacting force that fosters the relationship between learners’ cognitive resources and environmental resources.Media and media attributes have exemplary capabilities that enable
learners to achieve cognitive resources. According to Clark vs. Kozma (2018), two pieces of research pieces of evidence came up to demonstrate the effects of media on learning. These include the thinker tools and the Jasper Woodbury Series pieces of evidence. Clark (1994) explains that the Thinker Tools are used to teach force and motion problem solutions while the Jasper Woodbury Series are used to solve mathematically related problems. The Thinker Tools, which is a computer-based learning media according to Kozma (1994), introduces four phases; motivation, evolution, formalization, and transfer phases.The motivation phase asks the learners to predict the outcomes of forces acting upon objects in the real world, while the evolution phase pairs up the learners to solve problems presented in the motivation phase. In the formalization
phase, the learners have to come up with a law that explains the occurrence of their results. The transfer phase requires the learners to answer the questions asked in the motivation phase using the formulated law. The outcome of the interaction with thinker tools was compared with a control experiment of students using textbooks and traditional teaching methods (Kozma, 1994). Students who used Thinker Tools on evaluation had higher scores and significant improvement.Kozma’s argument on the Thinker Tools demonstrates the influence media has on learning. The computer presented dynamic elements that created representations of real-world objects (Kozma, 1994) and this helped the learners create a cognitive model of the objects. Similarly, the interaction with the computer, as it took learners’ input and processed it through moving the objects
evidence, Kozma concedes that careful integration of media in learning has positive implications as the learners can connect social contexts with real-world situations.The use of media in learning leads to the achievement of positive outcomes if the medium used is interrelated and confounding. Clark vs. Kozma (2018) avers that for media to influence learning effectively, the embedded instructional method must be appropriate to the educational media. The Thinker Tools and Jasper Woodbury Series projects observed significant learning outcomes as the computer’s capabilities and the video disk created mental representations. This enabled the integration of external resources into the cognitive processes, resulting in better problem-solving skills, retention, and knowledge comprehension.
In the case study, a subjective portion of the note provides a clear picture of the patient’s habitus, complaints, and anamnesis. However, it needs particularization about the last time the patient had unprotected sexual intercourse as it can help indicate the incubation period. The presence of similar skin defects at the patient’s recent sexual partners and the previous existence of similar skin defects on the patient’s skin and mucosae can define the duration of the disease and the episode number. The appearance of spread rash all over the patient’s body can indicate of duration and period of the disease. The intake of any medications, including antibiotics, for the last one month, can affect further diagnostics, tactics, and treatment plans; indicate fixed drug eruption. The patient’s anamnesis lacks gynecological
questioning on menstruation details, number of pregnancies and abortions, and pregnancy prophylaxis. It is also significant to specify the patient’s travel history for differential diagnosis of chancroid, lymphogranuloma venereum (LGV), and granuloma inguinale (Afzal, 2020).The objective notes should primarily include physical examination such as palpation of the lymph nodes because one of the significant signs of primary syphilis is regional lymphadenitis, and secondary syphilis manifests with systemic lymphadenopathy. The assessment of the skin and mucosae in the rectal area, periorbital space, mouth mucosa, examination per vaginam is also needed. Multiple chancres can occur if numerous sexual contacts with the contaminated partner during the recipient’s incubation period happened or if numerous locations of bacteria invasion during one sexual act took place. An attentive examination of oral mucosa can indicate
Behçet disease if the ulcers in the mouth are painful and correlate with uveitis, skin lesions, muscular and joint pain, gastrointestinal symptoms.The diagnostic tests should include tests for syphilis (VDRL together with darkfield microscopy or direct fluorescent antibody test), polymerase chain reaction (PCR) for HSV, DNA amplification tests for chancroid, and LGV (Roett, 2020). The last instanton in diagnostic search, if all previous tests are negative, should be a histological examination of a tissue biopsy searching for Donovan bodies specific for granuloma inguinale (Kang et al., 2019).The assessment is mostly supported by objective data as tests results are the most trustworthy. A contingent of patients with STDs has peculiarities of providing false data to the doctor, and their anamnesis information should be critically evaluated. Syphilis is an appropriate
diagnosis for this case, and test results can be used to confirm or reject it. It is significant to every medical worker to be concerned about syphilis; even though the disease is not spread overall, the impact on all systems and organs of the human body has dramatic consequences. Syphilis is one of the ancient diseases; still, current medicine lacks the alertness on its diagnosing as it may, for instance, mimic other oral manifestations (Dybeck Udd & Lund, 2016). As a differential diagnosis, HSV infection can be reviewed, and the differential search for it will be grouped vesicles on an erythematous background, leaving shallow ulcers (Vestergaard, 2018) afterward. Chancroid, or soft chancre, is caused by Haemophilus ducreyi, is spread in Africa and Asia, has an incubation period from
The present essay analyzes a manual for the use of a dishwasher developed by Bosch. The first positive characteristic of this manual is that it contains a lot of illustrations that make it easier to understand how to use the dishwasher. For instance, the manual depicts how to add rinse aid, arrange crockery in the dishwasher, and remove baskets (Bosch, n.d.). Thus, the manual is focused on its audience, who is not expected to know very well how to use the dishwasher. Besides, the section on the installation of the machine is not detailed and contains only fundamental suggestions. Hence, the authors of the manual expect it to be installed by professionals. Another reason that proves that this manual focuses on the audience is that the largest part
of the text is presented in the form of bullet points. Therefore, a user could easily and quickly find all necessary information in the manual. The manual is problem-oriented, purposeful, and persuasive because it addresses precise issues that users might face. For example, it explains how to select the right program for specific types of crockery and food remains, cancel and stop the program, and check the condition of the machine.Even though the text is written without technical terminology, the manual remains professional. This conclusion is based on the fact that in the instruction, one could find answers to a wide range of specific questions. The manual contains instructions on how to use the dishwasher, take care of it, install, dispose of wastes, and what to do in
make it easy to read. What is more, near the paragraphs with warnings, a related sign is inserted. The exclamation point in a red triangle draws the attention of a reader and makes him or her focus on the content of the section. The manual is also logical: the first section is dedicated to the components of the dishwasher; in the second one, the manual tells the audience how to put tableware in it. Afterward, there is information on how to add water softener, salt, and rinse aid. Finally, the manual explains how to take care of the device and how to act in case of a problem.
What is a Mediterranean diet?The Mediterranean diet is perhaps the most popular gastronomy trend of the current decade. The trend has been popular for a long time and continues to gain popularity among food and culinary enthusiasts. Thanks to the COVID-19 pandemic, the Mediterranean diet has gained wider recognition among people from different countries. The trend adopts its name from the traditional cuisine of the four Mediterranean countries: Morocco, Greece, Italy, and Spain (Papadaki et al., 2020). Although the diet is associated with slight variations from the four countries it originated from, almost every Mediterranean diet incorporates fruits, vegetables, nuts, cereals, fish, legumes, and unsaturated fats. The growing trend to adopt healthy eating habits due to the pandemic has led people to embrace the Mediterranean diet due to
its simplicity in preparing and the easy availability of ingredients.The menuThe proposed menu incorporates the Mediterranean diet approach by focusing on a two-course meal that will contribute to various nutritional benefits to an individual. Another important consideration of the design is time and satiety. Food preparation does not have to be lengthy, especially if the meal is more straightforward, such as an appetizer. Appetizers are initial courses that should be prepared promptly to give an individual a mouthwatering feel as they wait for the main course.The appetizer selected for the recipe is Cream of Mushroom Soup, while the main course is Boston lobster Mafaldine. Both meals are perfect examples of what a simple Mediterranean diet should look like. The selection suggests that people do not have to spend
too much money eating a healthy meal. However, for the meal to resemble the perfect Mediterranean look, some factors are considered. First, the meals have to be prepared using modern culinary techniques. For the mushroom soup, the mushroom soup is prepared, and then parsley is added through foaming, while Sous Vide cooking is used for cooking the lobster for the Boston Lobster Mafaldine.Cream of Mushroom SoupMushroom Soup ingredients are sourced from locally available grocery store items. The goal is to ensure that the recipe uses easy-to-obtain things to give interested people a straightforward approach to avail the ingredients and get straight into cooking. People do not prefer complex recipes since they use ingredients that are not locally sourced or cost too much if they are available. The ingredients
for the appetizer are meant to eradicate this observation and reduce the time and money of people looking to prepare a healthy soup. The ingredients are meant for serving two people and include:  * 100 g diced Cremini mushroom  * 1½ tablespoons unsalted butter  * ½ tablespoon plain flour  * ½ cup of heavy whipped cream  * 3 tbsp chopped parsley  * 1 tbsp dash of black truffle  * Salt to tasteCremini is preferred since it stands between the white button and the portobello mushroom. When used to prepare the soup, it will produce a meal characterized by a brown, firm texture and rich flavor.PreparationMelt butter over medium heat for 3 minutes; add diced mushroom and sauté for 3 minutes. Add
a pinch of salt to the mixture and sauté for 2 minutes until the mushroom has released its juices. Stir plain flour into the mixture and sauté for 3 minutes to remove the taste of plain flour. Add water to the mushroom mixture and bring to a simmer for 8 minutes. Transfer the soup to a blender and puree on moderate speed for 3 minutes until it is smooth and thick. Return soup to pot, add in whipped cream, and stir for 1 minute. Add salt for seasoning. Garnish with parsley foam and serve.Production Flow ChartThe flow chart presents a simpler illustration that shows how the workflow should proceed. It is important to follow the steps highlighted in the flow chart to prevent one from producing the wrong
meal with a completely different taste. The time interval within each process is also vital to ensure that the meal being prepared is of the right quantity for the exact serving. In case an individual wants to prepare the dish for over three people, they should calculate the time in relation to the number of needed servings. For instance, since an 8-minute sautéing period is allowed for one hundred grams of Cremini mushroom, this time should be multiplied with every additional gram. If the meal being prepared is for four people, then the time will be 16 minutes. The nutritional value of the appetizer is as follows:  * Calories 76  * Protein 3.4g  * Carbohydrates 5.6g  * Fiber 0.5g  * Fat 3.4g 
* Cholesterol 0.8gModern Culinary Technique: FoamThe culinary foam technique is an approach that traps air bubbles within a structure made from fat, proteins, or water. Foams are part of molecular gastronomy, which involves mixing natural flavors such as fruit juices with natural gels or stabilizers such as lecithin and hand-whipped through a whipped cream canister or immersion in a blender. Examples include foamed coconut, mushroom, and espresso. To create modern foam, the interfacial tension between the air-oil stage and the aqueous stage needs to be reduced through the presence of a surfactant (Ridge, 2019). Whipped cream, marshmallows, cakes, ice cream, soufflés, mousse, and meringue are examples of foods to which the foam technique can be applied. The tiny air bubbles give foams their unique light texture. Many products
use protein as the primary surface active agent, helping form and stabilize foam in the gaseous stage. Creating this kind of form employs whipping protein solutions. The existing foaming characteristics determine the likelihood of creating the thin film at the gaseous stage for larger gas bubbles to be stabilized.Sensory Element EvaluationThe defining traits of any meal are the three sensory elements, texture, smell, and taste. After preparing the Cream of Mushroom Soup, an individual is presented with a creamy, fluffy, and moist-textured meal. A creamy texture is essential for improving food intake by making the mouth moist in preparation for the main course. This observation implies that the appetizer plays its role in prepping an individual for the main course. On the other hand, the smell is flavorsome
and aromatic. Being that the soup is the opening course, it should serve all the functions of making an individual want to anticipate the main course. Through the aromatic and flavorsome smell, the soup is able to increase an individual’s appetite. Finally, the taste is savory, sweet, and delectable. When eating, an individual is supposed to enjoy the course, even when waiting for the main course. Additionally, this taste is effective in increasing appetite and helps control protein digestion. This will become essential when the individual is taking the main course.Resource Constraints: Cream of Mushroom SoupOne can face several challenges when preparing the Cream of Mushroom Soup. The first challenge is hurried cooking which can produce unexpected results. Mushroom forms part of the ‘special’ meals that need additional
caution during preparation. A slight mistake might lead to the production of the wrong meal. For instance, if one cooks the food too fast, they will prevent excess water from seeping out. If this water is maintained while cooking, there are increased chances of the food bearing a different smell or tasting entirely different. For better results, cook mushrooms low and slow. Second, it is important to use the right amount of water based on the required servings or amount of mushrooms. Water is also an important factor when preparing soup. Exact measurements lie with the chef, but the idea is not to use too much or too little water. While cooking mushrooms, many people may overcrowd the pan to incorporate different ingredients. While this may work in
some cases, it is not always a good idea to overcrowd the pan. Therefore, often locate a large pan before starting to prepare the meal. Finally, the art of making foam may be challenging for some chefs, especially those who have no prior experience in the art. It is important to research to understand how to make foams quickly and effectively.Boston Lobster MafaldineLike the appetizer course, ingredients for the main course are also sourced from locally available items. They include:  * 1000 g of chopped Boston Lobster  * 100 g of Mafaldine Pasta  * A bowl of shredded Brussel sprout  * Salt to tasteAlthough the recipe mentions a whole lobster, the tail will be used to prepare the main course. The tail is preferred
due to its richness in protein, fatty acids, minerals, vitamins, and omega-3. Additionally, it allows chefs to prepare food rich in health benefits such as mental health, weight loss, and reducing the risk of cancer and heart disease (Mentella et al., 2019).PreparationPreparing Lobster Mafaldini is also simple as the preparation of the appetizer course. First, lobster meat is cooked Sous Vide at 80F for 30 minutes. This is done to make the meat tender and not chewy. This illustrates the employment of another modern culinary technique with Sous Vide cooking. Next, water is brought to a boil for 8 minutes, and then Mafaldine pasta is added and allowed to boil for 10 to 15 minutes. During this time, the lobster is already ready to be fried. Butter is
melted for one minute, and then the chopped lobster meat is added. The resulting mixture is sautéed for 6 minutes until it is fully cooked. Shredded Brussels sprout is then added to the mixture and sautéed for 2 minutes. The pasta is added and mixed with the mixture. The mixture is allowed to simmer for 2 minutes.Production Flow ChartLike the appetizer, following the main course steps is vital. The same observation applies to time intervals and the step-by-step guideline, as shown in the figure. The Boston Lobster Mafaldine is also rich in nutritional content as follows:  * Calories 489  * Protein 34.5g  * Carbohydrates 66.9g  * Fiber 4.8g  * Fats 2.2g  * Cholesterol 0.001gModern Culinary Technique: Sous VideSous Vide is borrowed from
the French vocabulary for “under the vacuum.” In essence, this technique employs a similar “under the vacuum” approach whereby food is put in plastic pouches and then placed in temperature-controlled water baths (López-Alt, 2022). In some instances where restaurants use steam-filled environments to conduct Sous Vide cooking. This technique is used in cooking various foods, although the most common ones include meats, stews, and soup. The approach is employed if chefs ensure that food is evenly cooked inside and outside. The figure shows Lobster tail being cooked in Sous Vide.Sensory Element EvaluationThe texture of the meal is firm and chewy, an important factor that reveals the amount of protein present in the lobster tail. On the other hand, the smell is flavorsome and eggy. Upon mixing, the eggy
smell emerges from the pasta. A flavorsome smell, in this case, helps an individual retain their appetite for a long time during the course. The taste is sweeter and crispy. Another defining characteristic of the lobster tail is its taste. In this case, sweetness is produced from the taste of lean meat, while the crispy emerges from the fiber tendons.Resource Constraints: Boston Lobster MafaldineThe common challenges present when preparing Boston Lobster Mafaldine range from overcrowding, over-seasoning, overlooking the steps, and overcooking. Overcrowding, like the appetizer, is common when preparing lobster Mafaldine pasta. Overcrowding is likely to lead to the production of an unevenly cooked meal and the deprivation of other vital ingredients. To prevent this from happening, it is wise to always use a large pot for preparing
lobster. The second challenge is overlooking the steps, as illustrated in the flow chart. There may be instances when an individual thinks that steps are a waste of time and goes ahead and skip one or two. Although people may have their idea of the perfect Boston Lobster Mafaldine, their final versions may differ from the current meal. Steps taken must be chronological to ensure that the final presentation is similar to the one highlighted in the image. Another challenge arises from over-seasoning, where an individual may be carried away by adding more salt to the seasoning water. It is important to get the right sizes before starting to cook. Finally, some chefs are likely to overcook their meals. Overcooking lobster can make t dry and rubbery.Marketing and
MarketabilityMarketing a Mediterranean diet depends on three primary factors, namely lifestyle, user status, and dietary benefits. Although the gastronomy trends suggest that the diet is popular, having a poor marketing strategy is a recipe for failure. The three factors effectively allow advertisers to create a detailed market segmentation involving different users. For instance, the Mediterranean diet promotes healthy eating habits, which suggests that marketing it to people who do not follow healthy eating may not work. Therefore, the marketing approach sending the message of healthy eating will be “good health,” “longevity,” “low heart disease conditions,” and so on. Communicating this message effectively through various media channels, such as TV and print media, will likely increase awareness, allowing many people to turn to healthy eating. At the moment, the
Melanoma is generally recognized as one of the cancers that have an increasing cover percentage, though it is usually diagnosed at early stages. Recently, the ways of melanoma treatment for patients with metastatic disease were so limited that many patients were practically doomed. Fortunately, melanoma therapeutics have developed for the past decade because of the use of immune checkpoint inhibitors. Now, people with stages II and III may easily have a long period of remission. Therefore, modern options for melanoma treatment serve as a source of hope for numerous people.Indeed, innovations in the sphere of melanoma treatment are connected with the use of checkpoint inhibitors and the so-called adjuvant therapy. According to recent research, “the use of anti–CTLA-4 and anti-PD1 immune checkpoint inhibitors and combination BRAF/MEK inhibitors for
Although mentoring is a relatively new term within church circles, it has been practiced widely in Christian communities for years. Across many churches, spiritual coaching, directorship, discipleship, and friendship have been implemented in a mostly unstructured form, necessitating the need to formulate standard skills and methods for mentors for better outcomes. According to Mallison (1998), Christian coaching encompasses the development of disciples and leaders through sound instructions and encouragement, which are founded on God’s will and biblical teachings. The author defines Christian mentoring as “a dynamic, intentional relationship of trust in which one person enables another to maximize the grace of God in their life and service” (Mallison, 1998, p. 8). The author’s predominant theme is that mentorship is not optional if Christians intend to grow and the
criticality of taking an interest in the progress of others.Christian-based mentoring integrates various spiritual components, aspects, and the bible as the principal ingredients. By presenting Jesus as the prime mentoring model, Mallison’s (1998) central premise is that Christians should be concerned in the spiritual and personal growth of others since Christianity is relational and collectivist. The author emphasizes the concepts of community and interdependence by describing “a Christian wanting to live in isolation as a pious particle” (Mallison, 1998, p. 34). However, the author’s notable refutation is that despite integrating all the critical ingredients and observing the foundational principles, Christian mentoring is futile if not underlined by a genuine desire to see the mentor advance spiritually.Mentorship and developing an interest in the spiritual and personal growth of others
There are several ways to compare and contrast the Mesopotamian and Ancient Greek civilizations. Socially, the two civilizations were very different; the Greeks were known for their strong sense of democracy, while the Mesopotamians were ruled by kings and queens. Politically, there were also major differences; the Greeks were republics, while the Mesopotamians had empires. Economically, Ancient Greece was known for its many exports, while Mesopotamia was mostly an agricultural society. Culturally, the two civilizations differed in terms of their writing systems and religions. The Greeks used an alphabet that is still in use today, while the Mesopotamians developed a cuneiform script. Therefore, there are eminently social, political, economic, and cultural differences and similarities between Mesopotamian and Ancient Greek.The social differences between the Mesopotamian and Ancient Greek civilizations
were vast. Mesopotamia was a very hierarchical society, with a strict caste system in place. There was very little opportunity for social mobility, and the powerful ruled over the masses with an iron fist. Ancient Greece, on the other hand, was much more egalitarian. People were able to move up in status if they were talented or ambitious, and democracy was practiced in many city-states (Adams 35). This resulted in a much more prosperous society overall. Similarly, Ancient Greece was a much more democratic society than Mesopotamia. In Athens, for example, all male citizens had the right to vote and participate in government. Wealthy citizens could not buy their way into office; they had to be elected by their peers. Mesopotamian society was much more stratified; at the
top were the rulers and priests, followed by a small number of wealthy landowners (Adams 43). The vast majority of people were slaves or peasants who worked the land. There was no concept of democracy in Mesopotamia; instead, society was ruled by a small elite group who claimed divine authority.Both Mesopotamian and Ancient Greek civilizations exhibited a great deal of social similarity. For example, both were patriarchal societies in which women had few rights and were largely confined to the home. In addition, both societies placed a high value on warfare and physical prowess and considered martial prowess to be one of the key markers of manhood. There were also some key differences between these two civilizations. One major difference was that the Ancient Greeks were far more
egalitarian than the Mesopotamians (Frahm 119). This is evidenced by the fact that in Ancient Greece, women could own property, engage in business, and even participate in politics. Mesopotamian and Ancient Greek civilizations were strikingly similar in terms of their social structures. Both were based on hierarchies in which people were divided into classes according to their wealth, power, and status. However, the two civilizations differed in terms of their religious beliefs. The Mesopotamians believed in a pantheon of gods, while the Ancient Greeks believed in a single god who governed the world.The two civilizations differed in their political structures; Mesopotamia was a theocracy, while Greece was a democracy. Mesopotamia’s theocracy meant that the gods were responsible for guiding the human king in carrying out his responsibilities. In
contrast, Greek democracy placed ultimate power in the hands of all free male citizens (Frahm 117). This resulted in decisions being made through discourse and voting, as opposed to divine guidance. The two civilizations differed in their political structures. Mesopotamia was a theocracy, while Ancient Greece was a republic. In Mesopotamia, the king was considered to be the representative of the gods on Earth. He had absolute power and controlled all aspects of society (Frahm 111). In Ancient Greece, by contrast, citizens had the right to vote and to participate in government. There were also many different city-states, each with its laws and customs. This allowed for a great deal of diversity and debate.Similarly, both cultures were polytheistic, with a pantheon of gods and goddesses who controlled all
aspects of human life. They also shared similar architectural styles, with temples and palaces constructed similarly. The most significant similarity between these two cultures is their approach to warfare (Adams 55). Both Mesopotamians and Ancient Greeks believed that a victorious battle could bring great rewards, not only for the victors but for the entire city or nation. This led to highly strategic wars fought by armies of brave soldiers who valued their honor above all else.Mesopotamian and Ancient Greek civilizations were outstandingly similar in their political structures. Both were considered city-states, and each city was ruled by a king who had complete authority within his domain (Frahm 121). Citizens of the city were required to obey the king’s decrees, and disputes between cities were often resolved through warfare.
The major difference between these two civilizations was in their religious beliefs. The Mesopotamians believed in many gods, while the Ancient Greeks only believed in one god, Zeus. This difference led to different attitudes towards warfare – the Mesopotamians fought for religious reasons, while the Ancient Greeks fought for political reasons (to expand or protect their territory). The two civilizations had some political similarities in that they were both led by powerful kings, and their economies were based largely on agriculture (Frahm 115). However, the Mesopotamian civilization was considerably more advanced than the Ancient Greek civilization. For example, the Mesopotamians developed writing, while the Ancient Greeks did not. Additionally, the Mesopotamians had a more complex system of government, with a large number of social classes and a complex
legal system.The main economic difference between the Mesopotamian and Ancient Greek civilizations was that the Mesopotamians were a more mercantile society while the Ancient Greeks were more focused on agriculture. The Mesopotamians were merchants who traded goods such as textiles, spices, and metals. They built their economy on the principle of credit and debt, which led to a high level of commercial activity. The Ancient Greeks, on the other hand, were farmers who grew their food (Heriyanto 95). They did not have as strong a trading economy and instead focused on developing their political and artistic cultures. The ancient Mesopotamian and Greek civilizations were two of the most influential in history.Though they share some similarities, there are several key differences between them. Mesopotamia was an early example of
a centrally planned economy. Central planners decided what goods would be produced, how much of each good would be produced, and what prices would be charged. This caused shortages and surpluses of goods, as well as widespread corruption. In Ancient Greece, by contrast, many different city-states had their independent economies (Heriyanto 75). There was no central authority dictating what should be produced or how much should be produced; rather, merchants and traders decided what to sell based on the products available.The two civilizations had different cultural beliefs that led to different economic systems. In Mesopotamia, there was a strong belief in gods and goddesses, which led to the creation of temples and religious ceremonies. This led to a strong sense of community and cooperation, which helped create a
thriving economy (Adams 33). In ancient Greece, on the other hand, there was a belief in human rationality and individualism. This led to the development of philosophy and democracy, which helped create a prosperous society.Another difference between these two civilizations is their respective attitudes toward warfare. The Mesopotamians were a warrior culture, and war was an integral part of their society (Frahm 109). Homer’s Iliad, which recounts the Trojan War, is an example of this type of literature. The Ancient Greeks, on the other hand, were not a warrior culture. The ideal citizen in a Greek city-state participated in politics and cultivated his mind and body. The Mesopotamian sculpture is characterized by its realism and its emphasis on the power and strength of the human figure. Another key
the Mesopotamians, whereas the Greek alphabet is still in use today. Mesopotamian and Ancient Greek civilizations were strikingly similar in that each city-state was headed by a monarch who exercised absolute power over his territory. A commonality across societies is that males had authority in both the private and public arenas. Mesopotamian and Ancient Greek society, politics, economy, and culture are different and similar to one another.
The study of what rhetorical tools public personalities use in their speech can be a beneficial aspect to study. With its help, people can get an understanding of how, when, and where people can use rhetorical components. This work aims to study Michelle Obama’s opening remarks at the White House Convention on Food Marketing to Children. The main message of the First Lady was to draw attention to the suppression of the advertising of unhealthy food to minors. In addition, the main appeals that Obama uses are logic and emotional.The first aspect of rhetoric used in this speech is logic. It implies the justification and reasons for a particular action or event. Michele Obama stated that “between 2008 and 2011, obesity rates among low-income preschoolers dropped in 19
three kids is still on track to develop diabetes, and when the diet has now surpassed smoking” (Read Michelle Obama’s Speech on Food Marketing para. 11). In this case, Michele Obama points to the positive results already achieved while also highlighting that children are still at risk.In conclusion, this work was engaged in analyzing Michelle Obama’s speech on the topic of the harm of the media for introducing the younger generation to healthy habits. To better convey the main idea, the first lady used such components of rhetoric as logic and emotion. They helped to better form and give important information, gave the speech solidity, and improved the audience’s ability to persuade.
Microsoft Power BI overviewData visualization enables the transformation of abstract measurable data into a visual representation in the form of tables, charts, graphs, and matrices (Bhargava et al. 1; Qin et al. 2). Microsoft Power BI is an intriguing data visualization tool (Bansal and Upadhyay 14; Hadhoud and Walid 5). Power BI consists of various components that are available on the market separately and can be purchased and used independently, such as Power BI Desktop, Power BI Embedded, Power BI Gateway, and Power BI Mobile Apps.When it was first soldIn 2010, Microsoft came up with the concept for this tool. In July 2011, it was made publicly available for download under the name “Project Crescent.” It took three months for the Office 365 add-in to be published under
the new Power BI brand (Senter 44). After that, Power Pivot, Power Query, and Power View were thereafter exclusively accessible as Microsoft Excel add-ins (Becker and Gould 185). Power BI Gateway was integrated with various features, such as enterprise-level data connectors and security settings. Power BI was then released for sale with all its current full-fledged features for the first time on July 24, 2015. Today, Power BI remains a popular data visualization tool.Main customersFirms in the professional services sector are the largest customer group (16.3%), followed by the manufacturing sector (13.2%), the financial services sector (8.6%), and the healthcare sector (7.1%). Others include the retail sector (6.3%), the oil and gas sector (5.5%), and the education sector (5.2%) (Microsoft Power BI). The top 5 companies that use
Microsoft are Walmart, Apple, McKesson, Berkshire Hathaway, and GEICO (Microsoft Power BI). Hence, Power BI has an extended customer segment.Key strengths of Power BIPower makes creating straightforward dashboards and dynamic reports a breeze. Power BI is known for its customizable dashboards, which can be tailored to a company’s unique needs (Becker and Gould 185). There are also interactive and intuitive visualizations included in the bundle. Drag-and-drop capabilities may also be used to quickly create bespoke reports (Microsoft Power BI). It also provides access to data that is updated in real-time. Therefore, the dashboard shows and updates a user’s visualizations as new data is streamed in.Weakness of Power BIPower BI is not designed for analyzing complicated table-to-table connections. Power BI might not be able to handle intricate table connections.
Second, while Power BI allows you to modify your visualizations, it does not give users many options (Becker and Gould 185). This limits its utility.Top five most interesting features of non-tableau data visualizationPower BI contains an interactive Power BI desktop that enables users to access data easily and produce reports. The software is simple to learn and utilize (Lyon 167). The second interesting feature is the Pivot Point. In-memory data models are created by importing and combining diverse datasets from various sources. As a result, by combining data from different sources, functional users can quickly increase the total value.Another significant feature is query power. This component seeks data from various corporate data sources or on the internet and then inserts it into an Excel table in a fluid
it provides bespoke, visualized dashboards.Does non-Tableau data visualization have any uses that Tableau does not?Power BI does not have any uses that Tableau does not have. Comparing the two, it appears that both can display data visualizations from multiple reports (Akhtar 29). However, Power BI only has an edge when it comes to ease of use and real-time access to data (Becker and Gould 185). When it comes to speed and the capacity to deal with complex data, Tableau is the clear winner.
Life on its own is a complex notion that includes many stages, aspects, and problems. As a person passes subsequent stages of development, previous issues become less important, leaving room for new matters and concerns. In this regard, a mid-life crisis is a serious occurrence affecting most people who reach this point in life. As can be inferred from its name, this crisis emerges at an approximate middle point of an average lifespan when youth is in the past and the second half of life is approaching. At this stage, an individual is likely to reflect upon their past experiences and question their previous choices. Once enjoyable activities begin to lose their importance, and the future prospect may appear daunting. In pursuit of the elusive youth, people experiencing
a mid-life crisis tend to make questionable decisions. Furthermore, their personal philosophy moves further away from materialistic matters as they reflect and discuss more sophisticated ideas. This paper reviews Leo Tolstoy’s My Confession as an illustration of the inner struggle experienced by a man in his mid-life crisis. While his faith-based solutions meet these needs, it is not and cannot be limited to the Christian religion.Tolstoy wrote My Confession when he was of an age that is currently perceived as “middle”. In this short essay, the famous Russian author reflects upon his literary career and life experiences as he becomes older. By that point, he had already attained great success as a master of literature, having published several prominent pieces. However, as he overtly admits, most of this
work served to make a living for him and his family. In other words, Tolstoy’s literary pursuit relied on materialistic motivation in terms of earning money and status. In addition, his career was a sufficient distraction from having to seek meaning in life. Authorship occupied a considerable portion of Tolstoy’s time, leaving little or no room for contemplating more sophisticated matters. Furthermore, amid the age when religion was of major significance for Europe, Tolstoy, as an author, remained loyal to facts and science. Ultimately, the author faced an imminent crisis of meaning at the figurative middle point in life.This crisis experienced by Tolstoy originated from his concentration on literature throughout most of his existence. In My Confession, it shortly becomes clear that authorship was neither a passion nor
a destiny for Tolstoy. Instead, he openly refers to it as a “waste of time”, admitting that he continued on this path merely for materialistic reasons (Tolstoy, 2018, p. 7). In other words, he wrote to be famous and wealthy and ultimately accomplished this objective. Nevertheless, as Tolstoy passed the middle point of his life, materialistic wealth had not ensured his full satisfaction. He earned his money and his name became well-known both in Russia and abroad. However, he began to consider the futility of this pursuit and the overarching purposes of his authorship. Having attained material satisfaction, he found his spiritual needs unmet. Thus, Tolstoy encountered a mid-life crisis of meaning, knowing what he accomplished but questioning whether it was worth it.This way, the famous author found
his previous satisfaction temporary and even futile. Tolstoy reflected upon his feelings and experiences, ultimately deciding that his life lacked a spiritual component. While seeking an effective solution to the crisis, he remembered that his previous steps were dictated by rational knowledge. Tolstoy (2018) inferred that this knowledge provided him with facts but failed to ensure the meaning of life. Therefore, he sought answers in the so-called irrational area, which is faith. Tolstoy accepted the tenets of Christianity, considering the central concepts and of religion on a more profound level. He became convinced that science and logic do not suffice to fathom life’s intricate, complex, and multi-faceted nature and its meaning. Consequently, Tolstoy expected religion to bring him closer to the true purpose of life, which was no
longer limited to material goods.In other words, Leo Tolstoy took a strictly theistic stance on this philosophical matter. For him, the answer to the meaning of life lay in God’s realm and the teachings of Christian philosophers. Evidently, as a free, educated person, he had the right to choose this path toward understanding the meaning of life. However, the ultimate presentation of theistic values as the absolute source of truth, meaning, and fulfillment does not align with the pluralism of opinion valued by society. For example, an atheistic opponent could reasonably argue that, unlike science and facts refuted by Tolstoy, faith is not substantiated by solid evidence. Therefore, this could be an instance of wishful thinking that does not provide true meaning to life. Instead, its overall uncertainty
creates room for interpretations, through which a person can draw convenient conclusions that create an artificial sense of fulfillment. Furthermore, the desperate pursuit of religious solutions to a crisis of meaning makes people vulnerable to the malicious intents of those who wish to exploit them.In spite of the general controversy regarding the solution for which Leo Tolstoy advocates, the very nature of this reading is thought-provoking. It is incredibly valuable to examine the inner monolog of a man who encounters a severe crisis of meaning by age 50. Furthermore, Tolstoy is a wealthy and famous person of his time, which indicates that neither money nor status provides immunity to such an occurrence. These ideas remain relevant today, as modern society’s mid-life crisis is a common development. Similar to
Tolstoy, many people remain in an ongoing pursuit of wealth, status, and success in both their professional and personal lives. Nevertheless, they are equally likely to encounter a severe crisis of meaning. In fact, the likelihood of the occurrence is higher today as the world becomes more competitive, intense, and demanding. The current lifestyle, especially in urban areas, encourages ambitious people to be in constant pursuit of new heights, always raising the bar. Under such circumstances, more individuals eventually review their past experiences and realize that they still lack fulfillment and meaning.As a result, the search for an effective solution to a mid-life crisis of meaning is a matter of paramount importance today. For Tolstoy, the key lay in faith and God, as the ultimate source of spiritual
limited to it. Furthermore, faith is not necessarily associated with conventional religion. Having faith implies that a person has strong beliefs that provide them with meaning and purpose. In addition to God, one can also believe in oneself, their family, interests, friends, and a range of noble missions from charity to social activism. Every person is free to believe in God, but there are other sources of faith in this world. In this regard, a mid-life crisis can, indeed, be addressed through Tolstoy’s solution, although it requires further development to be universal.
Globalization has indeed become a significant pattern in the development of geopolitical and cultural practices of recent decades. With the advent of the Internet, people have become connected, even across continents: such a powerful catalyst could not fail to have a necessary consequence. In particular, people from different countries and cultures have become more integrated into a common, emerging culture in which there is room for the traditions of all peoples. Meanwhile, the representation of different cultures in this common one is unequal, which means that stronger national cultures can absorb weaker ones.A natural reaction to the unification of people was the growth of nationalistic sentiments among peoples whose cultures tend to be weaker. Thus, the spread of American sentiment (and especially the American dream) to the world
There is no simple answer to what it means to be human. Some might say that being human means being independent and controlling their personal lives. For other people, being human means utilizing the refinements of civilization, wearing clothes, and going to work every day, i.e., doing everything that animals cannot do. It is also complicated to say how people want to live because everyone has unique requirements, dreams, and thoughts on this issue. This essay reflects on the On Being podcast and answers the above questions.In the podcast, Thich Nhat Hanh explains why people need to be human. According to him, “we have to remain human to be able to understand and to be compassionate” (Onbeing.org 30:53 – 30:58). The monk adds that being human means having
dedicated to being human, problems people face in the modern mad world, and ways to avoid them. The Buddhist monk Thich Nhat Hanh creates an impression of a conscious person whose ideas should be taken seriously. Even though I do not share the Buddhist worldview, I deeply admire the personality of Thich Nhat Hanh since he inspired me to learn more about mindfulness practices.
Modern parenthood is complex and sometimes unbalanced, and the consequences of it are anxious, at least because modern children growing up in those families obtain less care and adopt negative behavioral patterns. Unstable families produce instability, and children inherit it, creating more instability in the next generations. In times of change, it is crucial to understand those changes and be ready to react to overcome numerous challenges.Family instability conception refers to situations in marriages and relationships that change quickly. This concept was initially developed in the 1990s and considered children undergoing this instability (Cavanagh & Fomby, 2019). It studies children’s responses to the different stressors connected with those changes: divorces, remarriages, cohabitations without marriage, etcetera. Children undergo stress from parents’ negative feelings, from breaking up with schools and
friends that usually follow the divorce, from living in incomplete families, and obtaining less care and family warmth. In that way, drastic changes lead to instability, and instability leads to stress.A high divorce rate is one of the main reasons for family instability: incomplete families tend to be unbalanced for different reasons. For example, it is much harder to maintain a work-life balance in such a family due to a constant lack of time. Due to high divorce rates and high marriage age on average, more and more children are in the situation when they live in an incomplete family. Divorce rates in the United States have risen slowly last decades, and for now, they have reached more than 40% of all marriages (Smock & Schwartz, 2020). Children
experience stress with their parents conflicting and divorcing and tend to adopt those behavioral patterns for themselves (Cavanagh & Fomby, 2019). In this way, they grow up with a tendency to form incomplete families by themselves. In the 2010s, most people living together were cohabited, not married (Smock & Schwartz, 2020). The tendency to reject marriage is rising, along with the average age of marriage. It leads to instability in families in general.Another reason for modern families being unbalanced is the hardship of maintaining a work-life balance. More than 50% of all women and men having children said in a survey that they feel difficulty in combining work and family activities (Parker & Wang, 2013). That leads to the situation when children may obtain less care, and the
overall stress level in families increases. According to Parker & Wang, though, the amount of time parents spend with their children is growing up (2013). Due to changes in gender roles, fathers spend much more time with children and doing housework: this time almost doubles from the 1960s (Parker & Wang, 2013). Maintaining a work-life balance is crucial, but it is more challenging due to those changes, both for men and women; people should adapt to new roles and conditions.In general, gender roles have become much less distinct, and traditional images of a working man and a housewife woman are vaguer now. The traditional family structure has changed. The percentage of working women has risen drastically compared with the 1960s (Parker & Wang, 2013). At the same time,
In general, working full-time for women and doing all housework for men is not unusual now. Such changes in gender roles bring even more chaos and instability to the situation with families.Instability in modern families produces challenges for parents and children: parents should maintain a work-life balance, and both parents and children should be more adaptable to live well. Chaos with gender roles has changed the familiar way of life, making people feel confused. Families tend to form and dissolve much quicker than before, and marriage is not mandatory for modern families. The abilities to maintain a work-life balance, react quickly, and be ready to change are crucial to living well in this time of constant change.
Referring to competition’s nature, the competitive landscape covers multiple aspects, including, the number and size of companies, their weaknesses and strengths, barriers to the market entry and exit, and substitutes’ threats. In the present day, it substantially differs from the traditional competitive environment that relied on large advertising budgets and economies of scale – and it continues to transform due to rapid technological progress. Due to constantly changing conditions, the contemporary competitive mindset is characterized by innovation, integration, flexibility, and speed. It relies on data in business decision-making in order to have competitive advantages and create transparent business processes, adapts to the latest market technologies, and aims to improve the consumer experience. In general, in order to stay competitive, the majority of companies focus on customer-oriented operations to
“The Passing of Traditional Societies” is based on empirical material obtained from fieldwork and interviews conducted over a decade in Turkey, Lebanon, Syria, Egypt, Jordan, and Iran. Lerner proceeded from the fact that in the process of modernization, all societies move in the same direction, which was set by the Western countries that had completed modernization earlier. However, this “Western model,” according to Lerner, is, in fact, global. It acquired its name only due to a historical confluence of circumstances. Countries of the North Atlantic were the first to carry out the processes of secularization, urbanization, and industrialization. Analyzing the modernization of lifestyles based on empirical material, Lerner pays the most attention to the growth of population mobility, the spread of literacy, and the mass media.For example, Lerner
The clothing industry is amongst the many monopolistically competitive industries. There are many clothing firms in the industry competing against each other while producing similar products. However, the firms in the industry earn competitive advantages by distinguishing their products through branding and advertisements (Davis and Özgür, 4). Product differentiation is one of the strategies commonly used by monopolistic competitive firms. Product differentiation in a clothing firm can involve designs, the quality of materials used, and the prices charged for the clothes. In advertisements, differentiation is put in physical aspects such as color, designs, elastic, and different sizes (Davis and Özgür, 7). Intangible aspects included in the clothing advertisement can be guaranteed money back, high quality, free delivery, and long-lasting usage.Steel manufacturing is an example of an oligopolistic competitive
or lower prices, and advertise the special features of their products. In an oligopolistic market, if a leading company lowers prices, the others do not follow but rather improve their products to remain in the higher cuts of prices (Ritz 187). The few leading companies also stay competitive in the industry by setting their standards high to prevent easy entry into the industry. The firms set high standards by producing the highest quality products, selling them at a higher price, and producing them in high quantities (Ritz 189). That way, they ensure that the small or new companies fear the competition at the top thus ensuring reduced entry to the industry.
Moral relativism claims that morality is not based on any absolute standard. According to moral relativism, ethical truth is more likely to come from situations, cultures, and sensations. The source of moral universalism is considered human nature, particularly the susceptibility of a person, the ability to empathize, and the resulting need for argumentation for persuasion. The two moral concepts are opposed, but moral universalism seems to be more truthful.Several arguments can be made concerning moral relativism that reflect a dubious nature. Firstly, while many of the arguments that insist on supporting relativism may seem compelling, they all have a logical contradiction in that they all return the correct moral schema that all people should follow, which constitutes moral universalism. Secondly, relativists may argue that different cultures have different
point of view is the obvious observation that in all known moral codes that have proven their viability, there is a common core: respect for life, health, property, and personal dignity. Moral universalism seems to be the more truthful theory. Firstly, moral relativism is built on exceptions, not on general rules. All people approach morality from human nature, which explains approximately the same moral and ethical codes of all countries and peoples. Moral norms are considered basic everywhere, for example, the prohibition of murder. Secondly, if everyone had their own morality and ethics, as moral relativism suggests, it would be impossible to regulate human relations.
“Interpreter of Maladies” introduces the reader to a collapsing world of a dysfunctional family. In the novel, Mr. Das sparks both sympathy and a sense of slight annoyance that is likely to transform into disdain after considering the evolution of his character. Although the character might seem benevolent and sympathetic at first, his evident inability to emotionally connect with his wife or children indicates the need for further evolution, which never occurs.At first glance, Mr. Das represents a character that is easy to empathize with and relate to due to his kind nature. Indeed, Mr. Das is mostly benevolent and kind-hearted throughout the novel. For example, he is never aggressive or unkind to his wife, her mostly being the one to start a confrontation: “’But they’re harmless,’ Mr.
Das said” (Lahiri). However, Mr. Das should not be seen as immediately redeemable.Specifically, on a closer look, Mr. Das’ unwillingness to interact with his wife or children becomes evident. For instance, when Mr. Kapasi starts talking to the couple., Mr. Das chooses to avoid the conversation. Namely, he chooses to read a book instead: “Mr. Das was absorbed by his tour book, so it seemed like a private conversation between Mr. Kapasi and Mrs. Das” (Lahiri). Therefore, Mr. Das clearly distances himself from his wife and, by extension, from his children, creating a further rift in their relationship.Therefore, the failure to acknowledge and address a problem represents a major obstacle in Mr. Das’ character development. as a result, he never grows throughout the novel, remaining in the same
The article represents an overview of other literature on methodologies and criteria used in supplier evaluation and selection process, which is believed to be one of the vital components of a successful operation of a manufacturing company. In particular, the paper emphasized the industry’s change in this field – from focusing primarily on operational efficiency to embracing the potential of strategic partnerships. The article claims that the right approach to supplier assessment, thus, is the key to a company’s development and progress.The paper starts with various ways to address the issues related to MCDM of suppliers’ selection. The most common ones are stated to be mathematical models, Simple multi-attribute rating technique (SMART), analytic network process (ANP), analytic hierarchy process (AHP), data envelopment analysis (DEA), linear programming, and some
which can build an idea of the most prominent ways to address the issues with suppliers’ assessment and selection. It is also stated that suppliers should be evaluated based on “the inputs of the strategic, functional and operational levels” (Agarwal et al., 2011). Methodologies such as DEA, mathematical programming, or AHP are advised to be used for identifying the most optimal suppliers, whereas AHP is noted to be effective in providing consistency.
Ancient Rome could be described as multicultural, largely due to the significant areas of land that the Roman Empire controlled at various points, often integrating the local populations and cultures into their own. A wide variety of cultures existed within the borders of the Roman civilization and the Roman population was found to have incredible genetic diversity, having more in common with the Mediterranean states rather than Western Europe (Thomsen, 2019). Some of the cultures that were present under Roman rule include the Gauls, Greeks, Syrian, Egyptian, Lebanese, Persia, and many others. Scholars attribute the cultural and economic success of Rome partially to its ability to embrace a range of ethnic and national identities, often assimilating many elements of the foreign cultures into its own traditions, beliefs or
practices.The well-known Pax Romana , a period of prosperity and tranquility for approximately 200 years came at a point when Roman conquests came to a relative end, and a range of cultures were given the opportunity to live in harmony under one central government. While as all Empires, Rome did push some values and requirements upon the regions it conquered, for the most part, the people could live their lives, worship their respective religions, follow their respective traditions, and even maintain their own laws and taxation (Brooks, 2019). Rome by far was one of the most multicultural states in the ancient world that greatly respected the civilizations of others.The primary culture that strongly influenced the Roman culture is likely Ancient Greece. The Hellenistic society led the basis to
military tactics. Furthermore, the Romans were influenced by the Etruscans, a neighboring tribe to the northwest of Rome, who were allied with and then conquering the newly formed city-state. Etruscans were heavy traders with the Greeks, and had a similarly loose empire of city states, sharing many of the cultural elements. Essentially, the Etruscans allowed for the Greek culture to transition into Rome (Brooks, 2019). However, Rome was influenced by the Etruscans in its early days by contributing to its military capabilities and war-oriented, expansionist society.
A live classical music concert, which will be discussed in the paper, is the Millennium Stage by Apollo Orchestra. The orchestra joins forces with renowned opera stars and international instrumental soloists for an annual series of free concerts. The performance was held on March 5, 2020, and I attended on the same day. It brought me unforgettable memories, enough to be reflected in the corresponding essay.The performance was filled with music by many composers who contributed to the development of classical music. The concert begins with a work by Ottorino Respighi, an Italian composer who studied at the Bologna Lyceum, and then with Nikolai Rimsky-Korsakov in St. Petersburg, where he was the first violist in the Opera Orchestra ( Ottorino Respighi ). His active training throughout his life
endowed the composer’s works with a unique orchestral flavor. The concert ends with a piece by Ludwig van Beethoven, known to the general public for his heroic struggle with the onset of deafness when some of his most important works were written ( Ludwig van Beethoven ). The musical compositions of these authors formed the basis for a concert that touched the heart and soul of every listener in the hall.The set of instruments was typical for conducting an orchestral concert. The professional orchestra group was endowed mainly with string instruments: the cello, double bass, violin, viola, and harp. As the largest group on stage, the string family accounted for more than half of the total number of performers. They were also accompanied by wind instruments, which sit
together in the middle of the orchestra, percussion, and piano. Together, they created a holistic and harmonious sound with each new composition played at the concert.The orchestra concert was attended by eminent composers of our time, contributing to the development of musical culture. For example, international pianist Peter Orth was acclaimed as a special guest artist and soloist for the concert. His career in the American mainstream began after the first prize at the International Piano Competition in Naumburg in 1979, held in memory of William Capell (Peter Orth, Piano). He was awarded numerous awards in America and Europe, bringing him worldwide fame in the music community. Claudia Chudacoff as a visiting concertmaster and associate conductor Jeffrey Newberger, conducted the opening piece, setting the mood till the end
of the concert. The other members of the orchestra also coped with their work perfectly and provided the audience with an evening of high-quality and sensual music.The concert starts with Ottorino Respighi’s Botticelli Triptych, which is the memory of three famous paintings by Sandro Botticelli. The piece is followed by Beethoven’s early masterpieces, Concerto No. 3 and C Minor Concerto, which became an excellent end to the evening. Despite the variety of works and composers who lived and worked in different eras, the combination of their music sounded harmonious and unusual to an unaccustomed ear. All the music played during the performance belongs to the genre of an orchestral concert, although it affects differently due to differences in musical moods. The lightness of the first piece and the
fleur of sadness of Beethoven’s compositions contrasted perfectly with each other, quietly flowing from one to the other.I personally was impressed by the concert since the soft change of compositional tones greatly delighted me. Each section brought a new mood to the overall picture, which was noticeably reflected in the course of the music. The first part was divided into three, each of which adhered to the light and fresh moods characteristic of the mentioned triptych. In this part, more attention was paid to the quality of the compositions, which is why I could not stop admiring the orchestra’s skills. The second part of the concert can also be divided into two parts, the first of which was more majestic, the second, on the contrary, sadder and more
the whole concert did not stop even in the last notes, allowing to simplify and facilitate the figurative series.Thus, the Millennium Stage by Apollo Orchestra gave me a lot of unforgettable emotions and can be recommended by me for listening as an interesting and exciting experience. The skillful musicians who took part in the concert were one of the main factors in its success. The selected compositions, representing an uncomplicated mood change, also served as the basis for obtaining positive emotions.
From ancient ages, humans have used symbols and myths to express their experience of a reality that transcends the physical world and transmits it to future generations. Nowadays, famous brands apply mythology to successful products due to their magical power. The logo of the house of Versace is a very extravagant and extraordinary mark; it was designed in 1978 by Gianni Versace. The logo represents the head of the ancient Greek mythology of Medusa Gorgon. The designer explained why he chose this character; it is a synthesis of beauty and simplicity, which is able to mesmerize anyone, just like the clothes produced by the brand. Other examples are Lamborghini; first, the Italian company was engaged in the production of tractors. The bull became the emblem of the brand,
the art of medicine (Travis, 2021). Prometheus was destroying people’s faith in the deity, and for this, the thunderer Zeus decided to punish him. Prometheus was chained to a rock, the sunburned him mercilessly, and the rain was pounding him. However, this was not the end of the titan’s torment; a giant eagle sat on Prometheus’s chest every day and tore his liver (Travis, 2021). Heracles, the strongest men, killed the eagle that tortured Prometheus, broke Prometheus’ chains, and the titan was free.
Chapter 5 of the book talks about the condition of native women in the times of the colonial conquest of the Americas. The invasion of South and North America by the Europeans involved many males coming into contact with the local egalitarian societies. The Algonquian tribes experienced considerable changes in their established social and economic order (Hughes & Hughes, 1997). Before the invasion, the men and women of the tribe equally divided their work and responsibilities. Yet, after the conquest, the men’s work, which was hunting for large game, became more in demand among the Europeans. Moreover, the trade between the tribe and the invaders made some of the women’s work irrelevant, for instance, the creation of certain items which were now replaced by European ones. The Catholic
Jesuits who came to spread Christianity also encouraged the establishment of a patriarchal society and primarily baptized tribal men. Many women opposed conversion to Christianity, but their husbands, brothers, and fathers beat them for their defiance of God.In New Mexico, where the slave trade was the primary source of wealth for the Spanish, Many Indian women were made slaves and used as property without any rights or freedoms. In Barbados, black female slaves were forced to work in fields and were also subject to different types of exportation, including physical, sexual, and emotional ones. In New Spain, the Spanish conquerors established their cultural norms and rules for women, which implied that females had to be sexually pure and practice discretion. As a result, the Spanish often raped and
sexually abused the native women to keep the Spanish ones intact. At the same time, the local population also embraced the Spanish traditions of honor, which once again led to the sexual exploration of native women.Chapter 6 of the book concerns the topics of the role of African women during the 17th century. In the 1660s, a Lutheran pastor who visited the Fetu people described their social activities. As the pastor stated, the Fetu women dressed according to their status in the community and their wealth. The affluent females covered their breasts with silk, while the poorer ones were topless (Hughes & Hughes, 1997). During weddings, the tribe had festive events, and the bridegrooms had to show their generosity. Men could marry several times, yet the first wife
have several husbands, and she ordered all of them to dress in female clothes. Njinga became a successful ruler, led her army in battles, and repelled the attacks of the Portuguese. The chapter also provides information about Eur-African women who were born to European fathers and African mothers. Such women had a marginal status in African societies because they were not recognized by the natives as their family. Thus, Eur-African women, including Betsy Heard, leaned towards their fathers, who provided them with European education. The Eur-African women married other Europeans and thus accumulated resources and status, allowing them to act as intermediaries in the slave trade.
McDonald’s filed a lawsuit in the United States against its former CEO, Steve Easterbrook, after it was revealed that he had several consensual sexual encounters with workers in the year before his leave and maintained them hidden. Easterbrook misled authorities and threw away proof of his wrongdoing; he prioritized his interests over McDonald’s. Shareholders have filed a lawsuit against the corporation for attempting to prevent misbehavior and prioritizing speed over accuracy in resolving the issue. Negligent recruitment and retention responsibility are widely used to describe an employer’s commitment not to recruit or keep a worker (Monteiro et al., 2019). The supervisor was aware of or should have been aware of the likelihood of engaging in behavior against other persons or otherwise subjecting workers or third parties to legal
A commercial business operates by increasing or maintaining profits. However, one of the agency costs is the excessive pre-requestive. This expense allows the contractor to get more, but does not affect the well-being of investors. Shirking of the company’s top management also creates agency costs, as it reduces the productivity of management and creates additional costs for the founders. Therefore, the earnings of other employees may decrease in this regard. In such a situation, a business must consider the ethics of its behavior.Corporate business requires companies to take full responsibility for how the achievement of their goals affects the world around them. Consumers, investors and employees of companies are aware of the possibilities of modern corporations (Bansal et al., 2021). In this regard, it is necessary to direct
them not only to making a profit, but also to improving the life of society as a whole and developing human capital responsibility. The enterprise is obliged to carry out actions aimed at improving the condition of society, and not at its deterioration (Hoffman, 2018). The implementation of corporate social responsibility of the organization also includes responsibility to employees: the provision of an additional social package, which includes the formation of a pension system, medical insurance and recreation.The ethical attitude includes the sensational case of Wells Fargo, one of the largest US banking holdings. In 2016, about 2 million credit cards issued without the knowledge of customers were discovered, the bank was fined $ 185 million, and the management fired about 1,000 employees. Investors were dissatisfied with the
fact that the bank had ceased to be reliable and lost confidence in the eyes of customers, and the public considered the real culprits of what had happened not to junior employees, but to top managers of the company. The profits of the company demonstrated a decline during this period.On the other hand, Nike is deeply convinced that it is possible to implement more sustainable practices in all areas of the company. To reduce the carbon footprint of Nike.com in the US, in 2020 the sports giant announced a partnership with environmental investment fund EFM. With the help of Nike, the foundation was able to plant more than 100 square kilometers of forest plantations to absorb carbon from the Earth’s atmosphere. Proper management and professional tree care increase
Negro spirituals are songs composed by Africans who were abducted and transported to the United States to be sold into slavery. While they were stripped of their languages, families, and culture, their masters could not take away their musical characteristics. A negro spiritual known as Ring Shout uniquely expresses African Christianity. Ring Shout is characterized by hand clapping, footsteps, and other percussion accompanying the lush orchestral singing of the leader and chorus in this folk spiritual. It has a highly stylized religious dance in which participants dance in counter-clockwise circuits (blackhistorywalks 6:24). In the United States, the term “spiritual” is most closely connected with the racial oppression of African Americans. In terms of traditional music, the African American spiritual, also referred to as the Negro Spiritual, is among
the most significant and most prominent cultural practices (blackhistorywalks).A few well-known spirituals are Wallis Willis’ Swing low, dear chariot, and Deep down my heart . (African American Spirituals). The word “spiritual” comes from a King James Bible conversion of Ephesians 5:19: “Speaking to yourself in psalms and hymns and spiritual songs and singing and making melody in your hearts to the Lord.” (African American Spirituals). African slaves held “praise houses” and outdoor assemblies titled bush or camp meetings, and brush arbor meetings where they met informally to discuss their conditions of slavery (African American Spirituals). There were ecstatic trances at the gatherings where people would sing, chant and dance.Enslaved Africans sang about their plight to the American slave lords through the spiritual hymns (blackhistorywalks 5:34). Slave lords let
their slaves follow certain Eurocentric religious rituals, even though they did not have the right to free speech. However, they had no idea that a rich culture full of outstanding and complex songs would arise from that, serving as the soundtrack to some people’s spiritual life (blackhistorywalks). Call and response is a crucial feature of negro spirituals. It later found its way into other musical genres, including the blues and gospel. According to Sonia Caldwell in the documentary Origin of the Negro Spiritual (10:20), as a form of resistance, spirituals were used by enslaved people because they wanted to retain African components in their lives. The negro spiritual is sometimes cited as the source of all subsequent musical styles because of its widespread influence.In the twentieth and twenty-first
in the ring scream felt a sense of accomplishment and camaraderie after the event. Negro spirituals enabled African-Americans to express their identities and capacities. Because of the prejudice of white superiors who were adverse to the results of the Civil War, Negro Spirituals were also immensely popular amongst African Americans. African Americans discovered a means to deal with their misfortunes through spirituals, which is why Negro Spirituals are considered a part of the African American criterion for American Identity. Negro Spirituals inspired African-Americans to unite and fight for their rights, encouraging them to demonstrate their strength in numbers.
When it comes to people I find most fascinating and interesting, Neil deGrasse Tyson is one of them. This man is a famous astrophysicist and planetary scientist who shares his opinions and knowledge on various platforms. Personally, I find the pieces of information he provides mind-opening and shocking at times. I believe that this person knows a lot of controversial information and has various opinions on such matters, which would be pretty interesting to know.Neil deGrasse Tyson was born in 1958 and received several degrees from various universities, including Harvard, the University of Texas at Austin, and Columbia University (Tyson). Additionally, in early 2000, he was appointed by the president to serve on the Commission on the Future of the United States Aerospace Industry (Culp). I am a
chance to talk to this person, I would definitely ask him questions about extraterrestrial life. I have always found it perplexing that our planet is the only planet that has life, and I wonder if Tyson has any theories on this matter. I would also like to ask him whether he knows about any classified information at NASA.Hence, Neil deGrasse Tyson is one of the fascinating people to me. His knowledge and experience inspire me, and I would love to have a chance to talk to him in real life. From this experience, I would like to gain new perceptions and theories on the cosmos and information about outer space, something not commonly discussed. I think this person has more information and opinions to share.
From a personal perspective, Disney+ has all opportunities to unseat Netflix as the leader in video streaming. First of all, the contemporary development of the streaming service industry presupposes the attraction of customers through the brand’s reputation, quality of content, and consumer targeting. In relation to these aspects, The Walt Disney Company has several considerable advantages. It is a well-known international corporation with history and millions of lovers all over the world. It operates across four business units: media networks, studio entertainment, direct-to-consumer and international products, experiences, and parks.At the same time, in relation to streaming, Disney+ surpasses other companies and stands apart from them being an optimal solution in its industry as it provides a combination of modernity and classics, creating an unprecedentedly high quality of entertainment
(Agnihotri & Bhattacharya, 2022). In other words, this platform offers a wide range of exclusive content, from timeless classical movies to the latest releases, with a combination of accessibility and options provided by digital media technologies. In addition, with operation in all four quadrants, Disney+ aims to target literally all population groups covering all major audience demographics. In contrast with Netflix, Disney+ releases more kids and family-friendly content. At the same time, Marvel’s superhero blockbusters and Star Wars-based series also attract and unite people from various backgrounds. In combination with a cost-efficient subscription, the platform’s materials make it highly desirable for consumers who prefer the most convenient type of entertainment for all family members.It goes without saying that Hastings and his team should consider the experience and competitive
advantages of Disney+; however, responding to its development and entering a direct confrontation would be unreasonable. Since 2019, several entertainment conglomerates and technology giants will enter the streaming service space. In general, their strategies will presuppose the availability of predominantly exclusive content and comfortable conditions in relation to prices – thus, every platform will finally have its audience. In this case, Netflix should remain one of the players in the market and follow its strategies by producing and promoting its content. At the same time, it may try new approaches to generate its competitive advantages and unique values.I think that with the development of technologies and digital media, the popularity of traditional media is inevitably decreasing. Netflix was a pioneer in the sphere of streaming services, and its
want to catch Netflix and attract a wider audience, they should enter the streaming service market as well with their unique benefits or generate other customer values.First of all, the success of video streaming is determined by the variety of content and its accessibility. In other words, people are attached to streaming services for the opportunity to choose from big collections of audiovisual materials suitable for all demographic groups and watch them from various devices at a relatively small price at any time and in any place or without even leaving home. Other advantages of video streaming include the simplicity of use and user-friendliness, the availability to control playback and record content, and the accessibility of live events.
It is important to note that brain tissue is among the most complex and intricate structures of the human body, which has a highly limited capacity for healing and regeneration. The topic of the proposed research is to assess how neural stem cells replace and differentiate into neurons and other cells of the brain in order to use them for therapeutic purposes. N eural stems cells must be used as a therapeutic measure to slow or halt the aging process due to their rejuvenation and differentiation capabilities.Organization Plan 1. Introduction. 2. Literature Review. 3. Brain Aging. 4. Neural Stem Cell Differentiation. 5. Differentiation Regulation. 6. Therapeutic Approaches. 7. Discussion. 8. Conclusion.Literature ReviewPart 1The preliminary research suggests that there is a complex system of regulatory steps that involve GABA signaling. There is an array of signaling molecules involved in the ventricular-subventricular zone (V-SVZ) neurogenesis, such as Sonic hedgehog, fibroblast growth factor 2, glutamate, and others. The subgranular zone (SGZ) is another important germinal region of the adult human brain, and the mechanisms of regulations are comparatively different between V-SVZ and SGZ.Part 2For example, a key source of the proposal states that “V-SVZ NSCs are regulated by local signals from their immediate neighbors, as well as by neurotransmitters and factors that are secreted by distant neurons, the choroid plexus, and vasculature” (Obernier & Alvarez-Buylla, 2019, p. 1). In other words, distantly located cells secrete a wide range of signaling molecules to regulate the neural stem cell generation, differentiation, and regeneration processes.Schedule for the Completion of Tasks
The two American regions to be first settled by the English colonists were New England and the Chesapeake Bay. In the Chesapeake Bay, the colonists arrived under the auspices of Virginia Company – a joint-stock enterprise dedicated to colonizing America for profit. Although the early hopes of finding precious metals did not materialize, the region eventually found its economic specialization in growing tobacco (Corbett et al., 2022). The company hired the English poor for the labor-intensive task of growing the colony and producing tobacco, and most of the newcomers were young single males (Corbett et al., 2022). Conversely, the New England colonies followed a different settlement pattern. Unlike the Chesapeake Bay, they were shaped not by the pursuit of profit but by the desire to escape persecution and
A new creation that has recently entered the market is the electric scooter. It quickly gained popularity because it allowed people to rush from one part of the city to another. At the same time, people spent less time because they were not stuck in traffic lights (Hagiu and Wright 1527). Its competitive advantage, though, is that it does not harm the natural environment and requires less energy for maintenance. That is, such scooters use little energy resources to operate and therefore are better than a car (Hagiu and Wright 1527). It should be noted that some electric scooters can be charged by the sun accordingly; it can be described as an uncomplicated device for a low price, which enables to move quickly. Thus, the above advantages contribute
With the current broad variety of species, as well as the emergent news about the species that are on the verge of extinction due to the impact of the changes in the environment, one might believe that discovering new animals is no longer a possibility. However, new species are still discovered regularly, the recent incredible find being an example of that. Namely, the Nimba myotis, also known as the fuzzy orange bat, or Myotis nimbaensis, has been identified as a new species this year (Simmons et al., 2021). Having orange fur with black pigmentation, Nimba Myotis represents a rather unusual specimen of bats. The animal prefers natural caves as the place where it lives and rests. Like other bats, Nimba Myotis uses laryngeal echolocation as the means of
There are many different species of marine microbes that exist in the water in massive amounts. Among the Nitrite oxidizing bacteria, there are six main types: Nitrotoga, Nitrospira, Nitrolancetus, Nitrospina, Nitrobacter, and Nitrococcus (Han 2). One of the fascinating species of bacteria is Nitrobacter which plays a crucial role in the nutrition of plants. Since this is a nitrifying bacterium, it serves as a simple way to release nitrogen that comes out of plants. Therefore, this paper aims to analyze the essence of the Nitrobacter, its specific characteristics its position in the ecosystem.Nitrobacter is the most interesting among the other species because it participates in converting nitrite to nitrates. Nitrification happens due to the receiving of nitrates from ammonia by oxidation, and the process goes with the help
Posture and body motions are examples of body language. A straight stance, for instance, conveys confidence; the same holds true for physical motions. Sitting upright and leaning forward on the chair, for example, displays attention and focus in the debate, but a relaxed reclining back posture may imply apathy or superiority. Although looks might be deceiving, not all of them are when it comes to professional communication. Consider the case of a sales agent offering a high-end fashion item. The clothing and footwear they wore would highlight their personal style as well as their fashion expertise essential for marketing the goods. Gestures are acts that are done automatically or routinely, such as tapping fingernails on a table, bending the head from side to side, or laying palms on
the cheekbones. Even if they are not intended to, certain gestures might communicate the wrong idea. For example, a worker may rest his forehead in his palms when intently pondering, which may be misinterpreted as boredom.In my opinion, I perceive body language nicely. When a person makes some kind of movement in order to pay attention, I always do it. I consider my strongest side in terms of non-verbal communication. This style of communication accompanies everyone from birth, and although this type is well developed for everyone, decoding is not always up to par. Most often, I study body language by analyzing the behavior of people in cafes and other public places; in this way, I get to study the maximum possible number of people, which allows me
to understand them better. Appearance is complex for me, I cannot always understand what a person wants to show with his appearance, but I would like to develop such a skill in myself since, in my opinion, it is essential.The capacity to encode good turn-taking messages can assist in guaranteeing that people can retain the ground when necessary in a discussion or make their way into a discussion effectively, without unfairly disrupting someone or appearing disrespectful. Encoding is the process of converting ideas into information. The encoder sends out a message via media such as a phone call, internet, text or email, face-to-face conference, or another communication device. The amount of conscious thinking that goes into encoding signals varies. Other instructions, diversions, or temptations should be considered by
IntroductionIn every healthcare setting, the need to meet optimal patient care requires nurses to maintain ethical practices and follow the outlined principles effectively. The relationship between the sick individual, relative, and practitioner is vital for ensuring better services to the ailing person. In most cases, nurses are faced with technical situations that require them to make sensible decisions while taking into consideration the welfare of the client and family members (Bratz & Sandoval-Ramirez, 2018).Such challenging moments call for the caregivers to critically apply the principles of beneficence, non-maleficence, autonomy, and justice to ensure they optimally attend to the customers appropriately. Morals allow nurses to detect ethical dilemmas in the work environment and make sound judgments and practical decisions according to their values and beliefs while maintaining their conduct
within the laws that govern their profession.Based on the current health status of Mr. Newcomb, I would approve the request to meet his mistress. First, Mr. Newcomb is at a critical stage of pancreatic cancer, and having in mind all the pain he is going through; it would be appropriate to consider his wish. Currently, he is under hospice care, where the main focus is to ensure he receives quality time and comfort experience before his death time. At this point, anything that makes Mr. Newcomb happy matters most for his life. He needs something that can make him happy to lengthen his days.Disapproving the request would diminish the trust Mr. Newcomb has in me, and he will probably start withdrawing his attention from my services, which will
be disastrous for his health. Therefore, to maintain the connection and ensure he receives quality care, I would ensure his desires are met. The practice will be good for the patient’s health, but for his wife, it would sound like a betrayal. As a nurse, I will make it secret after inquiring about the relationship between Mr. Newcomb and the mistress from him. Once I realize the relationship is healthy, I will formulate a way of allowing the patient to meet his friend.Principle of BeneficenceIn healthcare, the principle of beneficence requires a nurse to be kind and act in a way that benefits the patient. Caregivers are expected to support the welfare of sick individuals by preventing any harm while preserving moral rules (Giles et al., 2018). In
the case of Mr. Newcomb, he wanted to meet his mistress, and the action would bring him joy and happiness that, in return, improved his health condition. Allowing interaction between the patient and the visitor is an act that follows the moral of beneficence. At the same time, keeping it a secret from their wife is protecting him from guilt and fear that would cause his status to deteriorate abnormally, reducing the number of his days to live.Principle of Non-MaleficenceThe principle of non-maleficence prohibits nurse practitioners from engaging in any action intentionally that can harm the patient. Based on the case of Mr. Newcomb, rejecting his request would cause him stress and pain following the sensitiveness of the wish. Therefore, finding a means of giving him a chance
to meet the mistress would be of great help to his care. I already knew that refusing to grant the permission would result in more traumas for the patient; hence, if I declined intentionally, my practice would be against the principle of non-maleficence (Ilkafah et al., 2021). If I weigh the burdens of denying and granting the opportunity, accepting the request presents more benefits to the welfare of Mr. Newcomb, which is necessary for his hospice care management.Principle of AutonomyThe principle of autonomy allows patients to make independent decisions concerning their needs. According to the scenario of Mr. Newcomb, he had the right to moral practice. Therefore, it is ethical to allow him to exercise his capacity of sovereignty. Upon hearing the patient’s request, I would have to
assess his ability to carry on with the wish. If he is capable, then the principle applies, and the individual explores his self-determination. When I allowed Mr. Newcomb to meet his mistress following his decision, I adhered to the practice of autonomy to improve patient care services.Principle of JusticeIn nursing, the principle of justice requires nurses to practice fairness, equitability, and equality for all patients. The moral promotes recognition of a sick person’s dignity irrespective of their status (Silva & Oliveira, 2020). According to the scenario of Mr. Newcomb, I would apply the standard by allowing him to meet his mistress. The practice would follow the requirement of justice, which is to be fair to the patient. Displaying justice would indicate care to the victim hence enhancing his
emotional strength towards the services he is receiving within the facility.Beliefs and ValuesGenerally, personal beliefs and values play a vital role in influencing ethical practice in the work setting. Education, past experience, and culture are key factors that significantly determine how an individual portrays moral behaviors (Sari et al., 2018). I believe in the provision of care for people in need, and the concept has been of great help when it comes to solving dilemmas. According to Mr. Newcomb’s scenario, my decision was greatly influenced by the value of caring, which prompted me to do what was possible to help him relieve the constant pain. Based on my nursing experience, if you prevent patients from what they wish to have, they become depressed and lose trust in the
care provider. Therefore, apart from the principles of ethical conduct, my beliefs and values would form part of the decision I make about a patient’s welfare.Strategies for Promoting Self-CareGenerally, nurses engage in different activities to ensure patients receive the best care services within the facility. It is their responsibility to ensure sick individuals’ well-being is achieved. Their duty requires maximum concentration and focus on ensuring they deliver optimal care to patients. They, therefore, need proper strategies to enable them to improve patients’ self-care to enhance the quality and safety of their health (Wang et al., 2019). The practice allows patients to have good physical and mental health while undergoing medication to enable them to overcome the stress and pain of the disease. Some techniques, such as regular exercise,
maintaining friends, and healthy eating habits, facilitate self-care among patients.Practicing Healthy Eating HabitDifferent categories of meals patients consume have impacts on their health. Nurses should ensure a sick person has a proper balance diet to help build their immune system. They should also make sure sugary foods are not given to the patient because of their adverse effects. Healthy eating habits would allow patients to have enough energy necessary for their physical fitness. Caregivers should encourage patients to consume foodstuffs that would help them have better growth.Regular ExercisePracticing regular physical exercise is essential for the health of a patient. Nurses should advise sick individuals to have a planned routine for engaging in bodily activities. The practice would ensure patients reduce anxiety, depression, and trauma caused by the disorder.
Guaman Poma witnessed the injustices of the colonial government and personally suffered by its hands. He was the descendant of Incan noblemen who grew up after the conquest of Peru by the Spanish. His family was stripped of their lands and titles, and his attempts to regain them were continuously rebuffed by the colonial government (Kilroy-Ewbank, n.d.). Although he initially worked with the colonialists, Poma was exiled for supposedly false claims of nobility and then decided to publicly denounce the Spanish treatment of natives. He published a 1200-page illustrated document addressed to the Spanish king, chronicling the Andean way of life before invasion and the abuses they had suffered since under the Conquistadors.Poma’s manuscript illustrates the full horrors of colonialism and argues that the Spanish were foreign settlers
Young people are known for their desire to change as many things in their life as possible in a short period. They like to make decisions, find opportunities, offer new ideas, and follow their dreams. This is what has recently been happening to me and explains my intention to get accepted to the program in this academic facility. Nursing is not just another career option I want to learn but a field of knowledge that should significantly improve my life. The question of health is more than serious today, and people need additional help and support to cope with an existing variety of diseases, health problems, pandemic-related concerns, and physiological challenges. I am taking a conscious step by applying to this program and choosing nursing and health science
as my major to value care quality and promote health through developing the necessary skills and knowledge.The progress of nursing is remarkable and influential from multiple perspectives. Some people are ready to use any chance to advance this profession, while many individuals believe that this job is full of challenges. Human despair, unpredictable traumas, and innovation aspiration may provoke nursing burnout, anger, and depression (“Health Systems Are Implementing Creative Strategies”). However, modern progress and strategies allow healthcare employees to deal with such situations and predict the growth of negative emotions. Nurses play an important role in human life by supporting, explaining, and encouraging individuals when their health is not stable. I want to become a part of this process and recognize the worth of professional interactions.I understand that
an application to any academic program requires certain skills and evidence that my participation can be beneficial not only for my personal growth but for the people who contribute to my professionalism. At my 22, I cannot say that I am too experienced in many nursing activities, but I am confident that I am ready to study and appreciate each piece of information I am offered. I am a quick learner and observer, which, I think, is critical in health and nursing care. I also comprehend that nursing is a constantly developing field, and it is necessary to investigate most of the time, including reading journal articles, participating in conferences, and commenting on forums. I am a communicative person, and interpersonal cooperation is a core aspect of any
The nurse needs to get information on Alyssa’s health history and the physical assessment results to propose adequate interventions. Alyssa was diagnosed with Ventricular Septal Defect (VSD), which may be an additional risk factor for other heart problems. The girl’s current symptoms include noticeably rapid heartbeat, dizziness, pale complexion, and increased sweating. She has already experienced the same symptoms, which denotes that her condition might be reoccurring. The nurse needs to evaluate the cardiac output rate formed by the heart rate and the stroke volume, heart sounds, and calcium level (Hinkle & Cheever, 2018). The physical assessment results may indicate some acquired cardiovascular condition, such as supraventricular tachycardia (SVT), which major symptom is the increased heart rate (Hinkle & Cheever, 2018). The information obtained from the physical assessment
will influence the nursing plan and the necessary nursing interventions.The nurse should support Alyssa and closely monitor her condition. The first priority nursing intervention is assessing heart rate and blood pressure (Nurseslabs, 2019). The rationale for it is that it is important to monitor these indicators as compensatory tachycardia and decreased blood pressure may indicate reduced cardiac output (Nurseslabs, 2019). The second nursing intervention is monitoring an electrocardiogram (ECG) for heart rate, rhythm, and ectopy (Nurseslabs, 2019). It will help detect cardiac dysrhythmias and tachycardia that affect cardiac output (Nurseslabs, 2019). The nursing third intervention includes providing adequate rest periods that decrease myocardial and oxygen demand (Nurseslabs, 2019). These are three important interventions that Alyssa’s nurse must perform.Another important intervention is the administration of the prescribed medication –
adenosine. Adenosine is one of the drugs included in the list of antiarrhythmic agents (Karch, 2020). Adenosine decelerates “conduction through the atrioventricular (AV) node, prolongs the refractory period, and decreases automaticity in the AV node” (Karch, 2020, p. 1960). It has a short duration of action (about 15 seconds) and may have only a few negative side effects, including headache, flushing, and dyspnea of short duration (Karch, 2020, p.1960). Antiarrhythmic drugs are not usually prescribed to children unless they had cardiac surgery or, as in Alyssa’s case, have congenital heart issues (Karch, 2020). Thus, Alyssa should be monitored by the nurse after the drug’s administration to detect possible adverse effects (Karch, 2020). This is the key pharmacologic and administration information on adenosine.The nurse needs to provide adequate patient
A protein-restricted diet involves the reduced intake of protein foods that constitutes an individual’s daily calories. This diet is typically prescribed to control specific medical conditions such as kidney and liver diseases. These foods include eggs, nuts, salmon, chicken, and beef, containing high protein levels (Suzuki et al., 2018). Therefore, a low intake of proteins is a dietary style preferred for geriatric patients considering that their metabolism slows down in senior age, indicating that high-protein foods could result in weight gain and other diseases (Mirzaei et al., 2017). Therefore, an inclusive nutritional teaching strategy on low protein intake among geriatric patients is integral in promoting a healthy lifestyle.There are various risks associated with aging, including low immunity, unhealthy eating patterns, and the reoccurrence of chronic medical conditions such
as diabetes and hypertension. In addition, when people age, their immune system reduces significantly due to the less production of the B and T cells that help fight against illnesses when they occur (Suzuki et al., 2018). Similarly, senior people are prone to developing unbalanced dietary systems due to social-economic factors such as a lack of a certified caregiver and finances to access healthier food choices. Additionally, geriatrics suffers from degenerative diseases such as dementia, affecting their judgment and nutritional choices (Mirzaei et al., 2017). Therefore, effective training in self-management is integral in facilitating change among this population of people. For example, patient M is a 68years African American male diagnosed with polycystic kidney disease (Suzuki et al., 2018). He is reported to have been taking half a
pound of meat and three eggs daily. He mentioned that he loves his eggs and meat every day, and he feels happy and satisfied after taking the meal.When asked about the dangers of his dietary pattern, he said nothing is wrong with eating since proteins are the building blocks of body tissues and muscles. As a retired bodybuilder, he still loves big muscles and maintains a high-protein diet to sustain his physique. However, his responses indicate a man with information distorted from the truth. Therefore, considering his medical history and age, he must be put on a low-protein diet since both variables put him at risk of experiencing health deterioration (Mirzaei et al., 2017). Additionally, he needs training on the best dietary behaviors to maintain a healthy lifestyle.Considering
maintain the stipulated diet (Suzuki et al., 2018). For instance, African Americans love soya and beans, which can be used instead of eggs and meat. The client will also be taught how to interpret the nutritional label to make informed choices. For instance, the patient will understand that 100 calories per serving are recommended and considered moderate through learning and discovery (Mirzaei et al., 2017). Therefore and anything beyond that mark has detrimental effects on health.
The two stories “The Tell-Tale Heart” by Edgar Allen Poe and “The Gift of the Magi” by O. Henry were examples of their authors’ writing talent. O. Henry and Poe were writers from separate eras; however, some similarities can be found in these stories, especially in terms of literary techniques employed. At the same time, the two stories differ in that they adopt distinct approaches to societal tensions and emphasize various parts of these and challenges.“The Gift of the Magi” deals with a couple named James and Della, who eventually sold their most valuable belongings to buy each other presents for Christmas. Della discovers a set of pricey ornate hair combs, but they are worthless because she chopped off her hair to purchase Jim a chain for his
watch, which he subsequently sold to give her a gift (O. Henry). In certain socioeconomic situation (the couple is impoverished), O. Henry employs irony to show the situation in which a person can give up the most precious thing to show love.The major components of which “The Gift of the Magi” is being built up are irony and selfless love. While O. Henry’s story explores the positive aspects of these concepts, Poe delves into more negative, darker dimensions through the narratives of mental disorder. “The Gift of the Magi” became one of the foremost literary examples of irony (Sushma). Jim and Della offer their most valued belongings in this case so that the others might completely appreciate their gift. Jim sells his watch to purchase Della’s combs, anticipating
that she will utilize them, while Della sells her hair to buy a present for Jim. Neither of them expects the other to go to such lengths. The irony here is effective on both a practical and a deeper, emotive level (Zafarovna). Della and Jim both purchase each other a gift that turns out to be financially foolish. They cannot spend money on stuff they won’t use since they’re impoverished. They do, however, receive something they did not expect: a present that reminds them of how much they love one other and are prepared to go to great lengths to make each other happy (Zafarovna). They offered each other the most powerful statement of their love they could muster.One of Poe’s shortest stories, “The Tell-Tale Heart,” deals with
paranoia and mental disintegration. While in “The Gifts of Magi” the aspect of mental illnesses is omitted, more focusing on the general assumptions of hardships of living being impoverished, Poe, as in most of his stories, delves into deeps of human mentality. In this story, Poe delves into a psychological mystery: why individuals damage those they love or need in their life (Bloom). Po, the narrator, adores the elderly gentleman. He is not envious of the elderly man’s fortune (he, himself, is impoverished), nor is he vengeful about minor matters. In this approach, the narrator removes potential reasons for a crime (Alsahafi). The narrator, claiming his own sanity, is fixated on the old man’s vulture look. In the end, the narrator further dehumanizes the elderly man by murdering
him and dismembering his victim. The narrator validates his theory that the old man’s eye is distinct from him by fully killing him and dividing him into several bits (Poe). The protagonist, on the other hand, ironically confesses to the crime when the police turn up. Poe’s stories are known for literally bringing the dead back to life by utilizing memory as a trigger to bring them back to life (Alsahafi). He identifies the bothering sound as the old man’s heart beating beneath the floorboards, which completely ruins his mental health.To make their stories more interesting for readers, O. Henry and Poe employed suspense, irony, or both. Irony has become a common thread running through both works, making them very similar in this aspect of their use of
literary devices. Both O. Henry and Poe became well known for the twist endings, an unexpected outcome leading to a reassessment of the initial positions of their characters. However, the aspects of irony explored by authors are completely different. In “The Gifts of the Magi,” the irony brings the story to somewhat of a happy end. The ironic outcome of the gifts exchange serves as a bridge to the understanding of love, that is, sacrificing the most precious possessions (Sushma). Poe’s narrative is way darker in this regard, leading a reader not to expect the confession of a murderer, who is suddenly disturbed my ‘a heart pounding’.Poe often employs dramatic irony, such as the narrator’s kindness to an elderly man a week before he murders him. The reader
would not anticipate the narrator to be courteous to the elderly guy before killing him, therefore thus being a dramatic irony. Another ironic metaphor is situational, as the elderly gentleman keeps his windows securely shut due to his fear of intruders (Alsahafi). It is ironic since the narrator, who lives with him, is the only burglar near his house.In both stories, the authors deal with impoverished protagonists who are going through a difficult time. This makes another point of comparison between stories. There are certain socioeconomic parallels between characters, and the environment is also nearly the same, namely, a modest flat. Moreover, both take place in the winter, one in January and the other at the turn of the century around Christmas time. The difference in socioeconomic conflicts,
Millions of people worldwide suffer from mental disorders: manias, phobias, and panic attacks exhaust and torment a lot of individuals. One of the widespread, long-lasting mental ailments is an obsessive-compulsive disorder or OCD, which consists of obsessive thoughts and compulsive behavior that are almost impossible to control. The analysis of this disorder due to the four D diagnostic indicators can let us explore it more profoundly and thoroughly.  * Distress: OCD often makes individuals feel abnormal when they are forced to fight the terrible thoughts torturing their heads and repeat meaningless acts intended to decrease anxiety. In addition, having “unwanted, recurrent and persistent images or impulses that evoke anxiety or extreme distress” and realizing “the unreasonable nature of symptoms” people cannot stop them (Van Leeuwen et al.,
2020, p. 1-2). They become nervous and depressed: therefore, the level of distress is high and complicates the person’s life.  * Dysfunction: This disorder significantly influences the daily life of a patient. Firstly, obsessive thoughts often interfere with the usual people’s acts and cause a surge of panic, disturbing to complete their work. Sometimes, “cognitive biases cause dysfunctional beliefs” (Van Leeuwen et al., 2020, p. 2). Secondly, compulsive actions interrupt a patient’s daily routine, forcing them to do specific steps a certain number of times. Such activities can last even for an hour or more: therefore, the extent of dysfunction is also noticeable.  * Danger: OCD may represent a significant danger for an individual since sometimes, people feel so depressed that they are ready to commit
OCD is to harm others, they rarely do it (O’Connor & Aude, 2019). Thus, the level of danger to self is significantly higher than that of danger to others.  * Deviance: Since OCD causes abnormal thoughts and behavior, people with such a disorder can be characterized as deviant. However, it would be wrong to claim that it is easy to “determine the degree of deviation from the norm” (Davis, 2009, p. 1). OCD causes anxiety, stress, and panic; it makes people live in fear that if they do not do specific actions, they will not be able to avoid danger. Therefore, an individual should visit a clinic and let specialists help them fight.

The IDS is an intrusion detection system that helps people quickly identify potential security breaches in a device or network. There are several types of IDS, the main ones being HIDS and NIDS. These IDSs are focused on different analytics and data control. For all IDSs, the main advantage is a quick notification system about an attack or file deletion. Saving time and committing changes allows administrators to take action to protect information as soon as possible.NIDS analyze incoming and internal network traffic; the purpose of the analysis is to detect malicious activity. However, when port coverage is disabled, additional sensors should be installed, and this is the main problem of NIDS (Magalhaes, 2018). This is due to the fact that the switch does not directly transmit the
packet to the entire network, but only to the recipient. This arguably makes working with NIDS difficult, forcing administrators to do extra work.HIDS are tools that control the operation of individual devices. Typically, HIDS captures the status of all files hosted on an endpoint and informs the administrator when system objects are removed or modified. In addition, this kind of IDS checks all data packets transmitted to or from the device (Magalhaes, 2018). HIDS usually has advantages over NIDS, and administrators find that HIDS is ideal for laptops, servers, and workstations.HIDS and NIDS can be compared in different ways, and analytics show that HIDS more often outperforms or is not inferior to NIDS, at least. HIDS protects files even if the administrator is disconnected from the LAN because
HIDS is installed on the device directly. The ideas about the universality of HIDS are also connected with this fact. HIDS and NIDS are equally easy to implement and easy to control (Magalhaes, 2018). The most important advantage of HIDS is that it is not necessary to go through training before using it. This makes HIDS the most desirable for most administrators, along with the price of HIDS, which is significantly lower than NIDS. NIDS also uses the bandwidth of the LAN, which leads to increased requirements for it.The general advice for administrators is to use HIDS and NIDS together on firewalls and clients, even though it may seem reasonable to use only HIDS. In the modern world, protecting information from intruders is equivalent to protecting money from
In the survey The Effect Of Work Relationships On Organizational Culture And Commitment, as many as 89% of respondents confirmed that communication with colleagues affects the quality of life (Suhardi, 2020). It also turned out that if a person has at least one friend at work, it connects him more strongly with the company and supports his desire to stay in this place. Feeling connected to other people supports employees’ interest and involvement in work. Talking to colleagues, a person gradually gets rid of the fear of expressing their ideas and comments.Scientists from the University of Michigan conducted an interesting experiment, Friends (and Sometimes Enemies) With Cognitive Benefits: What Types of Social Interactions Boost Executive Functioning? The participants were divided into two groups: first, the first group subjects had to get to know each other for 10 minutes. And the second group was asked to participate in disputes among themselves on a certain topic. Then all the subjects were asked to solve several cognitive tasks. The experiment participants from the first group, who had previously just communicated in a relaxed atmosphere, showed the best results in solving problems. They had significant improvements in the executive functions of the brain. These processes are responsible for planning, concentration, prioritization, and organization. In other words, for the skills and qualities that we need to work.
As a matter of fact, organizational factors play a highly essential role in the implementation and change of strategies, policies, and action plans in healthcare settings and determine their success. Thus, understanding and addressing organizational culture (OC) have become essential for achieving improved healthcare performance. This work aims to investigate the importance of OC for infection prevention and control (IPC) interventions, the theoretical basis of necessary cultural changes, and the role of leadership in them.In general, no common definition may unite all aspects of OC in it. However, the most appropriate one was probably given by Shein, who stated that OC is “the pattern of basic assumptions that a given group has invented, discovered, or developed in learning to cope with its problems of external adaptation and internal
integration, and that has worked well enough to be considered valid, and, therefore to be taught to new members as the correct way to perceive, think, and feel in relation to those problems” (De Bono et al., 2014, p. 2). Moreover, the collective mental programming on the basis of core values, rules, attributes, norms, and assumptions distinguishes the members of different organizations (Valmohammadi & Roshanzamir, 2015). As healthcare-associated infections currently remain one of the most substantial challenges to medical institutions, the efficient implementation of infection prevention and control (IPC) interventions helps to reduce infection-related incidents (De Bono et al., 2014). However, effective IPC heavily depends on multiple management systems’ interplay influenced by OC. In particular, the organization’s design and the arrangement of different jobs are the main components
of culture that determine employee behavior. In turn, employee behavior impacts the prevention and control of infectious diseases.Several theories related to cultural change are essential for implementing interventions that include the cultural adaptation theory, the self-efficacy theory, and the transformational theory of leadership. The first one describes cultural change as the generation of value in response to changing conditions. It explains the necessity for changes in OC in response to new challenges. The self-efficacy theory refers to employee behavior change and designates four modalities, including performance enactment on the basis of a person’s belief in his abilities, vicarious learning by watching others, verbal persuasion that modifies behavior, and emotional arousal (De Bono et al., 2014). Finally, the transformational leadership theory emphasizes leaders’ exclusive role in cultural change.Although several
Osteoarthritis is a disease that affects people all over the world, but is frequently mishandled within the healthcare system. It is one of the most common causes of disability in older persons, resulting in pain, loss of function, and a lower quality of life. On a societal level, the condition is predicted to cost $303 billion in medical bills and lost wages each year (Abramoff & Caldera, 2020). This chronic, severe disease requires continued efforts to limit its incidence, pain, and loss of function.Osteoarthritis is known for its degenerative effects on articular cartilage, which becomes significantly damaged over time. The smooth cartilage at the ends of long bones and within the intervertebral discs is known as articular cartilage. It provides a low-friction articulation surface while being able to
Autumn is not generally viewed as an appropriate season for having a garage sale, not to mention that one on a scale of a local community. However, what makes my neighbourhood particularly unique and different from others is its consistent inability to meet expectations (Pyrkosz 147). Either due to some event that occurred too long ago for any of the neighbours to remember or care, or out of sheer need to have something extravagant in the midst of one of the least unpredictable seasons ever, my community has a massive garage sale every autumn. Although the weather and the lingering threat of health issues complicated the task, the community garage sale carried out last fall was one of the highlights of its members’ public life due to the
opportunity to communicate and share memories, objects, and ideas.The range and diversity of the items that our numerous neighbours and community members offered as sales items could easily make one feel surprised. Though being admittedly cheap and often worn-out, these items told exciting stories about the lives of their owners (Hassan 68). For instance, some of the kitchenware sold during the event was quite old, with the style thereof allowing tracking down its origin to quite far back in the past. Though these items were certainly not of high price, they still led to rather fascinating revelations about the cultural legacy of their owners and their fascinating life stories.As it often happens during large garage sales, there was some drama. For instance, one of the neighborhood children recognized
one of their treasured possessions among the sold items, causing quite a stir. Luckily, the buyer was understanding enough and returned the purchase, which turned out to be a collection of action figures, without any questions. It was truly heartwarming to observe the understanding and cooperation that buyers showed during that garage sale.Furthermore, it was worth noting that a substantial portion of the money collected during the garage sale was donated to assist those in need. Specifically, those suffering from the coronavirus, as well as members of impoverished communities and several local charities, were provided with a portion of the finances form the yard sale. Though the event resulted in a rather humble outcome, the money donated to the specified parties were definitely used to improve the lives
Family relations are becoming increasingly important in the modern world. This cell of society has the opportunity to form the most favorable conditions for future generations. That is why it is necessary to research and find ways to solve problems, difficulties and disagreements between husbands and wives. This is also critically important due to the fact that even at present, the deterioration of family ties will negatively affect not only society, but also the psychological and physical health of individuals (Salinger and Whisman, 2021). At the moment, the Western model of marital relations is particularly widespread, where the relationship is based on friendliness and taking into account the person’s personality as the most important indicator. It is important to note the fact that the relationship between spouses is
a direct reflection of the trends in the development of society. This is due to the fact that social conditions are constantly changing and transforming, presenting new requirements to the institution of the family. Hence, recently, the roles of husband and wife have been changing in values. There are often cases where a woman becomes the breadwinner of the family and assumes all responsibility, becoming a leader. However, an integral part of the union of men and women is following religious concepts. Moreover, faith emphasizes the preservation of traditional ideological values. The way people will relate to faith can be passed on to the next generations, which will have both a positive and non-negative character. That is why it is necessary to grow children taking into account religion
based on mutual understanding, love and empathy.Modern society, despite its rapid development, is characterized by a sufficient number of social problems. The need to solve them is to improve people’s relationships for the further well-being of other generations. Hence, one of the important questions is the survey of marital relations and issues that may arise in them. It should be noted that in this aspect, the importance of religion and its postulates plays an important role. Thus, this work examines the problems of matrimony, the ways to solve them and the use of faith for a better understanding of the problem.Therefore, more and more literature and scientific works appear on the topic of the relationship between husband and wife. Moreover, special attention is paid to their influence both
on social life and on the psychological and physical condition of the spouses (Masoumi et al., 2017). The family as an institution of society occupies one of the central places, therefore it is characterized by increased interest from researchers in various fields. Similarly, this aspect attracts religion into its component, since it can become both a way of uniting spouses and a cause of disagreement. Despite this, most of the studies prove the positive influence of faith on this type of people’s relationships.For these reasons, it is necessary to fully understand the marital relationship, which is characterized by constant changes over time. It is also influenced by such external factors as modernization and globalization. To a greater extent, they influenced the development of the concept of a friendly
marriage, which has the features of a partnership relationship, where both parts consciously approach solving many issues and understanding what is happening. However, even in this case, negative and stressful situations may arise that require timely solutions and a sober attitude (Masoumi et al., 2017). Moreover, such healthy relationships are described by a high degree of closeness of spouses, a special level of affection, mutual understanding and empathy.The development of technology and changes in social values have a special effect on the institution of marriage. Hence, in modern society, there is such a type of nuclear family, where a man is engaged in mining to ensure the material side of the family, and a woman is more often engaged in preserving the hearth and caring for children. However,
it is also possible to have families where these roles change and the woman is engaged in earnings, and the man is engaged in household aspects. In addition, the Western family model is spreading all over the world, where the main component is just the same friendly relations, and then romantic ones.Therefore, the modern Western model of the family is characterized by a focus on the personality of the partners, and not on the economic or status component. Unlike past experience, in society, first of all, people choose their life partners based on certain qualities, and then according to the level of wealth and position. Moreover, the age gap between generations is growing, which complicates the relationship between, for example, children and parents. This is due to the
shift in the pace of formation and establishment of the individual. Family values and patterns of behavior are also changing, adaptation to which may cause some disagreements and issues. The leader in the family is not always the male breadwinner, which also has its own special influence.A stable and satisfying marriage can become an important source of emotional and instrumental support throughout adult life. In addition, it is associated with increased economic well-being, mental and physical health (Rajabi et al., 2020). Some of these obvious advantages of marriage may be the result of improved health behavior among married people, care and control by a spouse, or, first of all, the selection of the healthiest, happiest and economically well-off men and women in stable marriages. Although the exact nature
of the processes leading to these positive outcomes is not entirely clear, marriage is associated with important benefits for older Americans.It is worth noting that the close relationship between spouses is based on emotional support and trust. It is these aspects that will contribute to such a concept as a healthy marriage. The difference of interests in a couple can also become a way of bonding. Even if they are different, the main thing is to enjoy each other’s company. Moreover, a healthy relationship between husband and wife is a means of well-being and makes it possible to effectively manage emerging stresses. Conflict situations and problems in this case do not disappear anywhere, but they can be solved much faster and manifest themselves much less often. Moreover, when
dealing with different isuues, spouses are even more united and can bring more benefits to society.Thus, as already mentioned, stressful situations are inevitable and their solution is sometimes quite difficult. One of these problems may be the financial side of creating and maintaining a family. This issue is more often mentioned in the sources and may have one of the most harmful effects. It is noted that disputes over money often conceal the desire to have power over the cell of society. Moreover, it can be caused by different views on the family structure and values that one of the spouses has formed during the formation of personality. Thus, this problem increases the occurrence of difficulties, negatively affecting the psychological state of the husband or wife.The next problem
is everything related to the birth and upbringing of children. These family members generally always contribute to increasing tension in the family, especially at the stages of preparation for parenthood and in the first period of caring for offspring. On the other hand, children in family relationships can significantly affect the cohesion, improvement of their responsibilities and care (Mahoney et al., 2021). With the advent of new family shuttles, however, the spouses manage to pay less and less attention to each other, which also causes conflicts and disputes.Daily stress in everyday life also has its contribution. Sometimes. It may be insignificant, but over time, tension can accumulate and become the result of a strong conflict. Under such conditions, it is important to see the irritated or depressed state
of the partner. This will help to regulate stress and avoid possible consequences. Successful stress management promotes the development of emotional support skills, which will help with a possible recurrence of the situation.The next problem that needs to be mentioned is the lack of time. It can be caused by many factors, but most often occurs due to the work schedule of one of the spouses. This situation affects not only the mental, but also the physical health of the spouses. A husband and wife may feel alienated and deprived of their former strong bond. Because of this, an issue of communication problems may leak out, which will disrupt the dynamics of the functioning of the family institution. Sometimes, analyzing the interaction of spouses based on their way
of communication can immediately make it clear whether their marriage will last or not. The positive side is the fact that all of the above problems can be easily solved. If attempts to fix the situation on their own fail, many couples can turn to the help of family therapy. This aspect of working with a specialist, as if by an outside spectator, will help to come to a balanced decision and change the spouses’ ideas about the importance and criticality of any problem.Religion and theology also pay considerable attention to how the institution of family relations develops in modern society. Thus, research comes to the conclusion that faith can contribute to both improvement and deterioration of the situation in the family (Kelley et al., 2020). A special
place should be given to religion in the issue under study, since without God there is no real and sincere humanity in people, thereby proper relationships cannot be formed. Thus, based on the postulates of faith, it is possible to deepen and improve the understanding of such a social phenomenon as family relations and their problems. Moreover, this knowledge contributes to a more effective analysis of changes in this institution over time and the identification of future trends in its development. Without taking into account religious aspects, people risk getting rid of the understanding of the main values and the role of creating a family, which will have a negative impact in the future.On the part of theology, in contrast to more methodical data, three main points can
be distinguished in family relations. Certain roles must be formed between the spouses, which were prescribed to them by the Almighty. This type of relationship requires the creation of bonds of dependence and service between the wife and husband. Further, these vocations of the spouses have a justification in the grace of Jesus himself, which determines the essence of the marital relationship. It also helps to cope better with conflict situations and brings a man and a woman closer to faith. In addition, the conclusion of marriage ties implies the creation of a community of love and life, forming a kind of home church. However, due to the fact that this aspect is increasingly ignored in modern society, many difficulties arise. Due to the distance of people from
faith, the moment of spirituality disappears and a moral distortion of society arises.Moreover, there is an increasing tendency among men and women to dissolve marital ties. This is due to the rejection of religious values, whether it is the faith of one of the spouses or the complete absence of it from the husband and wife. It is worth agreeing that religion and spirituality do not have such a significant role in the formation of romantic relationships, but in the future they should gain more power and authority. If people overlook this fact, the situation in the family can significantly worsen and lead to undesirable consequences (Aman et al., 2019). in the longer term, spiritual contradictions can worsen, expand and undermine romanticism in relationships. Taking into account religion
can give partners the opportunity to unite and avoid the occurrence of stressful cases.It is worth noting that the religious views of parents in the future strongly affect their children. This fact is especially valuable because it has a role in shaping future generations and how the society of the future will view religion. Thus, families where concepts such as pacification, harmony and mutual support in religious matters are neglected, much more issues occur. In other cases, children and parents find a source of peace and interest at the same time, depriving family members to commit sinful acts. Among the practices that must be had in every family, holding a joint prayer is noted, which has a beneficial effect (King et al., 2020)health. Thus, the members of this
the study and analysis of family relations is of valuable importance. This activity will contribute to a deeper and clearer understanding of this public institution and minimize the occurrence of problems related to marriage. Naturally, the creation of a family is accompanied by many difficulties, but with a sober look at the relationship between husband and wife, it will help to solve them in a timely and effective manner. Moreover, regardless of methodological research and data, it is important to take into account such an aspect as religion. It plays an important role in family relations, as it contributes to the creation of cohesion and mutual understanding in the family.
In order to prevent an offense and draw up a protocol on an administrative offense, the authorized person has the right to apply such a measure to ensure production as the detention of a vehicle. This happens if it is impossible to draw it up on the spot of detecting an administrative offense, ensuring timely and correct consideration of the case and execution of the resolution. In case of violations of the rules of operation, use of the vehicle, and its management, the detention of the vehicle is applied. This is due to placement in the nearest specially designated protected place (in a specialized parking lot), and storage there until the cause of detention is eliminated.The costs of moving and storing a detained vehicle, with the exception of
vehicles, are reimbursed by the person who committed the offense. The cost of storing a detained vehicle is charged for each full hour of its stay in a specialized parking lot from the moment the detained vehicle is placed in a specialized parking lot until it is returned to the owner. Payment for the cost of moving and storing a detained vehicle is carried out within the time limits and at the rates established by the authorized executive authority. The prices of the parking lot owner, which should be involved in payment, should also be taken into account. Thus, attention should also be paid to the fact that Outback Insurance Company was notified by the parking lot owner and by the police. However, it should be noted that
the company “took no action to take possession of the vehicle”.Consequently, they were fully aware of the situation and had to take appropriate measures. The fee for the car storage services should be charged to the owner of the vehicle, who has not fulfilled their obligation to receive the car from the special parking lot, while the storage services have been provided in full. From the analysis of the above legal norms, it follows that legally significant circumstances for the correct resolution of this dispute are determining the number of reimbursable expenses incurred by a person in connection with the storage of a car. However, it should be noted that Outback Insurance Company has the right to demand a revision of the cost of payment in accordance with
Outreach Chicago is an organization providing help and services to homeless people and those underserved by already existing incorporations. The company’s main mission is to provide help and necessities to humans for their subsequent successful reintegration into society. To practice deductive reasoning, it is essential to start by formulating a general hypothesis or statement that Outreach Chicago provides help to people (Adler & Clark, 2015). The observation allows us to find evidence for the statement as Outreach Chicago serves meals and distributes hygiene kits, coats, blankets, socks, and undergarments to people in need. The company’s official site provides precise numbers of each aid type, so one can conclude that the company indeed provides help with various necessities since 2011 to people in need.Outreach Chicago states the average poverty
rate in its area of performance is 34% among adults and 51% among children (Outreach Chicago, 2022). To practice inductive reasoning, it might be useful to compare data stated by the company with the other statistical sources regarding poverty rates, checking the modernity of the information it proposes to the readers. The company works in several locations: Chicago Heights, Chicago, Cicero, Dolton, and Harvey (Outreach Chicago, 2022). The estimations, according to the site Welfare Info, relate to the following poverty rates among adults in 2017 26.4%, 20.6%, 19.8%, 26.6%, and 35.6% respectively (Poverty Illinois, 2022). The calculated average of these areas is 25.8% which means the company was either gathering data from previous years or referring to the numbers of the poorest city, Harvey.A question for qualitative research
customers. This research can interview customers and assess the impression of service, and the use of the goods it supplies. The study hypothesizes that Outreach Chicago provides essential supplies for its clients. The results of the research could be used for better service providing as customers can give feedback on some items that are not necessary or could be changed.For the quantitative study, the question is if the general satisfaction level of the clients is above 50%. To estimate satisfaction, the clients will be given application forms to fill in. The research hypothesizes that Outreach Chicago meets the expectations of the customers by more than 50%. The research can help the organization receive information about the effectiveness of its performance.
Overpopulation in cities has become one of the most critical problems of our time. This is both an environmental and a social problem. The city cannot grow indefinitely and provide decent workplaces for every resident. The ecological burden is also increasing. Uncontrolled growth in the number of cities leads to the unchecked spread of pollution and the escalation of poverty. However, there are several preventive measures that the Government can implement to combat this problem.First of all, overpopulation in cities is congestion and traffic jams, which lead to serious pollution problems. Atmospheric pollution is the most serious in cities, and its primary source is road transport, which emits sulfur dioxide and nitrogen into the air in huge quantities. The second main problem is poverty: disadvantaged groups in rural
are incinerated at incinerators.In conclusion, to solve traffic and air pollution problems, people should use public transport as often as possible, rather than using their car. The government should build more roads and improve public transport to solve this problem. Poverty is now lower than at any time in human history, and all trends demonstrate that we will have consistent successes in the fight against poverty in the foreseeable future.
The Balboa is Panama’s national currency, named after Spanish explorer Vasco Nez de Balboa, who encountered the Pacific Ocean. One Balboa represents one U.S. Dollar, and the U.S. Dollar has been lawfully exchanged in Panama since then. As a result, Panama is regarded a highly inflationary country; however, Panama can profit from the U.S. dollar’s resilience as the foundation of the world banking markets. For example, this implies that Panama will not face hyperinflation as a consequence of shifting exchange rates. Consequently, Panama has become a more attractive investment and tourist destination. Nevertheless, a dollarized system has outstanding inflation performances and may even lessen the influence of global trust shocks but not real external upsets (Bakari & Mabrouki, 2017). Furthermore, it is unclear whether Panama’s loose monetary policy resulted from the dollarization system or the competing, increasingly globalized banking sector.Panama’s geographic position as a key maritime route adds to the significance of the Agreement. Approximately two-thirds of the Panama Canal’s yearly transits are destined to or from U.S. locations (Park et al., 2020). Almost all U.S. automotive and commercial goods shipments to Panama will be duty-free initially, with residual levies phased away over a ten-year period (Park et al., 2020). Information systems gear, farming, large machinery, aircraft and components, healthcare and measure environmental, ecological products, medicines, fertilizer, and agrochemicals are among the U.S. items that will benefit from immediate duty-free accessibility. The U.S. and Panama exchange crops like corn and bananas if we talk about exports and imports.
Childhood has the most direct impact on a person’s adult life since it is the first step in the socialization process. Unfortunately, not all parents understand effective methods of upbringing, do not realize the value of a favorable environment for the child’s independence, and neglect the appearance of the youth’s emotional anticipation. It is a severe issue that requires broadening the knowledge of the theoretical bases of the family relations structure. One alternative that can promote the growth of skills and erudition of parents is studying online resources. Parenthub is a quality option with a sufficient amount of theory and approaches of its practical application to promote children’s mental and physical health.Parenthub is a resource that provides access to materials on interacting with children from their conception to
adulthood. One can read about pregnancy, parenting, psychology, children’s education, family connections, eating habits, and householding. Complex relationships between kids and their parents are always psychological and mental trauma, which can provoke severe depression and destroy the most fundamental instinct – self-preservation (Idris & Ahmad, 2020). The online resource contributes to the solution of this concern at the early stages when contact is just being constructed, and approaches to family links can still be modified.For a child, the household is the primary environment for living, developing, and becoming a whole person. Kids learn to recognize the world, grasping the basic mechanisms of cognition and interpersonal relationships from the family (Chen et al., 2022). Therefore, the relationship with parents determines the basic skills, abilities, and psychological qualities, since children
are imitators, beginning to learn the basics of communication from infancy. However, not all parents understand the vital role of contact and often inadequately assess the child’s activities. They do not support the youngsters’ self-esteem, have hardship determining their emotional state, and cannot establish a partner connection.Parenthub offers access to numerous resources on childrearing to construct a strong relationship. It provides articles from experts in diverse fields, from medicine and psychology to physical education and nutrition. Thus, this Internet resource supplies comprehensive parenting training and promotes an understanding of the child’s peculiarities in the different stages of growing up. In addition, there is the possibility of an open forum so that everyone can share their own experiences or ask for help from those who have already experienced upbringing
hardships. The site is split into categories, and therefore the search is quick and efficient. One can search for the necessary materials by keyword or read all the available information, divided according to kids’ age. The functionality of the Internet resource is comprehensive, and the level of maneuverability is high, which contributes to the convenient use and activity of visitors.Thus, the parent-child relationship is crucial for forming a complete personality. The website provides filtered and expertly approved information on topics of concern. It offers quality training in building competent communication with the child, from birth to adulthood. Moreover, this resource is vital for nurses, who need to understand that children’s health, growth, and development occur in the context of their connection with parents. Health is either maintained or
AbstractObjectiveThis paper’s objective is to discuss the pathophysiology of intraoperative hypotension, or low blood pressure, with a focus on the causes of hypotension occurring at the cellular/receptor level.BackgroundIntraoperative hypotension (IOH) is a major factor associated with postoperative complications and high rates of mortality following non-cardiac surgery. The incidence varies according to the definition of IOH used by physicians and the causes of the condition. Even though there is no single definition of what can be considered intraoperative hypotension, physicians commonly use the indication of mean arterial pressure less than 65 mmHg. Despite the variations in defining hypotension and its symptoms, a strong connection has been between IOH and a number of adverse postoperative outcomes. These include myocardial injury after non-cardiac surgery, acute kidney injury, and other organ injuries.ResultsThe
current research has identified several major causes of intraoperative hypotension. They include intravascular hypovolemia, vasodilation, high intrathoracic pressure, low cardiac output, and compromised baroreflex regulation. These conditions act as causative mechanisms resulting from the use of anesthetic medication and lead to the reduction of blood pressure. Risk factors are associated with included advanced age, the history of hypotensive episodes, emergency surgery, and the vulnerability to tissue ischemia. Although several conditions and processes have been identified as causes of intraoperative hypotension, more research needs to be done on the treatments and perioperative management of IOH. Patients that receive non-cardiac surgery under general anesthesia still face the risks of a decrease in blood pressure to dangerous levels.Pathophysiology of Intraoperative HypotensionIntroductionIntraoperative hypotension is among the most common side effects of general
anesthesia used during surgery. Most frequently, IOH or intraoperative hypotension is determined as a mean arterial pressure (MAP) lower than the 25% average value of the patient. Even short periods of the decrease in MAP have appeared to be connected to unfavorable outcomes. IOH is considered to be a major factor associated with adverse postoperative complications, such as ischemic myocardial injury after extracardiac surgery, kidney injury, organ injuries, and other dangerous conditions. Annually, over 8 million patients suffer from postoperative myocardial injury, which is also one of the leading causes of patients dying within the first month after surgery. Thus, IOH is a major factor linked to a high postoperative mortality rate, as it increases the risk of adverse postoperative outcomes leading to death.IncidenceStudies report the different incidence
since the definitions of IOH used by researchers vary. Thus, “IOH defined as a mean arterial pressure below 65 mmHg occurs in approximately 65 per cent of operations, and IOH defined as a 20 per cent decrease in MAP from baseline occurred in 94 per cent”. Fourteen of the studies reviewed by Wesselink et al. have investigated mortality, and showed an “outcome incidence between 0.03% (follow-up: <1 day) and 5.6% (during hospital admission)”. Twelve studies reviewed showed a connection between IOH and acute kidney injury, with AKI incidence “between 2.8% (7 days) and 72% (7 days)”. Nine of the studies investigated the cases of myocardial injury preceded by intraoperative hypotension, and the incidence reported varied “between 0.09% (in-hospital) and 30% (1 day)”. Even though hypotension is believed to
be a strong signal and a significant factor involving adverse postoperative outcomes, and duration of its episodes has not been clearly defined yet.EtiologyTo be able to treat intraoperative hypotension and avoid its dangerous postoperative outcomes, health professionals have to identify its causes. The causative mechanisms that lead to IOH vary in different phases, which are defined according to the different stages of surgery under general anesthesia. Post-induction hypotension (PIH) and early intraoperative hypotension (IOH) have been identified as the main phases induced by intravenous anesthetics and other anesthetic medication.Patients undergoing surgery under general anesthesia can have hypotension caused by various pathophysiologic mechanisms, which means that the etiology of IOH involves a range of factors. Among the most common ones are vasodilation, intravascular hypovolemia, low cardiac output, high intra-thoracic
pressure, and impairment of the sympathetic nervous system or compromised baroreflex regulation. During vasodilation, blood vessels widen as a result of the relaxation of their muscular walls. This mechanism leads to “a decrease in systemic vascular resistance (SVR) and an increase in blood flow”, which causes a decrease in blood pressure. Vasodilation and venodilation, in particular, is considered to be the main cause of hypovolemia induced by anesthetic drugs. It can also be caused by the reduction in circulating blood volume following massive blood loss (absolute hypovolemia) or inadequate “increases in the capacitance of the blood vessels as in vasodilatory shock” (relative hypovolemia). As a result, when compensatory mechanisms are impaired or function inadequately, relative hypovolemia can reduce arterial blood pressure.Decreased cardiac output can be caused by a
sinus rate that is too slow and leads to conditions like bradycardia or low stroke volume. Abnormally high heart rates, in turn, can lead to a decrease in stroke volume by “reducing ventricular filling time”. As a result of ventricular fibrillation, cardiac output falls to zero, which, in turn, causes hypotension. Hypotension can also be a consequence of baroreflex failure in patients undergoing and/or following radical neck dissection, neck injury, throat irradiation, and carotid artery surgery. Along with bradycardia, hypotension is common in patients when they are resting or relaxing. This is due to the loss of buffering ability, which occurs during baroreflex failure. It results from the “interruption of the afferent limb of the baroreflex at the level of the carotid sinus, baroreceptor afferents, or medulla”, and,
result in permanent organ injury, as it means that blood is not reaching the patient’s major organs.ConclusionIt can be concluded that while the causes of intraoperative hypotension have been identified, the ways to prevent them and treat hypotension have not been clearly defined. IOH remains to be a major signal associated with adverse outcomes and high rates of postoperative mortality. Therefore, further research might focus on investigating the ways to manage.
The American War of Independence is between the American colonies and Great Britain. The revolution’s success eventually depended on the willingness of Americans to risk their lives and economic well-being in the name of patriotism. The revolution was a conservative attempt to preserve freedoms that seemed to be threatened by British politics. However, the war was accompanied by social and intellectual transformations that radically changed the nature of American politics and brought ordinary people into politics to an unprecedented degree. It was the main reason why the Patriots were willing to risk their lives for the sake of independence and change.Firstly, the Patriots wanted the American colonies to gain independence from Great Britain as they wanted their own independent country. People in America felt they were being treated
unfairly by the British (DiPucchio, 2020). They were taxed without voting or being represented by the British government. Soon, the first battles for freedom were heard throughout the colonies. The Patriots wanted freedom from British rule and fought for it.Secondly, the American fighters for independence were more willing to sacrifice their lives because they wanted to defend universal ideals. Indeed, American intellectuals were greatly influenced by the ideas of John Locke and Jean-Jacques Rousseau, who promoted the natural rights and freedoms of every man (The Library of Congress, n.d.). However, with its rigid class system and the unrestrained power of the monarchy, the British Empire was far from the new values that more and more Americans held.Finally, the new generations of immigrants were forming a new identity that
England and its American colonies became wider, and the former was viewed as the conquerors by the latter. Therefore, the patriots were willing to risk their lives to ensure freedom from the oppressors.Overall, it is argued that there are at least three reasons that made the patriots willing to sacrifice their lives in the war against the British Empire. Among them, the unfair treatment that Americans experienced as they were heavily taxed and could not influence the political situation is found to be one of the strongest ones. Additionally, the spread of modern ideas and a new identity formation in the colonies further increased this dissatisfaction.
Pentecostal movements adhere to some doctrines that are contested by most Christian denominations, whether it be the Eastern Church or the Western Church. Sometimes their movements are treated as sects, still, they are not recognized as destructive. The big denominations will never come to a consensus with the Pentecostals on a number of issues. By most denominations, Pentecostals cannot be considered as a legitimate movement.Nontrinitarianism rests on the assertion that God is one, there is neither the Holy Spirit, emanating from him, nor his Son, the same divine being. The Bible usually states the trinity of God: “For the kingdom of God is not a matter of eating and drinking, but of righteousness, peace and joy in the Holy Spirit, because anyone who serves Christ in this way
is pleasing to God and receives human approval” (Romans 14:17-18). Pentecostals reject the divine nature of Jesus Christ altogether, acting as Jehovah’s Witnesses.Pentecostal Arianism is about ridding the figure of Jesus Christ of all that is divine. This doctrine is completely contrary to most denominations and confessions, where it is customary to say of Jesus Christ: “He is the image of the invisible God, the firstborn of all creation” (Colossians 1:15). The degree of the divine and the human in Jesus Christ has been the subject of discussion for a very long time, still, the complete elimination of the divine from his figure is not possible.The Pentecostal movement does not recognize the Apocrypha, and considers only the Bible to be a genuine subject for study. This, in general,
children to eternal torment. There are usually contradictions here too: “And shall cast them into a furnace of fire: there shall be wailing and gnashing of teeth” (Matthew 13:42). This is what divine love is: in saving people from eternal punishment. In conclusion, Pentecostals have a few differences from other Christian denominations and are unlikely to ever come to a consensus, therefore, these denominations cannot legitimize them.
The Coptic religious community has a long history in Egypt. The persecution began at the conquest of Egypt by the Arabs and, unfortunately, has not stopped until now. Coptic Christians are regularly targeted for persecution, sometimes resulting in terrorist acts or murders. At the everyday level, Coptic Christians are opposed by the inhabitants of Egypt, ordinary Muslims (Sherwood, 2018). On a spiritual and more global level, Copts are threatened by terrorist organizations such as ISIS. They were exiled from Iraq and Syria and took secret refuge in Egypt.Persecution of Copts occurs throughout Egypt, facilitating the persecution of the fact that their religion is written in the passport of citizens of Egypt. It allows the Muslim Egyptians to deny the Copts the desired work, hindering their small businesses development.
The differences between the Persian and Greek cultures can be seen in several traditions and customs. In Persia, the distinction between different religions and languages was accepted by the society, allowing people from the conquered territories to continue practicing their ancestral traditions without being persecuted (Brooks, 2019). In contrast, Greeks were less tolerant of other religions and cultures, enforcing submission to Greek customs from the populations residing in their territory (Brooks, 2019).Another significant dissimilarity was the citizens’ attitude toward the authority, with the Persian residents voluntarily supporting the King and remaining strongly loyal to him (Brooks, 2019). In Greece, where the democratic rule was considered the most beneficial, the concept of one person reigning over others was disapproved, with the majority of the elite supporting democracy as a
BackgroundThe action of the prayer effect is based on the regularities and peculiarities of cognitive processes. It is based on two attention abilities, namely, switching and concentration. In the course of prayer, people switch and focus on an area of higher spirituality. The requirement of regularity and systematic recitation of worship leads to frequent repetition of concentration on religious categories, strengthening the mental connection with God. Froese and Jones (2021) wrote in their article that prayer strengthens one’s faith in the supernatural and, therefore, it is a session of faith. In addition, public prayer has long been used as a tool to influence the political arena (Froese & Jones, 2021). Therefore, one can consider this phenomenon as a weapon, sacred and supernatural.The same idea that prayer is a
weapon, and used politically, is also found in Martin’s article. Religion is familiar with precedents when it was possible to defeat enemy troops by force of turning to God (Martin, 2019). For example, in A.D. 174, by the power of prayer, a Roman legion was able to discover a spring of water, and the flood that followed washed away the enemies (Martin, 2019). In general, both authors emphasize that prayers serve as weapons and that their use brings people closer to God.Participants in the ritual often experience a sense of social acceptance and emotional uplift after the prayer is completed. The rhythmic and systematic repetition of prayers reinforces the ideals and guidelines of a particular religion (Froese & Jones, 2021). Martin also wrote about it in his article,
intervention in this way have existed throughout Christian history. They are unanimously convinced that prayers are inherently proactive; there are no significant differences between their positions.SummaryRepentanceIn his second letter to the Corinthians, Paul refers to repentance as sorrow for God’s sake, which leads to salvation (2 Corinthians 7:10). Repentance in Paul’s understanding is when one does not return to sin again. Repentance cleanses the soul, and a clean soul, in turn, is able to more fully receive the grace of the Holy Spirit.Dedication
The COVID-19 outbreak was a sudden and terrifying experience for all people around the world. I remember telling my friends that the virus would not last for a long time and that we would all meet after two weeks of self-isolation. I did not know how far it would go and what changes to my life it would bring. Sitting at home and watching the news about millions of infected and fatal cases made me realize how fragile human life is. The pandemic has both positive and negative effects on people and their businesses. This paper addresses these effects and provides my experience of the COVID-19 healthcare crisis.The virus that is still ongoing has taught a valuable thing for all of us that is being able to adapt
to rapidly changing circumstances. You will never know what is waiting for you in the future, and you should be flexible and calm enough to embrace the new reality. At the beginning of the pandemic, it was fun to sit at home, watch TV series and chat with my friends. Yet, after some time, I realized how my mental health was going downwards as I started to feel anxiety about the world and my future. I also felt very sorry for people who lost their close ones because of COVID. However, I somehow managed that stress due to mental health support, podcasts, and books. I realized that being able to adapt to a changing reality is the only way to keep doing daily routines. At a country level,
countries were also adapting and making new policies, and I think now many political figures are more flexible being aware of sudden changes. There were too many mistakes to realize the importance of effective and fast decisions that take into account today’s reality.One more positive thing about the pandemic is that people learned the value of family and socialization. People cannot live alone, and they need someone to rely on and care for. During the pandemic, I was with my family, and I think it was the first time interacting with them so closely. We were discussing the situation and sharing personal concerns a lot, so that I could understand my family more and support them. I was also worried about older members of the family, thinking that
I did not appreciate time with them before the pandemic. It made me reconsider my family relations and understand that they are my close ones, and I should dedicate my time to them more. I assume this was a great lesson for everyone, and I hope people would value their families and take care of them.One of the crucial changes that the COVID-19 outbreak brought to us is online education. I did not know how to assess such kind of education as positive or negative as there are many arguments for each side. Personally, I liked the online mode of the studies because I could also register for other courses provided for free by different universities and platforms like Coursera. I also learned how to manage time properly
as the increased number of assignments forced me to do so. Yet, many students did not like online education as we could not focus well on our studies. People live in different conditions, some of us did not have personal space for studying while others did not have time for education. Education is indeed a privilege, but the online mode made it even worse. Moreover, I heard that in some countries, students climbed on trees to have access to the Internet and do their homework.The COVID-19 crisis increased inequality across the world and had a negative impact on the world economy. People in developing countries did not have proper healthcare services and tools for online mode of working and studying. Many people lost their jobs, being unable to
Perspective is an important consideration in art, one that determines the way people look at a painting and what they see, how they see it, and how they interact with it. Additionally, it is responsible for the way people understand an image in its cultural context or intended meaning. While exploring the google arts and culture exhibit, I have been able to see a number of different religious paintings that use perspective in interesting ways. I think that the discussion of perspective is important for those both close and far from the art world, as it promotes engagement with paintings that can often be overlooked.To narrow down my search, I have looked up “Religious painting”, and went with the results that seemed most interesting to discuss. First, I
want to take a look at The Adoration of the Magi, painted by Sandro Botticelli. The image depicts people adoring a number of “wise men” who were considered to be especially important in Florence, where it was painted ( The adoration of the magi – sandro botticelli – google arts & culture ). The linear perspective allows the audience to see everything that is happening from a detached angle, taking in the scenery and understanding the importance of the event to the people depicted. While the magi are being revered by the people of Florence, the audience also understands that they are close to their followers, therefore placing them in close perspective proximity to each other.Figure 1: The adoration of the magi – Sandro Botticelli – Google Arts
Dürer in 1511.Figure 2: Adoration of the Trinity (landauer altar) – Albrecht Dürer – Google Arts & Culture.The figures made central in this painting is much more important than in the last, and the significance of the Trinity for Christian religion is enhanced with both the visual presentation and the perspective. The pose he makes is reminiscent of the crucifixion, and the father and the holy spirit are also included. We, the audience, are made to look at the Trinity from below, assuming a position of observation and awe. The difference in the way the gathered saints and the holy Trinity are framed make it clear what the central piece of the image is.
Environment-friendly technologies develop with the growing social awareness about the issues caused by pesticides utilization in various industries. Sharma et al. (2020) claim that “these chemicals enter the ecosystem, thus hampering the sensitive environmental equilibrium through bio-accumulation” (p. 110812). Consequently, alternative strategies become in demand for protecting the plants and species from biomagnification and severe changes in natural settings (Sharma et al., 2020). Biological, semi-chemical, and physical control methods for decreasing the use of pesticides require proper encouragement to achieve sustainable improvement in the ecological situation. Indeed, the governmental programs, legislative changes, and business initiatives that promote environmental protection are the key for the novelties’ implementation.There are several ways to influence the decision-making processes of pesticides used in the industries such as farming and livestock. Firstly, the awareness
methods to eliminate the neonicotinoid insecticides utilization. Lastly, the range of eco-efficient benchmarks to evaluate the level of hazard caused by one industry or company’s use of pesticides must be developed. Magarey et al. (2019) state that “eco-efficiency is an operational basis for optimizing pest management for sustainability” (p. 3129). The presence of regulations and standards to match production can encourage the industries to seek environment-friendly ways of manufacturing.
Water contamination is a global environmental problem, and the use of pesticides worsens the situation. This essential element, if polluted, makes plants, animals, and food unhealthy and leads species to disappear and humans to develop chronic diseases. Pesticides contamination must be considered on the legislative level in most countries, and global environment protection organizations must establish regulations. Furthermore, a good rating of water contamination’s severity must evolve before encouraging people and regulators to address the problem (Demir, Dilek, & Yetis, 2019). Each situation is unique, and many countries cannot integrate contamination limiting regulations due to the inability to match the general environmental standards. The alternative strategies to decrease pesticides utilization can be implemented in different institutions such as social work, culture, healthcare, and politics.Indeed, replacing killing pesticides with
The impact of pesticide utilization can be devastating for nature and the environment because they influence health, animals, plants, and living conditions. Their hazard on bees’ behavior reveals that bioaccumulation is severe for pollination, critical for plants and seeds growth, and food production. Recent studies and organizations such as The Environmental Protection Agency encourage the government and manufacturers to act against pesticides to avoid disappearing entire incepts’ populations (Lawler, 2017). The artificial changes in the ecosystem can lead to catastrophic consequences, natural disasters, poor harvests, and water pollution (Matyjaszczyk, 2018). Consequently, actionable steps must be made to address the problem, and vectors control or integrative pest management (IPM) are the profound approaches to start from.Pesticides utilization is becoming a global problem, therefore United Nations, World Health Organization, and
control influences the environmental situation, and encouragement to implement proper practices can be reached through research and social programs devoted to the importance of particular incept species. Lawler (2017) states that “Health agencies, the public, and environmental groups have especially debated the use of methoprene because some studies have shown toxic effects on non-target organisms” (p. 337). The hazardous side effects need to be revealed to the public to force industries to decrease the pesticide use in vectors control.
IntroductionProviding patients with adequate and effective drug therapies is essential for timely medical care and treatment. In the examined case of the patient with a number of severe diagnoses, one can single out the diseases that are characteristic of older adults and are less common in young people. As a consequence, as a factor to be analyzed in relation to the pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic processes, age will be involved. This criterion can help explain appropriate drug interventions and identify optimal treatment regimens to address the patient’s needs.Influence of Age on the Patient’s Pharmacokinetic and Pharmacodynamic ProcessesThe examined case study shows that the patient has severe health problems associated with the cardiovascular system. While taking these diagnoses into account, the aspect of age plays an essential role in pharmacokinetic
and pharmacodynamic processes. For instance, Rosenthal and Burchum (2021) note that diuretics, such as furosemide, are prescribed to treat high blood pressure and lower blood cholesterol. However, due to impaired body systems in adulthood, diuresis may start later and persist for less than the standard eight hours. As Thürmann (2020) argues, the kidneys and liver, which are responsible for removing harmful products from the body, function worse in older patients. Anticoagulants aimed at preventing blood clots in people with ischemic problems are poorly absorbed (Thürmann, 2020). Therefore, drugs in the body of older adults enter into chemical reactions worse and have a shorter effect on the body than in young people.Impacts on the Patient’s Drug TherapyThese changes in the pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic processes can affect the drug therapy
recommended for the patient. Dodson et al. (2017) state that polyprogmasia may be one of the negative consequences of taking a large amount of medication in older people with heart disease. In this regard, due to the insufficiently effective impacts of drugs and an excess of many components, particularly aspirin, the simplest anticoagulant, with warfarin, dangerous health outcomes may occur. In addition, targeted drug therapy aimed at controlling the blood sugar level with metformin puts a strain on the liver, which is dangerous in adulthood. As a result of these processes, the proposed therapy may pose threats due to the insufficient resistance of the patient’s body to such medicinal effects.Improvement of the Drug Therapy PlanTo improve the patient’s current drug therapy plan, some changes may be helpful. Since
A disaster preparedness plan starts with an emergency preparedness kit that must necessarily include drinking water for each person, a supply of food for several days, a radio receiver for listening to information. Moreover, it is important to have a flashlight and extra batteries in case of a long stay in an emergency. Additionally, the kit should include a dust mask and a whistle that can be used as an alert or help signal. If it is not possible to turn off utilities, it is essential to put pliers and a can opener in order to open the food.When preparing for an emergency, there are many other factors that influence action. There is a paralyzed person in the family, so it is critical to have a stretcher in
of water and food. Moreover, I need to make sure that all members of the family are intact. After that, I will turn on the radio and listen to messages from the rescue services. In the absence of communication, it is important to remain calm and give distress signals with a whistle. The success of the plan should be judged according to the level of calmness and readiness for different circumstances.
Morality as a System of Hypothetical Imperatives is a work by Philippa Foot that attempts to question Kant’s idea of morality. Kant claims that moral judgment cannot be a hypothetical imperative; instead, it is a categorical and universal imperative. Foot argues that morality should be presented as a system of hypothetical imperatives due to the fact that morality does not differ from anything else, for example, etiquette.The idea of morals being driven by the categorical imperatives implies that morality takes a different kind of the word should. By comparing morality with etiquette, Foot claims that there is no significant distinction between the two (Foot, 1972). She draws an example of a person not caring for some etiquette rules is not excused for violating them (Foot, 1972). As such,
Philosophical ThinkingIt is important to note that philosophy is a discipline that systematically applies reason to deepen the overall understanding of existence, reality, and the nature of knowledge as well as wisdom through a thorough examination. The question about knowledge is strongly associated with a branch of philosophy called epistemology. The latter focuses on defending and analyzing the key concepts of knowledge, including the core methodological frameworks utilized to attain it. When it comes to understanding reality itself, the most relevant branch of philosophy is metaphysics. It seeks to describe the nature of reality by addressing the underlying matters beyond science’s capabilities, but the principles are grounded in reason and logic. Lastly, the ideas about the good life and proper way of living stem from the branch of
philosophy called ethics. It assesses and thoroughly defends the critical concepts of value by determining what is wrong and right.In the case of the question of knowledge, Socrates offered solid methodologies to uncover what is true. It should be noted that dialectic was a cornerstone of the pursuit of knowledge through wisdom, which is focused on a mutually respectful discourse between several people of opposing views to attain the truth (The Socratic Approach, n.d.). However, when it comes to delivering the known truth to people, who do not know, such as students, Socrates used the Socratic Method. The latter focused on asking questions about known matters and pushing the boundaries of knowledge to attain new ones (The Socratic Approach, n.d.).Arguments played a central role in the process of
structuring and obtaining the truth since they were vigorously evaluated and assessed in regard to their validity. Even during his last trial and sentencing to death, Socrates adhered to his reasoning by proving why death should not be feared. He claimed that death is either something or nothing; in the former case, one can communicate with the dead, and in the latter case, it is dreamless sleep. Therefore, both cases present no valid reason to fear death, which makes it irrational for him to be fearful of his sentencing (The Apology: A Defense of Philosophy, n.d.).In the case of the question about reality, Plato offered insightful knowledge and a framework to understand the nature of reality. The philosopher’s core claim about metaphysics is rooted in the concept of
flux or change. His argument is that the world is constantly changing, which makes knowledge impossible, but since knowledge is possible, then there are some essences outside the world in the metaphysical one (Plato Forms: The Foundations of Being, n.d.). Reality is grounded on forms, which are entities such as paradigms and ideals (Plato Forms: The Foundations of Being, n.d.).In the case of the question of epistemology, Aristotle offered virtue ethics to distinguish what is wrong from what is right. It is important to note that virtue ethics focuses on character or actor rather than the action itself. He claimed that when a person needs to act, he or she will act in accordance with his or her character (Aristotle’s Highest Good, n.d.). Virtue is located between two
extremes, and vice is either deficiency or excess.Reflection on Virtue EthicsThinking philosophically means thinking structurally with awareness of the premises and arguments being made to come to a certain conclusion. Such an approach can help me immensely by making me more resilient to groupthink, biases, and logical fallacies. It deepens my understanding of what is true, what is right, and what is real.The impact of the ideas of the Ancient Greek philosophers on my opinions and views is significant. For instance, virtue ethics taught me that ethics is not binomial in terms of one side being wrong and the other side is right. The given framework tells that goodness is in between two extremes, which is balance. The notion holds true in regard to almost everything, such as
Coronavirus has significantly impacted the general health status of the planet’s population for two main reasons. One of them is the virus itself, as it negatively influences people’s organisms, and the other is the difficulties related to maintaining favorable health condition in the pandemic situation. Thus, it is imperative to stay physically active and perform various exercises to keep one’s body in proper shape, improve organism’s immunity and reduce the chances of being diseased.COVID-19 causes particular challenges associated with maintaining a physically active lifestyle. According to Shariat et al. (2020), the leading risk factor of virus transmission is people’s proximity to one another in groups, meaning that public gatherings are dangerous. Thus, public gyms and training grounds may not be a proper place to exercise as they do
Supporters of relativism believe that morality in the objective sense does not exist. The moral norms adopted in society are not obligatory for adherence and execution. In absolute terms, the concepts of evil and good are nothing more than fiction. In this regard, researcher Porus noted that moral relativism could easily degenerate into permissiveness (Bush and Moss, 2020). Moreover, people who adhere to this point of view can be perceived as the ones trying to devalue moral norms to the lowest possible level, will not attempt to seek compromises and negotiate on mutually beneficial terms.On the contrary, objectivism states that there is right and wrong that do not depend on someone’s opinions or other factors. In this sense, moral standards are believed to be propounded and everlasting, not
day we face elections, the result of which often cannot be called correct or not. Most people, in principle, always try to act ethically, but even then, their actions can be perceived negatively. You will not please everyone precisely because, despite some existing ideas about good and evil, you make decisions that pass through the prism of experience, psychological characteristics of a person, circumstances, and weighing many factors. I find objectivism too utopian an ultimatum, which seeks to simplify morality while threatening it with a distorted view of reality.
Dark Side of the Moon is the eighth album of Pink Floyd, the British rock quartet. Since 1973 when it was released, it has been regarded as one of the greatest rock albums in the history of music. In the present day, it definitely deserves listeners’ attention, and its analysis may substantially contribute to self-assessment and self-development. The purpose of this paper is to investigate Dark Side of the Moon from the positions of meanings, sounds, and influence on individuals. Characterized by an extraordinary thoughtfulness, clear conception, and the coherence of lyrics and sounds, Dark Side of the Moon still has a massive impact on human society, reflecting people’s attitude to life, death, madness, money, violence, choice, and social norms.Dark Side of the Moon may be justly regarded
as one of the greatest albums in the history of rock music, if not the most outstanding one. According to Epstein, who wrote for Rolling Stone magazine, “there are hit albums, and then there’s Dark Side of the Moon ” (par. 1). Recorded in several sessions from May 1972 to January 1973 at London’s Abbey Road Studios, Pink Floyd’s eighth album has become commercially successful after its release, with more than 45 million copies sold worldwide (Epstein par. 1). At the same time, Dark Side of the Moon is more than a top bestseller that stayed in charts for breathtakingly many weeks – it has managed to affect its creators and the rock music of the next generations as well. First of all, it was the artistic achievement
of Pink Floyd that defined the British quartet’s career and turned an experimental and jam-oriented band loved by college students into worldwide renowned top-echelon rockers. At the same time, the album’s rich songwriting, heavy lyrical musings, and cerebral soundscapes led to people’s countless listening sessions, set quality standards for future albums, and inspired other musicians.One of the major values of Dark Side of the Moon lies in its conception and thoughtfulness. In comparison with the majority of studio albums that imply a series of unrelated or unconnected songs, Pink Floyd’s well-written masterpiece includes a general theme addressed by all songs. As a matter of fact, there are multiple theories and disputes concerning the album’s concept and general meaning. Although Pink Floyd has partly provided the explanation of particular
songs, listeners have been mostly given an opportunity to reflect and decide for themselves.From a personal perspective, Dark Side of the Moon is about life and its shortness, the importance of living and being human, finding the purpose in life, factors that may impact its fulfillment, and death. At the same time, the album may be regarded as a warning to people about challenges in life that may affect its fragility and lead to insanity and destruction. In other words, “Breathe,” “Speak to Me,” “Time,” “The Great Gig in the Sky,” and “On the Run” are tracks that may be grouped according to their focus on people’s perceptions and multiple aspects of life including its futility and shortness, fear of death, the boredom of routine, parenthood, luck, and
the freedom of choice.In turn, other tracks, such as “Us and Them,” “Money,” “Any Colour You Like,” “Eclipse,” and “Brain Damage” address ideas and concepts that cause destruction, madness, and uncertainty or despair related to life reflected in the album’s other tracks. They are selfishness, greed, social pressure, violence, wars, racism, common insanity, and hidden negative feelings. Thus, Dark Side of the Moon helps listeners realize that the pursuit of material things, social approval, and public acceptance lead to dissatisfaction with life and recognition of its futility.The meaning of the album corresponds with the ideas of individualism that were spread in the 1970s. According to Thompson, “by the 1970s, society had lost its constraining power and individualism became a matter of self-absorption and the quest for self-development” (851).
Thus, concepts reflected in Dark Side of the Moon helped young people to understand themselves better and perceive the ways in which their lives could be fulfilled.At the same time, listening to the album may be highly beneficial for individuals today, especially millennials who “more than any other generation, are searching for purpose and purposeful work” (Grant 1). Regarded as materialistic, narcissistic, and individualistic, they are concentrated on ambitions, achievements, and competitiveness. However, young people are frequently confused about life balance and their purpose in this world. For them, the album may serve as a source of wisdom and consistency, reminding that searching for truth is natural. It shows that life itself is highly important and appreciating every moment of it is paramount. In turn, there are multiple
detrimental concepts, ideas, and events that may limit life fulfillment and lead to despair and madness – they should be understood to be avoided.In general, the album’s reflection of society may be defined as timeless. In the present day, pandemic-related circumstances limit people’s ability to enjoy life. Tragic news, the lockdown measures, misinformation, global tiredness from multiple restrictions, and isolation lead to anxiety, helplessness, anger, and more serious health problems. The album’s message resonates with individuals’ emotional state – for example, “The Great Gig in the Sky” reflects people’s attitude to death, either acceptance of fear, “Us and Them” is about conflicts that prevail in the modern world due to restrictions, discrimination, and inequities, while “On the Run” express stress, anxiety, fear, and the senseless of life. All
in all, Pink Floyd’s album emphasizes the inconstancy of life. Although there are bright and positive moments, they are inevitably changed by bleakness and even horrors that will pass as well. However, listeners can interpret songs in numerous different ways finding individual meanings that describe what they feel in a particular life period.The whole album may be perceived as a journey for people who want to understand the importance of being a human, being alive, and life in general, uncover it, and find their purpose. It opens with a relatively long and cinematic introduction with the crescendo of heartbeat accompanied by distant voices, ticking clocks, and sound effects that resemble an airplane propeller, automobile motor, cash register, and arcade machine. It is possible to say that “Speak to
Me” introduces life both within and outside a human being with its rhythm, dynamic, and pace. Listeners may identify a clear phrase, “I’ve always been mad,” that indicates society’s influence on the development of its members’ mental issues (“Speak to Me” 00:00:44). However, when “Breathe” starts, slide and chorused guitars, ride-cymbal drum kit, and bass enter all together, creating warm and delicious merging tones (“Breathe” 00:01:09). They replace the sounds of life, offering listeners to distract their attention from routine and explore another dimension in search of truth.In general, “Breathe” represents the ideas of the shortness of life and its futility at the same time when people focus on the endless achievement of non-existing ideals, competition, and toil. On the basis of its message, the may be divided
into parts, and one may be regarded as a parent’s guidance:Run, rabbit, runDig that hole, forget the sunAnd when at last the work is doneDon’t sit down it’s time to dig another oneFor long you’ll live, and high you’ll flyBut only if you ride the tideAnd balanced on the biggest waveYou race towards an early grave (“Breathe”)In these lines, the importance of continuous hard work is emphasized, however, it is senseless as even if success is achieved, non-stop “race” will inevitably lead to early death. In turn, the author states that the purpose of a person is in an everyday living as life is positive and negative moments that constitute it, and only they should be valued:Breathe, breathe in the airDon’t be afraid to careLeave, don’t leave meWalk
around and choose your own groundLong you live and high you flySmiles you’ll give and tears you’ll cryAll you touch and all you seeIs all your life will ever be (“Breathe”)Although the next track, “On the Run,” is predominantly instrumental, the theme of time passage is clearly recognizable. At the same time, the message of this song is controversial. On the one hand, it expresses people’s constant “race” for career achievements, money, or fame and related anxiety and stress. Moreover, airport announcements and a person’s steps scattered throughout it reflect the dynamic and rhythm of life. In other words, people forget to live being constantly on the run. On the other hand, this tempo symbolizes living on the spot, and a person’s words “Live for today, gone tomorrow”
support this theory (“On the Run” 00:01:52). In any case, life is short and may finish suddenly and unexpectedly – in this song, life is probably compared with a plane that has crashed in the end.In a genuine masterpiece, “Time,” various concepts of time are explored. In addition, this song may be regarded as a person’s attitude to time during his life.Ticking away the moments that make up a dull dayYou fritter and waste the hours in an offhand way.Kicking around on a piece of ground in your hometownWaiting for someone or something to show you the way.Tired of lying in the sunshine staying home to watch the rain.You are young and life is long and there is time to kill today.And then one day you find ten
years have got behind you.No one told you when to run, you missed the starting gun (“Time”)In the beginning, a young person feels unprepared for life, waiting for a mentor who will guide him. In addition, he may feel unsecured due to the pressure of society and organized power structures. At the same time, when a person is young, he does not realize how time passes and believes that the whole life is still in front of him.So you run and you run to catch up with the sun but it’s sinkingRacing around to come up behind you again.The sun is the same in a relative way but you’re older,Shorter of breath and one day closer to death.Every year is getting shorter never seem to find the time.Plans
that either come to naught or half a page of scribbled linesHanging on in quiet desperation is the English wayThe time is gone, the song is over,Thought I’d something more to say (“Time”)Finding himself in the middle of life, a person starts to run, trying to achieve success and do things he was always dreaming about. However, the majority of opportunities have already been missed due to aging. In general, “Time” is a song about the fragility and shortness of life, every moment of which should be valued. The tragedy of missed opportunities due to the ignorance of the importance of time is majorly reflected in this track.“The Great Gig in the Sky” is another predominantly instrumental work, and it is dedicated to the theme of death.And I
am not frightened of dying, any time will do, Idon’t mind. Why should I be frightened of dying?There’s no reason for it, you’ve gotta go sometime (“The Great Gig in the Sky”)People may accept dying or be afraid of death and hide this feeling. In this song, there are two contrasting positions – the first one belongs to a confident person whose attitude to death and the absence of fear is convincing. The second person admits that she accepts dying as well, however, her voice is less confident as if she conceals her genuine attitude to death.The next song, “Money,” opens the series of tracks that present various things that may destroy life and lead to madness. Obviously, money and money-related greed are some of them, however, not
all people understand this truth. For the majority of them, money implies multiple opportunities and life pleasure:Money, get away.Get a good job with good pay and you’re okay.Money, it’s a gas.Grab that cash with both hands and make a stash.New car, caviar, four star daydream,Think I’ll buy me a football team (“Money”)At the same time, when a person has more and more money, he cannot stop and wants more and more things. Money leads to debauchery and a lack of self-control. However, money is never enough, and that is why they become a source of multiple global problems:Money, it’s a crime.Share it fairly but don’t take a slice of my pie.Money, so they sayIs the root of all evil today.But if you ask for a raise it’s no
surprise that they’regiving none away. Away. Away. Away…. (“Money”)“Us and Them” explores the themes of conflict, violence, and fighting that derive from people’s intolerance and inability to accept the existence of more than one opinion.Us, and themAnd after all we’re only ordinary men.Me, and you.God only knows it’s not what we would choose to do (“Us and Them”)This song tries to show the senselessness of the black-and-white mentality that leads to struggles. Addressing a conflict’s physical aspect, “Us and Them” states that ordinary people will suffer while powerful ones will promote violence staying safe. Thus, people should reject being guided by ideas and opinions that aim to instigate a confrontation.Finally, “Brain Damage” and “Eclipse” may be regarded as the album’s most somber compositions that address insanity, mental health
disorders, a mental breakdown, and darkness to which they lead. It reflects both the insanity of a society obsessed with money, conflicts, competition, and success and the insanity of a person who ignores life and merges into his own reflections and concerns. The dark side of the moon symbolizes life’s unfulfillment and dissatisfaction that may destroy all – all hopes, all dreams, all love, all happiness.Throughout Dark Side of the Moon, all songs are connected with each other, not only lyrically emphasizing the themes of life fragility, alienation, and insanity. Tracks have seamless musical coherence flowing into one another smoothly and symphonically s parts of one single harmonious melody. In general, the album may be regarded as a concert divided into pieces during which listeners have an opportunity
to indulge themselves with spatialization, new electronic sounds, and the array of tones and pitches. Moreover, various sound effects, including alarms, chimes, footsteps, clocks, and cash registers, create a sense of presence. The inclusion of them into the traditional rock melodies of a quartet reminds that the perception of life, self-development, and self-assessment are included in everyday reality.As previously mentioned, the album’s songs are coherent from the position of lyrics. This accordance is partly justified by the fact that the bassist Roger Waters is Dark Side of the Moon ’s sole lyricist (Epstein par. 4). Thus, he wanted to create a comprehensive, powerful message related to the power of life and its significance. The album is primarily based on emotions in response to concepts that affect society. According
to him, he has suddenly realized that postponing life for education or career is wrong. It is not possible to prepare for life that is supposed to start later as life is happening now. That is why people should take responsibility for it and guide their destiny, trying to avoid things that limit life fulfillment.Along with its songs’ lyrics and sounds, Dark Side of the Moon has a highly recognizable logo which meaning and history deserve attention as well. Richard Wright, Pink Floyd’s keyboard player, asked Storm Thorgerson, the graphic designer, to create the artwork requesting it to be elegant and simple. In turn, Thorgerson “along with his team of artists of Hipgnosis, a London-based art-design group, returned with what still remains, one of the most iconic and
The situation in Pioneering Technologies (PT) is complex and ethically unstable. On the one hand, Owl Vision is a unique product in the field of bionic eyes with clear strategies and benefits for customers. On the other hand, the causes of fall-off because of some changing conditions are poorly investigated. In other words, no guarantees are given to explain the shortages of the new product. Regarding such conditions, the utilitarian ethical framework must be applied as the most consistent option with PT’s corporate culture. The main idea of this approach is that morally right steps are those leading to the best outcomes for many people and resulting in the greatest overall good (Halbert & Ingulli, 2015). The company should analyze the harms and benefits of the campaign and
the product not only in relation to its success but all stakeholders and users who may be affected by the decision (Halbert & Ingulli, 2015). The examples include the evaluation of long- and short-term outcomes. Many individuals can be attracted by the campaign at the beginning, but their problems and concerns would grow with time, challenging the company’s reputation.Following the rules and principles of the utilitarian ethical framework, the identification of the outcomes plays an important role. When the company is confident in positive results and benefits for the company and ordinary users, the success of the campaign within the framework may be observed. Thus, at the moment, PT should not proceed with the advertising campaign as it is but must focus on some changes and improvements before
introducing the product to customers. The main steps contain the analysis of the current position, the identification of shortages, and the discussion of the effects (Halbert & Ingulli, 2015). If the harms prevail over the benefits within some aspects, it is important to involve more people and clarify the defects with its solutions.Considering the current state of affairs, the representatives of Eagle Eye Technology (EET) do not prefer to follow some ethical standards and have already got access to the PT’s concerns and challenges. They decide to stop the PT’s campaign and not to allow misleading the public. Therefore, the idea of whistleblowing is an appropriate mechanism for EET to follow. Whistleblowers are people who try to disclose information inside organizations to the media (Halbert & Ingulli, 2015).
in a motor vehicle accident because of the poor performance of the Owl Vision product, it is possible to address product liability theory as a basis for a lawsuit. The citizen was not informed about the unsafe and dangerously defective product, and this unawareness makes it possible to use the product under unfavorable conditions, meaning cloudy weather (Halbert & Ingulli, 2015). Addressing the current common law of torts, the driver should expect compensations from PT if the problem with the Own Vision product is investigated and proved.
Since it is assumed that skiing is a rather traumatic sport, the company should have taken precautions for minimizing the injury risks for the skiers. However, in that particular case, the actions of the company’s workers have created risks for health damage for Mr. Craig and Mr. Alex, who were actually injured. The fact that it was April and the slopes were supposed to be closed may lessen the degree of the company’s responsibility in this particular case, but not completely. The company made a mistake letting people ski after the snowstorm though it could not have allowed people to do it. Hence, the company’s actions endangered not only the skiers but the staff as well.Though Mr. Alex’s injury was made by Mr. Craig, it is not only
IntroductionManagement accounting involves measuring and reporting of economic activities of an enterprise. It is vital for the decision-making and planning of any organization and society. Managers primarily depend on the information provided by this paradigm for forecasting, operational control, and performance evaluation. For instance, managers use this information to decide what to produce, make, and when to produce. Therefore, it is helpful to them in determining various costs involved in the production process and the needed resources to attain the company’s objectives.Additionally, the management accounting system is financial in nature. Therefore, it feeds into the financial accounting system, especially in the product costing system, which is vital in calculating the cost of sales used in the income statement and inventory cost used in the balance sheets. Arguably, this
information can be seen as the backbone to the excellent management and operation of large organizations. Thus its preparation should be made monthly or quarterly and given to the various managers, including the chief financial officers, for efficient operation of their duties. This paper, hence, seeks to create a comprehensive report and analysis of the actual financial performance vis-a-vis the budgeted performance to be presented to the chief financial officer.SummaryThe actual net profit of 1036.8 shows that the company is in good operation and can secure financing and investments. However, the budgeted net profit is 153.9 higher due to the lower sales volume in the actual performance. This then signals the sales and marketing department to adjust their marketing strategy to prevent the sales lag that is deterring
the company from reaching its plans. Conversely, comparing the actual and budgeted net profit margins, the 15.88 % profit margin indicates that the company earns 15.88 cents for every dollar it collects instead of £15.71 that was budgeted (Maheshwari, Maheshwari, and Maheshwari, 2021). This shows that the company is operating optimally and is highly capable of meeting its objectives. This analysis, therefore, deems it fit for the company to try and reduce the cost of sales for it to generate higher profit margins. Consequently, the company is required to minimize the selling costs and increase its sales volume to continue earning higher returns. Similarly, in the analysis of this data, the liquidity ratio is also vital to examine as it determines whether the company can pay off current
debt obligations.The liquidity ratio shows the company is relatively in a good position to clear its current debts without using the inventory financing method, which is the least liquid. Its quick ratio of 0.8 indicates that it has £0.81 of liquid assets without inventory to cover £1 liability (Maheshwari, Maheshwari, and Maheshwari, 2021). Although the company desires to achieve 1.02, it is not close to insolvency. With all these analyses, it is prudent to argue that the company is in good operation for the foreseeable future.Statements of Profit & LossBudgeted statement of profit and loss account for the year ended 30th Sept 2020.

performance for the whole year.In the data above, direct labor costs take a more considerable percentage of all the costs involved in the performance of this company. Direct labor costs apply to the cost of labor that can be traced to the creation of a product without unnecessary expenses, for example, the salaries and wages paid to the workers. It takes a more considerable percentage because it determines the volume of production (Maheshwari, Maheshwari, and Maheshwari, 2021). As production increases, labor cost also increases; that is why in the budgeted performance, the cost of direct labor is 2% higher than the actual cost of direct labor. It is followed by direct material cost, which includes the cost of raw materials and the items used to create the products.
The direct materials in the bakery industry, for example, would consist of flour, eggs, oil, and water. It also contributes a bigger percentage of costs in the production process.When the production is increased, the output will be increased, and thus the inputs costs, including direct materials, must increase. This is evident in the two charts as it indicates that the direct materials costs are higher in the budgeted performance with higher sales. It is followed by the variable cost in the chart, variable costs are the business expenses that changes according to the output or sales. Therefore it varies linearly with the output level. On most occasions, it decreases with the increase in production or sales, as depicted from the charts (Maheshwari, Maheshwari, and Maheshwari, 2021). The budgeted
plan with higher sales has a lower percentage of the variable cost than the actual plan with lower sales. It is closely followed by the fixed cost, which includes those costs that do not change when production or sales volume changes; they do not vary with the output volume. Always the total fixed cost does not change, and they remain within a given range.However, the cost per unit of fixed cost decreases with the increase in production because the exact fixed costs are spread over more units. This is evident in the charts above, as they shows that in the budgeted program, the fixed cost is 6.76%, and the actual program is 7.87%. Following is the distribution cost, which is associated with storing and delivering the products to
the respective customers. These costs are incurred in getting the finished products to customers, for example, the cost of fuel and depreciation of the vehicle. They are directly related to the output level, as the output level increases, the distribution cost increases, as seen in the charts. The selling costs also form part of the business performance. It deals with the costs associated with getting orders or requests from customers. They include salaries and commissions paid to the sales and advertising agents. As the output increases, the need for many selling agents is necessary; therefore, it also increases but not proportionately to the output level.Ensuing is the administration cost, which involves paying salaries and wages and giving benefits to the non-sales individuals. It is also directly related to
the output volume. The Finance costs, which include the cost incurred by the management to secure funds for the organization’s activities, are also included in the costs. Finally, there is the cost of taxation which involves the charge by the government authority on the gross profit or loss of the company, including interest on debentures and dividends to shareholders. It is proportionately related to the output level as shown on the charts. As output increases, the tax also increases, thus its costs increases (Maheshwari, Maheshwari, and Maheshwari, 2021). From the above-analyzed data, we can say that both the business’s actual and planned performance is in the same line, and there is a slight diversion on the actual and intended outcome; hence, they are positively related in terms of
profit goals of the company.Graphs Comparing the Budgeted Against the Actual PerformanceBudgeted Against Actual Sales.

graphs above measure the actual performance and the budgeted performance of the business. They show the variance between the business plan and the actual outcome. From the graphs, we can see that the budgeted; sales, operating profit, gross profit, and the actual; sales, gross profit, operating profit exhibit the same trend. The budgeted parameters designates a constant increasing growth, while all the actual parameters show a fluctuating growth. The actual parameters have a steadily increasing growth from October to February. They reach their peak in January and starts dropping in February up to March and then start to pick again with a constant speed before they start increasing increasingly in May. The performance then starts to shoot at a higher rate from august to its pick in September.
As a result, this implies that the business has peak and low seasons across these performance periods, and the company should therefore strive to minimize losses during the low seasons and maximize its profits in high seasons.Profitability Ratio Calculations for both Budgeted and Actual YearsNet profit ratio : the calculation of these ratios are derived from the statements of profit or loss accounts created above.Actual performance 1.      1.

Unfortunately, I have not been able to attend any event or concert with a cultural dance performance. However, I remember well the TV program, part of which was dedicated to New Zealand’s indigenous peoples and their unique culture. The event was filmed in New Zealand and was called the traditional Poi dance; the date of the event is unknown to me, but I watched the program in December 2021. It was not the first time I saw cultural dance performances, but it was one of the most impressive.Poi dance is performed by large groups of Maori men and women who perform synchronized dance moves. The movements are quite simple and include mainly stepping from one foot to the other and active movements of the arms and hands. Additionally,
women often spin around their axis and also walk one after another in lines. Specific actions also include interaction with special balls, bars, and sticks by each woman as additional objects, as well as singing. The theme of this dance is the traditional culture of the Maori people, in particular the expression of joy and gratitude.The most important movement theme in this dance is the interaction with various objects such as balls, bars, and sticks. Each of the women starts the dance with small fluffy balls, then moves to short white bars, and then they are replaced by sticks. The rhythm is set throughout the dance by clapping and singing, and the interaction with these objects is the center of the action and determines the movement. For example,
women actively moved by stepping from foot to foot and moving their arms with balls in their hands, while with bars, they mostly sat in a circle. Additionally, bars and sticks were used to set the rhythm when they were banged on the floor or against each other.The cultural significance of this dance lies in the preservation and demonstration of the traditions of the Maori people. In particular, through such mass dances, they show the identity of their people and interact with each other. I think it was the collectivity and mass character that impressed me the most. When I watched this dance, I was surprised by how well a group of people consisting of 30-40 people dances, sings, and interacts with objects at the same time. I
felt joy and surprise, along with a sense of respect for this fun and spectacular tradition.The Maori used traditional costumes, makeup, and continuous rhythmic singing to enhance the movements of the dance. It is noteworthy that the music was performed exclusively by the singing of the dancers, which created an amazing effect of authenticity and immersion. In addition, all participants in the dance used extremely speaking facial expressions, which in particular could be used to understand the plot of the song and the dance as a whole. Thus, it was more like a performance of songs, dances, and the use of various objects that the Maori presented. In addition to the described dance before the start of the event itself, men and women in the same traditional costumes
food. Mostly fish dishes and local fruits were provided, the names of which were not presented.When I watched this performance, I was overwhelmed with awe and a sense of community. I wanted to repeat the movements and hum the tunes that the Maori sang. I do not think I have ever been so touched by dance before because the energy of this performance literally gave me goosebumps. This mass character and coherence of the dance amazed me, and the artistry of the performers made me immerse myself in the atmosphere of Maori culture. This experience was much more enjoyable for me than I expected because I have never been a fan of traditional dances. However, this dance is a real performance that captivates and amazes.
A policy brief is a concise explanation of a particular issue. The brief policy aims at government policymakers or interested parties who shape or influence policy. A policy brief provides adequate background for the reader to comprehend the problem and persuade them to handle it immediately. It identifies the most effective solutions to the problem and gives data to back them up. The policy brief encourages the reader to make the best decision possible.A good policy brief should be concise and focused on meanings rather than procedures. The policy brief should concentrate on a single issue or concern and give enough evidence from multiple sources (“2022 NACo Legislative Conference Livestreams”, 2022).Policy Briefs on the State, Local and Federal Issue1st policy briefEscalating Food Prices – A national crisisAction to
be taken to eliminate poverty and hungerEscalating food prices pose a problem to the poor, government of low-income countries with high import bills, and aids agencies managing increased demand for cash and food. The poor are unable to buy food. Low-income countries face political unrest. The problem emanates from a lack of better investment in the food industry and poor management of the national food supply (Lubell, 2021).What happens and why?Initially, food prices were affordable since the farmers and the government had invested a lot in the agriculture industry. Since 2000, food prices have started escalating due to the increased cost of fertilizers, farm machinery, and chemicals. An increase in food prices was due to increments in fuels prices.Impact on the poor, low-income counties and farming industriesThe poor
spend most of their income on food; hence escalating food prices contribute to high expenditure, which is not manageable. The higher food prices contribute to higher transport costs that affect farmers’ income. The low-income countries face pressure from the bills, leading to low economic development and growth (Lubell, 2021).Policy recommendationUrgent action is required to eliminate distress that emanates from escalating food prices, and more resources are needed to support WEP and assist developing countries with higher import bills. Relevant policies are required to help farmers produce more food.ConclusionThe correct measure is needed to control the food prices and promote economic growth. The government must regulate the oil prices to enable farmers and the agriculture industry to reduce their income-expenditure hence low food prices.2 nd policy briefNatural resources: climate
change challengeThe change of climate has occurred recently in the countries that cannot handle the change. The developing countries are the most affected because they depend on natural resources. The countries face global warming due to industrialization. Effective management of the natural resources leads to climate and suitable development.Soil erosionMost of the lands are affected by soil erosion due to cutting down the trees and poor management of the environment, like poor cultivating and grazing practices.Low rainfallsLow rain leads to low crop production and desertification. It makes the farmers have difficulty planning crop cultivation, resulting in a developing country.Policy recommendationThe government protects the water catchment areas and natural forests within arid and semi-arid regions. The government promotes farm levels to mitigate climate change.ConclusionThe practical measures to be put
in place to control adverse weather changes that contribute to climate change (Lubell, 2021).3 rd policy briefSuitable agriculture and rural development – strengthening rural and agricultural businessSuitable agriculture and rural development satisfy economic, social, and cultural needs without endangering future generations.

involve a justice department to ensure anyone who violates the related laws on gun violence is prosecuted in court.The government and politicians have developed the necessary plan, such as no sales of firearms to unlicensed groups or individuals, licensing the company that sells the gun, and prohibiting individuals from carrying the weapon in public. The implementation of the federal regulations will minimize gun violence among Americans. The politician organized the congress to support the national laws governing machine guns’ licensing. If the set regulations are adhered to, there will be a reduction in gun violence in America (Vernick et al., 2017).
In the last decade, Chinese internet enterprises have grown at a breakneck pace. This is significant because, while the online world in China is well-known to be trapped behind the Great Wall, there may be another half of the issue that has been comparatively overlooked: the big three Chinese internet providers are also hybrid or blended in the global economies in general of the investment, possession, and control framework that supports them (Jia & Winseck, 2018). The Chinese administration’s determination to improve the nation’s communication network and tight influence and authority has fueled the internet’s fast expansion in China. However, China’s most recent phase of internet growth has been driven by a three-way interaction involving the State, internet enterprises, and foreign financial capital. While these mechanisms are now substantially altering the Chinese internet, they have not been adequately investigated in research journals.The term “financialization” contributes to the expanding significance of finance, financial markets, and investment firms in the functioning of the economy. Financialization has an influence on both the macroeconomic conditions and combines the features by altering the structure and operation of financial markets as well as affecting company behavior and economic policy. Financialization has also resulted in higher income growth in the financial sector than in the rest of the economy. Financial crises may cause lasting lost revenue, have a terrible impact on the poor and increase unemployment.
IntroductionJudicial determinations are the outcomes of events in which the adjudicators are constrained by defined rules, independent from extraneous influences, and bound by their social experiences or sensibilities. In Duncan Kennedy’s Freedom and Constraint in Adjudication: A Critical Phenomenology , the interpretation of the law is presented as a constant interchange between law and life. Consequently, most judicial decisions are obvious outcomes reflecting the legal arguments, presented facts, and the judge’s ideological commitments. However, Kennedy argues that adjudicators develop the desired outcome at the initial presentation of a dispute. As a result, the subsequent interpretation and analysis of the law attempt to support their sense of justice and substantiate their decisions to make the judgment acceptable. While this argument mirrors the inherent tension and interplay between life and
the law, it underpins the unavoidability of the principle of political neutrality in adjudication processes. Although judges usually reach their decisions by observing the legal rules of judging and exercising their freedoms in making judicial choices, their experiences and social context often influence the outcome of cases.Duncan Kennedy’s Rejection of Political Neutrality in AdjudicationAdjudication is the process through which judicial officers exercise their authority to determine disputes. It encompasses judges’ interpretation of the law through the observance of the established legal constraints and the exercise of judicial choices in making determinations. Kennedy (526) contends that judicial processes reflect a constant interplay between freedom and constraint. Manko (2) corroborates this view and asserts that traditionally, adjudicators determine matters brought before them by interpreting and contextualizing the laws against the
presented facts and evidence. However, such an interpretation involves engaging with the questions of value, which indicates that adjudicators cannot avoid integrating political considerations in their decision-making. This implies that the interpretation of the law is not entirely a constrained or wholly open undertaking. As a result, judges feel obligated to interpret the law in a clearly defined manner and in accordance with their sense of justice. This subjectivity reflects the phenomenological aspects of the interpreter of the law and comprises the context and ideological commitment of the judges.Additionally, the literal interpretation of the law limits the ability of the judicial officers to sufficiently explore and consider the materials presented. In most cases, the legal resources point to clearly defined outcomes after evaluating the facts and arguments. This
The Food Safety Modernization Act (FSMA) is created to address the issue of food safety that concerns many American residents – consumers and manufacturers. My colleague’s work represents the position that FSMA is not coping with its ability to make food safer. The peer discusses the content of the law, the danger of foodborne illness, food pollution, and presents arguments supporting the position on the inefficiency of FSMA. The work focuses significantly on the fact that there is no evidence that the provisions of the law can make food healthier even though it was adopted.I do not believe that FSMA is ineffective, and although the law has several shortcomings, I do not support a colleague’s position. The influence of the law is already confirmed by the fact that
food safety through FSMA is also important and influential for future improvements. Thus, it is possible to find evidence of the effectiveness of the law under consideration.Having considered the positions of the opposite sides of the debate, I am inclined to argue about the positive impact of FSMA on food quality and public health. Food can be contaminated at various stages of the supply chain. FSMA focuses on the initial point – manufacturers and sets specific requirements for them. Although the danger is still present at other locations, the law is an essential step for future security. It drew attention to the problem, and in the future, society should expect other measures to improve food safety.
Subsidizing programs are considered welfare and net initiatives that the government takes to aid low-income families and individuals affected by poverty. These programs offset the essential needs of the citizens from health, food, housing, and education. Such an initiative aims to allow people access to quality services and save some money for their personal growth. The subject of whether the subsidizing of essentials causes an incentive or de-incentive to seek employment is a debatable one.An example of a subsidized program is the subsidized housing, House Vouchers, and Public Housing programs. This scheme was initiated specifically for the poor and the disabled. Through the plan, citizens from economically low backgrounds and those physically impaired could afford to live in private and government-owned rental houses. Generally, it can be argued
Large Corporation in Modern TimesThe gist of Justice Stevens’ opinion in Citizens United verse Federal Election Commission is that organizations are lawfully created bodies that carry out activities and are allowed specific legal protections equivalent to those granted to people. The state determines their rights and privileges (Massey, 2016). According to Justice Stevens, the court’s majority decision to overturn a century of legislative restrictions on election spending by corporations and unions is based on the First Amendment’s protection of right to free speech, which applies only to genuine people and groups of persons.Companies supersede the nineteenth century, but their current incarnation and involvement in the community, political, and fiscal policy changed and developed so dramatically in the last era that it is difficult to comprehend. Contemporary social transformation
without analyzing the importance businesses have played in cultural and social structure transformation (Massey, 2016). They own and manage the majority of the world’s wealth; they are a pillar of the economy and a means for accumulating riches.The Corporation’s History of TransmissionIn 1600, the British, the Dutch, and other successful trading firms functioned under state charter to collect cash for trips, facilitate business, and fight any opposition they confronted from other states’ trading firms and the residents at the places of their ventures. The British East India Firm, a privately run business, had more than two hundred and fifty thousand troops under its control at one time to complete its mission of establishing supremacy over the world (Massey, 2016. The British royal, such as the Dutch crown, leased
or subcontracted the empire to private corporations.How Large Corporations Direct Social ChangeIn at least five aspects, big businesses are a driving factor behind the social transformation. First, the companies are deeply involved in repurposing and discovering different uses for old technology and building discoveries that help and drive what we do as consumers. Secondly, companies have structured and opposed labor for more than a century, defining how work should be performed and the norms regulating professional life (Massey, 2016). Third, the management of capital and the aims for which capital is deployed determines their size and economic stability.Fourth, huge companies control the physical environment with their images, goods and services, and the sensitivities that push people to engage to the fullest of their capability in the realm of
product consumption and beyond (Massey, 2016). Finally, corporations are vital to the political system, playing a significant role in promoting legislation that helps them and resisting policies that would limit or impede their ability to operate as privately operated, income businesses.Economic liberalization or nonregulation of financial activities, for instance, having the government do nothing. Those are some of their objectives in state intervention. Statistics and research are mobilized to show that any limits or regulations are pointless. Sometimes it is better for major firms that the issue never obtains an airing, rather than fighting back unpleasant recommendations regarding how the government should handle such concerns (Massey, 2016). Any hint of difficulty is disregarded simply as a non-issue or something that falls outside the government’s jurisdiction.Large Corporations and Resistance
to Social ChangeThere are barriers to social transformation in the major companies, just as there are instances of resistance to technology, social movements, and other agents of social transformation ( Massey, 2016). There is also opposition to the trend of societal transformation because of company practices. However, big firms are expected to maintain their affairs because they are part of the existing condition.For years, reporters and researchers attempted to understand why companies oppose or weaken measures to curb their influence over resources (Massey, 2016). Public interest groups have proposed limiting their control over tax policies and economic legislation, enacting more restrictions, and boosting administration and community supervision. Companies frequently successfully reject these regulations and any alteration to their activities, whether acting alone or through trade associations.The strong States
and Social ChangeThe opportunity of the nation’s grew extensively with the exceptional of rebels and denial, nobody within the ideological range, self-governing and preservation disagreed that government should offer safety and physical security for its people or involve themselves in war. The current nations made and preserved the worth of the currency and control funds. States constructed and operated learning institutions, bridges, roads, waste treatment plants, and airstrips; it was a move that was regarded as the end of the Iris Summers lifetime (Massey, 2016). The United States enhanced hospitals, improved public resources, and prolonged people’s rights, which showed a great driver of social alteration since it provided solutions to the problems to its people.Public Health; Reducing Disease and Accidental Death as a Public GoodThe death rate in
women giving birth was about one thousand for every delivery. The state made vaccinations for several kid illnesses in the research facilities, the administration injection agendas quickly proliferated. In 1950, the United States issued polio vaccine to the public institution with the help of the state health programs. About three million individuals succumb to car accidents (Massey, 2016). The public well-being programs should aim at the speed limits, better driving, put strict measures of traffic rules and put measures on the lessons provided to the drivers and tutor drivers.National Progress through Control of NatureThe United States regarded the waterway used for movements as a community good. For example, the construction of the leeves to manage the flooding of the Mississippi and the wide range of dam creation programs
on almost every large river in the West was an exertion of people’s power over nature ( Massey, 2016 ). The repossession of the wilderness helped the state to have control of the regions and the resources for development and weakened, evacuated, and secluded indigenous individuals with significant disruption and brought individuals of European lineage to the regions.The Judicial Road to Civil RightsThe state uses important ways such as passing and implementing rules to promote social transformation. The legal systems carry out important duties to ensure that cases follow legal precedents and the civil liberties computed in the sets of law (Massey, 2016). Sometimes the court tries to catch up to people’s ideas and shifting practices. However, the court’s verdicts are part of the social alteration, particularly when
ChinaThe foreign control that led to discrimination to the army and decline in the economy of China. in the past two centuries, pushed the nation away from nation-building and got rid of the old-style and social development (Massey, 2016). Leaders from the Chinese Communist Party made the nation stronger and got rid of the deficiency and universal weakness. The leaders who had dreams to make a stronger nation and overcame every aspect of life had the opportunity to lead the Chinese Communist Party and perform economic and social alterations.
IntroductionHuman beings maintain good health through practices such as eating balanced diets. Pregnant mothers need perfect nutrition not only for themselves, but also for their unborn babies too. The period not long before the birth of a child is referred to as the antepartum period, where mothers are encouraged to eat healthy diets to ensure the development and delivery of a child. Medical practitioners term nutrition as one among significant factors that contribute to a successful child delivery. According to Clark (2020), eating a balanced diet will provide nutrients for both the mother and the child. However, ladies are still exposed to malnutrition practices that are caused by various factors such as the level of income, awareness, and illness history. This essay discusses the risk factors of age,
2018). Stickler states that teenage mothers are at a higher risk than those over 20. Pregnant mothers require a variety of vitamins and minerals that are necessary for both body and child development. Teenagers like eating snacks and a lot of starch foods such as fries, thus leaving their bodies imbalanced with nutrients. It would definitely be hard for a teenager to strictly follow a diet schedule compared to a mature woman of about 30 years. Because nutrients are not produced naturally, one must obtain them through eating. When the body does not receive enough nutrients, that is a nutritional deficiency (Nana & Zema, 2018). Teen-aged mothers get exposed to risks such as low birth-weight and premature delivery due to poor nutrition habits during the antepartum period.
President Franklin Roosevelt did much to end the Great Depression, which included passing acts and laws. They were aimed not only at restoring the economy and infrastructure but also at improving the situation of certain groups of the population. They included immigrants, African Americans, and workers, creating health clinics, special courses, college buildings, new schools, and recreation facilities, thus, increasing their quality of life.The first act I would like to analyze is the creation of the Public Works Administration (PWA). It was a Federal American Agency created during the New Deal by President Franklin Roosevelt (Corbett, 2014). This act not only contributed to recreation from the Great Depression but also provided workers, immigrants, and African Americans with workplaces and necessary social infrastructure. The act was specialized in building
corps raised; thus, the business became more profitable. However, there was another side to the coin as people had to pay more money to buy it.In my opinion, the New Deal made a significant contribution to the recovery from the Great Depression. There were created many agencies aimed at the improvement of different fields. Moreover, the government attempted to control wages and prices and established many programs for vulnerable population layers and unemployed people.
Pressure ulcers are a common occurrence in the medical field, affecting patients that are immobile due to illness or injury, or the elderly that typically have less mobility. A pressure ulcer can be defined as localized damage to the skin and soft tissue underneath as a result of intense or prolonged pressure, or pressure combined with shear. The prevalence of pressure ulcers has remained relatively consistent in the United States, affecting nearly 3 million adults. However, healthcare costs have been increasing and pressure ulcers, if left untreated, can cause severe health issues such as localized or general infection, or necrosis. Approximately 60,000 people die from pressure ulcer adverse outcomes each year (Mervis and Phillips, 2019).Pressure ulcers can occur both during hospital stay or after discharge during homecare. Many
housebound adults who may be immobile due to age, injury, post-surgery recovery, or other illnesses are at-risk to develop pressure ulcers. Unlike in hospitals, there is no regular nurse presence to aid in changing of positioning, dressings, or identifying ulcers early on. Therefore, literature indicates thatan effective solution for adults in community settings is the use of pressure reducing surfaces. At the most primitive level, there are recommendations to use pillow, cushions, or mattress pads to reduce the pressure and support the area (MedlinePlus, 2020).More complex interventions would be the use of pressure reducing support surfaces. This is identified as durable medical equipment (DME) and used to care for pressure sores and ulcers. Pressure reducing support surfaces can be split into three groups dependent on complexity. Group 1
The process of recruiting employees is vital since it determines the type of workforce and skills organizations will have to accomplish their goals and objectives. Companies’ managers and recruiters focus on hiring diverse teams to ensure that their firms are more innovative creative and achieve better results. Undeniably, a workforce comprising individuals from different backgrounds and perspectives contributes significantly to newer and diverse ideas that are instrumental in solving problems and driving innovation. Nevertheless, fairness or diversity, attracting the right candidates, the establishment of a strong employer brand, engaging qualified candidates, and efficiency are prevalent concerns in the recruitment process. An evaluation of these challenges can help design strategies to address them.Many organizations experience problems attracting and hiring diverse candidates due to unconscious bias. Companies have legal obligations
to offer equal opportunities to all individuals regardless of applicants’ gender, age, religion, or ethnicity (Horváth & Szabó, 2019). However, unconscious bias during the recruitment process can increase risks for legal litigations and deprive companies of a chance to hire and retain the best persons for particular jobs.Attracting suitable candidates and engaging the most qualified ones is also a significant concern in recruiting. Higher chances are that qualified and unqualified candidates apply for jobs once companies advertise vacancies. It becomes challenging to find the right candidate, primarily when a pool of applicants comprises unskilled talent (Fuller et al., 2021). Consequently, the recruiting managers may end up choosing the best individual they can find at the time but not the best fit for the position. Conversely, different recruiters regularly
contact qualified candidates, making it challenging for a particular employer’s email to stand out. Additionally, the most qualified individuals have different job offers to consider, necessitating an extra effort to persuade such candidates to choose your organization over the competitors.Lack of a strong employer brand is another issue that impacts the recruiting process. An exceptional employer brand is an instrumental tool for attracting and engaging better candidates (Broomfield, 2019). Although investment in employer branding increases the possibility of making a quality hire, the approach involves complexities. Establishing a strong employer brand may include anything ranging from promoting the organization’s culture on different media platforms to guaranteeing a positive applicant experience. The strategy is a collective and continuous process that requires the recruitment team to involve coworkers.Establishing and maintaining
innovation and incorporating the same into operation while focusing on the cost factor. According to Elia et al. (2021), the cost factor is the main aspect to focus on when a firm needs to be innovative. For instance, cost consideration is critical as it will minimize resulting friction from the extended cost that might jeopardize entire operations. Cost consideration will be my major aspect to focus on in my venture.
The introduction of project management standards is vital for any organization as it will improve collaboration between employees and goal achievement. Thus, the recommended strategy focuses on creating the roadmap for the project. It should imply working with interim goals and a final purpose (Kerzner, 2017). Thus, the standards should include improved teamwork, the discussion between team members, and the attainment of high standards and outcomes via collaborative effort. The first standard is critical for any organization as an aligned work of teams is vital for their evolution. The employees should be provided with the opportunity and tools to create high-performance groups and engage in interaction and decision-making. For instance, Basecamp can be employed as an application to create a platform for workers to discuss current tasks and
Justice is important in a country and should be applied equally in crime and social setup. Social justice demands that everyone be given equal economic, political, and social rights regardless of their social class or race background (Chisholm-Burns et al., 2021). During John F. Kennedy’s presidential campaign in 1965, he was unhappy with children loitering on the streets while others were in school. John F. Kennedy saw the need to develop a learning culture for all children in the United States. Ending the helplessness in children would require disrupting the culture of poverty that was passed from generation to generation through education. The move to operate Head Start was to promote social justice in education for children. Head Start was initiated and started in the summer of 1965
by Lyndon Baines Johnson (Pillay, 2018). This essay will discuss the role of the Head Start program in the promotion of social justice in the US, focusing on the values taught to the children and the activities that constitute the program.Social justice promotion through Head Start is seen through its initiative to instill cognitive and emotional development of children from low low-income families below five years in preparation for school. The children under the program would not go to school if they were denied the opportunity (Johnson & Jackson, 2019). The children at the program are taught life-long skills of observing social justice for all races and backgrounds.The program’s selection process is an open and justifiable process. When a family is selected for the program, support is provided
depending on the family’s needs. Case officers make frequent visits to the homes to see how best they can help the families. The needs that can be addressed range from health problems and parenting skills to drug abuse and alcoholism. The social workers’ focus on the selected families is maintained to the issues identified.Head Start provides clinical services to the selected families. Head Start provides counseling to individuals and children either in groups or singly, depending on the needs of the families. The program’s other clinical services include diagnosing health problems such as anxiety or depression, among other health complications (Williams et al., 2018). Mental health problems are common in low-income families due to difficulty meeting their daily needs. The social workers working with the program are highly
qualified and can offer psychological assessments to the families and visit them at home to provide counseling and intervention in crisis cases (Nix et al., 2018). The officers can review the family’s needs upon new discoveries and support the family in other initially not included needs.To provide equal opportunities to the community, the program social officers organize outreach activities in schools, community gatherings, and churches to educate the community about Head Start activities. Educating the community about Head Start allows every family that qualifies to enroll in the program to have a chance to be assisted. The outreach team distributes enrollment forms that provide the requirements for a family and child to be registered to the program (Gatewood, 2019). The social officers encourage the attendants of the organized
gatherings to share the information with other community members who maybe be qualified but do not have the chance to get the enrollment form or have never heard of the Head Start program. Spreading the word promotes equal opportunity for the community to be enrolled in the program and consequently the promotion of social justice.Accountability is highly valued at the Head Start program through record keeping. The records of registered families are updated at any time in case of changes. The registered families’ needs files are updated whenever assessments are conducted. The officers conduct checks regularly to know the progress of the families and children following the needs registered at first. The Head Start program might withdraw a family from the program in cases of change in social
Purpose of the StudyCOVID-19 has shaped the global economic context significantly. Head Start, an initiative that has been providing educational opportunities, as well as focus on healthy nutrition and management of public health issues in children in families affected by the coronavirus, illustrates how the outcomes of COVID-19 have shaped the performance of non-profit organizations, causing them to adjust to the environment of the online setting. This study aims to analyze the coronavirus’s impact on educational and health management opportunities for children in families affected by COVID-19 in the U.S., providing solutions to the current problem by providing educational opportunities and social support to the target demographic.Literature ReviewHistorical ReviewThe coronavirus has brought changes that would have been deemed as otherwise unimaginable to the setting of the global economy.
Specifically, the complete transfer to the online context and the readjustment of strategies for managing financial resources have been essential change that has affected the performance of multiple organizations (Wilke et al., 2020). Notably, due to the comparative recency of the pandemic becoming a global problem, the history of the issue at hand, namely, the effects of COVID-19 on early childhood education and health management, is quite brief (Wilke et al., 2020).Specifically, some of the earliest studies show that the variables in question are deeply interconnected as the pandemic has drastically changed resource allocation (Wilke et al., 2020). As a result, a range of early childhood education projects has been lacking the necessary funding (Wilke et al., 2020). Similarly, the management of public health issues in children has
been affected by COVID-19 since a sizeable amount of financial resources had to be allocated to address the health crisis (Wilke et al., 2020). However, the exact relationships between the variables in question are yet to be discovered.In turn, the issue of early childhood education has been the subject of multiple discussions for quite some time. The developmental significance of providing children with early education opportunities has been examined since the 17 th century and has been actively explored since the 1930s (Silalahi, 2019). With the emergence of theories of early childhood education created by Vygotsky, Piaget, and Eriksson, strategies for encouraging the rapid emergence of critical thinking and related academic skills in young children have been devoiced (Silalahi, 2019). In their frameworks, the researchers in question specified
different developmental stages, explaining the nature and course of cognitive progress (Silalahi, 2019). Therefore, understanding these theories is central to examining the effects of external factors, such as the pandemic, on early childhood development opportunities.Recognizing the role that external factors play in children’s cognitive development is central to building the framework for their successful learning and identifying the effects that the pandemic, with the relevant changes in the Head Start opportunities, has produced on children’s academic options. Therefore, Vygotsky’s developmental framework is vital for examining the variables in question. According to the theorist, social interactions represent the key to effective early childhood development and learning, the zone of proximal development defining the range of skills a child can embrace at a specific time (Silalahi, 2019). Therefore, in the
context of the pandemic and the drop in social interactions, the opportunities for enhancing early education are significantly reduced.Similarly, the theoretical framework created by Piaget emphasizes the importance of building cognitive skills at an early age. However, Piaget’s approach suggests the focus on individual learning as opposed to knowledge development through social interactions, which allows suggesting that the lack of Head Start opportunities may not be as devastating to the opportunities for young learners as one might have believed it to be.Finally, the concept of social support that Head Start offers needs to be reviewed as a critical, independent variable. The subject matter has been examined through the lens of the recent changes in social services, particularly the outcomes of the coronavirus (Jalongo, 2021). Specifically, the issues regarding
the increase in staff turnover, a rise in workplace burnout, and the resulting unavailability of quality care need to be examined.It is worth noting that the current body of knowledge lacks evidence concerning the effects of the pandemic on the quality of early education and the development of cognitive skills in children. The specified lack f information is understandable given the relatively short time span over which the pandemic has managed to engulf most the social interactions on global and interpersonal levels. Furthermore, there is a considerable lack of information concerning the specific effects of the absence of Head start opportunities on children’s early development. Therefore, further analysis of the specified concerns is strongly needed to identify perspectives for future early childhood education.Current FindingsAt the same time, believing
that the issue of supporting children academically and socially has not been seen as an issue with strong research potential lately. For example, the study by Sciberras et al. (2020) has investigated the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic on the physical and mental health of children in Australia, thus, producing essential results. Furthermore, despite the gap in the analysis of the effects of the levels of social security, particularly the provision of education options and health maintenance opportunities, especially in regard to Head Start services, several studies have outlined the drastic effects of the coronavirus on the quality, efficacy, and frequency of support provided for young learners (Jalongo, 2021).Specifically, the paper by Li et al. (2020) denotes the presence of multiple obstacles in addressing the accessibility of early
education opportunities and health management services for families affected by the coronavirus (Jalongo, 2021). Nonetheless, the issue needs to be explored further in order to identify the exact nature of the problem and the current range of concerns that young learners have in accessing learning options and healthcare services.MethodologyTo address the issues raised above, meticulous and profound research will be required. Specifically, the mixed research method will have to be adopted to gauge the coronavirus’s exact effect on the opportunities for children and their families, as well as the extent of challenges that Head Start has been facing in providing the services in question to the target demographic. Specifically, the qualitative analysis will allow for determining the essential factors impeding the provision of vital education and healthcare opportunities
to young children. Afterward, a quantitative assessment of the effects of the identified factors on Head Start’s performance and the quality of services offered by the organization will be conducted.The research will involve the participation of at least 200 people so that the study results can be as representative of the real-life setting as possible. Therefore, the sample size will be equal to 132 participants. The specified number will allow for testing the research hypothesis with the required extent of certainty in the research outcomes and the credibility of findings (). To obtain the sample for further analysis, the simple random sampling approach will be utilized. Although often dismissed for the lack of nuance in its framework, the simple random sampling technique will help reduce the extent of
determining their ability to use their cognitive skills, as well as the assessments determining their health rates at different stages of using Head Start. In turn, qualitative data needed to evaluate the nature of the observed changes will be collected from interviews with the children’s parents.AnalysisTo assess the qualitative data, the thematic analysis will be utilized. Thus, key themes related to the subject matter and essential characteristics of the observed change will be identified based on the interview results. The quantitative data analysis process, it will be performed. As a result, the changes in children’s performance and health rates will be identified.HypothesisCOVID-19 has affected the performance of Head Start, therefore, causing a significant drop in the range of early childhood education opportunities and children’s health service quality.
The definition of the HOPES (Homicide Outreach Project Empowering Survivors) as a necessary tool for individuals that experience this form of attack is accurate. Karmen indicates that victims have a profile and are likely to get attacked in the future if they do not develop a protection system (Karmen, 2020). Individuals in big cities and near them have a higher chance of experiencing one form of violence such as robbery or homicide when compared to people that live at a farther distance from these locales. Programs such as HOPES provide these individuals with answers to troubling questions involving why the cases are more rampant in their locale. It is also important to consider the potential for these programs to illustrate the safety level of a particular location based
that studies such as those conducted by Kopel in 1987(Karmen, 2020) do not focus on male victims, illustrating the flawed nature of this system. While males encompass a section of this population, they are not listed in the statistics. It is also crucial to note that black individuals are more prone to experience any form of crime when compared to their white counterparts (Karmen, 2020). Discerning such information allows programs such as HOPES to target particular communities and neighborhoods while providing aid.
IntroductionThe vague language of the current Intermountain Healthcare (IH) description of PC results in insufficient elaboration of specific nursing responsibilities such as quality of patient life, caregiver support, and non-discriminant patient treatment. A comprehensive PC policy has not been adopted in the IH facilities, leaving care teams to devise an individual approach to each terminal patient, which may be inefficient and result in subpar service. Across the country, many HCPs lack knowledge and skills in pain and symptom management, communication, and care coordination, while the public has only a vague understanding of the benefits of PC and how to access them (Meier et al., 2017). Given a wide range of responsibilities in providing palliative care (PC) and lack of specific instructions, IH healthcare providers (HCPs) filling only primary
orders such as medical prescriptions may coincidentally neglect some care aspects. Therefore, an instructive PC policy is needed to facilitate successful administration and ensure equitable access to care services in the IH facilities.Current PolicyDue to the lack of an established PC policy, most details were obtained from annual reports and public website sections. Palliative care in IH facilities pursues several goals: quality of patient life, symptom relief, family and caregiver support, and a team approach to care and care aligned with patients’ aspirations (Intermountain Healthcare, 2018). However, the current key goal is for HCPs to focus on managing pain and other symptoms like nausea or sleep problems (Intermountain Healthcare, 2020b). None of the listed elements are thoroughly elaborated, including the key goal. Intermountain Healthcare (2022) nursing services for
end-of-life care include symptom assessment, “skilled services and treatments,” and situational management. In addition to nursing care, patients and their families can expect the care team to cover counseling, emotional and spiritual support, medication and supplies, domestic helper services, and home care in acute need (Intermountain Healthcare, 2022). The nuances are to be addressed in a plan of care (POC), jointly created by the care team and the patient based on the diagnosis, symptoms, and other needs (Intermountain Healthcare, 2022). However, it is unclear what ‘skilled services’ constitute or how detailed POCs are.Literature ReviewScholars in medical and legal research encourage the development of detailed palliative care policies. Supporting this initiative, IH developed a hospital-based electronic palliative care algorithm to improve the identification of patients benefitting from PC services
and calculate PC penetration rates (Gruhler et al., 2018). The algorithm then indicated that the need for receiving PC might be as high as 26.4% of the total IH inpatient population (Gruhler et al., 2018). It will be progressively more challenging for HCPs to devise individualized care plans for IH patients with as high and potentially increasing numbers. Therefore, an approach with great universal applicability is needed to meet this demand.Furthermore, the policy focus should be on restructuring service delivery as a whole. Palmryd et al. (2021) found that nurses caring for intensive care unit patients did not prioritize integrity, arguing that more explicit guidelines are required to ameliorate the issue. This issue may apply to the IH facilities, given that extant IH guidance on PC does not
identify the expectations and responsibilities of each party. Thus, the research mandates a policy change to guide productive communication between providers and patients.Additionally, the lack of a universal, comprehensive PC opens a leeway for bias. A striking finding was that patients’ quality of end-of-life care might depend on the disease the patient suffers (Martinsson et al., 2018). At the same time, Spraker-Perlman et al. (2019) found that IH patients without known critical conditions (CC) benefit significantly from PC support before their death just as much as patients without CC. Therefore, the research necessitates ensuring that the non-discriminant approach to PC provision is specified in the policy.Lastly, blaming IH nurses for negligence is impractical, given their inability to assist sometimes. The outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic has demonstrated that
the lack of resources and nursing burnout contribute to the increased negligence in PC (Human Rights Watch, 2021). In its Annual Report (2020a), IH recognized that its caregivers focused on creating personal protective equipment (PPE) assembly lines, with their regular duties seeing a significant decrease in hours because of the pandemic. This situation mandates ensuring that nurses can meet the care requirements. Hence, the policy to improve patient care should involve reconsidering the carer support system, as nurses’ workload can interfere with the quality and quantity of services provided.Discussion OutlineA detailed assessment of contributing factors, strategic goals, and budget plan will be required to create and implement the policy successfully. The policy should ensure even responsibility distribution and uphold an appropriate accountability standard for non-compliance. It should provide
an appropriate level of detail in each aspect and implement enforcement mechanisms to avoid regular duties suffering due to negligence. Moreover, sufficient staffing in every establishment is mandatory to avoid situations where IH staff is overwhelmed with double duty. Overall, the proposed approach should create concrete and explicit guidelines regulating nursing staff responsibilities in end-of-life care, a comprehensive support network for HCPs and patients, and specific instances of accountability.DemographicsThe COVID-19 pandemic highlighted that curative care is currently at the core of provider-patient interaction over any PC aspect. During an acute crisis, hundreds of IH staff members were sent to help in New York hospitals (Intermountain Healthcare, 2020a). The crisis may have passed, but the question of which duties take priority remains, which may be overwhelming for the IH
facilities staff. Therefore, the major demographic that policy changes can affect will be nursing staff needing explicit guidance on responsibilities and expectations. Further, the inpatient population of the IH facilities will be experiencing the consequences of the changed PC routine.Morbidity and Mortality RatesNot addressing the issue of inadequate PC may impact mortality rates significantly. Gruhler et al. (2018) estimate 90 million Americans currently living with serious, life-threatening illnesses and expect the number to double within 25 years. There is strong evidence of PC reducing acute unplanned hospitalizations and specialized PC services associated with improved short- and long-term care outcomes (Sleeman et al., 2021). Therefore, improving the policy approach to specialist palliative care would improve patient outcomes.Disparities Resulting from the Current PolicyThe poorly recognized role of end-of-life care in
current policy contributes to unequal access to care. Although PC is increasingly recognized as a human right, the lack of guidelines’ support and research prevents many from utilizing it (Sleeman et al., 2021). Specifically, there are two downsides resulting from IH policy reliance on the individual POCs in the facilitation of end-of-life and palliative care. First, individualized POCs mean no universal standard of conduct is established; coupled with a potentially limited level of patient understanding of the services they may require, this could result in underperformance. Second, Intermountain Healthcare’s (2022) policy states that the hospice program and the patient’s physician must approve any proposed POC tests, procedures, and services, adding that “generally, treatments necessary for symptom or pain management” are approved. Therefore, services beyond the necessary symptom management
may not be approved.Cultural IssuesThe proposed change in policy would provide an all-encompassing transformation of the extant system. If any of the PC aspects in IH are currently dependent on creating individualized POCs, these aspects will be thoroughly regulated in the future system. For the IH care teams that are used to working closely with each patient, such a system may initially seem overly prescriptive. Additionally, the cultural background may influence patients’ decision-making regarding pain and PC, making it vital to consider the patient’s beliefs regarding care and death before forming an all-encompassing instructive guidance of staff conduct.Readiness for Change and StakeholdersAmerica has seen tremendous growth in palliative care in the 21st century, indicating the national readiness for policy change and implementation. The IH facilities are receptive to
Cryptocurrencies are a controversial topic in society, as their volatility puts their long-term validity into question. However, older blockchain coins have failed to deliver a scalable and secure currency that will be as decentralized as possible (Hamilton, 2022). Unlike Bitcoin and Etherium, Solana has multiple advantages that make it a worthwhile investment. For this proposal, I would like to highlight the benefits of this cryptocurrency to a business university graduate.Solana is not the newest cryptocurrency, yet it is one with the highest potential. Other blockchains possess a small capacity for transactions, as their operations per second make them unfeasible (Locke, 2021). However, this currency transfers faster and has incomparably small transaction fees (Farrington, 2021). An investment in Solana is a safer choice among cryptocurrencies, yet it has the
yet their current state disallows companies to utilize them efficiently. Solana has the potential to overcome these barriers and turn into a globally accepted currency.In conclusion, Solana is a cryptocurrency that is worth one’s attention, as it has several benefits that make it a better choice for investment than other similar coins. Its current solid position on the market and strong backing from a cryptocurrency community is a perfect indication of future prospects. It might be necessary to analyze Solana’s carbon footprint to prove its potential for a long-term success.
It is no surprise to anyone that professional sport is inseparable from monumental physical and mental challenges. High-profile athletes across disciplines have spoken up on how excruciating training, ongoing lifestyle restrictions, social isolation, and an inevitable race against time have affected their mental well-being during and after their sports careers. Most of these struggles are, to a degree, unavoidable, but an impossible standard of never-ending endurance that athletes have to face outside of practice and championships has undoubtedly made them even harder. The New York Times article Simone Biles Rejects a Long Tradition of Stoicism in Sports (2021) comments on the standard and the way American gymnast Simone Biles rejected it during the Summer Olympic Games 2020. It explores the tense and complex question of emotional vulnerability in
big sports and the cost of such vulnerability.Right at the beginning, the article acknowledges the cultural shift toward acceptance of mental struggles both in general and particularly in athletes. An athlete of Simone Biles’ stature ten years ago, or even five years ago, might have been hesitant to admit that she battled with pressure, much less withdraw in the middle of an Olympic competition. Simone’s decision to quit the largest international event in the sports world has made her a poster figure of the relevant yet uncomfortable conversation. Success in sports, as well as in many other fields, is impossible without self-discipline and willingness to struggle. Yet, which point is considered a respectable place to pause and allow oneself to recover? After her pivotal decision, Simone has experienced
online backlash with accusations of lack of patriotism and strength of spirit. It is therefore clear that for many people the overall result remains significantly more important than the mental well-being of an athlete. Such a setup, however, is an almost certain recipe for an eventual tragedy, a burn-out, or even worse, that could have been avoided if one’s mental needs had been taken seriously early enough.The article proceeds to recite the comments of Sian Beilock, the president of Barnard College, who studies the dynamic between outside pressures and the minds of athletes and business people. According to Beilock, the growing willingness of athletes to speak up proves that mental health issues touch everyone. Biles, Osaka, and others’ open admissions are, according to Beilock, essential in the ongoing
taking a step back might be a smart decision not only within the moment but for the long-term trajectory of an athlete’s ongoing path in their chosen sport. Sustainable lasting success and consistent performance are only possible when a person recognizes and accepts their limits. There is no shame in needing the help of others, as well as there is bravery in admitting the fact and adjusting current actions. At the end of the day, unnecessary endurance does not necessarily reflect greater resolve within championships. As everyone has their resources, it is essential to utilize them in optimal ways without ignoring the basic needs of the human psyche.
It is important to note that psychopharmacology is a critical field of knowledge and expertise for any independent mental health practitioner. The main reason is the fact that psychopharmacology is a science-based study of medications and drugs on human psychology. It is becoming increasingly necessary for a mental health practitioner to be familiar and knowledgeable about pharmacological aspects of the treatment of mental issues.As a future independent mental health practitioner, one must be fully equipped with skills and competencies in treating clients’ mental health problems, which is impossible without pharmacological interventions. It is stated that “even though psychiatrists represent the branch of medicine that specializes in psychopharmacology, they are directly responsible for providing only a fraction of professional services to the mentally ill” (Preston et al., 2021, p.
In the piece under review, Putnam seeks to investigate the nature of pain, specifically, to identify whether it is a brain state or not. He highlights the dissimilarity of brain structure in various forms of life through the example of an octopus and a mammal, from which the difference in their “physical-chemical” functionality emerges (Putnam, p. 56). Simply stated, the ways activity occurs in the brain may differ from one type of it to another. This, according to Putnam, drives to the conclusion that physical responses most living creatures demonstrate, including pain, are not exclusively brain states.An essential nuance, at which the thinker points, is that such reactions normally manifest themselves in particular behavior that enables detecting the state. For instance, it is possible to guess that a
certain organism is experiencing pain, hunger, uncomfortable temperature, or other from its movements or the sounds it is emitting (Putnam, p. 56). This serves to prove that the states are not limited to changes in brain activity, but can also determine its bodily equivalent; therefore, it is more reasonable to consider them complex. Specifically, the term Putnam offers to classify basic physiological response to irritants, which interfere with the well-being of an organism, is “a functional state” (p. 54). His hypothesis tells that to feel pain, a living creature needs to possess an appropriate type of functional organization, which actually determines this condition, making it physically possible.In the simplest terms, Putnam rejects the identical nature of mental and physical properties, which two hypothetically are intertwined up to inseparability.
Horowitz mentions that such a viewpoint falls under the philosophy of “type-physicalism” (p. 81). Meanwhile, Putnam labels it “the brain state theory” (p. 55). His main argument against it, as mentioned, rests on the fact that mental conditions can have various behavioral manifestations, therefore, they hardly share certain physical nature.Putnam’s view doubtlessly is closer to reality in comparison with type-physicalism, primarily because of sufficient practical evidence. In fact, different creatures may act dissimilarly when in pain; thus, they may twitch or shrink, cry, moan, or squeeze, or other. Furthermore, several species, including humans but not limited to them, can camouflage their discomfort to avoid becoming excessively vulnerable. These are the examples to illustrate that physiology-based response to irritants, such as pain, is “multiply realizable” (Horowitz, p. 82). This
is observable even within one species. Therefore, it is more relevant to classify pain as a function with the focus on the behavior that manifests it.To summarize, the hypothesis to which Putnam refers as the brain state theory and which he opposes strongly is doubtful. Notably, the adepts of this view equalize mental states to physical, proclaiming that the former, including pain, share unique physical nature. However, in such a case, actions of organisms in pain would be identical as well, which, as empirical evidence shows, does not correspond to reality.
Coronavirus disease is a rapidly growing worldwide pandemic due to severe pulmonary and syndrome coronavirus 2, henceforth increased pessimism and high loss of lives. It was first discovered in Wuhan (China) in a cluster of pneumonia patients with acute respiratory illness. The pandemic presents an unrivaled challenge to public healthcare and food systems (Alcendor, 2020). As governments try to curb this scourge through border closures, trade restrictions, and confinement measures, it has crippled economies. Beyond impacting the economy and healthcare, it has debilitating effects on many families globally.Disparities in knowledge, attitudes, and practices (KAPs) levels exist regarding COVID. White people are perceived to likely have high knowledge and confidence associated with a high level of education and income compared to their non-white counterparts, who were likely to have
a low level of education and attitude but are viewed as high practice responders (Alcendor, 2020). Race, sex, education, income, health insurance status, and political views are all associated with KAPs.Hispanic and African- Americans have a higher infection rate and the number of deaths, despite being minority races. African-Americans had many deaths in Chicago and Louisiana despite being a minority, consisting of roughly a third of the population. These undermine the social determinants in health, socio-economic disparities, and prevalent racial disparities in health outcomings in the USA. In NEW YORK, 34% of COVID-related deaths were Hispanics, who consist of almost a third of the population (Alobuia et al., 2020).Concerning knowledge of COVID, a higher percentage of white people had a slightly higher knowledge than Hispanics or African-Americans, who
scored lower in a study done by the Kaiser Family Foundation “KFF Coronavirus poll” conducted between 11 and 15 march 2020 on people living in the USA. It’s, therefore, easy to say a majority of White people had exposure to information on COVID compared to their Hispanic and African-American counterparts. The socio-demographical racial disparities are evident as areas with a high population of Hispanics and African-Americans lacked the correct knowledge on the COVID virus.Univariate analysis shows that African-Americans and Hispanics have a higher attitude towards COVID, positive or negative, than the White race. These can be highly attributed to the higher number of white people with higher health insurance than other races in the US. Similarly, income highly affects attitude, and those with high income annually were fewer
safe practices to minimize the spread and infection of COVID.Many measures have been put in place to minimize the spread of COVID. These directives may reduce the spread but having the correct knowledge and a positive attitude can affect how we relate to COVID. It also leads to more empowerment and inclusivity in decision-making among minorities. Racial disparities in KAP exist globally. A racial and financial divergence exists in the degrees of KAPs connected with COVID-19. More work is expected to distinguish instructive apparatuses customized to explicit racial and socio-economic groups.
IntroductionMovies about racial tensions and the effects of significant tragic events take up a large portion of cinematography. Their creators send a particular message through films using verbal and silent visual signs. The movie Crash is an example of a media piece with a strong anti-racism message while showing how ingrained it is in every community – even those who face it themselves. It has a diverse cast of characters that hold their own biases against other groups and even members of communities to which they would say they belong. The use of verbal and nonverbal communication in Crash creates the picture of post-9/11 America plagued by mistrust, hatred, and fear, which is intensified by people’s inability to see their own prejudices.Communication Model, Co-culture Interactions, and Biases in
Verbal CommunicationThe variety of racial and class distinctions between the characters creates an opportunity for many co-culture interactions and problems during communication. The movie features young and older adults, black, Hispanic, Latino, white, and Middle Eastern characters with low-, middle-, and high-income lifestyles. According to the communication model, the person sending the message encodes it, and the recipient of this message has to decode it to gain its meaning. Each step in this process is influenced by one’s relationship, culture, knowledge, attitude, communication skills, noise, and much more (Jandt 71). As a result, one message can be encoded and decoded in seemingly endless ways.A simple explanation of the problem can turn into an argument and a perception of a threat. In Crash , characters often start arguing due
to their inability to encode and decode messages. For example, Farhad is a Persian-American man with limited English skills. Due to his appearance and speech, most locals perceive him as an Arab foreigner, and they show hostility spurred by the recent September 11 attacks. He is similarly tense and aggressive towards anyone who doubts his American identity. However, his inability to speak English also leads him to misunderstand any negative news as a personal attack. When Daniel Ruiz, a locksmith, tries to explain to Farhad that the man needs to change the door rather than the lock to protect his shop, Farhad is confused, which leads to him suspecting Ruiz of being a scammer. In this case, the unsuccessful process of decoding a message leads to conflict.However, messages
can be specifically coded to show belonging to or distancing from a group. For instance, one can compare the speech of Anthony, Peter, and Cameron. These characters are black, but Anthony and Peter are low-income young men, and Cameron is a famous and rich television director. One can see that Anthony and Peter often use constructions and terms from African-American Vernacular English (AAVE), while Cameron does not use AAVE and uses mostly standard English grammar. Here, the correlation between class and culture is posed both as a stereotype imposed on characters and something they continue to uphold as a part of self-identification. When a white colleague of Cameron notes that one of the actors does not speak “black enough,” Cameron initially protests but then gives in as he
fears being fired ( Crash ). The internal conflict between enforcing a stereotype and losing his status is based on verbal communication. Similarly, Anthony and Peter may use AAVE unintentionally, but their speech reflects their identification with African-American culture supported by their view of intragroup and intergroup crime.Biases Shown in Nonverbal CommunicationApart from language barriers and intentional language use, the film also shows how aspects of nonverbal communication create barriers between people. The most notable examples in the movie come from interactions between characters of different races. In the beginning, as Anthony and Peter walk through a predominantly white neighborhood, they see a visibly affluent white couple, Jean and Rick Cabot. While Jean and Rick walk at a distance from one another, Jean moves close to Rick and
holds his hand when coming closer to the young black men. Anthony notes that this behavior is a clear sign of mistrust from the woman, and she feels threatened by their presence without them initiating any conflicts. According to the theory of proxemics, she both moves into the intimate space of her husband to feel protected and removes herself as far as possible from the area where the black men are situated (Jandt 252). It is a sign of fear that Jean later confirms through her dialogue. Here, the woman expresses her biases against African-American people without any words.Impression and ConclusionThe examples discussed above touch only on a small portion of all conflicts covered in Crash . In the movie, people of all races, genders, and economic classes
and financial patterns. Nevertheless, horizontal analysis is seen as inconsistent due to ever-changing accounting principles and factors. Financial statement analysis facilitates the financial plans and management of an organization by reviewing the cash flows, liability, business trends, and budget preparation. Different financial statement analysis methods are utilized in an attempt to obtain organizational data and information regarding the assets, liabilities, profits garnered, losses incurred, growth, and competition patterns.
The study of historical facts about the fall of empires and republics still attracts the interest of many researchers. This is due to the fact that the acquired knowledge can give valuable insight and help solve some problems in the modern world. Thus, this scientific paper aims at how a series of racing strong military men and inter-class conflict influenced the fall of the Roman Republic. I believe that both structural and individual problems contributed to its fall. This is because they are in a direct relationship with each other. An example may be the wrong decisions made by the ruler about economic policy, which will lead to a downturn in the economy and discontent among citizens. Thus, this can cause subsequent problems with an incorrect solution, of
which many problems can also accumulate. This is precisely what happened to the Roman Republic, where the causes and consequences of problems influenced the disappearance of the empire.It was one of the main reasons for the fall of the Roman Republic, which led to other events that were problems related to the economy. They followed after the end of multiple conquests and smoothly turned into political ones. As is already known, thanks to historical sources, the final point was the murder of Caesar. As a consequence of the multiple expansions of the lands of government, Roman citizens no longer had to pay taxes. However, this wealth led to open corruption in the elections, and senators bought at the expense of considerable contributions to the election campaign (Arena 1).
Thus, these actions led to the establishment of various laws that worked toward the affluent classes.The figures who promoted the struggle for the rights of people, which arose because of the hole between the classes, were the Gracchi. Both brothers pursued this idea and wanted to improve the lives of the lower classes of society. In addition, due to the problem of unequal distribution of land, the Gracchi sought to seize land from the rich population, that is, representatives of the senatorial class. With the help of this initiative, if such representatives of the lower classes, such as soldiers and peasants, were moved. Another initiative was to provide subsidized grain to the needy and pay for the clothing of poor soldiers.Another reason that contributed to the fall of
fall of the republic was the assassination of Caesar. During his activity, discontent grew strongly, and many feared that this negatively threatened the republic. It was also fueled by the fact that the concentration of absolute power in the hands of one person threatens democratic institutions. Because of this, the “Liberators” movement killed the dictator during the conspiracy. Thus, all these events gradually influenced the fall of the Roman Republic.
The article highlighted multiple reasons why women chose to be child-free. These include the desire to succeed from an academic and professional perspective, financial reasons, a lack of natural desires, and the understanding that a child would not enhance their life but rather make it more difficult (Sandler).There were a couple of things that I can’t entirely agree with. The choice of a woman to be in a serious relationship with a man with a 15-year-old daughter without taking even minimal parental responsibilities appears to be inconsiderate for the young girl both from the perspective of the childfree woman and the father who accepts such conditions. Moreover, the statement that women are not more pressured into having children due to the possibilities does not correlate with the previous
Although Lemuel Haynes and Mary Wollstonecraft discussed two distinct issues, slavery and female rights, the fundamental idea behind their works was that liberty and freedom should be equally distributed to all in a civilized society. Haynes Liberty Further Extended and Wollstonecraft’s A Vindication of the Rights of Woman were ahead of the time they were written. In fact, Haynes claims that freedom is a naturally given gift to all human beings, regardless of race (242). One of the renowned feminists of that time, Wollstonecraft, presented her ideas with a significant portion of anger, suggesting that women should be equally allowed to aspire to the same goals as men. Indeed, virtuous existence is impossible if all people do not have the same opportunities to pursue their objectives and share
their natural gifts. This rhetoric analysis argues that both authors created the framework for defining the good life by claiming that rights and liberties are inherent to all people and thus they should not be withdrawn from someone.Individuals may perceive the good life differently, but it is impossible if people cannot use their talent, skills, and knowledge to attain specific goals. Wollstonecraft stated that women could become better citizens if men “be content with rational fellowship instead of slavish obedience” since females would become more “observant daughters, affectionate sisters, faithful wives, reasonable mothers” (179). Moreover, what is good or bad for one person is equally dignified or evil to others (Haynes 246). Both authors agree that liberty is essential for all people, and this term can be defined
as having uniform opportunities, freedom of expression, and equality before the law (Wollstonecraft 230). If the law is threatened, people cannot attain a good life; thus, the more equality is present in society, the more virtuous it may become. However, from policymakers’ viewpoint, women were inferior creatures, allowing the government to create the environment that would enable men’s success (Wollstonecraft 30). In fact, Wollstonecraft’s sarcastic tone in her writing suggests that the regulations of that time were hypocritic because they allowed white males to dominate and discriminate against individuals based on their race and gender.It is probably impossible to achieve virtuous life in a country if some groups are devoid of their rights or unaware of their options. If only a portion of a group’s potential is involved
in decision-making, it cannot attain the highest potential. Therefore, Wollstonecraft promoted the idea that women should acquire physical and emotional strengths to become fully functioning members of society; in that case, virtuous life will become possible (31). Furthermore, the author seems appalled to elegance, delicacy, and gentleness, calling them the impediments to a good life (Wollstonecraft 31). Wollstonecraft is not sarcastic about these characteristics, but she appears to feel offended by the fact that strength is men’s privilege and a taboo for women. Still, her tone is satirical when she talks about the male population’s fear that if females are allowed to exercise and receive better education, they will become excessively masculine because it may not be attractive. The author also believes that being eloquent should no longer
be a priority in the world that strives to build a good life.Haynes did not use sarcasm or shaming language to claim that slavery is fundamentally wrong; instead, he chose to use the name of God to prove that liberty and freedom are divine gifts. Therefore, these inherent rights cannot be taken from us “without our consent” (Haynes 247). Since this natural law was violated through enslavement, society could not live a good life because some members were violently deprived of the opportunity to pursue their own ideas and develop their gifts. Indeed, the author claims that since people all belong to one species, the same rules should be applied to everyone without giving privileges to particular groups (Haynes 246). However, not only external factors can prevent one
A work of art’s subject and its content are different and yet closely connected concepts, as well as its essential components. According to Fichner-Rathus (2016), “the subject is the what of a work of art—people, places, things, themes, processes, events” (p. 4). This statement means that there are discernible visual elements that are accessible to nearly all human beings and can be perceived as something representing or resembling reality. In turn, “content refers to a work’s array of intangible aspects: the emotional, intellectual, psychological, symbolic elements” (Fichner-Rathus, 2016, p. 5). Hence, the content involves the particular thought behind the piece of art, which can be understood through the subject. Thus, the content differs from the subject in its abstract nature, referring to ideas rather than the material world.The
probably average consumers of the time 60s when the author worked on the sculpture. They are perhaps from the middle class and devote their free time to vacation trips in the decade when there is no economic crisis that would disturb them so that they are participating in the careless and meaningless process of spending their money. Hence, Hanson conveys the meaning of troubles and yet eager to new experience existence through the details, such as the clothes, the equipment of the couples, and the postures. Therefore, the subject of the sculpture, namely tourists, is complemented by the idea of ironizing about the lack of worries among ordinary people with economically stable status.
IntroductionMilk preservation is a key concern to large-scale dairy farmers across the globe. The product is required to remain fresh from the source to the consumer. This has led to the development of milk devices that aid farmers and dairy factories to process and preserve the product. Factors such as presence of pathogens in the milk products, lowers the duration the commodities take while still fresh and fit for consumption (Garcia et al., 2019). The condition for the equipment has to be maintained cleaned to ensure the products do not get spoiled or become unfit for human consumption. Furthermore, some of the equipment help milk processors to make various types of milk products like cheese, cream, butter, and so on. With the use of the devices in the
production, individuals have been able to lower the costs involved, like labor, and reduce the time consumption during packaging. The focus of his paper is to analyze milky devices and the current technological involvement.BackgroundDairy plants have evolved to use equipment that facilitates processes like milk manufacturing, pasteurizing, packaging, storing, and transportation. Initially, these activities were expensive, time-consuming when the level of technology was limited (Charlton & Kostandini, 2021). Currently, the advancement in engineering has made the processes convenient due introduction of various machines that perform the factions effectively. Most dairy farms have access to equipment like tanks for storing milk, cream churner milk containers, tubular heat exchangers, and evaporation systems that aid in the processes. The machines are useful in ensuring farmers do not incur unnecessary losses resulting
from poor preservation. They have improved dairy farming since the plants can manage to process the amount of milk produced.Technology for Dairy products back in the 1900sThere has been an improvement in dairy products over the past century. The milk processing industry has been growing gradually to provide dairy foods that meet the expectations of human diets with respect to nutrients, safety, and overall sustainability. Around 1917, the private dairy farmers presented milk products to their consumers in their locations (Rankin et al., 2017). During this time, farmers had started adopting pasteurization as the mechanism of preserving and controlling milk from contamination by some diseases.In the milk processing plant, the mechanization of cream separation, filling, washing bottles, and capping them set the root of modern industrialization in the
sector. Between the years 1907 and 1913, bottle machines were put into use as well as the fillers and cappers (Capstaff & Miller, 2018). To enhance the safety and increase sanitation of the milk products, there were some advancement made on the mechanical bottle washers. Most countries developed compulsory pasteurization processes due to diseases that were connected to unsafe milk consumption that caused deaths amongst adults and children.The process of milk pasteurization was officially in use but the methods, timing, and temperatures totally varied from farm to farm. There were no heat regulators during this period therefore the process took about 60 seconds at a temperature of about 72 degrees Celsius followed by immediate cooling. Similarly, proper timing was not manageable due to a lack of technology (Charlton
& Kostandini, 2021). It was termed flash pasteurization and it was not fully accepted due to its limitation. Another current technology involved in dairy industry is using the in-bottled method. In this process, the bottled milk was subjected to a high temperature of about 63 degrees Celsius for close to 30 minutes. It proved effective because it reduced the shortfalls of post-pasteurization.The advancement in technology prompted the improvement in dairy products as effective equipment was developed. Devices like a vat holder, heater, and cooler were used to improve the milk pasteurization process. Another milestone in the dairy plant was achieved in 1934 when a mechanical refrigerator was introduced to help in preserving the products. On the basis of sanitation, the use of stainless steel bulk ensured the commodities
were kept safe.Current TechnologyScientists and technologists have been working to improve the milk processing procedure and the content of the products. Over the last decade, a number of innovations and advancement in technology has been made to enhance productivity in the industry. Some of the current know-how used is aimed at lowering cost, increasing shelf life, and separating the component products of milk (Akbar et al., 2020). Some of the current technologies used in the milk processing plant are discussed below.Milk AnalyserFluid milk consists of various components like lactose, fat, protein, total solids, and other elements. The milk processing plants use the Mid-infrared examination method to determine the composition of the product (Akbar et al., 2020). Once the analysis has been done, the result is used to evaluate
the amount of money the dairy farmer will receive in relation to the available contents. Mid Infrared Spectroscopy also helps farmers to decide on what feeds to give their animals to influence the needed components. The technology is fast and facilitates efficiency in the testing of milk components.Automated Sprayer DryerDairy farmers are able to undertake the necessary quality tests using the automated sprayer dyer at once. During the analysis process, a sample of the milk products is taken and analyzed by infrared technology to determine the content of moisture in the milk powder, bulk, and temperature (Shinde et al., 2018). There is a specific inline powder developed for the automated sprayer dryer. The procedure is helpful since it allows the producers to set warning alarms in case of
product loss during the manufacturing process.Automated Clean-In-Place (CIP) SystemThis system allows the milk plants to clean the interior surfaces of the pipes, filters, vessels, associated fittings, and process equipment while they are intact. CIP uses sensors, controllers, valves that are well-programmed to enhance effectiveness. It makes the plant maintain the required level of hygiene for the proper preservation of the milk products (Ledo et al., 2020). Internal cleaning is essential as the materials get into contact with the milk.Direct Vat Set (DVS) CulturesCurrently, milk processing industries are using some species of microorganisms to facilitate the production of fermented products. DVS are significant since they have no side effects to the consumers and they also improve the immune system (Rankin et al., 2017). The main reason for applying the
DVS cultures in the milk processing steps is to increase the production at a relatively lower time. For instance, it takes about 10 hours to make a curd using a homemade approach whereas when the microorganisms are used, the production time is halved.High-Performance Liquid ChromatographyHigh-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) is a reliable, precise accurate process that helps in detecting the presence of melamine in pasteurized milk, ultra-heat temperatures, soft cheese, milk powder, and powdered infant formula (Ledo et al., 2020). Generally, melamine is an organic chemical compound that looks like a white crystal. HPLC enables farmers to easily locate the melamine hence reducing the time that would have been taken in the process.Fortification of MilkIn most cases, the component of milk does not contain all the required nutrients. To
ensure consumers obtain the necessary minerals, some vitamins that are not contained in the milk products are added (Ledo et al. 2020). Fortified milk is essential for human consumption because it has a good ratio of useful ailments. The process is essential in increasing the mineral and vitamin content suitable for human consumption.Ultra-High Temperature (UHT)UHT is used to aid in the process of the pasteurization of milk in the industry. It involves using commercially sterilized equipment to heat milk then fill them under an aseptic state into packages that are hermetically sealed (Warncke & Kulozik, 2020). During this process, milk is heated for about two seconds at a temperature of 138 degrees Celsius then cooled down quickly. UHT is capable of eliminating bacteria present in the product, therefore,
increasing the shelf life of milk. After UHT, the commodity can take a long like six months without refrigeration.High-Temperature Short Time (HTST)The dairy plant uses hot water and metal plates to attain the required temperature suitable for pasteurization. HTST technique also allows dairy farmers to heat under a temperature of about 71 degrees Celsius within a time frame of 15 seconds (Garcia et al., 2019). It is then cooled off before packaging to enhance the shelf life. It also enables the dairy farmers to eliminate the threat of bacteria present in milk products.Dairy Product Composition and Attribute TestingCurrently, near-infrared and inline mid-infrared technology is being used in the firms to enable the manufacturers to establish and analyze the composition of the products. The system makes it easier to
test the components of the liquid milk (Akbar et al., 2020). The factories usually produce a large quantity of milk therefore the advancement makes it easier to examine the milk for cheese making and other products.Types of Equipment for Dairy and MilkDairy PasteurizersThis equipment is used to heat the dairy products to a considerable temperature that is suitable for killing the pathogens that might be present in the milk. They are used to enhance and increase the safety of milk for human consumption.Dairy Milk TanksIn the dairy plant, there are tanks used for storing milk, cooling, and for fermentation. There are isolated tanks, one-lay, two-lay, and process tanks that are used in the processing process.HomogenizerThis machine helps in making the milk products have a uniform consistency to minimize
separation. It also helps in reducing large fat globules into tiny ones (Warncke & Kulozik, 2020). The equipment facilitates the conversion of two insoluble liquids to form an emulsion. It enhances flexibility and quality performance in the industry during the processing. Furthermore, it reduces the intensity of work done in processing milk.Dairy SeparatorThis equipment is used by dairy farmers or milk processing plants to separate skimmed milk and cream. They increase the effectiveness in the processing of milk and enables farmers to reduce cost. Dairy separators are easy to use therefore very efficient for most milk plants. The machine makes it easier for the dairy farmers to lower labor and have different composition of the milk products.Manufacturing of Milk (How it is Manufactured, Pasteurized)The process of manufacturing milk
involves a series of steps. It starts with milking cows by attaching vacuum cups to their teats. After that, the liquid milk is taken to refrigerated vats for storage under a temperature condition of about 5 Degrees Celsius. Milk is then transported to factory tankers where different procedures take place, such as pasteurization where milk is put at an extreme temperature of 72 Degrees Celsius for about 15 seconds to destroying harmful pathogens. The process allows the products to have an extended shelf life. The next step is homogenization, this method subject milk to high pressure that helps to disperse fat globules (Soundous et al., 2019). It enables manufacturers to stop the cream from rising to the top and separating to ensure a consistent taste and texture of
the product.The milk is then taken to centrifugal separation to enable the removal of the available cream to facilitate the making of low-fat or skim milk. The other procedure is ultrafiltration which involves passing milk across a given membrane at a considerable pressure to aid in holding back the fat globules and other proteins present in the milk content (Mikhaylin et al., 2018). During this process, lactose and water pass through the membrane leaving behind the large particles including calcium complexes.The next process involves reverse osmosis which is more like ultrafiltration only that the membrane permits water to pass across leaving lactose. Then there is ultra-osmosis that entails both reverse osmosis and ultrafiltration (Mikhaylin et al., 2018). This procedure allows salt and water to go through holding back
solid milk. Another procedure is spray drying which helps to eliminate water from milk to produce powdered milk products. The process does not interfere with the nutrition content of the milk. The last step is permeating, which enables the manufacturers to produce milk having consistent properties.Future ResearchBased on the predicted demand for milk products in the future, agriculturalists should further the research on how to increase the amount of milk each cow can produce. The finding should focus on ways of raising the limit without having a devastating effect on the life of an animal (Capstaff & Miller, 2018). If such improvement can be achieved, sustainability shall also go up since it will not be necessary for the farmer to keep a large number of dairy animals.The world
population is projected to increase; therefore, the need to produce more milk products will increase as well. Researchers and agriculturalists should do some studies on how the different combinations of feeds would improve the quality of milk products to minimize industrial processes that complicate the process (Capstaff & Miller, 2018). With the expected pressure in consumption, they should search for ways of modernization to reduce the labor cost associated.Furthermore, with the intense need for organic food products in market, research should be done on the milk industry to find possible ways by which organic milk products suitable for human consumption can be produced. Similarly, the shelf life of the commodities should be enhanced to ensure they can stay for more than a year without spoilage (Charlton & Kostandini,
Since the Greeks were more inclined to adopt everything new, it is not surprising that many of the first Christian congregations were formed on their lands. Christian communities grew and flourished in cities such as Patras, Corinth, Thessaloniki, Philippi, and Athens. The tradition of Christian naming led to a decline of ‘tria nomina’ first in these parts and then across the whole empire (Kantola & Nuorluoto, 2022). Initially, ‘tria nomina’ consisted of praenomen, nomen, and cognomen (Figure 1). However, later Roman names were shortened and used alongside Greek names.For a number of reasons, the Roman naming system collapsed some time after the collapse of imperial power in the West. The praenomen had already become insufficient in written sources in the fourth century, and by the fifth century, it
The relationship of Nora and Torvald develops significantly throughout the play and eventually shows a completely different side of each of these characters. At the beginning, they seem to be a perfect couple, both content with their roles in the family. However, as the play develops, they are revealing their unhealthy relationship and dissatisfaction. Torvald treats his wife like a child incapable of making her own decisions. He cares mostly about his money and reputation, and through his pressure and arrogance, he makes Nora believe that her life has to only be devoted to her husband and children. Nora sees her purpose in the same way: all she does is try to make her husband happy. Nora and Torvald’s relationship shows that women’s role as an individual was
to Nora and Torvald, Kristine was the one who cared about money more and eventually left Krogstad, even though she actually loved him. This caused Krogstad to become a bitter, devastated, and unhappy man, which shows that he truly loved her as well. What saves him in the end is Kristine, who offers a second chance for them to be together. It appears that his motivation is not gaining money or respect form society; instead, all he needed was love, understanding, and honesty. The fundamental difference between these two couples is that Kristine and Krogstad love each other, which makes it possible for them to talk and solve their problems to reunite after many years of separation.
In the XVI-XVII centuries, when the High Renaissance and Baroque were prospering in Europe, religion undeniably influenced the development of art. The religious upheavals greatly expanded the sphere, bringing many icons, altars, stained glass windows, and other art objects displaying religious motifs. In this paper, using the example of several specific pieces, it is discussed how religion was one of the key stimuli for the development of painting and was invested in the subtexts of many works.Michelangelo’s Sistine Chapel Ceiling depicting stories from the book of Genesis is considered one of the greatest examples of Renaissance painting. It is divided into 33 sections, each of which is painted with different scenes. The plot of the book of Genesis is depicted in nine central fragments, while other spaces are
occupied by the Old Testament scenes and depiction of the ancestors of Christ. Michelangelo originally conceived bright colors, but the shades faded and became darker after the restoration. The figures’ skin tones are pale peach, and the clothes are painted in pale pastel tones, which leaves a feeling of calm and grandeur. The ceiling of the Sistine This work primarily reflects Michelangelo as a deeply religious and devout man. The complex and unusual iconography is considered a Neoplatonic interpretation of the Bible, representing the main stages of the spiritual development of humanity and the dramatic relationship between man and God (Gilbert, 2022). To fill an almost unimportant ceiling space with such a painting demonstrated a deep respect for the religious motives of that time.Isenheim Altarpiece by Grünewald was
crucifixion is gloomy, though deathly pale, the other panels are marked by Grunewald’s vibrant Renaissance color palette, as well as his unique images of the devil. The altarpiece challenges its viewer through its depression of the reality of suffering and makes them question how “good” can come out of it (Aramini, 2018). The religious subtext, focusing on the suffering and pain of Christ’s crucifixion, has a huge psychological impact on the viewer.
Religion is a fundamental part of most world societies and cultures. There are numerous varieties of religions worldwide with a wide range of differences than similarities. This factor makes it challenging to have an all-encompassing definition of religion that works for all people. The most common traits among the religions include the focus on supernatural or sacred power, ritual acts, and moral codes. Some regions are easily recognized globally, while others are confined to a particular region or country. For instance, Shinto is a Japanese religion widely practiced by that country’s nationals. Although Shinto is a Japanese religion, its myth of origin that supports the divinity of the country’s islands and rulers to ancestral lineage with gods can have a similarity to other religions such as Jewish and
Christianity. DivinityThe Shinto Divinity Myth about Japanese Islands and Japanese EmperorsAs noted in the introduction, most Japanese communities subscribe to Shinto, an indigenous religion that defines the country’s culture and national identity. According to Mizumura, more than fifty percent of Japanese adhere to Shinto. Shinto myth supports the notion that the Japanese islands are divine by indicating that they were created by gods, Izanami and Izanagi. The two gods used a spear encrusted with jewels to stir the ocean, where crystalized salt on the tip fell after withdrawing it, forming the islands. The gods settled on Onogoro-Shima, the first island they created, and the female deity, Izanami, wedded Izanagi. Later, the divine couple created other islands that comprise Japan, the world, and other gods.Shinto myth also holds that
the Japanese emperors are direct descendants of Amaterasu. According to Mizumura, Amaterasu Omikami, the sun goddess, was of the gods created by Izanami and wedded Iznagi, from whom the Shinto religion believes that the imperial family descended. Therefore, the Japanese people considered their emperors to have qualities of Kami, making them superior. The people obeyed the emperors and divine rulers and worshipped them. The emperors executed religious and political roles in society, such as performing rituals and protecting the country. Shinto’s divinity notion about their land and rulers is relatable to other religions.The Jewish Story about “The Holy Land” and Shinto’s Divine LandThe Jewish story about God creating and giving “The Holy Land” has significant similarities with the Shinto myth concerning Japanese islands. The Jewish believe that their
land is divine, created by God’s supreme supernatural being, and given to their forefathers and descendants. The story began when God asked Abraham, from whom the Jewish descended, to leave his native land for another that He (God) would show him (The Jewish virtual library). God gave Abraham a divine promise that He would bless the latter and make his name promise. God made a covenant with Abraham, saying He gave his descendants the land (The Jewish virtual library). Canaan, or Israel as known today, is the “Holy Land” endowed to the Jewish community. God fulfilled his promise when He used Moses to take the descendants of Abraham from Egypt to the promised. The Jewish right to the land of Canaan shows that God had already planned that
the place would be an everlasting possession for the Jews.Similarly, Shintonians believe that the Japanese islands were created and given to the Japanese community to inherit. Although the Jewish “Holy Land” was created by one Supreme God and the divine Japanese islands by more than one God, the creators were both supernatural beings with the powers to control humans and nature. Like Jewish who believe that God’s power and favor have always been upon their land and consider Israel a center for adoring their Creator, Shinto has numerous shrines in Japan for worshipping their gods.The Notion of America as God’s Country and Shinto MessageAlthough several countries worldwide have ever identified themselves as a nation of God, they cannot contest the title “God’s own country” with America. The factors
that make most Americans consider their nation as God’s country range from a religious perspective to the prosperity and freedom associated with it. According to Perry et al., American civil religion and Christian nationalism are religious factors that make citizens consider their nation as a country of God (131). The American civil religion considers Americans as united under an ambiguous Creator’s (Judeo-Christian) covenant (131). The citizens are obliged to the Creator because He maintains an equitable and just society. Conversely, Christian nationalism aligns the country’s national identity with an evangelical Christian God. America is among the most economically developed country and one of the world’s superpowers. Living in the country is associated with prosperity and freedom, which are God’s providence.This notion of America as God’s country is similar
to the Shinto myth that Japanese islands were created and belonged to gods. Both perspectives associate particular countries with religions, Christianity for America and Shinto for Japan. Americans, most of whom are Christians, believe that God is responsible for the country. Equally, Shintonians believe that the gods who created the islands are responsible for their land’s high production.The Egyptian Concept of the Pharaoh as God and the Shinto Belief about the Japanese EmperorShinto belief about the Japanese emperor is similar to the ancient Egyptians’ concept of the pharaoh as a god. Notably, pharaohs were the prehistoric Egyptian rulers who played political and religious roles in society. The Egyptians considered their rulers divine, who linked the people and gods (National Society). The pharaohs maintained religious harmony among the residents
of the region. Additionally, they participated in different important ceremonies and were head of state, made laws, and oversaw all operations in the land of Egypt. Likewise, Shinto believes that Japanese emperors are divine and worshiped because they are descendants of gods who created Japanese islands. Like the pharaohs, Japanese emperors are also considered important religious leaders by Shintonians.The European Notion of the King’s Divine Right and Shinto Belief about the Japanese EmperorKings were an important symbol in most communities across the world. However, some parts, such as the European region, believed that their kings had divine rights from God. According to Wills, the kings derived their authority from God, and no earthly power could hold them accountable for their actions. The medieval notion that God grants power
to leaders formed the foundation of the divine rights perception. The first proponent of the divine right of kings in the European region was King James I of England (Wills). Theorists of that notion asserted that authority is sacred and derived from God, even though the king is a person. This belief is not different from Shinto’s, who consider Japanese emperors to have extraordinary power and authority derived from gods. Shinto holds that emperors are descendants of the goddess Amaterasu. Therefore, no human should question their actions because divine powers guide them.Christian Notion about Jesus and Shinto Belief about Japanese EmperorsThe Christian belief about Jesus also shares some similarities with the Shinto notion about Japanese emperors. The Christians stoutly acknowledge that Jesus was the son of God, who
In many countries, religion is still a very sensitive topic that might lead to severe violations of human rights and dignity. North Korea is particularly notorious for its oppressive political regime where people have virtually no civil rights and freedom to express their faith. According to the laws, North Korea does not prohibit any religions; however, in reality, most beliefs are being actively persecuted (Burkle, 2020).Linda Burkle (2020) explains that Christians are some of the most oppressed groups in North Korea. As a result, Open Doors 2020 World Watch List declared North Korea as the worst country to live in for Christian people (Burkle, 2020). Christians are being transferred to labor camps and prisons, while approximately 200,000 Christians have also gone missing for “unknown reasons’ ‘ (Burkle, 2020).
a diplomatic solution and do not interfere with religions within the country. Concerning reasoning, North Korea prosecutes Christians due to the government’s belief that religious people undermine national values and integrity. North Korea emerged after World War II and gradually increased the severity of political control. As a result, for more than 70 years, the North Korean government has been actively prosecuting religious groups and, specifically, Christians to mitigate the spread of freedom. It is an unjust policy, but, unfortunately, other nations cannot do much to help oppressed religious people in North Korea.
this guard, a man who is a potential malefactor is capable of anything.Although, God’s tribunal is not the only tribunal before which a person can hold accountable. Hence, if God did not exist, people would still be restrained by other factors, but in combination, heavenly and earthly potential punishments act as restraining forces against omnipotent conduct. It is essential to mention Polytheism and the Christian religion, where the concepts of good and evil are different. For example, magic is forbidden by the Lord, but permitted in pagan rituals (Krause & Ironson, 2019). At the same time, Christianity creates the single fair rules for everyone, but Polytheism is the privilege of certain individuals and donned by the forces of the gods, which is not equitable.
SummaryThe media quickly turns into real power in the political, social, and spiritual spheres. Possessing specific opportunities for authority, the media influence public opinion and personal worldview, and, due to their universality and inclusiveness, they can shape the appearance of each new generation. The expansion of influence and the growth of media opportunities exacerbate the already complicated process of forming views on racial appearance, already complicated by the crisis state of modern society.The Influence of Mass InformationMass information has a broad audience, is dispersed in time and space, and is distributed using technical means. It reflects social processes and has its own goal, which is to manage society or its subsystems through the management of people. Due to their universality and inclusiveness, mass communications can shape the attitudes
Social Inequality in the Gilded Age and Progressive EraThe Gilded Age was one of the United States’ most prosperous eras. Between 1870 and the early 20 th century, the country amassed wealth at a meteoric rate. The nation seemed headed in a path of economic stability, with everyone welcome to tag along, but this was a fallacy. The Gilded Age was glorious on the surface but full of rot underneath. It bled into the Progressive Era that aimed to correct the wrongs of the Gilded Age with arguably considerable success. It was a period of heightened social activism. In this paper, I look at the social injustices suffered by minority communities in these eras, how they sought to solve them, and the coverage of these critical periods of
American history in the textbooks.Social Inequalities Experienced by Minority GroupsOne of the hallmarks of the Gilded Age was widespread inequality. This form of injustice broadly took two forms; social and economic (Cashman, 293). With the rise of corporations that offered jobs for everyone willing to work, streaming millions of immigrants from Europe and the Far East was a welcome sight; or so it was supposed to be. It led to the advent of the deplorable state of workers in the republic. The number of workers was more than the jobs, and mass unemployment followed. The majority of the migrant population was unskilled, and the lack of factory jobs meant no income.Getting a job was not glorious, maybe just the lesser evil at best. Workers in these companies run
by overly shrewd businessmen who held productivity above all else were paid meager wages for their troubles. They had to endure dangerous working conditions without compensation for injuries incurred while on the job. This, coupled with the high rent charged by landlords, made the cost of living for the immigrants fresh off the boat. So high was this cost that most immigrants were forced to live in crowded and sanitary and crime-riddled tenement yards, all in pursuit of the American Dream.Most of the social injustice during the Gilded Age was propagated by trusts and companies running monopolies and the ‘robber barons’ who wanted to effect full-scale capitalism. Andrew Carnegie, Cornelius Vanderbilt, and JPMorgan are among them. To say that wealth distribution in the US was uneven will be
a significant understatement. Four thousand families, which formed 1% of the population, controlled as much wealth as 11.6 million. The financial moguls that made their fortunes in various sectors of the economy insisted on production at whatever cost, a cost borne mainly by the working man. The stories, such as one of Carnegie releasing a small army on his workers, are quite scary.Efforts to Address the InequalitiesWith the Progressive Era came reforms; people were teaming up to end the social injustice they had been under for so long. The populist movement of Agrarian reforms, the antitrust movements, and the progressive movement of urban social reformers came up. It became evident that the only way to be hard was not by individual action but by a coalesced effort to
seek rights and fair treatment (Cole, 297). Many policies to curtail inequality were formed and voiced. The guideline’s problem was that no infrastructure or groundwork was laid to make them politically feasible and practical.Loewen’s Assessment of the Coverage of these Inequalities in TextbooksLoewen is quite critical of how textbooks today and in the past have presented the issue of class. It is evident in Lies my Teacher Told Me . He says there is a general absence of class analysis in American History textbooks. It is almost impossible not to present class bias negatively; to avoid this and the controversy that would follow, textbooks give blandly positive accounts of history, sometimes not as it happened. This is a conscious effort to propagate the notion of the American dream.Immigration
which has been a crucial part of the nation’s journey since independence from Great Britain is given an unfair and shallow chunk of the history textbooks. They handle the topic in numbers, expressing statistics and non-descriptive information on the immigrants. Their issues in their voyages to America and their new life on the continent take a back seat. The only immigrants whose lives we get to know about are those that rose to fame by some act. The same is true for African Americans and does nothing but further cement the rags-to-riches narrative, which, while motivating, finds itself blaming the poor man for his poverty.Loewen also implies that class bias in textbooks has been used as a tool to keep the rich getting their pockets deeper as they
class bias in textbooks. Until recently, authors were labeled as Marxists for featuring class issues in their books. With today’s society looking ever so close to being a second gilded age, textbooks should be at the front of ensuring that social inequality does not recur.Progressive-era policies contributed to the deterioration of blacks, migrants, and workers. Instead of reducing monopoly and inequality, the state created a super monopoly and elevated the struggle for privilege and rent-seeking as a principle. Not everything is described truthfully in textbooks about how life was organized at that time. Therefore, to avoid repeating the mistakes of the past, modern textbooks must contain accurate information to avoid the mistakes of the past.
Epigenetics refers to the study of how one’s own behavior and environment can affect the way in which the genes work. Unlike changes that occur directly in the genes, epigenetic changes can be reversed and do not affect the DNA sequence; however, they can change the way in which the body reads the DNA sequence. For example, when one encounters two identical twins, their appearance shows some differences, even though they start out looking the same. As the two twins age, the impact of environmental and behavioral factors becomes more prominent, contributing to the changes and differences between the two twins. Therefore, epigenetics could be used as a critical framework for understanding one’s propensity to develop a particular health condition.When it comes to the considerations of epigenetics in
terms of a disease for which an individual is at high risk, it is necessary to consider family history as well as environmental factors that add to the development of the adverse health condition. Considering all factors, the most highly likely disease to develop in the future is type 2 diabetes. Type 2 diabetes refers to an impairment in the way in which the body regulates and uses sugar as fuel (Rosen et al., 2018). It is a chronic condition that can be managed with medication and lifestyle changes but cannot be cured completely with no traces of the condition left behind. This conclusion was made based on several factors concerning family history and environmental and behavioral factors.Specifically, both the parent and the sibling had type 2 diabetes,
diagnosed as adults. In adulthood, type 2 diabetes is likely to develop as a result of behavioral and environmental factors, such as increased blood pressure, elevated levels of fat in the blood, a sedentary lifestyle, high alcohol intake, obesity and overweight, and others (Rosen et al., 2018). Therefore, since there are direct DNA connections between a parent and a sibling, both of whom developed diabetes as adults, it is essential to consider such information as highly relevant. Other potential diseases included breast cancer, glaucoma, and thyroid disorder, which were identified in other relatives, for which the risk factors are lower.Epigenetics suggests that even in the case of genetic risk factors, there is a possibility to either increase or reduce the chances of developing a disease with the help
of environmental and behavioral improvements. Besides, researchers have been focusing on a new research agenda, emphasizing the interactions between health and environmental and social factors. Therefore, social determinants of health represent a considerable part of epigenetics as it seeks to explain any non-medical factors that directly influence health, such as values, attitudes, knowledge, and behaviors (Notterman & Mitchell, 2016). Besides, across an individual’s lifespan, health can be significantly affected by social disadvantages.The study of epigenetics has considered the control of both disease and homeostasis. Considering that the risk of diabetes and its complications is associated with environmental and inherited factors, it is not surprising that research in this area is extensive (Rosen et al., 2018). In addition, Rosen et al. (2018) stated that there are several areas of
epigenetic regulation, such as direct methylation of adenine or cytosine residues, covalent modifications to histone proteins, higher-order chromatin structure, and non-coding RNA. These areas have been implicated in cellular processes that are relevant to diabetes, with a long history of links between diabetes and epigenetics, as well as other metabolism-related challenges that include obesity, overweight, and other metabolic disorders.It is notable that the risk of diabetes development in an individual has been linked to increased rates of micro- and macrovascular complications. Clinical trials conducted among people with diabetes have underlined the positive effects of intensive glycemic control to avoid the occurrence of complications and their progression. Specifically, the rate of complications associated with diabetes can be influenced by glucose levels that were experienced years earlier, which is referred
to as metabolic memory (Rosen et al., 2018). Energetic changes can offer a biological explanation for the long-standing impact of metabolic changes, as metabolite levels can impact the epigenome while such changes are preserved during the division of cells.Importantly, studies focusing on cells and tissues from patients diagnosed with diabetes have illustrated striking differences in epigenetic marks at core genes linked to complications, including fibrotic and inflammatory genes. For example, the authors refer to the article by Beckerman, Ko, and Susztak (2014), who used kidney tissues from patients diagnosed with diabetes and chronic kidney disease to illustrate epigenetic changes in renal disease-related genes. In addition, epigenetic mechanisms have been shown to influence cellular models of metabolic memory.Therefore, the epigenetics article showed that diabetes and complications associated with it
could have a combined effect on the variations in DNA sequence, with environmental effects influencing shifts in the cellular phenotype. Because epigenetics as a field develops rapidly, there is a possibility to facilitate the work on the exploration of the cell-type-focused epigenome atlas. Such maps can be used for interpreting genetic variations and highlighting the ways in which such variations lead to disease development. Moreover, epigenome maps that include considerations of genomic and genetic data can enhance the understanding of mechanisms in which environmental changes contribute to the development of diabetes.After completing the Living to 100 Questionnaire, it was found that the life expectancy was 83, which is quite a good score. However, it is necessary to consider the impact of epigenetics as an indicator that environmental factors
A credit score is a number between 300 and 850 that reflects a consumer’s creditworthiness. Lenders use credit scores to assess the likelihood that a person will repay a loan on time. A credit score is an indicator that helps one understand how safe it is to trust an organization with one’s money. Banks, insurance companies, non-state pension funds, and other financial institutions that work with private clients usually have such ratings. A credit score can significantly impact financial performance as it plays a vital role in a lender’s decision to offer a loan to a client. People with a credit score below 640 are generally considered to be subprime borrowers and have poor chances of getting a loan, while those above 800 are considered excellent.The rating takes
into account not only the current financial position of the subject, the amount of capital, the volume of debts, and the entire previous financial history. A high credit rating means that it is practically safe to trust the subject with money because they have always paid their bills before, and now their position is relatively stable. At the same time, a low rating means a substantial risk because the entity’s business is not going very well, and it is highly likely that it may go bankrupt.There are three major credit reporting agencies in the United States, namely Experian, Equifax, and Transunion, that report, update, and store consumer credit histories. While there may be differences in the information collected by the three credit bureaus, five main factors are considered
when calculating a credit score. The first of these is the payment history, which makes up 35% of the credit score and shows whether a person pays his obligations on time. The total amount owed is 30% and considers the percentage of credit available to the person currently being used, which is known as credit drawdown. The length of the credit history is 15%, while longer credit histories are considered less risky since there is more data to determine the payment history. In addition, types and the very fact of a new loan are also important because this allows one to analyze the client’s credit history more clearly.In the case of working with clients, knowing their credit rating can ensure reliable and high-quality interaction between the enterprise and
the event of financial interactions between him and the business. Thus, the development and functioning of the company are qualitatively improved by analyzing the clientele and their credit rating. Reliable and secure interaction is provided, as well as certain guarantees of mutually beneficial cooperation and transactions backed by the client’s or trading partner’s creditworthiness.Based on the preceding, one can confidently state that knowing how a credit score functions and interacts with customers is essential. This allows one to conduct their own financial life effectively and effectively and safely interact with the clientele, analyzing their creditworthiness and financial capabilities. Thus, the presented information has value for anyone who plans to use the credit option in their business or other ventures.
Yoga is a concept that signifies a set of spiritual, mental, and physical practices aimed at managing the cognitive and physiological functions of the body. Practicing this sport allows one to broaden the horizons, change the habitual way of life, and eliminate harmful patterns that negate the efforts. That is why yoga is considered the most effective practice of self-development that has unique benefits for health, both physical and psychological.There are numerous varieties of modern yoga; despite the dissimilarities, they are grounded on shared parts: body postures, breathing exercises, and spiritual contemplation. The combination of exercises that train the body and soul has unique health benefits. It strengthens muscles, increases flexibility, and enhances mental soundness. Moreover, yoga classes have enormous therapeutic potential and preventive effects. Studies involving patients
Out of the various forms of resistance used by slaves, the one which exacted the best revenge is armed and organized rebellion. The main reason is the fact that despite their failures in colonial America, the Haitian Revolution was a signal about slavery always being challenged. One of the most common forms of resistance was sabotage of production by breaking tools, feigning illnesses, and slowing the work process. However, these were mostly ineffective measures because they led to negotiations where masters benefited the highest. In addition to sabotage, theft was also a form of resistance, where slaves stole certain goods for their own personal use. It was done mainly due to poor living conditions, such as nutrition, among slaves, which is why food was the main target of
punishments. Escaping was a risky endeavor with rather low chances of success with no widespread impact. In addition, it was mostly men who had acceptable chances of successful flight. Therefore, the most effective form of resistance with the best revenge was armed rebellion, such as the Haitian Revolution. Although it was the only successful rebellion among many suppressed ones, the victory was not the main point. The key message was the fact that slavery will never be tolerated and it always is challenged by slaves, and the Haitian Revolution’s success was a reminder to masters that they will not be able to own slaves forever.
The correlation of the fate of the hero with the development of society, which is the main distinguishing feature of the genre of tragedy, can take on a variety of artistic forms. It can be folk-historical tragedy, bringing to the stage the broad masses of people set in motion by social cataclysms. At the same time, it is a tragedy, in which the plot is based on a conflict that captures a relatively small number of characters (Boorman, 2021). Even with the most cursory acquaintance with most of the mature Shakespearean tragedies, it is easy to see the center of the playwright’s attention. These are the relationship between the fate of the characters and the course of the development of society. Shakespeare’s great tragedies most often develop the
theme of the death of the best people and their internal discord. Such is the tragedy of Othello , where the author describes the internal struggle of people whose honor has been tarnished.In Shakespeare’s play Othello , the main characters kill their wives to protect and restore their honor. During the play, women must obey their husbands to show real honor. Iago and Othello reflect this attitude towards their wives: they give them a reason to feel faithful by killing their women. Iago kills Emilia because she dishonors him by revealing his manipulation of Othello and Cassio. Othello strangles Desdemona because of the false infidelity that his assistant Iago imposed on him. As can be understood from the play, both characters have their idea of what honor is
and how it is manifested. Nevertheless, both Othello and Iago kill close women to protect themselves, their honor.The only deliverance for Othello from this doubt that relentlessly settled in his house and his soul is the solution to which he comes ‒ the murder of Desdemona. However, having accomplished it, Othello learns that Desdemona is innocent, that both are victims of that monstrous intrigue that Iago wove so skillfully. Othello calls himself an honest killer:“Why, anything:An honorable murderer, if you will;For naught, I did in hate, but all in honour.” (Shakespeare, 1975, 5.2.345)These words are the key to the murder he committed: a man for whom honor is above all, he could not exist next to vice and could not allow dishonesty to go unpunished. Realizing the horror
of what he had done, he kills himself – cuts his throat with a dagger.Faith in man is broken – this becomes the cause of Othello’s despair and, at the same time, the source of his loneliness. Because of this, a person decides that his whole past life and the attitude of those close to him were an illusion. It seems to Othello that nothing is lasting, honest, moral in the world; everything in a person is unsteady, chaotic, impermanent. Having understood the laws of this world, Othello fights it in every possible way in the name of the humanistic ideal of a beautiful, real, honest person. In the play, the hero goes to extreme measures to kill his wife, who, in his opinion, dishonored him. It becomes
in the struggle for honor, no matter how important it may seem.The advantage of Shakespeare’s tragic soil is that he is still able to show how this or that passion grows out of the fullness of a naive human consciousness under certain conditions. At the same time, it is a normal human passion unlike the writers of a more mature bourgeois society (Carr, 2020). Therefore, the Renaissance image of Othello speaks much more directly to the feeling of every person – both to the jealous and one who has never known jealousy. The potential energy of normal, natural human nature in Othello becomes the energy of affect.
Retailers, Wholesalers and Manufacturers are three stakeholder groups that can greatly contribute to financial success or failure of a business. All three of them are involved in the supply chains of most middle and large-scale product-oriented businesses. The three groups have certain aspects in common but are drastically different in how they engage with a firm’s products and its customers. The differences apply to the amounts of goods a group is dealing with as part of its function, as well as its direct role in the chain.Retailers earn money by acquiring things in bulk at a discount from wholesalers and reselling them for a profit. They seek to shift such things across as quickly as possible in order to reduce inventory holding expenses. They, however, then resell the
may be left with large quantities of goods that occupy their storage space and are not delivering profit.Finally, manufacturers are engaged directly in the production of goods that are later sold to wholesalers or customers directly, depending on the industry. Although manufacturers are, just as the other two groups, in need of accounting for the costs of taxation, salaries and other business expenses, their risk is arguably the lowest of the three (Bowersox, 2019). Since the manufacturers control the quantity produced, they might adjust it depending on the current demand, thus reducing waste to a minimum.
In 2020, FASB issued Accounting Standards Update (ASU) 2020-05, which deferred the effective dates of Topic 606 and Topic 842 by one year. This update gave private companies a much-needed relief, which was overwhelmed by numerous challenges associated with fighting off the consequences of the COVID-19 pandemic. Even though many companies had adopted the new revenue recognition policy, both preparers and auditors experienced significant difficulties applying the new accounting standards in practice. The central problem was that the new standard, unlike GAAP, does not provide sufficient detail on the implementation rules. Instead, it gives a theoretical basis similar to all industries, which leaves the details open for interpretation.There are several issues associated with revenue recognition that private companies face in all industries. First, Topic 606 requires revenues to
In her seminal work A Vindication of the Rights of Women, Mary Wollstonecraft argues that education is a necessary condition for developing virtue or ethical, right, and more ways of thinking and behavior. Wollstonecraft writes that learning and exercising one’s own reason are the only paths to developing virtue and women (Wollstonecraft 21). However, unlike men, women of the author’s time were limited in their access to education and had few opportunities to broaden their horizons. In this belief, Wollstonecraft echoed Plato and his Allegory of the Cave . In this work, the Greek philosopher argues that one’s perceptions may differ from reality, and people who are not allowed to receive knowledge will never know the real world (Plato). Thus, Wollstonecraft believes that women, equally to men, should
that men and women are equal human beings and, therefore, should be offered the same rights and opportunities in life. The feminist writer argues that, although men and women are different in their nature, “their virtues should differ in respect to their nature” (Wollstonecraft 27). In saying this, Wollstonecraft holds men and women to the same moral standards and criticizes those who contend that a woman’s role in society should be reduced to ornamental function and childbearing. It can be argued that Wollstonecraft inspired the feminist movement, specifically, individualist feminist tradition, that emphasizes personal autonomy and individualism. In particular, her unwavering support of women’s right to education inspired many women to pursue learning, improve their knowledge of the world, and become more virtuous.
One should note that Chapter 9 explains some concepts and ideas about the future and progress of society and the state as a whole. Garth Morgan Massey in his book claim, that most modern people are confident in their abilities to control situations and change events and phenomena for the better (p.321). However, only the power of reason harnessed to the inquiry can change persons’ “disadvantage” in the best light (p. 321). Thus, the writer calls this aspect a kind of progress and lists several essential concepts regarding this phenomenon.First of all, he states that different people, groups, and societies may have other thoughts, ideas, and beliefs about progress. Some see such improvements in more global events, and some do not expect drastic changes at all but want
to live “well.” Further, as evidence to these words, Massey attaches the thoughts and ideas of some famous personalities. Hence, according to David Harvey, people strive to accumulate and increase material goods and abundance to improve life (p.321-322). Supporters of postmodernism reflect on these issues and assure that the contemporary world is the self-referential world, and modern times is a “tangle of myths.” Especially in the age of consumerism, people tend to accumulate in a flow of multiple events, but they are not as happy as they would like.Lester B. Brown claims that a modern world is a mess; previous experience dictates further human actions, such as future changes in climate, population, amount of water, product prices, and states (p. 322-323). Additionally, technologies “absorb” a person’s soul, depriving
it of authentic, natural human qualities. Tim Jackson believes that one can achieve benefits without economic and financial growth because many other elements are necessary for humankind (p. 323). Moreover, some famous writers see dystopia only at the point of returning to the remnants and legacy of the past and in unity with nature (p. 323).Secondly, the author expresses the following concepts regarding the future of humanity. By their character and essence, people strive to learn as much as possible about themselves and others, about the environment and the future (p. 324). As a rule, the probability of assessing the future is high if we evaluate the actual, objective factors and prerequisites. For example, George Orwell could “look into” the world of the future in the book “1984”
or Herman Kahn in the book “The Year 2000” (p. 325). They were right because they predicted the moments such as high technology, control, instant data transfer, and more. Massey also agrees with the statements of these creative personalities and is sure that a modern man has so overloaded with information that only a tiny proportion of them are beneficial and essential (p. 325). Even in the files of the government of some countries and some large companies, such a vast amount of data is stored that it seems very real to construct a picture of future events (p. 325).Thirdly, the writer states that progress and social change are a natural process and the course of things, influenced by globalization and trends in corporate behavior and thinking (p.
On the right hand, contemporary data analysis presents chances that can be leveraged to improve current organization practices by growing the business, making life efficient, and helping in worthwhile causes. Through big data, contemporary data analysis plays a significant part in how the firm will stay ahead of business practices by anticipating potential needs and problems (Khine, 2019). To date, contemporary data analysis dominates the health care sector by minimizing operation costs and identifying efficiencies. However, to improve current organizational practices, data analysis will enable the firm to eliminate diseases, minimize, if not avoid, unnecessary harms, control infections, and extract the most valuable information from the existing dataset.To ensure continuous improvement in the firm, the following three processes might be implemented. The PDCA, or the Deming cycle, presents
a systematic procedure to enhance products or services by identifying, analyzing, and developing tests and thinking of viable solutions to the problem (Hamm, 2016). The Kaizen process will allow the firm to utilize standardized continuous improvement approaches by becoming the second nature for every employee. The Six Sigma process will enhance the business by error elimination (Hamm, 2016). Data analysis trends can improve current practices by identifying decision areas where clinicians perform better and duplicate the level of success. Moreover, through data analysis trends, the organization can also identify areas where clinicians are underperforming and provide evidence in helping the business inform its decision-making process (Hamm, 2016). In other words, data analysis trends can help the business track successful metrics in clinical decisions via predictive analytics to minimize
Creating a legal definition for various ages is crucial for lawmakers in America. By establishing the boundaries between childhood, adolescence, and adulthood, it becomes possible to clarify the specifics of such periods and behaviors that the individuals might demonstrate. However, as explained by Scott (2000) in The Legal Construction of Adolescence , there are several complications connected to clearly defining the end of childhood and the overall period of adolescence. While childhood and adulthood ages can be specified by distinguishing between the children’s vulnerability and adults’ responsibility, adolescent populations’ ages are more difficult to determine due to the transitional nature of this growth period.In the contemporary legal framework, adolescence is not properly defined. Nevertheless, it appears that not including this term in the system is a highly successful
of maturity earlier or later than 18 years. As a result, the legal definition of adulthood might not apply to some teenagers, forcing the authorities to treat all individuals below 18 as minors regardless of their actual development (Scott, 2000). Nevertheless, as perfectly explained by Scott, incorporating the multitude of factors impacting maturity is a highly strenuous task that requires significant effort from lawmakers.
The Metamorphosis by Franz Kafka is a great story about a young man who transforms into a bug and is imprisoned in his own chamber as a result of apples thrown at him sticking in his casing. Georg Samka awakens in a surrealistic dream world, and he receives no sympathy from anyone, despite the fact that he has sacrificed his own aspirations for years so that his sister might study music at the Conservatory. His family members’ reactions to him and how they choose to deal with the situation betray their relationships with him, revealing what they actually feel about the young man.While Gregor’s family has never shown affection for him, they did at least treat him as a human before his transformation; following his transformation, they have
become progressively nasty and aloof. Gregor’s family tolerates him before his transformation since he takes over as the family’s breadwinner. They don’t have a particularly warm connection, but at least they show him some respect so that he may continue to support them. When they suspect he’ll be late for work, they double-check to make sure he arrives. When his father tries to wake his kid up, even if he doesn’t work, he has a warning in his voice.His sister is the only one of his family that comes to his aid, inquiring if he is ill. She instantly tries to console and assist him in any way she can. Grete, the sister, begins collecting goods that she feels he will be interested in after his metamorphosis so
that he can eat and feel comfortable, such as rotting vegetables, cheese, old leftovers, and hardened bones. Mrs. Samsa, his mother, is troubled by the transition, overcome with emotion and despair. She does her hardest to comfort and assist him, but she can’t stand looking at him. She tries her hardest to behave motherly in her sadness, but she has a hard time overcoming his appearance. Mr. Samsa, Gregor’s father, is unpleasant and rude to the point of becoming abusive. Mr. Samsa has grown accustomed to Gregor providing for his family by working for a living and paying for their survival. He is enraged at the shift, particularly since it means Gregor will no longer be able to assist them.All the family members started to mistreat him after
Harlem Renaissance was a period in America between the 1920s and 1930s. Great migrations of African Americans characterized the South to the North, Harlem in New York (Farebrother and Thaggert 77). The First World War had just ended, and the Jim Crow segregation law was gaining momentum forcing black people to move to the North. During this period, African American culture grew tremendously in literature and thinking. Harlem was flooded with black artists who looked to grow their reach and capabilities. Their way of thinking was transformed, thus developing a sense of independence; they developed their literature instead of copying the white artists. They embraced their African heritage from which they developed their music, art, and poetry. Authors wrote novels and poems basing them on the way of
life of the people in Harlem during that decade. For instance, Zora Neale Hurston, a renowned writer and anthropologist wrote several novels that bore and applied similar themes as those of Harlem, the novel of choice is ‘Their Eyes Were Watching God. The paper will discuss how Hurston exemplifies the Harlem movement in her book.‘Their Eyes Were Watching God is an award-winning novel first published in the late 1930s and is considered one of the classics of the Harlem renaissance. Furthermore, this novel portrays the movement in all its features and style. The novel narrates the story of Janie and her pursuit for peace. As much as the book portrays as a product of the rebirth, it also acts as a representative of the Harlem Renaissance. The novel
exemplifies the Harlem rebirth by accommodating various themes portrayed in the way people of Harlem lived and carried out their daily activities. These themes include; racism, freedom, independence, language, power and conquest, love and relationship, and humanity. Through these themes, the author can capture and present the Harlem sensation in her novel.The language being used by the novel’s characters displays mastery of the southern dialect. Hurston uses an exciting narrative structure by accommodating idioms and literary speech, which was common during the movement. The characters of this novel are designed in a manner that long passages contain as much artistic voice as possible. For instance, Janie’s character has a distinctive use of grammar and vocabulary similar to the people of Harlem. Hurston uses language artistically to match Janie’s
quest to search for her voice (Rau 154). Similarly, artists in Harlem use their power over language to develop pieces of art that are compelling to the audience.The novel portrays language as an instrument of harm because it can hurt somebody. It is displayed when Jody asks Janie to be silent when elected as the mayor. White people despise vocal African Americans since they do not like the idea of black people demanding equal treatment (Rau 147). Language is depicted as a key for harmonious correlation; Tea Cake and Janie engage in conversations that breed love, respect, and togetherness. The same applies to Harlem, where artists use their skills to bring people together. Hurston has established that one can define themselves through language and let their intentions be
known (Hurston 224). In Harlem, black artists used their voices to air their grievances against racism.Though not a significant theme in the novel, race plays a crucial role in Harlem since African American artists are considered inferior compared to their white counterparts. Racism in the South has become unbearable for black people due to the oppressive laws which the Democrats are approving (Farebrother et al. 179). The great migration is mainly attributed to violent racism in the South, meaning that it is a crucial influence on the Harlem Renaissance. Black artists are being despised, which prompts them to focus on producing authentic art by embracing their African traditions. Furthermore, racism is so rampant in Harlem that white Americans migrate from their town Harlem to avoid mixing up with
black people.In the novel, racism is portrayed, but in this case, a black person discriminates against another black person; this is colorism. Although Janie is black, she is light-skinned because she ¼ white hence the Caucasian-like hair (Hurston 234). Mrs. Turner discriminates against Tea Cake, who has darker skin, and despises Janie for marrying him. Mrs. Turner asks Janie to leave Tea Cake for her brother, who is light-skinned like her. She is but another obstacle that Janie has to navigate before achieving fulfillment and being at peace with herself. The novel depicts racism during the burial of those killed by the hurricane. Here black people are buried with nothing while white people are put in pine caskets. Explicit instructions are laid that no black person should be
buried with white people and vice versa (Hurston 205). Tea Cake jokes that the caskets are for helping god identify white souls since there is no Jim Crow law in heaven.Power and conquest for fulfillment is the second theme in Hurston’s novel, basing its origin on the Harlem rebirth, where African American artists flood Harlem to make a mark in the world of music and literature. Harlem was initially a white man’s town, but whites were overwhelmed with the influx of black people and thus moved higher up North (Farebrother and Thaggert 204). White Americans can no longer suppress black people or keep them under their command. Their illusion of power is destroyed. African Americans seize the town of Harlem, and this gives them a deep sense of
fulfillment since they are now occupying a town that was purposefully constructed for middle and upper-class white.Similarly, Janie achieves fulfillment by undertaking spiritual journeys to self-awareness and love (Hurston 141).On the other hand, Jody achieves fulfillment by suppressing and controlling everybody. He is obsessed with forcing those around him into submission under the illusion that he will be fulfilled. Nevertheless, his illusion of power is destroyed when he becomes sick, and it dawns on him that he can no longer control his surroundings.Love and relationship are other themes present in the novel on the basis Harlem Renaissance. Many artists travel to Harlem to develop their talents since its population guarantees an audience (Farebrother and Thaggert 154). These artists work together and maintain symbiotic relationships where everybody gains. They
co-publish articles, poems, and books; as such, they help each other grow in their respective fields of expertise. A symbiotic relationship is evident between Janie and Tea Cake; these two hold each other in high regard and respect (Hurston 247). Through this, Janie can grow and eventually achieve self-awareness. Tea Cake treats Janie as his equal, which plays a significant role in ensuring the success of their relationship.Artists in Harlem relate harmoniously; nevertheless, relationships do not guarantee self-fulfillment; this is evident in both the novel and Harlem town. Janie attained true fulfillment only after the death of Tea Cake. In addition, she is enlightened and independent. In Harlem, William Grant quit his band and focused on himself. He perfects his skills and is now considered the best since
Annabel LeeIt was many and many a year ago,In a kingdom by the sea,That a maiden there lived whom you may knowBy the name of Annabel Lee;And this maiden she lived with no other thoughtThan to love and be loved by me.I was a child and she was a child,In this kingdom by the sea,But we loved with a love that was more than love –I and my Annabel Lee –With a love that the wingèd seraphs of HeavenCoveted her and me.And this was the reason that, long ago,In this kingdom by the sea,A wind blew out of a cloud, chillingMy beautiful Annabel Lee;So that her highborn kinsmen cameAnd bore her away from me,To shut her up in a sepulchreIn this kingdom by the sea.The angels, not half
so happy in Heaven,Went envying her and me –Yes! – that was the reason (as all men know,In this kingdom by the sea)That the wind came out of the cloud by night,Chilling and killing my Annabel Lee.But our love it was stronger by far than the loveOf those who were older than we –Of many far wiser than we –And neither the angels in Heaven aboveNor the demons down under the seaCan ever dissever my soul from the soulOf the beautiful Annabel Lee;For the moon never beams, without bringing me dreamsOf the beautiful Annabel Lee;And the stars never rise, but I feel the bright eyesOf the beautiful Annabel Lee;And so, all the night-tide, I lie down by the sideOf my darling – my darling – my life and
my bride,In her sepulchre there by the sea –In her tomb by the sounding sea.-Edgar Allan PoeTitleBased on the title, this poem is about a specific girl. It probably has a love connotation and is dedicated by the poet to his beloved.ParaphraseIt happened a long time agoIn the kingdom of the seaside land:There lived and blossomed the one that was always called,Called Annabelle LeeI loved, was loved, we loved together,This is the only way we could live.And, breathing love, we were both childrenIn the kingdom of the seaside land.But we loved more than we love in love,Me and sweet Annabelle LeeAnd, looking at us, the angel of heavenCould not forgive us that love.That is why it happened a long time agoIn the kingdom of the seaside land,From the
sky, the wind blew cold from the clouds,He breathed on Annabelle Lee;And the relatives of a distinguished crowd convergedAnd they took her away from meTo forever put her in a sarcophagus,In the kingdom of the seaside land.The angel in paradise could notKnow half such bliss –That is why it happened (as everyone knowsIn the kingdom of the seaside land) –The wind blew cold from the clouds at nightAnd killed my Annabelle Lee.However, loving, we loved stronger and fullerThose who bore the burden of old age –Those who have surpassed us in wisdom –And neither the angels of heaven nor the demons of darkness,Could never separateCould not separate my soul from that ofSeductive Annabelle Lee.And always a ray of the moon brings me dreamsAbout captivating Annabelle Lee:And the star
will light up, I always see the eyes ofSeductive Annabelle Lee;And during twinkling nights, I am all with her, I am all with her,With the unforgettable – with the bride – with my love –I am stretched out beside her,In the sarcophagus of the seaside land.ConnotationThe literary context of the work is deeper than the literal one. The poet uses a long list of epithets: captivating, seductive, unforgettable, and others (Poe). He also resorts to inversion, for instance, in the phrase “And this maiden she lived” (Poe). Most of the lines do not rhyme but follow the rhythm. The list of metaphors includes the following examples: breathe love, induce dreams by a ray of the moon, and others (Poe). Poe also uses angels and demons to make a

The article “What’s new in the Caribbean for 2022” written by Suri (2020) describes the revitalization of the Caribbean islands after the pandemic of COVID-19. Specifically, the author mentions that the infrastructure in the region is undergoing serious renovations and advancements to attract an even bigger number of visitors when the situation grows more stable. In 2020, the Caribbean travel industry experienced a devastating downturn, but in 2021, a substantial share of international travelers chose the region as their destination. The author specifies that Americans are not an exception; the reasons are the proximity of the islands and their relatively successful campaign against the pandemic.To delve deeper into the situation with the tourism advancements of the Caribbean, Suri provides specific data. According to the author, many visitors, primarily
people from the U.S., were driven to the Caribbean as a pandemic travel destination because of its accessibility and reasonably successful reputation in managing Covid-19 (Suri, 2021). Though incoming visitations were severely impacted in 2020, the number of foreign tourists in 2021 was significantly more significant, at least for a selection of islands (Suri, 2021). 14 of the 26 Caribbean Tourism Organization participating nations reported a substantial increase in international travelers in 2021.Considering the above, the region seeks to turn new visitors into regular to overcome the quarantine-related economic recession as soon as possible. This requires a maximal renovation of the resorts so that they can remain sufficiently competitive. Therefore, the most popular and influential islands are investing outstandingly large sums in their development. The latter involves not
solely constructing and renovating touristic objects, such as hotels or beaches, but also essential advancements in other spheres. Among those is energy, where the Caribbean islands seek to reach complete self-sufficiency, transport, the supply of potable water, and others.To complete its goal, the region has to increase its capacity substantially, which means the ability to house more people than possible at the current stage. This requires additional dwellings, air seats, and attractions to entertain the guests. In addition, the existing visa policies need reconsidering to enable visitors to spend long-lasting vacations in the region with no worries about bureaucratic issues. Furthermore, some islands are planning to allow foreigners to work without any special documents, which may add to their willingness to stay in the region. Certain communities find
resort, Paws Up Montana (Suri, 2021). Another example is shown through St. Lucia’s attitude, in 2021 received 20,000 extra flight seats from the U.S., and the development of new facilities was already ongoing (Suri, 2021). According to the island’s head of state, Evelyn Wever-Croes, Aruba’s number of tourists began to recover in July 2021 (Suri, 2021). The region now intends to invest around $153 million in 2022 and $264 million in 2023 to increase accommodations.
Plato’s Gorgias is the writing written in the form of dialogues between Socrates and sophists. In these dialogues, philosophers argue and share their views on virtue and rhetoric. According to Gorgias, “A rhetorician is capable of speaking effectively against all comers, whatever the issue, and can consequently be more persuasive in front of crowds about… anything he likes” (Dodds, 1990). Hence, in his view, rhetoric is mainly used for compellingly presenting an argument.Socrates argues that oratory practices that became popular among sophists in Athens pursue convincing and persuading rather than speaking the truth. “And the same will be true of the orator and the oratory in relation to all other arts. The orator need have no knowledge of the truth about thongs; it is enough for him to
One choice that demonstrates the author’s theoretical awareness well is the concluding scene in the first chapter of Maus, when the narrator’s father warns him not to disclose what he told about his youth. It demonstrates that Spiegelman is rhetorically aware of the fact that most of his audience would not have first-hand knowledge of the Holocaust and, for them, it would be just a page from history books. By reiterating the amorous adventures of the main character’s youth, he manages to make him more understandable, relatable, and, despite him being depicted as a mouse, more human. This rhetorical choice allows the audience, which would most likely not know about the Holocaust beyond the high school history class, to connect to the topic on a more personal level.Moreover,
IntroductionFrom the perspective of business accounting, risk management involves the assessment, evaluation, and mitigation of risk within the practices of an organization. Typically, risk management is seen as a strategic management concept, but within the context of modern businesses, accounting contributes strongly and is heavily invested in risk aversion. Enterprise risk management should be at the core of a professional accounting mindset, and to add value, accountants must be outward-looking risk experts that offer insight for their organizations when meeting their objectives or responding to uncertainty. Finance and accounting provide key quality information to management in a timely manner that can be used by managers at all levels for informed decision-making (Camilleri & Camilleri, 2017). Accounting is a tool for success, working with operating management to make conducive
decisions, take on evaluated risks, and achieve enterprise strategic goals.DefinitionRisk management is a comprehensive process of identifying, analyzing, and mitigating/accepting the risk of uncertainty. Risk is quantifiable in both absolute and relative terms and becomes ultimately inseparable from return on investment. Despite risk being viewed in negative terms, it is necessary to achieve performance objectives. In its basic form in accounting, the risk is a deviation from the expected outcome (Camilleri & Camilleri, 2017). The deviation is either positive or negative, but it is generally accepted by financial professionals that increased returns come at greater risk and, in turn, come from increased volatility. Accountants consistently search for means to reduce volatility and risk through the use of various metrics such as standard deviation, distributions, and dispersions. Risk assessment
is one of the key components of internal control in organizations, identifying areas of risk loss via accounting records and implementing adequate controls (Needles et al., 2014). Evaluating risk statistically and numerically allows for highly informed decision-making in regard to existing or potential risks.Risk has traditionally been defined in terms of the chance of danger, loss, injury, or other negative consequences. In accounting, the risk is viewed from the perspective of decision trees, probability distributions, cost-volume-profit analysis, pricing models, cash flow models, and many other frameworks. Risk management allows one to methodically address risk, immediately attaching it to organizational activities and pursuing organizational objectives. Effective risk management consists of assessment, evaluation, treatment, and reporting. Meanwhile, the more in-depth enterprise risk management approach is aimed at aligning risk management
with a business strategy and embedding a management culture into business operations (Collier et al., 2006).Types of RiskRisk is broken down into categories allowing for more effective and efficient comparison and evaluation. Risk will always be existent to some extent, so accountants must understand that some level of risk is viable, but tradeoffs and opportunity costs must be considered to either eliminate or maintain some risks. Therefore, it may be helpful to categorize risks, but different institutions may approach this differently. 1. Market risk – changing conditions in the marketplace where the organization operates, ranging from general market tendencies to specific company-specific elements. 2. Credit risk – stemming from the risk associated with credit extended to customers and/or suppliers, with the risk that either can default. The company
must also ensure that it meets its own credit obligations in a timely manner. 3. Liquidity risk – this can include asset liquidity and operational funding liquidity. The company must have cash on hand to pay for basic expenses, balancing its assets and operational funding. 4. Operational risk – risk arising from daily business activities, ranging from crises and lawsuits to fraud and business models (Camilleri & Camilleri, 2017).Role of AccountantsAccountants have an important role in helping organizations with internal controls and risk management processes. It is one of the core competencies of accountancy as a profession to oversee and improve internal control programs in an organization. They ensure that staff members are away of risk control language and standards, which must be met with all financial operations.
Accountants virtually create the standards and then implement them in an organization (Needles et al., 2014). In a way, accountants are key strategic partners in decision-making management in risk management and consideration.Accountants are most effective at risk management when they have an understanding of enterprise risk management (ERM) and applications of daily operations of a business. Companies with ERM strategies in place generally thrive better in risk and can focus on business continuity. A significant portion of companies is reactive to risks rather than proactive, and risk management is an activity that is best undertaken offensively before anyone is prepared. In order to do so competently, companies need accounting staff that can measure and manage risks accurately in all their forms. However, for ERM to work, it must
be linked directly to company strategy and actions. Accountants have direct insight into a company’s finances and supply chains, so they work cross-functionally with other departments, such as H.R., I.T., sustainability, and others, to essentially evaluate financial and non-financial risks across the organization to construct a holistic risk framework (Thompson, 2020).Impact on Accounting QualityERM gained significant attention and popularity in the midst of the 2008 crisis. It is believed to enhance a company’s ability to soften the impact of a major economic crisis as well as lead to an improved value relevance of account information for firms adopting ERM. Accounting quality is not a clearly defined term but generally implies that the value relevance of accounting information is considered and the ability of accounting information to reflect the
true performance of an organization. Some common characteristics highlighted as vital to accounting quality are timeliness and timely loss recognition, accrual quality, earnings management, and discretionary accruals (Olayinka et al., 2019).Accounting quality allows firms to reduce earnings management, minimize discretionary accrual, and offer great information on earnings. It is a vital measure of the value relevance of accounting for an organization seeking sustainable growth. ERM became popular around the world because it is meant to enhance the accuracy of corporate disclosure, improve the reliability of financial statements, develop stronger risk management, and enhance accounting quality. Therefore, accounting is directly interrelated with risk management and prevention in such systems. Accounting is vital for ERM function, while ERM seeks to enhance accounting processes by improving financial reporting quality and strengthening
the internal processes of an organization (Olayinka et al., 2019).Risk Management and Corporate GovernanceCompetent corporate governance is a result of an effective risk management system that creates a controlled environment. This is why much recent legislation around the world, including the Dodd-Frank Act in the U.S. in response to the 2008 financial crisis, requires effective risk management implemented in firms. Management accounting, under the concepts of risk and governance, has to be managerially actionable in order for their role and proficiency to be interpretable in logical and predictable terms. While risk management is the foundation of modern management control, management accounting is directly influencing corporate governance. For example, failure to provide accurate accounting reports and then use these reports inefficiently by risk management will have a negative impact
on corporate governance. There is an inherent interdependence between risk management, managerial accounting, and corporate governance (Van der Poll & Mthiyane, 2018).The design and utilization of strategic management accounting techniques are based on strategic information collection to address environmental uncertainties to support strategic decision-making. As part of the organizational structure, it is the role of the board as part of corporate governance to formulate a successful strategy, with managerial accounting reports enabling this task. Strategic management accounting is the basis for strategic positioning, which includes Porter’s competitive advantage and strategic cost exploration. Therefore, the usefulness of management accounts in risk management is paramount and is necessary for sustainability. However, if a firm chooses to ignore the strategic position, management accounting can then be used as a mitigation strategy.
This once again demonstrates the triangle, side-by-side interdependence between corporate governance, risk management, and management accounting, and companies should recognize this interdependence (Van der Poll & Mthiyane, 2018).Therefore, to understand how accounting systems influence risk management, it is important to view the firm as a governance coordinating mechanism for information provided to individuals. The objective is that the correct information is shared with targeted teams, departments, and individuals to whom they are relevant and enable them to undertake the tasks which fall under their responsibility. Effective information provision seeks to support efficient operations and primary concerns regarding risk management. Another important step is to extract meaning from the information, which requires expert judgment to interpret various calculative practices for risk assessment, such as the interpretation of uncertainty (Brookfield,
2018). Management accounting is a critical aspect of a company. However, even its elements can have certain challenges. For example, transparency, which is exalted as necessary for smooth governance, can be concerning. Evidence has shown that not all firms utilize management accounting in risk management for governance purposes. Some viewed M.A. statements but chose to ignore them; others presented manipulated healthy financial information, which was inaccurate, leading to collapse in both cases (Van der Poll & Mthiyane, 2018).Multiple organizations adopt ERM to meet compliance regulations and virtually ignore the need to proceed with risks strategically. However, a comprehensive ERM approach is more effective. First, management accountants are asked to aid the organization in identifying risks and opportunities with events that have not yet occurred. Accounting is also asked
to determine probabilities of occurrence and financial outcomes of these events, as well as justify why substantial investment controls of said risks are necessary even though there are chances they will never happen. Management accountants are familiar with regulatory standards, have direct lines to top executives, and usually have the experience for informed advising to decision-making parties. Management accountants play internal control roles in various ERM activities, and these activities may be aimed at multiple stages of risk management, from risk prevention itself, such as staff training, information on new software, etc., to actually resolving problems when confronted with consumers or regulators (analyzing costs of alternative ways of delivering repairs). Despite this, the profession still has no clear taxonomy regarding the role of management accountants in ERM activities
(Bento et al., 2018).While research and regulatory body of guidance and frameworks in ERM are becoming extensive, management accountants are still creating new territory regarding ERM practices. Management accountants have specialized experience and training on how to measure, report and analyze the financial and non-financial impact of decisions. Given leadership roles, management accountants can develop truly enterprise-focused ERM systems that are not dependent on functional silos but seek to permeate decision-making through the organization. This fits into the new paradigm of management accounting which calls to broaden its professional strategic scope and be better than a myopic view of planning and control, measuring the performance of the past and being able to make forward-predictive measurements about organizational sustainability and risk (Bento et al., 2018).In a complex dynamic market
environment, the effectiveness of risk mitigation may be difficult to pinpoint. The point of ERM is not to maximize profits but rather to create an equilibrium that is optimal and conditioned on its environment. The organization reaches a status quo where desired outcomes are reproduced from transactions undertaken that motivated the firm creation in the first place. Therefore, the issue adjusts from a static set of accounting-based budget targets to a process of equilibrium. Accounting and accounting technologies contribute immensely to organizational effectiveness and follow all other elements of organizational hierarchy closely (Brookfield, 2018). The key to remember is that information provision is always central to accounting technology and its role in effective risk mitigation.Future of Risk ManagementCurrently, the financial industry is undergoing significant changes with the advent
of blockchain and fintech technology. Blockchain is a disruptive element in currency, supply chains, and information-sharing practices. However, as with any new technology and practices, it will present additional risks. Accounting and ERM will be at the helm by addressing aspects of financial data integrity issues, financial reporting risks, and implications for external auditors. Firms that adopt blockchain will have to adjust their policies and accounting practices over internal controls and counterparty risk assessment. Both internal and external auditors will have to assess blockchain implementation primarily as a financial reporting risk (Smith & Castonguay, 2019).Advancements in fintech are rapidly advancing, with up to a quarter of global financial institutions being at risk in the near future. The primary benefit of financial tech is eliminating elements of costly data
entry and analysis. However, fintech has built-in logic and compliance with business models being built around data flow, greatly increasing transparency and reducing the time necessary to prepare for an audit example. As a result, accounting practices will shift dramatically as A.I. will be able to fulfill many manual human jobs currently ranging from data entry to selecting the right statistical sample in an audit. On the one hand, it will free up the human potential to focus on big data analysis and actually work with clients to improve business operations. On the other, it signifies an era of rapid change for accounting with changing standards, new issues, and most likely significantly new risks that the industry has not faced beforehand.Biblical WorldviewAlthough a significant portion of the Bible
concerns itself with faith and trust in the Lord, there are also calls to be prepared, to plan ahead, and to be rational with finances. In Luke 14:25-33, Jesus encourages followers to consider what it takes to follow him. Planning ahead is an important part of committing to any given thing. Jesus illustrates this through a short example, “For which of you, intending to build a tower, does not sit down first and count the cost, whether he has enough to finish – lest, after he has laid the foundation, and is not able to finish, all who see it begin to mock him saying, ‘This man began to build and was not able to finish’” (New International Version, 2011, Luke 14:28-30).Making a blunt comparison in accounting, this
Jesus began His sermon with an exposition of the Beatitudes, each of which begins with the word blessed, that is, happy. At first glance, it seems that the main purpose of the Beatitudes is to give various comforts to the oppressed. But beyond that, Jesus instructs in this chapter on how those who are privileged should behave (English Standard Version Bible, 2001). The verses address the issue of where to seek comfort for those who suffer (Matuszewski, 2020). This question was in many ways the basis for my project. Patients may find the answer for themselves in the gospel lines – let every praying and believing person be assured that they will be heard.Health care workers will do all they can to help everyone in need. They work
SummaryEven totalitarian nations are vulnerable to powerful requests that may organize millions of citizens and potentially influential leaders, attract foreign institutions and mass perception, and push their regimes to respond. The openness of legitimately established administrations to local opinion and initiatives by entities to reform policies and regulations varies substantially. The viewpoint of a revolutionary organization on the formulation of a cultural crisis can attract the public’s concern, focusing interest on the issue at hand and discovering answers. They might, however, be short-lived endeavours or episodic spurts of energy (Massey, 2016). Advocacy groups and participants of progressive organizations concentrate on the factors that contribute to the success of social movements. Not all social movements succeed all of the time; instead, the vast mass of individuals fails to meet
their objectives.How Social Movements MatterIn most cases, social movements pursue collective goods or outcomes, but not always. These things must be shared by a group regardless of their participation in the movement. Some outcomes are shared among the activists and a larger group not part of the movement (Massey, 2016). Politically active people can be members of a movement to bring social change to society. Members of a movement who interact as they seek social change create a social network constructed in cyberspace and through exposure through grievance-voiced media.What is a Social Movement?Social movements are forms of tumultuous engagement that question current conditions and practices and their validity and ethics. Movements must communicate with the general public, arrange contacts, and successfully fulfil the needs of those participating. Members
inside the uprisings inevitably oppose organized patterns and assume facts about the universe. This necessitates a diverse set of skills in people who can complete tasks and motivate others to work towards a common goal.Social Movement TacticsProgressive groups function beyond the organizational forms, particularly in the initial stages. They send mail and documents, request a meeting, or warn legal action to the other side, thus showing how revolutionary socialist techniques are used. Strategies are frequently self-aware of their theatrical nature because of the necessity to break through the cacophony of information that will otherwise drown out the movement’s activities; theatrical staging has become more likely (Massey, 2016). Without the threat or disruptive measures, gaining recognition for a union and obtaining a collectively bargained contract are improbable outcomes.Political Opportunity
primarily supported by the usage of social media, which allows them to express their opinions openly. Understanding how social movements affect societal change requires separating movement goals, activities, and claims of success from other elements and linking what a movement accomplishes and the outcomes. Social movements are significant since they affect the popular view, shape legislation, and shape culture. It also affects several individuals who take part in the movements have a long-term influence on their personality, personal decisions, and degree of societal participation.
The foundation myths of Rome represent some of the qualities vital for a successful state in antiquity – decisiveness, militancy, and political and social flexibility. Historians of different sorts have been trying to understand and interpret the story of Romulus and Remus since its creation. The following stages of Rome’s supposed history also raise many questions regarding fratricide, abduction, rape, and also the backgrounds of Rome’s first citizens. The fact that according to most of the myths, Rome started from fratricide seems to be quite relevant as the city’s history is famously filled with civil conflicts and wars. Many historians tried to sugarcoat this episode – Cicero ignored it, Dionysius of Halicarnassus depicted Romulus as full of regret, and Egnatius suggested that Remus had survived and outlived Romulus
granting citizenship to the people of provinces (Beard, 2015). One of the kings of Macedon in the third century BCE recognized the advantages of the Roman approach (as cited in Beard, 2015). Without much of a doubt, it can be presumed that Roman foundation myths are closely intertwined with the Roman identity, and it is possible to identify some of Rome’s success factors through its myths.
Romanticism is a large-scale ideological and artistic trend in the culture and art of the 19th century, which replaced the cold rationalism of neoclassicism and Enlightenment. Romantics have elevated the importance of fantasy, emotions, feelings, and mental tossing (Steiner & Foster, 2020). The era of heroes with robust, bold, contradictory, and sometimes rebellious characters has begun in literature and art. These are figures like Byron and Prometheus, who either proclaim man’s greatness or become vulnerable in the hands of fate while passions overcome them. They embark on wanderings, climb the barricades, raise the banner of freedom, and do not know peace.Romanticism in painting rejected the rationalism of classicism and reflected the attention to the depths of the human personality characteristic of the philosophy of the Romantics. It grew
up on the emotional soil of sentimentalism, but while preserving lyricism and poetry, it replaced sentimental sensitivity with dramatic manifestations of nature. Therefore, it is not necessary to associate this direction with religious motives – instead, with the romance of distant wanderings, travels, mysterious discoveries, and even revolutionary struggle. Unlike sentimentalism, there is no tenderness and tearfulness in Romanticism – it is the philosophy of the brave and strong.The characters in the paintings of romantic artists are similar to the heroes of literary novels: sensitive, often enigmatic, sometimes riotous, sometimes cruel, and often lonely. Many creators were immersed in studying the dark sides of human nature (Steiner & Foster, 2020). Hence, there was the interest of artists in the night, thunderstorms, and mysticism. To some extent, the romantic
masters even returned to Baroque aesthetics with its dramatic intensity, passion, dynamism, chaos, and mysticism.The main feature of Romanticism as a direction in literature lies in the main conflicts and ideas. The main idea of almost every work is the constant movement of the literary hero in physical space. This fact reflects the confusion of the hero’s soul, his flowing, continuous reflections, and at the same time, changes in the surrounding reality.As in any artistic direction, Romanticism has its conflicts. The whole concept in this direction is based on the complex relationship of the protagonist of the work with the outside world. The main character is egocentric, but at the same time, they rebel against the vulgar, base, material components of reality (Steiner & Foster, 2020). This is
IntroductionThere are a variety of options used by psychologists, psychiatrists, and counselors to identify the symptoms of mental health issues and psychiatric disorders among patients. In turn, the Rorschach test is considered one of the most popular and developed assessment systems utilized in different parts of the world. This test has got a vast spread throughout the media, which is why the majority of the worldwide population is aware of this test due to movies, TV-shows, and fictional stories. On the one hand, such considerable popularity of this assessment tool can be explained by its effectiveness in the process of detecting numerous psychiatric issues. On the other hand, this test has been criticized by scientists and healthcare providers for several decades in a row.Nowadays, this test is represented
as a procedure when the examiner demonstrates the other person each of 10 cards and asks to describe them. In turn, the examinee expresses personal thoughts and ideas regarding the images, thereby, offering a psychiatrist the opportunity to determine some deviations associated with the psychological health of a patient. These cards are mainly black-and-white, although some inkblots are colored. In terms of interpretation and assessment of the results, scientists have been debating since the middle of the past century. As a result, there are numerous evaluation tools which can be applied to the answers of patients. The Rorschach Performance Assessment System (RPAS) and Exner’s Comprehensive System (CS) are regarded as the most reliable and valid assessment tools which can be used for the Rorschach test. Thus, in spite
of the fact that the suggested psychiatric test has been critiqued many times, it is still one of the most well-grounded methods to identify psychiatric issues, such as schizophrenia.HistoryEven though Rorschach is frequently perceived as the first scientist to assess the psychological well-being of individuals on the basis of ambiguous scenes, this belief is not accurate. In fact, this person was inspired by numerous other influencers aiming at detecting the earliest stages of psychiatric issues. Initially, the boy developed an interest in this area due to the game called Blotto , a form of Klecksography (Teles, 2020). The majority of kids were playing this game at the beginning of the 19th century. However, the production of art and charade-based pictures out of inkblot has become Rorschach’s main point
of interest in adulthood as well.Once the health issue called schizophrenia became a globally recognizable problem, Rorschach began studying the artwork of mental patients. In 1920, the scientist managed to develop 15 inkblot cards which were intended to test the psychological health of patients (Teles, 2020). First, the effectiveness of using these cards was tested with the help of 400 patients, including 117 individuals previously diagnosed with various types of mental health issues. Once the effectiveness of this method of psychiatric assessment was confirmed, Rorschach took appropriate measures to spread this information throughout the whole world. In 1921, the book called Psychodiagnostik was published by the House of Bircher (“The Status of the Rorschach”, 2005). However, the Swedish scientist died one year later due to complications of physical
health issues. In turn, the contribution of this individual to the field of psychology and psychiatry was acknowledged only after his death.UsesTo assess and interpret the responses of patients accurately, it is important to understand how the Rorschach test should be used. First, each respondent should be provided with 10 cards, one by one (Weiner & Greene, 2008). In turn, the examinee is allowed to analyze pictures from different positions. Therefore, test-takers are able to hold the cards upside down or sideways. Moreover, these individuals can provide answers related to their associations with the picture in any form they want; it can be done with one word or several phrases. Second, the examiner is allowed to ask additional questions or stop the process of a patient responding if
the given explanation is not subject to future interpretation.Rorschach and Assessment PracticesUsually, the assessment of received results is based on 2 important steps, such as simultaneous analysis and further interpretation. In the context of the first stage of assessment, examiners pay attention to a variety of different factors. They include the way respondents describe the image, the length of response, extra comments, and the uniqueness of responses. For instance, the majority of individuals have a similar view on the inkblot cards, which is why the responses of mentally stable individuals are usually the same. Therefore, once the individuals provide a unique view of ambiguous scenes, it can be a sign of disturbances in thought patterns. Furthermore, examiners take into consideration the amount of time the respondent takes to
give the answer. In fact, if the waiting time for responses taken more than 10 seconds, the person is suspected to be shocked.As of the assessment practices, there is a variety of versions which can be used to assess the result of the test. In the past century, the most commonly used assessment practices were the Beck system, the Klopfer system, the Hertz system, the Piotrowski system, and the Rapaport-Schafer system (Mihura & Graceffo, 2014). At the same time, the effectiveness of these systems emerged to be dubious when other scoring systems were discovered. Exner’s CS has been considered the most reliable way to interpret the results of the test for several decades, although the Rorschach Performance Assessment System (R-PAS) became its improved version.Criticisms of Exner’s CS and
Comparisons to the R-PAS AdministrationAs one of the most widely used interpretation approaches to the Rorschach test, Exner’s CS has been used by psychiatrists and psychologists since the 1960s. This scoring system can be considered a tremendously difficult approach, as it includes numerous variables that should be measured with the help of different tools. However, a high level of validity is the main benefit of this scoring system.In terms of criticism, Exner’s CS has been discussed in relation to over-diagnosing psychotic disorders and subjectiveness. The presence of errors was the main cause of the poor reliability of this scoring system. In order to facilitate the process of results interpretation, scientists kept working on the development of an innovative scoring system even when Exner’s CS was introduced to the
world. As a result, R-PAS took into account the disadvantages of previous systems and improved them (Meyer & Eblin, 2012). For example, some of the variables were eliminated, whereas the others were analyzed from different perspectives.Nowadays, complexity, space integration, and space reversal are considered the most important variables of this assessment system, even though there are many other variables taken into consideration. At the same time, it has been confirmed that responses to the Rorschach test vary depending on the country. Therefore, R-PAS is based on a total of 15 adult samples, which makes this scoring system even more reliable (Mihura et al., 2013). In spite of the fact that the latest scoring system still requires improvement, it is regarded as the most valid method to interpret the
results of the Rorschach test in modern society.CodingCoding Rorschach responses is one of the most significant stages in the process of results interpretation. In fact, the accurate coding of responses is expected to give psychologists and psychiatrists a brief understanding of the patients’ internal world and their mental health. At the same time, inaccurate coding of responses can lead to the prescription of ineffective treatment (Kimoto et al., 2016). Hence, scientists and psychiatrists usually code responses on the basis of 2 steps.The first step of coding requires examiners to take the information transcribed during the test administration (qualitative material), whereas the second step of coding is based on interpreting it into numeric scores (quantitative information). In turn, gained scores are used for the interpretation and discussion of health
issues that can be associated with each respondent. Such a comprehensive approach to coding makes the Rorschach test one of the most popular tools used in the psychiatric area.InterpretationThe responses of test-takers can be interpreted in different ways, although there are common rules that are followed during this process by examiners. First, it is important to pay attention to sexual responses. If the individual interprets at least 4 cards in a sexual manner, it is predicted that the examinee faces schizophrenia or sexual frustration (Dimsdale, 2015). Second, all the cards are symmetrical, which was purposefully planned by Rorschach. In fact, if the respondent interprets at least 3 cards as something reflected in the water, it can be a sign of a self-reflective and thoughtful personality (Dimsdale, 2015). Third,
examiners should pay a vast amount of attention to food responses. In case a person interprets at least 1 picture as an example of food, this individual can be engaged in a more addictive behavior than psychologically stable people.Simultaneously, this test offers the opportunity to identify positive qualities as well. For instance, if the respondent analyzed the picture from a general perceptive, it can be a sign that they have well-developed leadership skills and considerable ambitions for life. It can be explained by the fact that the majority of successful and goal-oriented individuals analyze problems in general rather than its little components. Accordingly, the accurate interpretation of responses can help psychiatrists, psychologists, and counselors determine the health status of different population groups.ConclusionRorschach test is one of the most
interpretation of responses is beneficial for the identification of particular psychiatric illnesses. It is the reason why this evaluation tool has been used for numerous decades in different parts of the world. In the future, scientists should improve the scoring system in order to offer examiners the opportunity to improve the reliability and validity of the received results. Thus, the Rorschach test can be regarded as an integral part of the process of psychological assessment, as it helps detect mental health issues and psychiatric disorders.
Bjurström, Erling and Hylland, Ole M. (Eds.). (2018). Aesthetics and Politics: A Nordic Perspective on How Cultural Policy Negotiates the Agency of Music and Arts . Springer International Publishing.This scientific work tries to find the primary sources of rock as a culture. The authors refer to the ancient Nordic society, analyzing their way of life, moods and character. Musical instruments and the role of music as a sphere of art in the life of the layman are considered separately. As a result, the researchers come to the conclusion that it is impossible to identify the only source of the genre, but it is worth considering the whole society as a whole. This, in turn, suggests that rock can be regarded as a worldwide condition, since different parts of
the world in one way or another invented rock motifs and melodies. Thus, the writers emphasize that the genre should be considered as a separate stage in the evolution of art, and not only in the field of music.Mazel, Aron, Charette, Carole and Nash, George. (Eds.). (2021). Indigenous Heritage and Rock Art. Worldwide Research in Memory of Daniel Arsenault . Archaeopress Publishing Limited.The authors of this book conduct a worldwide and large-scale study of the role of rock motifs and certain musical instruments in the life of primitive societies. Further, the writers notice the cultural characteristics of the natives and Indians, as well as African tribes, emphasizing rock music as a tool for connecting with God. This allows us to conclude that the religious meaning in rock culture
is present as one of the root causes of the formation of a whole movement. Finally, it is worth highlighting the ubiquity of the analyzed genre, which explains not only the popularity of rock, but also the whole lifestyle associated with it. An important addition is the selection by researchers of the most popular and first melodies by sounds and notes, and the identification of a close relationship with ancient cultures. The conclusion of the study is that rock has its own clear laws and rules for implementation, which originate more than 1000 years ago.Moore, Allan and Carr, Paul. (Eds.). (2020). The Bloomsbury Handbook of Rock Music Research . Bloomsbury Academic.This book is not a study of the genre itself, but a guide to the methodology of studying
rock. The authors compare and contrast the instruments used to explore this area of ​​music. It is noted that this genre does not need to be analyzed as a separate sphere of art, but, on the contrary, it can look for conjugations and relationships. In addition, an important note of the authors is the integrity and unity of all art. This is expressed primarily in the fact that the mood broadcast by rock can be observed in other subsystems. This in turn means that only an objective, exploratory and multifaceted approach can bring the right results.Smith, Heather N., Perrone, Alyssa, Wilson, Michael, Raghanti Mary Ann, Lovejoy, Owen C., Rosen, Merri J., Shanbhag, Sharad J., DeForrest, David S., Lyman, Lee R. and Eren, Metin I.

the basic sounds of English culture as a basis for studying and consider their introduction into the genre. Thus, the authors come to the conclusion that rock is not so much a relatively modern trend in art and culture as a collective image of different eras. Finally, the book provides theory and analysis of the origins of rock music and its development. This allows to understand the causes and key aspects of the whole process, as well as to reveal the relationship of the analyzed genre with world culture.
Rousseau’s discourse about the notion of self-love in its two manifestations is an appealing and insightful one. The philosopher differentiates between amour de soi-même (self-love) and amour-propre (vanity), distinct in their virtue. Indeed, on the one hand, self-love as a mere natural feeling of love toward one’s self is opposite to vanity. It might be defined as “a natural sentiment which moves every animal to be vigilant in its preservation and which, directed in man by reason and modified by pity, produces humanity and virtue” (Rousseau, 106). Vanity, or egocentrism, on the other hand, is an opposite sentiment, the one that originates artificially in society due to the coexistence of individuals with others. In particular, the philosopher states that it “moves each individual to value himself more than
anyone else, which inspires in men all the evils they cause one another, and which is the true source of honor’ (Rousseau, 106). The two notions are different in the nature of desire, which is natural in the case of self-love, and artificial in the case of vanity.The natural form of self-love is deprived of comparisons to others and exists in the natural world as a mere characteristic of the need of an individual to strive and survive. Such a form of self-love implies that a person does not need anyone else to validate the value of his or her existence. Indeed, “each particular man regards himself as the only spectator who observes him, as the only being in the universe that takes an interest in him, as
the only judge of his own merit” (Rousseau, 106). Such a form of love is good since it leads to human happiness, promoting self-efficacy. On the other hand, vanity or egocentrism is a bad type of self-love since it promotes comparison with others in a society, which ultimately leads to atrocities. Due to vanity, people regard others compared to themselves and judge them as weaker, ultimately committing offenses.In the philosopher’s opinion, the cause of inequalities in different spheres of the life of societies is in the adherence to the bad type of self-love. Originally, all human beings belonged to a natural world where all species were equal until a physical transformation in their constitution occurred. It ultimately led to the differences in their physical and psychological state. In
particular, “improved or declined and acquired various good or bad qualities which were not inherent in their nature, the others remained longer in their original state” (Rousseau, 33). Over time, with social ties, a moral or psychological inequality emerged due to the differences in property and wealth. The wealthy experienced more power and independence than the poor, which led to social, economic, and political inequality.In his novel 1984 , Orwell unfolds the intrinsic features of a totalitarian society. A totalitarian political regime is a system of state laws and conduct that presuppose one-party rule centered around a singular idea, which is commonly pursued by violent and oppressive means. To force the population to abide by the totalitarian rules, the rulers eliminate any opportunity for individual accomplishment and assert
control to standardize people as average representatives of an obedient society.The political regime in Oceania is arranged around the model of panopticism. It is an approach to surveillance arranged to put a panopticon as a central controlling point at the top of society with one center overlooking all individuals in the state. Such an approach is manifested in the signs that “a Big Brother is watching you,” in the hierarchical arrangement of the ministries, and the precise attention to the actions of each citizen (Orwell, 4). Such utilization of panopticism aims to separate individuals into weak units of society for easier control.Indeed, one of the immediate attributes of a totalitarian political regime is the principle of dividing and conquering. Such a principle implies destructing social groups based on
people’s individual responsibility for their obedience or disobedience to the rules of the totalitarian state. Throughout the book, it is demonstrated how “Big Brother is watching” every single individual, separating each citizen from a group and paying attention to one’s behavior (Orwell, 4). Winston, the main character of the novel, works at the Ministry of Truth, where based on the accounts of each individual, historical events are rewritten to match the ideas of the Party. In such a manner, when a disobedient (previously divided and conquered) individual is eliminated, the history might be changed so as to remove the records about that person.A powerful means of control over the masses of people in the novel is the use of a specifically designed language called Newspeak. It is a
thinking process. The simpler and more primitive the language, the more controllable is the thought process of the individuals, who are ultimately easier to oppress and use as mere units in a political and economic machine. For example, the use of doublethink as a term implying a belief in two contradictory statements as true is one of the methods how Newspeak forms citizens’ perception of reality and alters their memories. Thus, it allows for pursuing the Party’s interests on the level of human consciousness.
IntroductionOn 17 February 2020, Mr. and Mrs. Illman submitted a proposal. They suggested a building plan of 4 affordable homes with one local needs home on land east of Beck stones and North of Thornthwaite, Keswick (‘‘The Keswick Reminder,’’ 2021). According to the plan, the homes consisted of four double-story buildings, and one bungalow within a paddock, all sharing a common parking area. The homes will enjoy the serene view and location on the feet of the historic hill.Summary of Local People’s ThoughtsThe affordable housing plan experienced massive rejections by local people in the proposed area. The local people had their reasons based on the valuable historical view of the national park, such as the lack of need for houses in such a lonely place with high natural
vista value (Zhongming et al., 2020). Among other reasons for rejections was the insufficiency of the parking lounge, chances of flooding, and the likelihood of properties surrounding the area losing value (‘‘The Keswick Reminder,’’ 2021). There were 12 different objections to the idea submitted to the district planners following the proposals, with some opposing the plan and others siding with it.Some of the submissions included reasons for implementing affordable housing in the selected location. Some submissions indicated that it was apparent affordable housing had been chosen, as the plans were more likely to gain a sympathetic ear from planning officers, being the current highest area of need. The overriding consideration of the local plan was to give greater weight to conserving and enhancing natural beauty, wildlife, and cultural
heritage. Any acceptance of the plans would mean that, as the planning authority, they have not fulfilled their duty (Mackinlay, 2022). Other claims raised to the authorities included the serene location of the site, the project’s influence on the neighbors of the homes, and the possible threat the development would impose on protected species and ecology. In addition, some claimed the matter of the appearance the proposed homes would portray (‘‘The Keswick Reminder,’’ 2020). Consequently, eight letters were submitted to the authorities to support the proposed plan.One of the supporters said the plan would meet the drastically increasing need for affordable houses. A second supporter said that the local area would keep suffering, as there are no young generations in the villages. A third one said it was
a massive surprise for the planning committee to object to the development plan, yet they were aware of the increasing need for affordable houses. Generally, the entire project faced various objections with significant issues rotating about the land’s serenity. Something that required maximal environmental conservation and the ever-rising need for affordable homes. The objections and support of the project by different parties lead to the authorization of a vague one. Every issue raised had some significant weight on the decision to be made.The Extent to which the Development Accords the Development Plan and the National Planning Policy FrameworkDespite meeting a couple of criteria set by the development plan and the National Planning Policy Framework, the development missed some that the same development planning body had set. The first
criterion involved regulating development plans to ensure such projects benefit the local area’s rural natural environment and landscape. These main aspects have played a considerable role in promoting tourism and the cultural preservation of history. The proposal submitted by Mr. and Mrs. Illman did not meet this criterion because rather than contributing positively to the area’s landscape, it tarnished the area’s serenity (Gkartzios et al., 2022). The affordable homes are located adjacent to a historical hill and a serene view of the National park. Therefore, the project would block the views tarnishing the area’s landscapes. As a result, the proposed plan is likely to affect tourism negatively, a central idea behind the planning of rural areas.Furthermore, the project would interfere with the environment because it is located on
an undeveloped piece of land. As a result, it will imply interfering with the natural environment to ensure human needs such as roads are available to the homes’ occupants. The second criterion regulates authorization of remote land encroachment on whether the project will enhance the availability of the various services and community facilities. Some of the projects that may meet the requirement include setting up local shops, meeting places, places of worship, and public houses (‘‘Lake District National Park,’’ 2022). The project proposed by Mr. and Mrs. Illman met this criterion as the plan involved the construction of four double-floored homes and one bungalow. As a result, the project will play a key role in addressing the housing problem, which is rampant in the current world. Providing affordable
homes in rural areas will play a role in easing the population of people in urban areas.The third criterion used to authorize rural projects is how the project promotes the development and diversification of the various land-based businesses and agriculture. The plan proposed by the Illman’s failed to meet the criteria as the plan had no direct contributions to either business of agriculture. The plan stipulated the living homes, and therefore, there is no diversification, which will be realized as the plan lacks any idea of how to exploit the area economically. The fourth criterion was set on the authorization of rural land utilization as the project’s role in the sustainability of the businesses that exist in the rural areas. The proposed plan, in this case, would meet
this requirement, as their migration to the rural areas would imply buying various services and goods traded within the locality, thus positively influencing the business.Assessment of the Issues Raised by the ProposalVarious issues arose following the proposed plan, where multiple parties had different views on the idea. Some of the problems were realistically leading to the decision to reject the plan rightfully, while others were unrealistic and should not even have contributed to the decision-making. The negative impact of lacking the young generation in rural areas was one of the critical issues raised by supporters of the plan stating it negatively affects various businesses and agricultural activities. As a result, it would contribute to the fading of the historical culture of the people. The idea has a sense
in it and should have been more considered over most of the ideas that led to the plan’s rejection (Walker, 2020). Once a person is born in the town, raised, and aged in the town implies they will not have exposure to the culture, which eventually fades away.Furthermore, destroying the view of the Hill and the National Park naturally was the other major issue that rose following the proposal. The idea was not as relevant on the grounds of the height of the hills and the park, and that which the homes would cover was insignificant. Still, the views were clear according to the various pictures submitted by the plan’s supporters to the authorities. Therefore, because the projected homes had insignificant impacts on the serenity of the area
nor the views of the Hill and the park, the issue should not have played a role in rejecting the home’s construction. Another issue arose following the proposal regarding its role in decreasing the value of the properties that exist within the location (‘‘The Keswick Reminder,’’ 2022). The idea was significant to the proposal, bearing in mind the objective of making rural tourism better. The construction of the homes would cause the Hill to loosen its value. Initially, tourists would enjoy the serenity and loneliness of the hill, but once the homes are constructed, they will lose the loneliness and eventually discourage tourism.The Specific Decision the Local Planning Authority MadeThe local authority rejected the proposal bid majorly because it fails to enhance the natural beauty, wildlife, and cultural
heritage as the enjoyment of the various national park qualities (Walker, 2021). Lorayne Wall, the planning officer for the Lake District, explained the local planning authority’s decisions. He claimed that despite the houses being offered as self-built houses, they interfere with the statutory fulfillment of the purposes of the Hill and the National park in the conservation of natural beauty. On those grounds, the authority could not accept the proposal as it would compromise rural tourism development efforts.Reflection on Whether I Agree with the DecisionI agree with the decision because the proposal would imply compromising the natural beauty of the rural area as the homes would have more negative effects than positive ones. According to the planning board, rural areas are supposed to preserve natural beauty to ensure
to the local community that would influence its development. The proposed plan will have no contributions in availing services or amenities even though it will slightly affect the businesses in the rural area. Therefore, considering the role the views of the National park and the Hill add to the value of the land, there was no reason for authorizing a project that would tamper with the natural beauty.
Russia Today (RT) is widely known for its controversial reporting on various topics, especially news in Ukraine. Multiple sources have repeatedly accused it of disseminating distorted information that forms a particular perspective. In many ways, it is dictated by the principles that are laid down in it in Russia and which, through the activities of RT, are also promoted abroad. In such a situation, one can conclude that freedom of the press is not only in danger but practically non-existent, being swallowed up by political rhetoric. The purpose of this paper is to analyze the situation with RT coverage of news about Ukraine through the prism of the Hutchins report on a free and responsible press.As Hutchins points out in his report, there are three dangers for news
publishers and other media outlets. Firstly, the strong development of such tools reduces the number of people who can express their will and broadcast their opinion. This factor is reflected in the current RT activities since only specialized people can post news on their portals. As one of the most massive pro-Russian voices, RT suppresses all other opinions, curtailing freedom of speech. The second factor, according to Hutchins, is the failure to provide the news that society needs, despite having an opportunity. RT covers news about Ukraine in a highly one-sided way, glorifying Russia and constantly pointing out the failures of Ukraine, exposing it in a negative light. While people want objectivity from the news, RT uses its vast resources for propaganda. Finally, the third factor is the
Throughout history, interventions such as safety measures and quarantine were implemented to improve public safety. According to Rosenberg (2019), Mary Mallon was “the first “healthy carrier” of typhoid fever” recognized in the United States at the beginning of the 20th century, which made her infamous as Typhoid Mary (para. 1). This woman was found to be a typhoid bacteria carrier, and healthcare authorities accused her of 47 illnesses and three deaths, isolating her on an island for most of her life (Rosenberg, 2019, para. 45).Woolliscroft (2020) argues that the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic and people’s public health responsibilities are “a modern instance of a long-standing problem as exemplified by the celebrated case” of Typhoid Mary (p. 1141). The story of the coronavirus outbreak during the 2020 charity tournament of
outbreaks. The situation of Novak Djokovic illustrated how a timely response could reduce the adverse consequences of mass spread. Both instances raise the following questions: “What measures can be implemented to reduce outbreaks?” and “What role do clinicians play in disease management?” Based on the World Health Organization’s guidelines outlined by Salathé et al. (2020), I recommend “rapid diagnosis and immediate isolation of cases, rigorous tracking and precautionary self-isolation of close contacts” to control outbreaks (p. 1).Furthermore, Blais and Hayes (2016) underline the role of nursing in global health and disease prevention and management, namely, raising awareness, improving communication, and identifying solutions to challenges. People should accumulate knowledge obtained throughout history to improve public health and safety measures.
Being an international company with diversified sectors, Coates Chemicals developed an interest in fuel production because of the introduction of E10 fuel in the United Kingdom. The organization has a variety of sectors ranging from foods and beverages to pharmaceuticals covering most of its consumers’ needs. The urge for the bioethanol plant compelled the company to construct the plant and produce ethanol from glucose. This report stipulates step-by-step safety guidelines that made the construction and production of ethanol in Coates Chemicals.After conducting the comprehensive feasibility of the bioethanol plant, it was evident that 10000 terapascal of pressure was economical in ethanol production compared with the viability of the current marketplace. The organization was erected adjacent to River Trent. The main reason for the plant to be situated near
the river is to cut down the costs incurred in case water areas are far away from the bioethanol plant. The manufacture and processing of ethanol require a lot of water in its processes (Velazquez-Lucio et al. 2018, 452). Thus, it is of great significance to have plenty of water during the manufacturing and processing processes. Besides its commitment to the manufacturing and processing sector, Coates Chemicals has put more effort into the organization’s sustainable development. Thus, this organization is accountable for its actions to its varied shareholders, like consumers and suppliers.As part of the company’s aims to serve their consumers the right package of end products from the various sectors under Coates Chemicals, the organization aims to achieve the following objectives by 2025. First, Coates Chemicals is
determined to reduce energy and water consumption by 20%. The reduction of water consumption can be achieved through heat exchange network optimization. This process can be achieved by reducing the water footprint by decreasing energy consumption. Secondly, Coates Chemicals aims to reduce the emission of carbon IV oxide from its processing sites by 20%. Recycling it can reduce the reduction (İnan and Özçimen 2019, 133). Thirdly, the organization aims to achieve zero waste in landfills.Recycling wastes will help avoid the accumulation of waste products in open lands. Besides, recycling will help the organization cut down some production and manufacturing costs because some of the materials required for manufacturing ethanol will be readily available. Fourthly, the organization aims to create a conducive environment among its workers and contractors. Lastly,
(Velazquez-Lucio et al. 421). First, the organization acquired tanks to store bulky glucose solutions that will run the manufacture of ethanol for five days. The plant will have four continuous fermentation reactors that will carry their operations parallel. Finally, the plant will have a distillation column that will help produce a distillate of ethanol under different processes like purification.In conclusion, Coates Chemicals successfully processed ethanol with all the expertise and resources made ready. The feasibility study carried out by the company’s experts paved the way for a better start to the process. Coates Chemicals’ objectives were considered measurable and achievable if much effort was put into the new venture.
IntroductionThe multimedia developers are mainly concerned about the sample resolution and quantization when scanning a full-color photograph in digital processing. Digital processing digitalize images both spatially and in amplitude. The analog video signal is sampled and quantized by the digitizer. Continuous data is converted to digital form using sampling resolution and quantization. The spatial resolution of a digitized image is affected by the sampling rate, whereas the amount of grey levels in a digital snapshot is controlled by the quantization level. During processing an image, the size of a sampled image is presented as a digital value (Torii, 2018).Quantization LevelsThe quantization levels of the image should be high enough for people to detect small shade variations. When an image is quantized with insufficient brightness levels, incorrect outlines are
the primary problem. The authors discuss color picture quantization algorithms that are adjustable and tapered. The goal of the research is to show high-quality color reproductions with small frame buffers. According to the research, various color images that normally need a frame buffer with 15 bits for every pixel could be quantized to 10 or fewer bits with little subjective deterioration. The images produced are usually superior to those created using uniform quantization (Torii, 2018).The Task of Color Picture Quantization is divided into Four Stages : 1. Obtaining color statistics from the original image 2. Using color statistics to select a color map 3. Mapping original colors in the color map to their closest neighbors 4. Redrawing and quantizing the original image.Sampling and QuantificationIf the camera or sensor’s
output is not already digital, the image is recorded by a sensor (e.g., a camera) and converted using an analog-to-digital converter. The image to be processed first is saved in a computer as a continuous voltage waveform then the computer converts the images into digital form. It converts the continuous image to digital form by digitalizing the coordinate and amplitude values.The digital image gives the response value and spatial position of the image. The analog image represents a continuous signal, while the digital image represents a discrete value. Sampling contributes to a spatial resolution, and quantization gives a gray image resolution (Torii, 2018).In sampling, a line is can from the bottom to the top vertically at certain intervals; on each horizontal line, remove the one-dimensional scanning of gray
map, it is required to raise the sampling frequency at the turning point of the road or river while decreasing the sampling frequency on the straight road. More pixels produce an image of high resolution (Torii, 2018).ConclusionBlack and white image processing, gray image processing, and color image processing are the three types of image processing. Brightness, contrast, and color channel are all essential image properties.Final output of the images.
The school-to-prison pipeline is a phenomenon, which implies that expelling students can push them to face the criminal justice system. Cruel tactics of punishments resulting in suspension and the presence of police at schools contribute to this process. For example, in 2017, according to the Office of Juvenile Justice and Delinquency Prevention in the U.S. Department of Justice, “more than 230,000 children aged 14 and under were arrested” (Meek & Austin, 2019, para. 7). This situation is especially meaningful to children with learning disabilities and people of color. The pipeline is a critical phenomenon, which requires close attention as more and more people are influenced by this irrational situation, and ways for stopping or slowing it need to be found.The current school policy is one of the main
reasons for the pipeline existence, as even minor violations of school rules are criminalized today. This strategy has received the name of “zero-tolerance,” implying that a person receives a severe punishment despite the circumstances (American Civil Liberties Union, 2020, para. 6). The youth faces the justice system in situations that should typically be handled at schools, for example, students may be expelled for bringing nail clippers (ACLU, 2020). The main cause of this phenomenon is the system of punishments, which allows student suspension. According to Letitia Basford, the associate professor at the Hamlin University, “when students are expelled <…>, they miss vital classroom time, fall far behind, and are more likely to drop out” (as cited in Kopas, 2020, para. 6). The research showed that when schools provide
children with a friendly atmosphere, contemporary techniques, and flexible programs, they prevent the pipeline occurrence (Kopas, 2020). Keeping students informed about the existence of such a phenomenon and discussing it in classrooms also helps to fight the situation.One of the most critical issues is concerns with children having learning disabilities, as they face the situation more often than healthy students. Most of their medical problems are untreated, thus, leading to disengagement. The suspension is the most dangerous practice in such cases, as children are released from the education facility, and their parents usually cannot be at home with them, either. It is obvious that this situation “hits the hardest: kids with cognitive impairments, kids in child protection, and Aboriginal kids” (Hopkins, 2019, para. 6). On this basis, the
result of them facing the criminal justice system seems logical.One of the most serious problems the pipeline arises is racial disparities. The disproportionality in expels from school resembles the known imprisonment rates. For example, data from 2014 indicates that “black children made up 33 percent of all children suspended, while <…> black adults make up 33 percent of the total prison population” (Meek & Austin, 2019, para. 12). Researchers have found that schools with more black students have higher suspension rates (Nelson & Lind, 2015). It is estimated that when dealing with identical behaviors, teachers rate black children as more difficult and choose more severe punishments for them. The problem of racial discrimination is a serious issue as it exists despite all the efforts of fighting it.An important
Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde and Frankenstein are distinguishing works related to science and indeed, they have several things in common in terms of how the authors used science (Shelley; Stevenson). Creating pure evil from a monster made by a decomposing body, apparently, two scientists did not know how science would turn into a “horrifying” experience. This essay examines the works of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde and Frankenstein in providing messages about science and integrity, claiming that science is used as a tool for violence.To begin with, the majority of the scientists that launched research did not see the studies completed as the comparison between the two scientists suggested. Dr. Jekyll, for example, finds Frankenstein’s numerous scientific experiments and observations fascinating despite his abandonment. Notably, both scientists’
initial reactions to creation are quite clear and obviously different. Another message that Frankenstein’s abandoning of a scientific experiment sends is that the domains of science and integrity have distinct demarcations and bounds. For example, Frankenstein says, “My dreams were therefore undisturbed by reality; and I entered with the greatest diligence into the search of the philosopher’s stone and the elixir of life.” (Shelley, 65). A “supernatural creature can only comprehend certain intrinsic concerns,” and competing with such powers will be terrifying in and of itself. After giving life to the “monster” Frankenstein made, a horrible creature, the phrase is valid.There are selfish motivations regarding the scientific experience in both works. By the manner he exhibits his adoration and wonder of his new scientific discovery, Henry Jekyll, unlike
Frankenstein, is motivated by a sense of power and overpowering depravity. He isn’t completely honest about his desire to make a human being to disprove other biblical claims. The way the two scientists approach their research reveals a lot about their personalities.While both Jekyll and Hyde are enthused about their scientific research, Frankenstein decides to abandon his project, calling it a bad idea. In Jekyll and Hyde, it says, ““Utterson, I swear to God,” cried the doctor, “I swear to God I will never set eyes on him again. I bind my honor to you that I am done with him in this world. It is all at an end.”, showing the acknowledgment of his actions (Stevenson, 123). The other two scientists (Jekyll and Hyde) are shown as
self-centered and egotistical, but Frankenstein is regarded as a man of integrity who is true to his ideals and objectives. Frankenstein is also more sorry for starting the experiment.What is clear is the doctors’ lack of accountability for their carelessness resulted in innocent people’s deaths. Both Frankenstein and Dr. Jekyll exhibit this lack of integrity by not telling the truth about the scope of their experiments and by obliterating the majority of the evidence of their respective scientific achievements. Some of the scientific experiments carried out by both Dr. Jekyll and Frankenstein are characterized by illogic and sheer evil. In the end, both scientists had to acknowledge that, despite their scientific knowledge and self-importance, they could not overcome some of life’s strange and incomprehensible conditions, such as creation.The
experiments help understand the scientific ideas and arguments prevalent in the nineteenth century. Frankenstein is forced to abandon his scientific studies on creation after realizing that he is breaking some laws of the cosmos and experimenting with the unknown. This lack of integrity is exemplified by the fact that both scientists overlook human nature in favor of conducting destructive and forceful experiments that rule their consciences. The thought of creating a superior creature engulfs their brains, and they act without thinking about the consequences of their actions.Every scientific investigation is, in essence, governed by extensive rules of ethics that are predicated on specific levels of integrity which was not followed in both works. All research scientists must follow these ethical guidelines as a condition of employment. Most of
the ethical rules and integrity that govern scientific study are broken by Frankenstein and Dr. Jekyll. Any breach of such integrity will have an impact on the results of the tests and the very spirit of research. When the two scientists fake evidence in order to get the desired result, their integrity is shattered. Instead of focusing on real and viable scientific discoveries, both Frankenstein and Dr. Jekyll solely attempt to gratify personal desires and ego. The two scientists went beyond the ethical limitations of human scientific investigations in their missions to regulate human behavior and discover the secret of creation and life.The effects are terrible, as evidenced by the two academics’ “questionable study,” revealing the horrifying nature of the science used. The two scientists, Frankenstein and Dr.
The scientific method allows scientists to study various phenomena by testing their assumptions built from observations of the surrounding world. As a result of exploring and attempting to explain the world, a scientific method process used by researchers was formed. It includes such steps as exploration through observation and questioning and testing hypotheses and predictions and their verification through experiments or additional observations. Despite the benefit and clarity of the scientific method, readers should still critically evaluate the information presented in articles.Scientific articles often address current problems of concern to society. For instance, an article serving as a secondary source and presented in The Economist describes a study testing measures for HIV prevention among young African women (G.C.). The original study was published by Baird et al. in
it is worth noting that it has many advantages that testify to its reliability. In particular, its authors have Ph.D. degrees; the study was conducted under the auspices of The World Bank and published in a peer-reviewed journal (Baird et al. 1320). The authors acknowledge that the article has some limitations, and further research is needed to clarify the findings. However, their experiment has shown results and could be a critical step in reducing the prevalence of the disease.
The 1972 German massacre during the Olympic Games in Munich was shocking for the entire world. Although terrorism was already a renowned international threat in the 1970s, security during this event was not strong enough to prevent the invasion of the Olympic village by the Palestinian extremists (Hirsch, 2020). According to Spindlove and Simonsen (2018), on “September 5, 1972, eight members of the Palestinian Black September terrorist group entered the village” and “managed to secure … nine Israeli hostages” (p. 160). They demanded to release more than 200 Palestinian inmates from Israel’s prisons in exchange for the athletes, who would be killed if their request was not fulfilled (Spindlove & Simonsen, 2018). The leaders of the two affected countries decided not to accept extremists’ terms. Thus, the German
military group opened fire on terrorists and their hostages, which resulted in the death of all of them (Spindlove & Simonsen, 2018). This accident strengthened Germany’s anti-terrorist agencies, while Israel responded with the Operation Wrath of God.Germany had to implement additional regulations that could control immigrating Arabs and their organizations within the country to prevent similar tragic accidents in the future. The main reason why terrorists were able to invade the village was that the Games had weak security that was unarmed (History, 2021). Moreover, theories suggest that Palestinian extremists received assistance from the administration of the Olympic Games, but this information was never confirmed (Reeve, 2018). Germany established a GSG-9 agency, which became an elite anti-terror unit (Spindlove & Simonsen, 2018). Its principal function is to defeat
terrorism and rescue hostages in case of an extremists attack (Reeve, 2018). Furthermore, the government was involved in a series of official meetings with the Palestinian Liberation Organization and the leaders of the Arab world to prevent similar attacks through cooperation (Hirsch, 2020). This situation was humiliating not only for the German government but also for the entire civilized community; hence, this issue and the importance of counterterrorism were taken to the international arena.Israel’s response can be considered brutal because it involved chasing and killing the responsible parties, naming the operation with the emotive but relatively pretentious title “Wrath of God.” Israel’s Prime Minister claimed they refused to negotiate with the terrorists because “no Israeli anywhere in the world can feel that his life is safe” (History, 2021).
2018). Undoubtedly, this event was a horrendous incident for the Israeli people and the global community.In summary, the tragic accident that happened at the 1972 Olympic Games in Germany showed the existing security problems in the country. Since Palestinian terrorists targeted Israeli athletes, who died during the rescue operation, the government of Israel responded with their readiness to destroy the involved individuals and groups. Germany also strengthened its counterterrorist actions by creating a special agency to fight extremism in the country. Overall, it appears that the Munich tragedy became the premise for the increased awareness about extremists internationally and coordinated counterterrorism work in the affected countries.
SummaryAnthrax, a serious breathing illness, is forcing air currents out of Midwesterners, sending dozens of people to the doctors’ offices. The victims are wheezing and gasping for breath and more people are being infected. Researchers begin the investigation by speaking with Zeke, who was the first victim to learn what he used to be before becoming ill. Zeke stated that he began wheezing and feeling super tired shortly after leading a soundtrack training course for 50 participants at a Chicago music venue. He suspected he had caught the illness from one of the learners in the classroom or that he had managed to catch it on a return flight from Africa two days before. The agent that is responsible for the outbreak is highly probable to have been
released at the music festival.Agent Responsible for the Breathless Outbreak in the MidwestAnthrax is a dangerous disease caused by the bacterial Bacillus anthracis. Anthrax is not spreadable. Individuals cannot catch it from some other individual in the same way that one can catch a bad cold. Anthrax can be commonly found in soil normally and can infect domestic and wild animals such as livestock, sheep, and goats (Figueiredo, 2019). When living things consume spores (bacteria) from polluted soil, they are often ill. People can become infected with Anthrax by managing diseased animal protein or inhaling anthrax spores from animal foods. People can also become infected with Anthrax by eating raw meat from infected animals or being subjected to pathogens by bioterrorists.Overview of the ConditionThe outbreak took place at
different locations in the United States; Chicago, Wisconsin, Illinois, and Milwaukee. A total number of fifteen individuals were infected, and emergency centers reported fifteen hospitalizations (CDC, 2022). In addition to that, there were seven reported deaths of the outbreak victims. These people have frequented emergency departments in the last two days with complaints of mild fever, tiredness, chest tightness, heart palpitations, and breathing difficulties. Numerous deaths have already occurred, and more people are on the brink of death.Current Condition of Breathless in the U.SThe situation in the United States is getting worse every day. There has been an unexpectedly high number of kids with coughs, colds, and breathing difficulties this season (Denny et al., 2018). This is according to Rachel Wolfson, an acute inpatient general practitioner who treats
sick people at the University of Chicago’s Comer Children’s Infirmary, in which the eleven Illinois reports were recognized (CDC, 2022). Wolfson explains that some of the children in her care required only nasal spray remedies, while others were significantly more ill (CDC, 2022). The lungs of one patient were in a such horrible condition that medics had to attach them to a blood oxygen generator.Epidemiologic TriangleIn this part of the work, the principle of disease transition between the agent, host, and environment, also called the epidemiological triangle, is revealed. Anthrax is a deadly contagious disease caused by Bacillus anthracis, a gram-positive, rod-shaped pathogen. It is found naturally in the soil and frequently harms both animals and food worldwide. Fungal spores of the disease can survive in the ground
or meat feed, such as dehydrated or filtered animal skin and shearling for centuries. Spores can also stay alive in water for at least two years, dairy milk for a decade, and silk fibers for up to seventy-one years.Anthrax can make individuals sick if they come into the consumption of contaminated food or infected animal protein. Jungle or domestic livestock, such as sheep, livestock, ponies, and heifers, are prevalent hosts for Anthrax, as defensive antigens from anthrax toxin hijack receptor molecules. Bacillus anthracis, a spore-forming bacterial infection that can sustain in harsh environments for long periods, causes Anthrax. When the pathogen enters a host immune system of a mammal, the spores germinate, rapidly distributing pathogens to the blood system.Initiatives that Community Health Nurses Can Undertake to Prevent Re-OccurrencePatients
reported. Additionally, a discussion with an infectious diseases specialist might be justified, though diagnosing patients with Anthrax is relatively simple. Individuals can lower their risk of Anthrax infection by being immunized. The BioThrax vaccine is the only FDA-approved anthrax vaccination. It is a five-dose vaccine sequence managed over an extended time when used as a preventive action. Products suspected of possessing biological agents are subject to special surveillance by or government.
Recently the self-driving technologies have been significantly developed by the researchers. Many companies consider self-driving vehicles as the future of supply chain management growth. Generally, self-operating technologies can minimize the expenditures on supplying the goods. Such technologies provide more fast delivery opportunities. Due to the large-scale implementation of such technologies, the whole transportation system will be changed. Despite the positive aspects of these innovations, self-driving vehicles have particular ethical considerations.Self-driving technologies can significantly improve the development of the transportation industry. The global supply data storage can be efficiently evolved into artificial-intelligence-based vehicles. As a result, the trucking industry and supply management will be more efficient and practically oriented. Thanks to these technologies, many expenditures for transportation will be reduced. It will be achieved by eliminating the driver profession
believe that the automatization of supply chain management will contribute to the more profound partnership between companies (Kota, 2018). The expanded opportunities for cooperation will enhance cooperation through the quicker deliveries.The most dangerous adverse effect of self-driving technologies is global job loss. This is a significant ethically and socially vital issue that should be addressed before implementing technologies. Today the driver is one of the most widely spread and quickly gained professions. People worldwide work in the transportation industries to ensure the efficient delivery of products. However, when self-driven technologies are involved, all these people will lose their jobs. It is essential to develop special training programs for drivers to change their specialty.
Thich Quang Duc committed self-immolation on the streets of Saigon on June 11, 1963, and it changed the course of history. Today, the photograph of Thich Quang Duc’s death, The Burning Monk, has become a universal symbol of rebellion and the fight against injustice. His death was reduced to a symbol, but it was much more than that (Sinzelle, 22). It was an act of defiance against a corrupt government that had killed its citizens. It sparked a revolution, overthrew the regime, and may even have caused the Americans to enter the Vietnam War. However, the monk himself most likely did not die for revolutionary ideas. His self-immolation was an act of rejection of the system and the inability to deal with injustice.Tunisian street vendor Mohammed Bouazizi set
which also led to mass protests.Most of the self-immolations did not impact the current situation; however, some of them played an important role in the political events in the country in which they took place. The actions of both men can hardly be called a specific call for revolution. Both cases can be compared, considering them as an extreme measure of disagreement with injustice. It seems that the men have no other means left for the official authorities to hear them. In one way or another, both events significantly influenced the course of history.
Service marketing is usually defined as a promotion of an intangible good or a service to a particular segment of the audience. It is distinguished from product marketing by such features as Inseparability, Heterogeneity, Intangibility, and Perishability. This paper will focus on the last characteristic, perishability, which implies the impossibility of any storage or repeated use of the service. In case the service is not used, it is most likely to be lost forever (Hole et al., 2018). Examples of such can be a concert or a sports event. Sometimes they can be canceled either by a performing party or by a consumer. In this case, the service does not take place at all. Perishability also underlines a limited time of their use, which is usually specified. For
Various forms of harassment are a widespread problem in schools. The behavioral patterns and perspectives during adolescence often have a considerable influence on the worldview in adulthood. Adolescents who are predisposed to verbal and physical brutality have an increased chance to maintain destructive tendencies in the future (Bondestam & Lundqvist, 2020). The teaching staff and school administration should monitor all manifestations of bullying, including sexual ones, to further investigate and eliminate the negative consequences for both sides of the conflict.An article by Neil Duncan describes the experiences of sexual bullying of girls by boys. Research shows that this is a common concern that often tends to go unresolved. The negative consequences of such an unwholesome environment between students include distraction from the educational process, the development of insecurity,
It should be noted that drivers should not be allowed to use handheld devices when their vehicle is stopped at a red light. The driving process is highly demanding of one’s attention, which means that any form of distraction is a risk factor. Handheld devices are distractive, and thus, drivers lose sight and focus of the road and signals of movement. Therefore, handheld devices should be banned for drivers at all times because stopping at red lights also requires drivers’ attention.The red light signal is a critical element of road safety and efficient movement, especially at intersections. The State of Georgia implemented an act, which “makes it illegal for drivers to “physically hold or support, with any part of his or her body,” a wireless telecommunications device” (Dyke
react to light changes from red signal to green one. This will cause unnecessary delays in the movement of traffic.In conclusion, on the basis of evidence provided above, drivers should not be allowed to use their handheld devices during the red light signal since attention on the road is required even during the stop. The delayed response time might cause unnecessary traffic and congestion. These factors increase the risk of accidents because not all drivers will be responding to changes in light signals at the same time.
terrified of being arrested, detained, or imprisoned if they seek prenatal care or drug treatment. Furthermore, criminalizing a woman’s behavior during pregnancy breaches her fundamental rights, particularly her right to privacy and equal protection under the law (Carroll et al., 2021). It claims that it infringes on a woman’s freedom to procreate and bodily integrity. It penalizes women who want to go on with their pregnancy and encourages them to avoid criminal punishment to terminate their pregnancy. As a result, it is essential to note that specific regulations may favor abortion (Carroll et al., 2021). Furthermore, it discriminates against women in general since it does not penalize dads who engage in behavior that may harm an unborn child.
Slavery has been one of the most problematic aspects of the history of humankind. Slavery developed as European trading and marine settlements which required additional labor in the American colonies (Harris, 2018). Settlers comprised enslaved people from Native Americans and forcibly brought Africans, using slave labor in every part of the economy, from sugar production to harvesting and exploration of raw materials (Harris, 2018). The practice of slavery in British North America can be characterized by how colonists regarded enslaved people.As slavery gradually spread across America, each area had distinctions. For instance, Jamestown in Virginia became the first permanent British settlement through which enslaved Africans were brought to North America (Harris, 2018). Similar to Jamestown, other port cities practiced slavery primarily by connecting the international slave trade with
rural and urban slave markets (Harris, 2018). Slavery practices were perceived to extend in Boston, which is believed to be the first place where someone tried to force enslaved people to have children to earn money (Harris, 2018). Later, Massachusetts enacted the first law of slavery in British North America (Harris, 2018). While the practice of slavery was developing throughout America, the labor roles did not vary much (Harris, 2018). Colonists used enslaved people as domestic labor or to farm and produce trade goods (Harris, 2018). Colonial regions captured people to force them to work, but slavery practices seem to differ depending on how settlers viewed enslaved people, whether for trade, profit, or as legitimized property.Although slavery used to be a significant source of labor in colonial America,
I will examine the symptoms and potential causes for the lung cancer disease further in this assignment.Lung cancer is one of the most frequent types of the condition, and with the low recovery rates. Due to the structure and function of lungs, most tumors very quickly become inoperable. Every year, around 40,000 people in the United States are diagnosed with the illness. In the early stages of lung cancer, there are generally no signs or symptoms, although many people with the disease eventually acquire a mix of them. A chronic cough, coughing up blood, dyspnea, inexplicable exhaustion, weight loss, and an ache or pain when inhaling or coughing are all common symptoms of lung cancer.Although those who have never smoked can get lung cancer, smoking is the leading cause. This is due to the fact that smoking includes breathing a variety of hazardous compounds on a regular basis, and thus leads to almost 72% of cases (O’Keeffe et al., 2018). Treatment is determined by the type of mutation in the tumor, the extent of its dissemination, and a general condition of the patient. If the problem is detected early and the malignant cells are contained to a small region, surgery to remove the afflicted lung area may be advised. If surgery is not an option owing to the overall health, radiation to remove malignant cells may be suggested instead. Chemotherapy is frequently used when the cancer has developed too much for surgery or radiation to be helpful.
The construction of social reality is one of the concepts of great interest to modern scientific knowledge. Ultimately, science develops to make the acquired knowledge possible to implement technologically in the process of transformative practice for the benefit of man and nature. In this sense, social reality appears because of the corresponding technological approach, and the technical procedure appears as a social construction of reality (Lancet, 2013). The structure of social reality, both in the meaning of creating a public image and in the definition of technological transformation of the world, reveals the process of constructing a New World Order and its implementation through globalization processes. The main form of social structuring of reality is human activity, represented by material and spiritual productions. The purpose of social construction
one group, for example, a family. Still, at the same time, they can also be a member of a labor collective, public organizations, etc. Being members of many social groups simultaneously, they occupy a corresponding position in each of them due to their relationships with other group members. This is also necessary in order to achieve a certain social role, for example, to get a job. Nevertheless, each person needs an individual approach, which dictates the need to change.
IntroductionThe appearance of material and monetary resources is the starting and initial point of forming a bottomless and wide gap between several people. From now on, the world has split into “two camps,” and individuals are classified not only by physical, personal or mental characteristics but also by the principle of having specific benefits. Today, there are both rich and poor citizens in any country, and sometimes the ratio between them is exceptionally remote. Nevertheless, each person is equal, less or more dependent on each other since they live in a society. Dedication is a vital sign of a spiritually rich, profoundly and broadly thinking person who has not lost human and compassionate qualities.Responding to the IdeasThe main idea and thought of the passage is self-feedback, dedication and
selflessness, regardless of the amount of money and the availability of precious items. According to Andrew Carnegie, any wealth requires sharing and returning to those who need exceptional help and support. Everyone should recognize their qualities for the sake of the whole society. Accordingly, if the rich continue to get prosperous, ignoring the poverty of others, this will lead the entire society to decline, and the rich themselves will also suffer. Indeed, wealthy people should give part of their capital to the impoverished. They are obliged to use their skills and means to fight poverty and help needy people get out of deprivation.Undoubtedly, the achievement of wealth, if it is not inherited, will require a lot of effort and time. However, this does not always bring the desired
Carl Jung identifies the mother complex with an innate feeling of care at the center of the emotional attachment between a mother and a child. However, in the absence of such an attachment, an archetype develops where someone’s mother fails to satisfy the essential demands associated with the relationship. The outcome leads the victim, the child, to seek comfort elsewhere (Bobroff 35). At the core of the mother complex is the mother archetype, meaning that in every emotional attachment, between the child and the mother, on the one hand, an archetype nourishing and security image manifests. On the other hand, an archetype that devours possessiveness, deprivation, and darkness comes out (Bobroff 36). In the film Every Secret Thing , a complex emotional attachment between Alice and her mother
Moreover, the tension in interracial affairs is associated with the second kidnapping and having born a biracial child while in prison, and given it up for adoption, Alice becomes the primary suspect in the case (Berg). Alice’s mother, the mastermind behind the kidnap, in the first and second cases, and murder, in the first case, plants evidence to ensure Alice stands out as the main suspect. Hellen, through betrayal and deception, purposely Alice ends up in prison (Berg). Further, compared to the indifference in Ronnie’s parents, there is no emotional attachment between the parents and their daughters. As the film comes to an end, the audience learns that not only were Alice and Ronnie falsely imprisoned, the justice system failed to prove that Helen is the killer.
Android Studio is developed for Android to accelerate one’s application development. This helps one to build the highest-quality applications for each Android gadget. The following are some of the significant characteristics found in Android Studio for building Android applications. Android Studio, as per the Intellij IDEA, offers the fastest turnaround on an app developer’s coding and operational workflow. Further, its Apply Changes characteristic allows an app developer to change resources and push code to a running app without restarting the app. This flexibility assists one to control how much of the application is restarted when one wants to install and test small, incremental modifications while preserving the gadget’s existing state. It also has a code editor feature that assists one to work faster, write better code, and be
productive by providing improved code completion, code analysis, and refactoring (Horton, 2021). Android Studio will offer recommendations in the dropdown list as one type.Furthermore, the Android Studio has an Android Emulator feature that installs and initiates one’s apps faster than the actual gadget. It also permits one to prototype and test an application on different Android gadgets configurations such as tablets, smartphones, Android wearable, and Android Television gadgets. One may also kindle a range of hardware characteristics like network latency, GPS location, and multi-touch input and motion sensors. At each stage, Android Studio assists Android app developers in ensuring they create the best code through sample apps and code templates. Android Studio also offers a robust static analysis structure and comprises more than 365 different lintelligence checks across
one’s entire app. It also has many quick fixes that assist one to resolve issues in different categories like security, performance, and accuracy. Android Studio offers a range of testing tools and frameworks to help one in testing the app (Horton, 2021). Android Studio also creates a unified environment where an app developer may build apps for Android tablets, wearable devices, Android Auto, and Android Televisions.The Android Studio project building is separated into two files, Java and XML, because these enable one to develop apps using both the two files. The Android app development framework supports one to develop applications using XML and Java. Java and XML files each perform a different role in Android App development. Any app developed, typically has the following behavior, layout, and resources.
The disparities between the opportunities of simple citizens and the residents of the Capitol present the severe issue of social class differences in The Hunger Games. However, the worst thing that happens to people is that they are used for the entertainment of those from the upper class. Overall, Suzanne Collins highlights the social inequity between the residents of the twelve districts of Panem and the wealthier part of society in the Capitol, focusing on the cruelty of the so-called hunger games.To begin with, the story revolves around two characters, Peeta and Katniss, who live in the twelfth district of the Panem and suffer from the Capitol’s cruelty. To be more exact, their neighbors are starving and have to work hard to earn money just to provide for
their families, “District Twelve. Where you can starve to death in safety” (24). Katniss’s family is beyond poor, so she is forced to hunt in illegal territories to get food for her sister and mother. The girl’s family has no conveniences in their house, so they cannot even shower or properly clean their clothes. What is more, the twelve districts are forbidden to interact in any way, so people cannot travel outside of their areas or purchase food, clothes, and other necessities in the different parts of Panem.In contrast, the Capitol is thriving while the people of Panem work hard to survive. As a matter of fact, the upper class does not share any worries about them lacking food, designer clothes, or technology to live their best lives.
On the contrary, almost every resident of the Capitol possesses a fancy car, estate, and everything that people from the twelve districts could not even imagine. The capital is full of mean and two-faced people; they value looks and clothes over personality, “They do surgery in the Capitol to make people appear younger and thinner” (124). Consequently, Collins highlights the primary goal of the Capitol, which is making the lives of Panem worse and making people suffer (38). The twelve districts do not even have an opportunity to obtain decent education because the Capitol cannot afford any rebellion from their side or people that may doubt their authority.However, the leading annual entertainment for the residents of the Capitol is hunger games, which include selecting two representatives from each
Social insurance programs have continuously provided income and health insurance for senior citizens. While social insurance programs may seem ineffective as they cannot have drastic differences in individuals’ lives and cannot provide luxurious lifestyles, they have a significant effect on resisting increases in poverty and inequality rates. According to Greenberg and Page (2018), social security was initially developed to serve as an addition to workplace pensions, even though a substantial number of retirees rely entirely on social security payments. Furthermore, while payroll taxes may seem unfair, the continuous flow of funding provides an outlook on a stable future with a low level of poverty in the country. On the other hand, Medicare’s initial goal was to provide health care to senior citizens who have no funds for treatment
affect social insurance programs as political and economic determine the longevity of social security programs. Social insurance involves the moral component of governmental administration and therefore depends on the government’s core values. The politics determine the working conditions, retirement age, and payroll tax rates in favor of prevailing economic conditions. Therefore, negative trends in the economy or governmental shifts that include changes in the administration’s core values can negatively influence social insurance programs.
Social media platforms have complicated algorithms which propose information or advertising according to the users’ interests. For instance, the work of those algorithms can be easily seen in TikTok by watching an interesting video. The app can categorize the topics and propose similar videos to maintain the attention of the user. To prove this theory, I started to watch many videos about ice-skating. Consequently, every third video on ticktock was related to this specific topic. When I scroll down ice-skating videos without watching them, they start to appear rarely in my TikTok field. The same algorithm works when I start skipping interesting videos and watching something I did. It becomes difficult to return videos that I like as the algorithm follows all my actions.Instagram and YouTube have the
can appear in the social media field. On the one hand, this technology might be helpful as people can see different information according to their interests. Moreover, advertisements might not be disruptive and sometimes propose needed products. However, as long as phones and other gadgets might hear what people are talking about and send this information to the artificial intelligence which produces algorithms, it might be scary for some people, and the trust level might decrease.
Black Lives Matter is one of the significant social movements affecting the human understanding of race. It is committed to eradicating systemic racism in America. This phenomenon includes, for example, racial prejudice among police officers and judicial injustice against black people. Black Lives Matter involves different branches in more than ten American states. A movement arose after the senseless murder of African American teenager. A year later, a court consisting of five white people and only one black woman acquitted the police officer. The court’s decision caused massive protests from the African American population.The Black Lives Matter movement is not about individual flaws but the perceived general injustice of the American system, capitalism, and white people’s supremacy. Black Lives Matter and its leaders were definitely part of the
American tradition. Their values ​​and beliefs can be traced back to the history of democracy and individual rights founders. The current COVID-19 situation aggravated the Black Lives Matter conflict. In the United States, pandemic-related racial divisions have also exacerbated the general problem. Thirty percent of all infected in the country are people with black skin color (while the black population in the United States is approximately twelve percent).The Black Lives Matter movement can be described through the relative deprivation theory. According to Ferris and Stein (2020), this theory explains the action of the deprived or oppressed group of people trying to protect their rights. Compared to other groups, black people have been exposed to oppression from the government and society. This social movement is concerned with equalizing the
rights of black and white people. Black Lives Matter has contributed to a significant change in the world. Black people try to satisfy their moral and physical needs, which they are deprived of as members of society.This movement is widely spread worldwide, questioning the current society’s order. People from different countries started to comprehend the scale of the racial problem in America. This movement provoked the discussion about the deprivation of black, empowering people to be tolerant of differences. Thanks to the Black Lives Matter movement, society advanced to a new level of moral development. The necessity of promoting racial and cultural acceptance was highlighted. However, the next step in striving for equality should be governments. The intensity of the protest will not lead America and any other
self-defense reaction. If white people admit that people with black skin are equal to them, they will find themselves in a tub of unequal in the global world. To solve these inequality issues, superior peoples should be ready to share wealth, mobility, or social capital with the deprived. Some people believe that racial inequality cannot be eliminated entirely because of human nature striving for supremacy over others achieved through comparison. Therefore, the problem of social inequality exists in all countries and must be fought further.
First, I argue that social movements do not simply use disruptive behaviors at times but are naturally disruptive. Social movements usually emerge when the existing institutions — elections, political parties, and government agencies — are unable or unwilling to solve evident issues. As such, social movements serve as an instrument of direct democracy that articulates certain positions and conveys them to authorities. By doing that, social movements disrupt an ideal model of liberal democracy, in which citizens vote for the candidates, who, in turn, represent them in governing bodies.Therefore, the disruptive nature of social movements allows marginalized and underrepresented social groups to speak and be heard. Moreover, this notion is valid for all sides of the political spectrum, which makes social movements valuable to the democratic political system.
political pluralism.Secondly, it is necessary to separate the disruptive nature of social movements from specific disruptive tactics that they utilize to promote their agenda. For example, both followers of the Civil Rights Movement and Black Lives Matter (BLM) used disruptive methods in the fight against racism. The difference between them lies in the message — whereas Civil Rights Movement actively sought to attract people from the outside, BLM struggled with the message of inclusion (Clayton, 2018). In the end, Dr. Martin Luther King’s rallying cry “We Shall Overcome” attracted many non-Black sympathizers, so BLM would arguably benefit from a more inclusive approach.
One way in which sociology can make a valuable contribution to the understanding of the interrelation between race and health disparities is by coining a working definition of race that emphasizes its relevant aspects. Even today, when the idea of the social construction of race has long gained traction, the concept of race is often affected by the notions of physical anthropology and genetic inheritance. A proper sociological approach to the issue of race as related to health disparities may alleviate it by focusing on the stratifying principles of race, such as socioeconomic disadvantages and discrimination (Hummer, 1996). This approach will allow concentrating on the socioeconomic factors most relevant as social determinants of health and, by doing so, enable a better understanding of causal relations.Another and more specific
what can be done in this regard in the study of the interrelation between residential segregation and fast food density. His approach involves analyzing the population, economic, physical, and social characteristics of a neighborhood to identify why fast food outlets are built at a proportionally larger scale in segregated black neighborhoods (Kwate, 2008). By doing so, Kwate (2008) shift attention from the simplistic explanations and assumptions that can steer the discussion of the problem in a wrong direction – such as the presumption that blacks like fast foods more. Thus, as in the case above, the sociological approach allows focusing on the actual structural factors behind the interrelation between race and health disparities.
Software piracy passes as any act resulting in stealing legally protected software. The act’s impact on the individual and society increases productivity risks through security holes that cause users to experience glitches and bugs. The outcome of the experience is frustrations, lost times, and lost work (Parson, n.d.). Two, the absence of warranties with the pirated software means they are exposed to increased security risks with the software containing viruses and associated malware that affect computers (Parson, n.d.). Third, the individual or society is exposed to legal risks associated with pirated software when caught using it. Piracy results in economic risks that take away legitimate software sales to the software company. Law-abiding companies are forced to illegally share their work with others (Parson, n.d.). Further, with other companies
from accessed non-Pay-TV and Pay-TV consumers was projected to be more than $67 billion by the end of 2023 (Stout, 2021). To counter this form of piracy, among the most effective ways is removing incentives for users to look for pirated content. The other anti-piracy solutions are PR and education, where piracy is highlighted as a crime, and legal and enforcement, where countermeasures are implemented to remove and interrupt pirated content (Stout, 2021). By mention, the other anti-piracy measures are cooperation, technology and operations, and barrier to entry.
Income segregation and development prioritization are forms of social inequality that perpetuate poverty worldwide. On the macro-scale, the poverty redress policies emphasize the importance of economic growth while the issue of social inequality remains in the background (Basu & Subramanian, 2020). A wider emphasis on growth further deepens the income gap since the people in the bottom 20% of the per-capita income spectrum do not necessarily benefit from the overall development (Basu & Subramanian, 2020). Thus, the policymaker’s hesitation in concentrating on the equal distribution of mean income remains the ultimate macro-cause of poverty.On the micro-scale, there is an issue with ambiguous data on the poorest population due to no fixed income source, with money coming from multiple information sources that are difficult to document (Basu & Subramanian,
2020). The documentation complexity then undermines the availability of financial help. Furthermore, inequality in school environments contributes to socioeconomic achievement gaps, resulting in income segregation (Bischoff & Owens, 2019). Overall, the lack of socioeconomically integrated settings contributes to diminishing low-income students’ achievements, while the lack of proper documentation contributes to the challenge of acknowledging the scope of the problem.Institutional discrimination is manifested through different systemic treatment of people in education, business, and politics. Social inequality is commonly rooted in an exclusionary institutional approach to education distribution (Teng, 2019). Education distribution, in turn, can be exacerbated by systemic income segregation through varying education funding (Bischoff & Owens, 2019). Furthermore, the institutions tend to select and promote people whose values align with the institution’s role in maintaining the group hierarchy
(Huet, Gargiulo & Pratto, 2020). Generally, institutional discrimination tends to be self-perpetuating and persistent, resulting in social inequality in the short and long terms.Beyond systematic discrimination, however, individual characteristics may also drive larger social inequality patterns. For instance, Huet et al. (2020) discuss how gender differences in self-esteem can create a male-dominant social hierarchy. As Bischoff and Owens (2019) point out, self-worth influences future employment success, further propagating the differences. Furthermore, if one assumes that each individual has resources partly derived from their support network, then people with greater resources may better advocate for their interests than the underprivileged population (Bischoff & Owens, 2019). Overall, the degree of individual well-being, sense of worth, and social resources create social inequality.Historic solutions to social inequality problems have commonly attempted to
most historic solutions aimed to address the situation postfactum rather than preventatively, which has been their major limitation.Preventative solutions, while not evident immediately, are often the most efficient long-term answer, which is the case for social inequality. Khosla (2017) recounts that knowledge and skills diffusion between and within countries always reduces economic and social inequalities. Nations must develop and incorporate a socially conscious movement, which would integrate education with the needs of society (Khosla, 2017). Properly distributed education, being the greatest equalizing force, can produce a workforce whose actions will benefit society in the long run (Khosla, 2017). Thus, incorporating an individual-focused approach in education may provide a long-term solution for social inequality by transforming human attitudes.
In 2014, Sony Pictures Entertainment faced a cyber attack from North Korea prior to the release of The Interview, a film that discusses the personality of North Korea’s dictator, Kim Jong Un. In addition to the cyberattack that caused millions of losses for the company, Sony also faced a threat from the terrorists that several theaters that will show the film will be attacked. Sony’s response to the threats included canceling the film’s release and switching to video-on-demand outlets. Some suggested that canceling the film’s release creates a dangerous precedent of a large company submitting to terrorist orders. However, while the company’s solution partially allowed them to disobey the terrorists’ order, it also displayed how terrorists’ plans can be prevented through technological development.In my opinion, Sony’s response was
appropriate for the situation, as it could be acknowledged as the use of the opponent’s weapon against him. Therefore, while the terrorists used cyberattacks to steal the company’s information and destroy their equipment, Sony switched the release to on-demand platforms and streaming services, allowing a speedy and widespread release of the film. As on-demand videos are easier to pirate, the film’s pirate copies quickly spread across the internet, making film easier to access and more discussed across different countries and segments of the population. In addition, the film’s plot turned out to be more appealing to comedy than satire, influencing the public’s opinion about the earlier threats from North Korea. In my opinion, Sony’s response to the attack was appropriate for the situation and politicly addressed several concerns.Furthermore,
while the case is complicated by presenting a real terrorist threat to the population, there are certain things that Sony and the U.S. government could have done differently to discourage future such attacks on other U.S. organizations. Firstly, Sony never publicly acknowledged that The Interview is a satire that has no connection with reality and does not threaten North Korea’s political regime. Instead, it seemed that the company used unexpected publicity to market a relatively insignificant comedy film. Therefore, by initially canceling the film’s release date, the company set a negative precedent of a major company submitting to terrorist demands.Next, considering the government’s role in Sony’s case, the issue should have raised attention to the cyber security problem in both governmental structures and large business corporations. Instead of
always the right choice. Furthermore, preventing both real-world terrorist violence and cyberattacks requires a collective effort of the U.S. government and business organizations. The possible measures include regulation of governmental and private organizations’ cyber security to achieve higher data protection standards. Through collective efforts and sufficient budgeting, organizations can develop more advanced cyber security and supervision systems and implement them in a short period of time, preventing future real-world terrorist violence and cyberattacks.
Clark, Nancy L. “Gendering production in wartime South Africa.” The American Historical Review 106, no. 4 (2001): 1181-1213.Clark’s topic is the impact of World War II on the independence of South Africa. The thesis is that historians are limited in their understanding of the relationship between the Second World War and African independence. The methodology is the analysis of historic documents describing the period of World War II. This is a paper on history with a substantial addition of women’s studies. The author relies on statements, memorandums, and other papers to show factual information. The main point of the author is that South Africa’s history during and immediately after World War II is underresearched. The author’s goal is to show the uniqueness of South Africa’s economic and political
development among African countries. There is a definite bias against political forces that instituted apartheid.The article is noteworthy for its attention to details found in old documents. Clark herself acknowledges the limitation that little research exists that supports her viewpoint. Nevertheless, the article is helpful in that it showcases the ambiguity of South Africa’s social trends as opposed to The Impact of World War II and Mwanikii’s article, which are notably one-sided. The article will help answer the research question by accentuating the uniqueness of South Africa’s post war years in comparison to other African nations.Grundlingh, Albert. “The King’s Afrikaners? Enlistment and ethnic identity in the Union of South Africa’s Defence Force during the Second World War, 1939–45.” The Journal of African History 40, no. 3 (1999): 351-365.Grundlingh’s
topic is the role of South Africa in World War II. His thesis is that South Africa’s historiography does not properly describe the country’s efforts during the war. Grundlingh’s work is a paper on history, with a definite military focus. The author analyzes previous historic books, articles, and military reports. The main idea of the text is that Afrikaners who joined the Allied effort during World War II had a significant impact on Afrikaner ethnicity. Grundlingh’s goal is to dispel the public misconception that South Africa did not participate in the Second World War due to nationalistic opposition. Some prejudice against Western historians can be observed in Grundlingh’s description of current assumptions about South Africa in the early forties.The paper’s strength is the abundance of evidence of Afrikaners’
participation in military effort. The article’s weakness is that the author does not propose any other way of confirming his hypothesis other than accepting his interpretation. The article is helpful because it showcases military efforts of Afrikaners, which are not covered by any other sources. The article’s detailed description of South Africa’s military participation in World War II will provide invaluable insight for answering the research question.Smith, Jean P. “Race and hospitality: Allied troops of colour on the South African home front during the Second World War.” War & Society 39, no. 3 (2020): 155-170.Smith’s topic is the importance of South Africa during World War II as a transport hub for Allies. The thesis is that South Africa served as an important node for training and transportation, which
contributed significantly to the military effort. The article is a work on history, with some insight from social science. Smith uses evidence from memoirs, governments’ reports, and books depicting South Africa during World War II. The main idea of the article is that South Africa’s hospitality of the Allies’ forces indicated substantial complexity regarding racial segregation in the country. The goal of the paper is to identify social nuances, which became particularly noteworthy while South Africa hosted the Allies’ military forces. It can be argued that the author is biased by the modern understanding of racial issues.The paper’s strength is the relatively new perspective on the relationship between Afrikaners and Allied military. The paper’s weak point is that the author assumes the positive nature of the relationship by
labeling it as hospitality, which was likely more nuanced. The article further continues Clark’s and Grundlingh’s trend of highlighting South Africa’s role in World War II, which directly relates to the research question.Teer-Tomaselli, Ruth. “In service of empire: The South African broadcasting corporation during World War II.” Critical Arts 28, no. 6 (2014): 879-904.Teer-Tomaselli’s topic is the changes in the mass media rhetoric during World War II in South Africa. The author’s thesis is that World War II changed the messages conveyed my mass media, which would eventually lead to social, economic, and political transformation if South Africa. The methodology used by the author is comprised of the analysis of news companies’ reports and Debates of the House of the Assembly. The paper is primarily a study of
mass media in the context of World War II. The main idea that Teer-Tomaselli promotes is that news coverage of World War II brought about changes in public perception, which would eventually lead to the demise of British rule in South Africa.The author’s intent is to showcase the power of mass media in tipping the narrative. No clear biases are evident as Teer-Tomaselli outlays facts with little personal opinion. The text’s strength is its reliance on state documents to prove the author’s point. The paper’s disadvantage is that no real interpretation of qualitative is given. This piece is valuable because it is the only source that addresses the role of mass media. Understanding the role of the mass media is helpful in answering the overall research question.Mwanikii. “The
Unspoken Contributions of South Africa in WWII,” Medium .The topic is the necessity of recognition of South Africa’s contribution the Allies during World War II. The author’s thesis is that the acknowledgement of the role of Western powers in World War II should also include South Africa’s contribution. The author analyzes excerpts from a history book and scholarly journal article, both of which are dedicated to South Africa’s involvement in the World War II. Although the article’s focus is history, it is in reality an opinion piece. The main idea is that South Africa’s contribution allowed Western nations to secure victory, which is not properly acknowledged by modern historiography.The author’s goal is to acquaint the audience with the basic facts known about Afrikaners’ involvement in the World War
is self-explanatory – it details the aftermath of the World War II in South Africa. No clear thesis is presented as the entry is an account of events. Byrnes relies on the sources approved by the US Library of Congress to convey her ideas. The work itself is a mix of history with social sciences with an emphasis on racial controversies. Byrnes’ main point is that the World War II has accentuated social and economic issues in South Africa, which would lead to the emergence of black workers’ protests.
Theodor Adorno’s concept of industrial culture implied a strong connection between capitalist society and the products capitalism produces in the cultural sphere to enhance the existing social practices that benefit the further development of capitalism. Therefore, Adorno suggested that most media products, such as films, books, television programs, reinforce the population’s belief in capitalist values. On the other hand, the structural functionalism theory approaches society as a living organism, where each part of society plays its function in the viability maintenance of the whole organism. Therefore, even though the concepts have similarities in equally prioritizing the importance of stability in society, their differences can be more apparent through application to modern culture and society.In his theory, Adorno pointed at the obvious narrative of mass media products, such as
films. In the structural functionalism approach, the entertainment industry for children presents a source of education and emotional development. In different forms, the children’s entertainment industry teaches them important moral practices of being kind and polite to other people, which serves as the foundation for security in the future society. However, in the industrial culture approach, modern children’s entertainment is focused on selling the merchandise of different characters featured in films. For example, one of the most influential companies, Disney, invented the business model of using cartoon characters to attract children to their theme parks (Clement, 2018). Now, the company strategically plans simultaneous launches of animated films and merchandise with the films’ characters to ensure financial benefit.
IntroductionWhenever an information gap or an unresolved scientific topic emerges, misinformation will likely arise as people attempt to reason, better comprehend, and connect the dots. This has been the case with COVID-19 vaccines, which have been met with both appreciation and skepticism. Recently, some celebrities such as Joe Rogan have found themselves in trouble for promoting misleading remarks about COVID-19 on his show. Rogan, who owns, The Joe Rogan Experience, the world’s most popular podcast, signed a deal with Spotify to have his content exclusively hosted on the streaming platform (Dickson, 2022). With pressure mounting on Spotify to eradicate misinformation on the platform and take decisive action against Rogan, examining how the bedeviled company can win the public’s opinion is imperative.The Joe Rogan CaseJoe Rogan’s podcast is considered
the most popular worldwide, meaning that it attracts millions of viewers and listeners. According to Rolling Stone, Rogan’s podcast has approximately 11 million listeners per episode (Dickson, 2022). Without a doubt, any COVID-19 misinformation emerging from his platform can be catastrophic. Spotify faces a big challenge because Rogan was allowed to host Dr. Robert Malone, an anti-vaxxer banned from other platforms such as Twitter. Malone made anti-vaccination remarks throughout the episode, including pushing the narrative that hospitals are financially motivated to report false COVID-19 fatalities (Dickson, 2022). Rogan is under fire because he seemed to embrace these ideas, with more emerging evidence that he had made racist remarks in many of his earlier podcasts. Therefore, further actions from Spotify should seek to win public trust, primarily through effective
communication.Spotify’s Position on the MatterSpotify does not believe it has a duty to police content posted on its platform (Holtermann, 2022). This is a reckless statement from a public relations perspective. The company has assured the public that it will add content advisory on some podcasts. This is a welcome move but should be implemented faster. Spotify has not dismissed Joe Rogan or shown intentions to investigate him. This is a blatant show of irresponsibility and lack of concern for public safety. Finally, Spotify lacks a discernible policy to tackle fake news or misinformation. These missteps from the start of the issue have continued to shape a negative attitude and public opinion about the streaming company. Without a quick solution, the company’s troubles may not end soon.The Communication
ProcessThe ability to communicate with one another is a fundamental feature that distinguishes humans from other species. The act of communicating is the ability to transmit stimuli – usually verbal – to other individuals to change their behavior (Lecture January 24). The purpose of communication often revolves around persuasion for three reasons: Shaping, reinforcing, and changing. According to lecture notes, shaping is helpful in creating a favorable mood (attitudes) or brand identity, changing for influencing behavioral transformation, and reinforcing (most commonly used) for strengthening existing behaviors (Lecture January 24). Therefore, the company should incorporate all three strategies to tackle its problems effectively.Communication and Action for PersuasionSpotify executives are under pressure to address COVID-19 misinformation spread on the platform. In response, the company has claimed that it has no
obligation to tackle the misleading information on the ongoing pandemic. Unfortunately, the public and various leaders have not received this well. As a result, some musicians have removed their content from the platform, and many others threaten to do the same (Holtermann, 2022). Many users also suggest that they intend to replace Spotify with alternative streaming companies. This underscores the urgency of deescalating the situation. Spotify can start by using three rhetorical elements to change, shape, and reinforce public opinion. These include ethos, pathos, and logos, as proposed by Aristotle.EthosAccording to Aristotle, ethos speaks to the audience’s moral status. Spotify has not come out openly and admitted that Rogan’s show violated its ethical policy. It has emerged that the company has no policy regulating fake news on its
platform (Dickson, 2022). This needs to change, and Spotify must start appealing to the public’s moral understanding. As Spotify looks to improve its policy on misinformation, it should come out openly and declare Rogan’s remarks as unethical. This will show that the company has a moral stand. More importantly, Spotify must reshape its organizational culture to embrace accountability. The picture Spotify has painted currently is that it lacks accountability, which is highly unethical.PathosPathos refers to a communicator’s appeal to the emotions of the audience. Spotify’s actions have shown a lack of concern for people who have succumbed to COVID-19, including health professionals working tirelessly to beat the virus. The pandemic has occasioned an endless period of suffering globally, and a large corporation like Spotify should empathize with those
affected. Many people expected Spotify to condemn Malone following his disparaging remarks towards health professionals on Rogan’s show, but this did not happen. Thus, Spotify should release an apology statement to healthcare workers to show the company’s support and understanding for their endless sacrifices during this pandemic.LogosLogos is the use of rational arguments to appeal to the audience. This can include the use of facts and figures to reinforce the argument. Spotify has succumbed to public pressure and removed some of Rogan’s podcasts from its platform. However, this may not be enough because the public expects Spotify to do more. Many argue that Spotify has not taken stringent action against Rogan because of his influence and million dollar deal he signed with the company. Therefore, the company should
dismiss Rogan indefinitely pending an investigation into his conduct. It must remove all content related to spreading COVID-19 misinformation from the site. This action should be extended to users abusing the platform’s lack of tight misinformation policy.Additional StrategiesSpotify needs to show that its operations align with basic corporate social responsibility guidelines. Spotify should outline clear strategies it intends to use to tackle misinformation. This should include an intention to train employees on effective content moderation and hire more staff to increase its content moderation capacity. More importantly, the company should announce its commitment to developing or investing in a robust artificial intelligence system that will be used to track content and flag inappropriate ones before they reach the public domain. Such actions would reinforce people’s trust that Spotify
Studying the literature of various heads can not only bring new knowledge about the past times. Literary sources can also provide valuable information about what views people have on such aspects of life as love, human relationships, or faith. Therefore, Søren Kierkegaard’s in his work “Fear and Trembling” conveys his unique vision of religion, which in some way differs from conventional faith. Thus, this work examines the concept of faith and its connection with morality and reasoning in the work of the Danish philosopher.In his work, Kierkegaard tries to answer the question about the nature and true meaning of faith in human life. With his works, the philosopher made a unique contribution to such disciplines as theology, philosophy, and literature (Noble, 2017). Moreover, in his writings, the author
Caterpillar Inc. is a leading global equipment manufacturer for the mining, oil and gas, construction, railway, and industrial industries. The company has three operating segments: the construction industry, the resource industry, energy, and transport. The first and last segments generate the largest revenue in the company’s consolidated revenue structure. Caterpillar Inc. also provides financial and related services through a number of subsidiaries. The company regularly conducts external audits and SWOT analysis to assess its effectiveness. These measurements help to identify the shortcomings of the organization in time and promptly eliminate them. I think these measurements are practical, and the firm’s successful work in the global market confirms this.The company’s organizational structure is guided by a board of directors and a global management team who work on overseeing the
company’s actions, performance, and management policies. Caterpillar Inc., having suffered from the actions of competitors in the mid-1980s, reorganized in order to establish internal accountability relationships. Caterpillar’s Board of Directors presently has 11 associates (Lysak et al., 2020). This number allows one to diversify the experience without hindering practical discussion or reducing individual accountability. Previously, if something went wrong, the heads of departments blamed the managers of the central office for everything. The clear accountability provided by the new structure has forced people to look for solutions to problems rather than looking for the guilty. Accountable employees of the company work in various departments, factories, and testing sites.The company’s organizational structure is closer to the traditional rather than Holarctic. The company does not form autonomous groups and teams
within divisions but centralizes management in the main office (Lysak et al., 2020). This helps the company to make global decisions and achieve their implementation effectively. It is also vital for an organization’s leadership team to be able to identify external and internal environmental factors. This is important to effectively compare their activities with the operations of competitors and win a competitive advantage in the market. External environmental factors also indicate in which direction the company needs to develop to meet the changing market. At the same time, internal factors make it clear to the company’s management how quickly it will be able to increase efficiency with increasing competition. In addition, understanding the internal environmental factors helps to understand the internal problems of the company and provokes work
leading position. Among such advantages, there are such as equipment characterized by high performance reliability and minimal total cost of ownership over the entire service life (Lysak et al., 2020). As operational management improvements for Caterpillar, we can suggest expanding the number of middle managers. Thus, individual dishonesty will be divided into several more links, and errors in the work will be detected and eliminated even faster. Such an innovation will also have a positive impact on future business decisions since they will be made with the involvement of a larger number of interested employees.
Strategic planning is an essential part of any managerial activity, and the ability to perform it defines the quality of a leader. Strategic planning, in my vision, consists of setting priorities for the longer prospect and defining which operations the team should put their focus and energy on. However, there are common misconceptions about strategies since this process is somewhat fluid and unclear, yet it should not be mistaken for business planning.A distinguished scholar and author, Roger L. Martin, described his understanding of a good strategy. He stated that it should not be formed through long and careful research but should appear naturally through the «rough and ready» process, as only this way will the strategy exist outside the comfort zone. Although I agree with the second part
Modern trends in the international markets for goods, services, labor, capital, and technology allow each competitive enterprise to find its place in the global economic process. However, it requires particular practices and conditions for meeting the political, economic, and cultural expectations of global business. One of the main principles is the understanding and implementation of the course of global corporate management followed by leading international corporations.Sun City has prominent prospects within the current global trend of active tourism and water sports. The economic side of the case is particularly attractive in terms of profit due to the growing popularity of the entertainment industry. For many countries, including the US, this is one of the largest sources of income and investment (Wilson et al., 2021). Surfing gains significant popularity
in the market: Amid the COVID-19 crisis, the global market was evaluated at $2.7 Billion in 2020 and has the potential to reach $3.1 Billion by 2026 (Surfing. Global Market Trajectory, n.d.). Such a profit has the risk of attracting a large number of competitors. Sun City’s management must become better customer-focused to prevail in the face of increasing competition.From a cultural point of view, this is also an exceptionally profitable investment. This area of outdoor activities continues to gain popularity and promote the worldwide idea of an unassailable eco-friendly vacation (Wilson et al, 2021). The International Surfing Association argues around 35 million people surf worldwide for leisure and sports purposes (Surfing. Global Market Trajectory, n.d.). Tourists at popular surf spots may create disruptive mass tourism, and the
The first half of Imitation of Life deals with the question from a feminist perspective of what it means to be a woman living in a male-dominated society, while the second half deals with how women of color are affected by racism. Heung notes that it is a story about imitation and pretending to be untrue. Lora Meredith, a white woman, widow, and aspiring actress, always pretends. The motive for this behavior is to avoid the hassle of raising his only daughter, Susie, alone with very little money. Although Lora defies stereotypes by not letting any man control her or interfere with her success, she upholds the proper standards of a good mother.In turn, Susie’s imitation of life is how she pretends to be a daughter, receiving all
IntroductionSustainability is among the fastest-growing ethical concerns for individuals, businesses, and governments. According to Mason (2022), “sustainability takes into account how we might live in harmony with the natural world around us, protecting it from damage and destruction.” This means that sustainability is where people can sustain themselves without harming the planet. As a result, the sustainability concept that resonates with me is reducing the impact of climate change. The concept relates to my desire to be a climate change advocate. It also relates to my goal of becoming an environmentalist. Therefore, everyone has a role in promoting sustainability to make the planet a better place for everyone, including future generations.SustainabilitySustainability is a contemporary concept that encourages consideration of ways to live in harmony with nature. It can
be defined as attaining our needs without jeopardizing future generations’ ability to meet their own (Mason, 2022). In my view, sustainability is concerned with how we should live in harmony with our natural world and safeguard it against damage and destruction for future generations. In other words, it involves existing and developing without depleting the available natural resources for posterity. It also means operating in effective ways for everyone because all the actions we carry out affect the future. For example, persistent organic pollutants can have adverse impacts such as an extension of species and damage to the ecosystem. This means that the environment will not be conducive to the incoming generations.The primary things that sustain me are air, water, and food in the natural world. Although human
beings can go without food for some days, death is possible if it is prolonged. Food is necessary for human survival because it is the source of nutrients that provides energy for activity, growth, and all body operations. Water is also an important element for human survival. It is impossible for humans to survive without water. However, polluted water is harmful to humans and can be a source of illness. Apart from water and food, I also need quality air to survive. This means that the air I breathe should be free from pollutants. Therefore, I require quality air, water, and food to live on Earth.Personal Understanding of Sustainability in My LifeThe sustainability component that is relevant to me is reducing climate change impacts. According to United Nations
(2021), sustainable Development Goal 13 aims to “take urgent action to combat climate change and its impact.” It is about developing ways or solutions to reduce the planet’s climate effect. Minimizing the impact of climate change, also called climate change mitigation, involves avoiding and lowering greenhouse gas gases into the environment to keep the planet from heating up to high temperatures (Ahmed et al., 2019). In addition, it necessitates a shift away from fossil fuels and toward clean, renewable energy. This is crucial because it helps prevent deforestation and restore natural habitats until carbon emissions are reduced to zero. As a result, reducing the impact of climate change involves engaging in activities that prevent climate change from happening.The sustainability component of reducing the impact of climate change is
important because it assists in alleviating the effects of climate change on the planet. Climate change is a significant issue because it has the potential to cause dangerous transitions in climate and weather (Ahmed et al., 2019). For example, many areas have seen changes in rainfall, resulting in an increase in floods, droughts, and intense rain and an increase in the frequency and severity of heatwaves. Based on this, this component provides important strategies to help lower the adverse effects of climate change. In addition, it offers different ways of reducing climate change at an individual, family, community, organization, country, and world level. For example, an individual is advised to monitor their carbon footprint.Reducing the impacts of climate change like other components of sustainability intends to achieve sustainability.
The main purpose is to make the planet a better place for everyone, including future generations. As people reduce the impacts of climate change, they create a conducive environment for all. For example, lowering our carbon footprint minimizes the amount of pollutants in the environment. The component also relates with others, like creating affordable and clean energy. For example, when people shift from fossil fuel vehicles to electric ones, they reduce harmful emissions to the environment. In addition, creating sustainable cities, which is about investment in public transport, creating green public spaces have a common goal of making the world a better place.This concept is directly applicable to my life and my vision of becoming an environmentalist. I understand that everyone on Earth is vulnerable to the effects
of climate change. Despite the impact of climate change, people are slow at adopting the recommended climate change mitigations. We can begin to make changes by looking at ourselves and seeing what we can do to change, such as not littering and attempting to reduce our use of pollutants. We can also begin to encourage others to do the same in order to keep the environment healthy. These actions are all part of the great turning point, as we encourage others to assist in protecting our citizens and the future of our planet. Therefore, reducing the effects of climate change relates to my long-life goal of becoming an environmentalist.During childhood, I developed a desire to participate in the protection of the environment after a news report. One day,
while watching the news together as a family, there was horrifying news of heatwaves in Europe. It claimed the life of thousands of people in Europe. This was the time I directly linked climate change to the death of people. From that moment, I developed a desire to learn more and talk about climate change to reduce deaths and diseases caused by climate change. As a result, the concept of reducing the impact of climate change resonates with my ambition of protecting the environment. In addition, the concept informs me that I can change the way I live and reduce the impacts of climate change. Thus, I reinforced my desire to help protect the environment when I learned more about climate change mitigation strategies.Connections to Active HopeAfter looking
through the Earth Charter, sustainable development goals and sustainability definitions, I found that I connect most with reducing the impact of climate change. I resonate most with this concept because I believe that the main enemy of sustainability is climate change. People are suffering due to the shifts in temperature and weather patterns caused by climate change. I also believe that it is impossible to achieve anticipated sustainability if we are still experiencing climate change. Therefore, the importance of this concept is to open everyone’s eyes that we need to decide to implement the proposed ways of reducing climate change. This includes changing our mindset about our environment and making the right decisions.A Connection to the Great TurningThe Great Turning can be incorporated into my daily life by
adopting the proposed climate change mitigation strategies. Macy and Johnstone (2012) posits “right now a shift of comparable scope and magnitude is occurring. It’s been called the Ecological Revolution, the Sustainability Revolution, even the Necessary Revolution” (39). This means that people should be ready for a revolution to achieve sustainability. Therefore, the concept of reducing climate change demands that I shift from the status quo and embrace the new order of sustainable operations.A Connection to Seeing with New EyesSeeing with New Eyes is an integral concept in the promotion of sustainability. It presents a view that I can derive new strength by understanding that I am part of a flow of life that started billions of years ago. Macy and Johnstone (2012) state, “He experienced himself to be
Despite the structural strength or extent of focus in a team, there is still a need for proper managerial support. According to Savu (2019), team success relies on its ability to embrace collaboration, able team leadership, and proper motivation. A study looked into the link between managerial support and work performance and found a close correlation (Wassem et al., 2019). They concluded that managerial support led to a notable increase in employee retention and productivity (Wassem et al., 2019). The paper will focus on a local soccer team and look into managerial communication and team leadership dynamics and their subsequent effects on the players’ success. The managerial support of Mr. Albert resulted in the success of the Eagles United Soccer Club through restructuring the team and focusing on
the individual weaknesses and strengths of each player while offering guidance on improvement.Eagles United Soccer Club is a soccer team and its primary purpose is to provide an avenue for nurturing and showcasing soccer talents through developing a competitive sports culture. The team’s ultimate goal is to be the leading and most successful men’s soccer team in Atlanta. The club was established on the 29th of January 2017 and has been operational for the past five years. The team comprises two boards of directors, three staff members (the club manager, the assistant club manager, and the club training manager), and twenty-five soccer players. Sports board members play a vital role in assessing the risk management processes, looking at the financial aspects, and in the appointment of the CEO
and managers (Cheng et al., 2021).In the Eagles club, the board members also offered a sense of overall direction and strategy. The team manager and assistant team manager provide the appropriate leadership, training, and motivation needed for the team’s success. The team also had a trainer and nutritionist whose jobs were to guide the players in improving their physical strength and agility. Musculoskeletal injuries and wounds are quite common among soccer players and result in a massive waste of time (Rollo et al., 2020). Therefore, the trainer and the nutritionist also helped players through injury rehabilitation and recovery.During the first year, Mr. Jones, one of the two Directors, was the team manager. Mr. Jones assumed the role automatically to fill the void as an interim manager as the
board looked for a permanent replacement. Interim management is a strategy often used for a temporary duration as the leadership deals with a technical, economical, or managerial difficulty (Kisi, 2020). Also, interim management is a highly flexible, radical, and adaptive leadership style (Kisi, 2020). Mr. Jones was charismatic, highly focused, result-oriented, conscientious, and assertive. His able leadership and effective communication laid an excellent foundation for the team. At the beginning of the second year, Mr. Albert was hired as the new club manager, with six-month probation. Later on, he was promoted to the position of permanent club manager following his success in the job. He highly valued autonomy and feedback in his communication style.The first and foremost task of the team at the arrival of Mr. Albert as
the club manager was to win a major trophy within two years with the available squad of twenty-five soccer players. The club manager started by reorganizing the team and having every team member set their personal goals. The club manager effectively resolved any conflicts between and among the team members. He mostly approached conflict with an active-constructive approach, where he emphasized a win-win outcome in every conflict. Gilbert & Kelloway (2018) noted that leaders who used the active-constructive approach reinforced better performance and sacrifices among the employees. In addition, the club manager was a great communicator, paying attention to detail in both verbal and non-verbal communication. Whenever anyone approached him with any issue, he would listen and keenly observe the body language while providing appropriate gestures, facial expressions,
IntroductionAn innovative home system is one of the unique modern technologies implemented by many intelligent systems: Ecobee Smart Thermostat – an intelligent design with software to control energy consumption. The device is medium-sized and consists of two parts: the thermostat with a glass display, a quad-core processor, and SmartSensor that picks up environmental signals. The thermostat has digital data transmission to the user and is compatible with the small detail and the user’s device. SmartSensor consists of air sensors (temperature, humidity, proximity, and occupancy) and a controlled voice assistant; it is automatically controlled by the thermostat and has built-in microphones, speakers, and speech recognition. Ecobee Smart Thermostat maintains a comfortable temperature and humidity in the home. The system allows you to reduce energy costs and regulate an environmental
load of your home. The report describes the construction of the thermostat parts, their relationship to each other, and their control.A Detailed Description of the ObjectThermostatThe thermostat is the central part of a rather large-sized device that controls an intelligent system with sensors. This part can convert the signal received from the sensor using a powerful processor and record the data on a memory card. The next-generation Cortex A35 processor allows for high performance with less energy to run its costs. One can see the scheme of a processor in figure 1.Figure 1: Scheme of Cortex A35 processorDue to the economical operation of the processor, the thermostat runs offline for long periods. The robust process ensures interfacing with other home components such as electric light sources, heat pumps,
humidifiers, fans and dryers, and users’ mobile devices. The small RAM , which stores the currently running machine code, is enough to serve the device at high speed. The built-in memory is only 4 gigabytes, but this amount is enough to store the comfort settings set by the user. The thermostat uses communication channels to connect to Wi-Fi or Bluetooth 5.0. The allowable settings are Wi-Fi up to 5 GHz, the possibility of IP addressing, and the identifier of the device in the network is extended to static or dynamic (DHCP).Thermostat ConnectionThe thermostat consists of an enclosure with elements for communication with the house’s internal systems and a glass display, which provides digitalization of the data. The case size is 6.2 inches by 6.2 inches, and the display
size is 4.29 inches by 4.29 inches – a compact enough unit that can be easily placed anywhere. There is a hole in the enclosure through which to run the cables for those elements of the house that need to be controlled: electricity, fans, and cleaning systems. Figure 2 shows the in-build elements below the thermostat display.Figure 2: Thermostat’s Elements under the DisplayThe available wire terminals are Rh, C, Y1 and Y2, PEK, O/B, and others. The AC connection is within 24 V via the C and Kc terminals, providing up to 3.5 VA of power. After connecting all the wires, the device must be started by allowing the internal settings to control the connected systems. The LCD display shows the corresponding characteristics : date, time, location, humidity,
temperature, and amount of energy consumed. The information requested by the user is transmitted to the mobile or other devices on-demand or automatically. All settings can be adjusted according to the user’s needs.Smart Sensor with Voice ControlAn optional part of the Ecobee Smart Thermostat is a small part with temperature and motion sensors. The sensor also recognizes voice commands and connects to Siri, Alexa, and other voice assistants. The sensor is small (1.6 inches by 2 inches) and consists of a plastic-metal housing and a stand. Figure 3 shows the sensor from two perspectives.Figure 3: Smart SensorThe sensor is placed anywhere in the apartment but 20 feet from the thermostat. It preserves signal transmission, which uses 915 MHz radio waves. The sensors have a viewing angle of up
Keeping track of student transcripts can be a heavy bureaucratic job that needs to be done away with as technology advances. Among these technologies are database management systems that allow creating an ordered library of student transcripts, as well as the students themselves, faculties, departments, and other essential entities within the university. The unique enumeration of students can help avoid confusion when having the same first or last name and implement transitions to other courses, keeping the student’s primary key identified. What is no less important is the ability to search and obtain quantitative knowledge control statistics for given keys of both courses, faculties, groups, and students individually, just like their work. Now requests will be available to all involved employees who may need this information: they will
SummaryThe human brain is the most complex organ and system in existence, which has a highly limited regenerative characteristic making aging a major factor in its deterioration. The proposed research aims to assess how neural stem cells replace and differentiate into neurons and other cells of the brain to use them for therapeutic purposes. Working thesis: neural stem cells must be used as a therapeutic measure to slow or halt the aging process due to their rejuvenation and differentiation capabilities.Galiakberova, A. A., & Dashinimaev, E. B. (2020). Neural stem cells and methods for their generation from induced pluripotent stem cells in vitro . Frontiers in Cell and Developmental Biology, 8 , 1-20.The study explores how neural stem cells differentiate into different forms of mature neural cells, including neurons
themselves. Pluripotent stem cells, or PSCs, are the best candidates for in vitro generation and cultivation of neural stem cells. There is a wide range of phenotypes when it comes to the differentiation process, which is why a strict condition setting is critical. The source will be useful for exploring and discussing how neural stem cells can be used in practice since the study focuses on in vitro mechanisms.Lazutkin, A., Podgorny, O., & Enikolopov, G. (2019). Modes of division and differentiation of neural stem cells. Behavioral Brain Research, 374 , 1-9.The research analyzes the process of hippocampal neurogenesis, where the emphasis is put on the neural stem cell lifecycle. The proposed neural stem cell maintenance, division, and differentiation models can occur in symmetric and asymmetric ways. Astrocytes play
a central role in maintaining neural stem cells, such as quiescent ones. The source will be highly useful in providing information on the intricate process of stem cell pool preservation.Navarro Negredo, P., Yeo, R. W., & Brunet, A. (2020). Aging and rejuvenation of neural stem cells and their niches. Cell Stem Cell, 27 (2), 202-223.The study focuses on two key neural stem cell pools in the mammalian brain: the subventricular zone (SVZ) and dentate gyrus (DG). The location of SVZ is lateral ventricles, whereas DG is located in the hippocampus. The assessment of the literature reveals that neural stem cells are critical for brain rejuvenation, and health-promoting interventions slow brain aging. The source provides a mass of valuable knowledge and literature analysis; thus, it will be used as
comprehensive evidence.Obernier, K., & Alvarez-Buylla, A. (2019). Neural stem cells: Origin, heterogeneity and regulation in the adult mammalian brain. Development, 146 (4), 1-15.The study focuses on the process of cell specialization and differentiation in the rodent brain. The key elements include molecular control, heterogeneity, and regional specification. It is stated that neighboring cells use neurotransmitters to signal the pattern of neural stem cell self-renewal. The source provides insightful data on how neural stem cell pools are maintained throughout brain development and maturity.Petrik, D., Jorgensen, S., Eftychidis, V., & Siebzehnrubl, F. A. (2022).

Current progress in the derivation and therapeutic application of neural stem cells. Cell Death and Disease, 8 (10), 1-12.The source provides a summative overview of transplantation procedures in regard to neural stem cells. The current state of progress in the field is faced with an array of issues. It is indicated that novel derivation methods, such as trans-differentiation from somatic cells, are developed. The source is highly useful for the practical aspects of implementing neural stem cells’ antiaging properties in the human brain.
Suicide is one of the serious problems of modern society, the relevance of which is typical for countries with very different socio-economic conditions, cultural, and religious traditions. One of the most suicidally dangerous ages is adolescence (Button and Marsh 13). When sexual and role identification is formed, unrequited love, conflicts with friends and parents, and school problems are acutely experienced. The prevention of suicidal behavior is one of modern society’s most critical and complex problems. Combinations of micro-social reasons and individual psychological features of the person, causing suicidal forms of reaction to psychologically difficult circumstances, assume individualization of work, especially with students at risk.When carrying out a conversation with the teenager thinking about suicide, teachers are recommended to take the following steps. First, it is necessary to listen
attentively to the interlocutor, as teenagers often suffer from loneliness and the impossibility of pouring out the soul. Secondly, it is essential to formulate questions correctly, calmly, and lucidly to ask about the essence of the disturbing situation and about what help is needed. Thirdly, it is unnecessary to argue and not insist that his misfortune is insignificant, that he lives better than others. Teachers should not use statements that make the child feel unnecessary (Coleman 56). Besides, it is necessary to try to give the teenager hope. It should be realistic and aimed at strengthening his forces and abilities. If suicidal tendencies of a schoolboy are noticed, the following tips will help to change the situation.The first step is to listen carefully to the teenager who has
decided to commit suicide and make every effort to understand the problem behind the words. One also needs to assess the seriousness of the child’s intentions and feelings (Robinson et al. 6). If he already has a concrete plan for suicide, he needs help right away. At the same time, it is essential to assess the depth of the emotional crisis, paying attention to details. For example, if the person in a state of depression suddenly starts to show violent activity – this can be a cause for alarm.It is worth paying attention to all, even the minor grievances and complaints. The teenager may not give vent to his feelings, hiding his problems, but at the same time be in a state of deep depression. To prevent a
her, to point out possible ways of solving the problem.To sum up, taking preventive measures to prevent teenage suicide is deeply individual. Work with the teenager should be carried out both by the teacher and the parents. It is essential to listen to the child and allow him or her to speak openly about his/her problems and anxieties. If the teen feels that he or she has a safe place to talk openly about his or her worries, he or she is less likely to commit suicide. When talking to depressed children, taking their concerns seriously and showing involvement and interest is essential. Thus, if timely prophylactic measures are taken, teen suicide can be prevented.
Tesla had entered the automobile market forcefully and, with energetic leadership, smart marketing, and high-quality products, carved a considerable share for itself. It inevitably puts the company at odds with other auto dealers, including the giants like Volkswagen and Toyota, who use a different retail model. While the competition and increased supply impact the range of choices that people have positively, monopolization still remains a possibility, driven by the same sinful nature that was already recognized in biblical times.Overall, Tesla’s entry into the automobile market impacted the situation for the better insofar as the ordinary customer is concerned. On the one hand, it added another car manufacturer to the list of those to choose from and, therefore, increased the range of options available to the customers. Apart from
that, its emphasis on direct sales, as opposed to franchising, creates a different buying experience, which also facilitates choice.In terms of natural market forces, increased supply represented by Tesla’s entry into the market is also a positive factor. The dynamics of the economy ensure that, with an increased supply and roughly stable demand, the price equilibrium point will gradually move down, thus, making the goods more accessible. In this respect, increased competition also impacts the range of choices for the better, albeit indirectly, as lower prices ensure there can be more options for the same spending level.That being said, the drive toward monopolization, with all its detrimental effects for the consumer, still remains. The simplest biblical explanation for this drive is, of course, the sin of greed that
drives people to obtain more than they can possibly need. By eliminating competition and dominating the market, monopolist suppliers seek to increase their wealth at the expense of the consumers by depriving them of alternatives, which is hardly Christian.To summarize, Tesla’s competition with traditional auto dealers impacts the range of choices positively insofar as the consumer is concerned. Increased supply and competition ensure that, at least theoretically, there should be more options available. Still, there is no doubt that any large company in the industry would favor the opportunity to monopolize the market by eliminating competition to satisfy its greed.The person I interviewed for this assignment was my mother, a pious and conservative christen woman. She does not have that much interest in the automobile market, and her
Test reliability is one of the criteria for test quality. It shows how accurately the test is guaranteed to measure the phenomenon under study. Reliability is usually determined after the test items have been analyzed and the final test form has been compiled; a special test validation is conducted to determine it (Whiston, 2017). A test can be called reliable based on two kinds of information. First, a test is called reliable if it is interference-resistant. When the test is administered under different conditions, it gives similar results. Second, a test is reliable if it is internally consistent (homogeneous). That is, there are no inconsistencies within the procedure itself, and the methodology for analyzing the results is chosen correctly. Test reliability is also closely related to random error.Like
between random and systematic errors is conditional. The total error of any test consists of errors of these two types but in different ratios. The relative weight of each type of error depends on the test’s quality and the examination conditions.Test results always contain errors, no matter how carefully administered the test is. However, using methods of mathematical statistics, it is possible to estimate the magnitude of the total test error and use it to assess test reliability. Without a statistical evaluation of test reliability, measurement results cannot be considered reliable. Therefore, test reliability is a characteristic of the extent to which differences between test-takers reflect differences in test-takers’ properties and the extent to which they are a reflection of random errors.
The 13th Amendment to the U.S. Constitution was introduced in the second half of the 19th century, manifesting the abolition of slavery across the country. According to the text, every citizen of the U.S. can neither enslave people nor be enslaved by fellow U.S. residents regardless of gender, race, age, or any other characteristic (U.S. Const. amend. 13, § 1). The abolition of slavery across the state has impacted U.S. history and the life of every American citizen, as this process initiated the restoration of individual freedom and nationwide democracy. Although currently, this Amendment does not have such a powerful impact on the everyday life of American citizens, it’s phrasing implicitly affects the limitation of human freedom. The Amendment states that involuntary servitude is abolished except for the
The Allegory of the Cave by Plato is a work about how people perceive life and reality. Many people in today’s environment have a distorted perception of reality. Plato’s work is important and vital because it underlines the significance of reconfiguring oneself in order to discover the truth. Using extensive metaphors, powerful connotative language, and an elegant questioning tone, he furthers this purpose. Through distinctive rhetoric, Plato highlights his unique perspective on reality.First of all, Plato created the people in the cave captives in order to rhetorically appeal to the audience’s emotions and arouse the sensations that already exist in them, which, of course, already produces an intimidating image in the reader’s mind. Furthermore, the inmates symbolize all of the people who are confined, allowing viewers to realize
that they may interact with the inmates and make them unhappy at the fact that they are genuinely stuck. Plato’s shackles elicit feelings of rage and despair in the reader by conjuring up vivid and terrible pictures in the reader’s imagination. He uses extensive rhetoric to visualize the scenes of the prisoners inside the cave, mainly the metaphors.Plato skillfully conveys rhetorical devices to support his point of view that individuals are frequently so oblivious to the knowledge that is freely offered to them that they lose out on the opportunity to acquire a new degree of understanding about reality. The Allegory of the Cave employs a number of metaphors to emphasize its point, as well as symbols to connect one notion to another. A cave with inmates confined
within, for example, illustrates how our knowledge is cloaked in darkness, much like a cave in real life (Plato). He is caught in this misconception of the world, much as being in a dark, confined place precludes a person from perceiving the actual world.The light was also used as a metaphor for a person’s ability to perceive the truth. Finally, the philosopher is represented by the escaping prisoner. Philosophers are interested in learning more about the world, they are seeking anything outside the cave (Plato). Plato’s rhetorical methods, which finally lead to the successful representation of his vision, include metaphors and symbols, which are unquestionably crucial.To express his argument, Plato also used the rhetorical method of rhetorical questions. Throughout the essay, the author asks rhetorical questions. In fact,
there is at least one rhetorical question in practically every paragraph or section. “…Do you not expect that he would felicitate himself on the change and pitied it?” – Plato asks hypothetical questions to illustrate his points (Plato). Socrates’ words have a peculiar tone when he speaks to Glaucon as if he doesn’t know the truth himself. “What he would say if…”; “What if he were shown… and compelled by…? “; “Don’t you think he would be puzzled…” (Plato)– these are among other examples where Plato employs the rhetorical questions. Plato expects that the reader would conclude for himself that truth has a limit and that individuals only believe what they wish to believe.Plato’s rhetorical inquiries are often descriptive, demonstrating how he strives to imbue readers with certain
Plato is an ancient Greek thinker whose beliefs significantly affected the development of modern philosophy as a science. The myth of Plato’s cave is a well-known allegory that is considered one of the critical concepts of objective idealism. The metaphor of prisoners chained in the dark is a myth’s core applied to explain the hardship of attaining and maintaining a just and intellectual spirit. Plato’s Allegory of the Cave is a timeless characterization of the distinction between appearances and reality, prompting humanity to step out of the ignorance into the glow of sunlight.The Divided Line is another concept that separates the world into perceived and cognized. It can be considered a theoretical basis for the Allegory of the Cave , representing humankind’s experience in exploring the visible and
comprehensible globe. The correspondence of the four phases of The Cave can be related to the four types of knowledge in The Divided Lines (Bonazzi, 2020). The visual world of the cave resembles the assumption about the mirror images, while the natural objects whose images cast shadows symbolize mathematical reasoning. The cognitive method of conceptual thinking is attributed to the parable of lines, and the perception of the sky corresponds in this scheme to the mind’s cognition.Allegory of the Cav e can be divided into several levels of awareness, each characterized by distinctive features. The first stage is the cave captives, accustomed to believing in shadows and illusions. Only a few manage to reach the second stage, liberation, attained through questioning, research, and study. Acceptance can be considered
the third and most challenging level because it involves abandoning previous beliefs. Plato assumed that the past determines the experience of the present, which is a reason for a suggestion that radical change in the way one understands things must necessarily lead to discomfort (Bonazzi, 2020). Finally, the return involves the culmination of learning between diverse realities. This level consists of disseminating new ideas that may cause confusion, contempt, or hatred for having the indiscretion to question the fundamental dogmas that structure society.The significance of Plato’s ideas has remained intact even after thousands of years. New interpretations and studies have emerged, but his allegories have not renounced their relevance among others. Their prominence is also evident in the twenty-first century when the issue of people’s attachment to social
networks is especially acute. People spend a considerable amount of time on media and, realizing their attachment, cannot find the strength to stop. Once on a social network, people are immersed in virtual life, and the concern is that all of this fascinating, vibrant life has nothing in common with reality (Bonazzi, 2020). Therefore, social networks are a cave in which people are imprisoned, and all the photos, videos, posts are shadows reflecting on the walls of this cave.Creating an ideal image on the Internet is much more effortless, and that is why people try to escape from all the troubles and burdens to another globe. The concern is that this happiness is constructed on illusions and fantasies, which Plato urges to abandon. His allegory promotes an understanding
of man’s active role in transforming the world and realizing that only reality is valid and unchanging, so one must strive to comprehend rather than resist it.There are also instances in my life related to media that can be compared to Plato’s analogies and teachings. One example is the constant monitoring of data from the virtual world, including social media and the rest of the Internet. I often take all publications as accurate, ignoring that the reality that these sources of information represent is only a shadow of what they want to share. Thus, I sink into a cave that distances me from the truth by consuming information without questioning it. This example also corresponds to the four types of wisdom: knowledge-imaging, belief, thinking, and perfect intelligence. At
the imagining stage, I took data from social media as truth. Then, I gained faith as I realized that these facts and actual events did not correlate, which led to many reflections and thinking. In the end, I broke free of false beliefs, learned to judge more critically, and realized the necessity of comparing the objective and the imaginary.The interpretation of Plato’s cave is broad, but its primary meaning remains unchanged. It represents the sensual world and everyday experience, where everything is uncertain and constantly changing. The imprisoned ordinary people live in a world of speculation and illusion. At the same time, the former prisoners who are allowed to wander in the cave hold the most accurate view of reality possible in the shifting world of perception and
Cave , permeates all of modern society. It is the first time in history that the distinction between reality and its ideas has been profoundly and figuratively articulated. Plato strives to educate that the fundamental nature of things is complex, and not everyone can cross the boundary between the visible and the real. However, by taking this step, it is feasible to understand the world of ideas, break away from the illusory nature of everyday perception of reality, and cognize the essence.
Performance is not just the production of musical sounds, but the interaction of the musician and the audience through all channels, including visual ones. It is not for nothing that at the concert the musician is on a dais in front of everyone. At the concert, not only the musician’s ability to produce musical sounds is tested, but also the musicians’ ability to carry out complex action between them and the audience.The way musicians dress for a concert speaks volumes about their attitude towards the audience. Listeners express respect for the musician by keeping their attention and silence while the music is playing, and after that, they applaud or thank them with words. Musicians express respect for the listener by diligently and faithfully performing music and create a
observe a strict dress code. Appearance for performance is an important detail that requires special attention and approach. An artist’s concert attire should not only be elegant and appropriate for the performance situation, but it should also be comfortable that nothing distracts from the performance. However, among classical music performers, there are also lovers of informal appearance, for example, violinist Vanessa Mae and cellist Nigel Kennedy. Different listeners perceive the original appearance of a musician differently: some see it as nothing more than a commercial trick, others see it as a desire for innovation.
A bar chart refers to a plan or graph that compares different categories of data using rectangular bars, either vertically or horizontally. The bar length is proportional to the values. New York Times published a newspaper on 10 th Feb 2022 and an article ‘How the pandemic has affected weddings,’ and individuals used the graph to show annual weddings from 1970 to 2022. Yearly there were 2.1 million weddings in the United States, but in the first year of the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020, there was a drop by 38 percent to 1.3 million weddings (Osisanwo, 2021). The key aspect of a graph that makes it meaningful in articles is the summary that is brought out in the discussion and analysis section. For instance, in the article mentioned
from the previous data. The reader gets a clear picture of the article presented. Besides, it covers large data on a smaller page.Simple, standard, and scalable are the critical items that make the chart valuable in the content of an article. Simply refers to how easy the variable can be interpreted. The title should be simple and to the point (Osisanwo, 2021). The data should be standardized and not complex for easy understanding. It also creates consistency across article organizations. In addition, scalable is another critical item that refers to a project’s ability to visualize the growing amount of data obtained. Individuals should use the right charts if the visual scalability is increased. Conclusively, charts are given the reader easy work in data comparison and analysis,
The global pandemic caused by the COVID-19 has led to severe issues in the labor market. To be more particular, the number of unemployed individuals is considerably higher than prior to the global lockdown (The Economist, para. 2). Naturally, such a situation happened due to businesses going bankrupt or reducing the number of employees to survive the economic crisis. The Economist elaborates on the statistics of the unemployment rate and shares the amount of time it can take for the labor market to recover to its prior-pandemic state (para. 1-3). This issue is complex, so McConnell et al. cover the primary aspects that contribute to it in chapters 12, 15, and 18. The 12th chapter reveals the governmental response to the labor market and how it is regulated
of employment and unemployment and how they affect the labor market on the whole.The economist, Gary Becker, earned the Nobel Prize for outstanding contributions to the field of economy, applying the theories for human behavior to connect the notion to sociology, criminology, and even demography. He researched the incentives for actors’ behavior, aiming at grander wealth, recognition, and fame, to analyze how this psychological phenomenon pertains to investments and crime (The Nobel Prize, para. 2). The most significant part of Becker’s contribution is his investigation of the relation of the aforementioned concept to discrimination in the labor market in relation to people of other professions.

The target audience is middle-class and higher-class mothers, but it should be noted that the brand is still unknown and requires proper marketing to build brand image. Thus, it is unjustified to select a high price range and risk lowering the demand, and it cannot compete with high-end bags and is not recognized as such.
Archetypes describe such characteristics, which are universal patterns that define certain events, objects, or people. In literature, they describe representations and concepts that are common to all people, which allow people to understand and interpret stories. However, archetypes also exist in everyday life and play a significant role in shaping the perception of the world around them. In particular, there are archetypes of people that help determine their character and actions, as well as motivation.Applying this concept to everyday life, one can single out special types of people who have a set of common and exclusive characteristics for them. They are formed both on the basis of the actions and inclinations of the person and depending on the environment. An example of an archetype in everyday life is
great example of an archetype. All his actions are motivated precisely by these characteristics, and his primary motivation is the transformation of the world.The presence of archetypes in everyday life allows me to compose a more comprehensive perception of people and events. In particular, based on the characteristics I know, I can determine the motivation and role of a certain person, which makes him more predictable. This is certainly more difficult than may be presented in the literature because people often have mixed features. However, in general, the concept of archetypes gives me the opportunity to understand the actions of people and their characters. I can later use this information to form my own relationship with them.
Bandung Conference was the first encounter between Asian and African countries that had gained independence from the western colonies. President of Indonesia Suharto invited the leaders from developing countries to Bandung, leading to a declaration on anti-imperialism and peaceful coexistence. It was hoped to unite emerging nations through collaboration in reducing their reliance on Europe and America.The conference aimed to promote Afro-Asian economic cultural cooperation and reject neocolonialism. The fundamental principles of the meeting were to respect territorial integrity and sovereignty, refrain from the use of power, have peaceful ways of settling disputes, and non-interference among the states. This nonaligned movement was founded to keep members from taking a side in Cold War politics, creating a solid rebellion. The outcome of the Bandung conference was that most of
The freedom to join the USA and the USSR Camp by the developing countries was achieved through the Bandung Conference (Lewis and Stolte, 2019). Although the movement aimed at discouraging members from participating in the War politics of the superpowers, most of the South and Southeast Asian countries were dragged into the Cold WarIn conclusion, the Afro-Asian conference, which represented twenty-nine nations from Africa, Asia, and the Middle East, condemned colonialism, racism, and the growing Cold War between the Soviet Union and the United States. The agreement was key towards protecting more nations from supporting the war. The core aim was political self-determination and mutual respect for sovereignty. This gave developing nations power in future politics outside the Cold War.
“Bang Bang Baby” can be labeled a science fiction musical as it incorporates elements of both genres in an exciting plot. After watching the trailer first, I was surprised by the energetic nature of the music and the characters in the film. The main protagonist of the movie is a young lady named Stephy. She dreams about becoming a famous singer; however, her alcoholic father disapproves of her dreams. The story’s setting takes place in 1963 in a small Canadian town, and additionally, the movie is stylistically reminiscent of the 1950-1960s era in American pop music (Perone 34). The dresses, hairstyles, costumes, and decorations all point out the teddy-boy trend that was common in the 1950s.However, after watching a film, it turned out to be a bitter and
depressing experience as themes described in the movie are much more profound than they seem from a preview. First of all, the director managed to achieve the surrealistic and magical atmosphere by questioning the reality of the events through the scenes where Stephy wakes up from her dream. Sleep is used as one of the main transitional tools in the movie’s script as Stephy is sexually harassed when she falls asleep. Then she wakes up with Bobby Shore in her house, and the next time she wakes up in her bed, her whole life is different, and she is pregnant with a strange baby and sleeps with a man who raped her. Therefore, I think the film is about the maturity of Stephy and her sad story of
The Crimean War of 1853-56 was the first major military conflict in Europe since the Napoleonic Wars and, as such, often attracted historians’ attention. Fought between Russia and a coalition of European powers together with the Ottoman Empire, the conflict demonstrated considerable advances in technology, communication, and the art of war. As the name suggests, an important part of the conflict was the campaign fought in the Crimean peninsula between the defending Russians and the expeditionary force of British, French, Ottoman, and later Sardinian troops. The most famous events of the war, such as the Charge of the Light Brigade, were associated with the siege of the Russian naval base in Sevastopol. However, this siege would have been impossible if not for the allied victory in the first
major battle of the Crimean campaign. The battle of Alma, fought on 20 September 1854, opened the road to Sevastopol and proved the superiority of the allied arms and the French tactics over the cumbersome Russian military.Before delving into the battle itself, it is necessary to briefly cover its context. In 1852-1853 a seemingly trite dispute between the Orthodox and Catholic clergy in Palestine escalated into a diplomatic conflict between Russia and France (Tate 15). Alarmed by the Russian propositions to partition the Ottoman Empire, Britain began drifting closer to the French side. After the Ottoman Empire refused the ultimatum that would give Russia the right to intervene in its internal affairs on Christians’ behalf, war broke out in October 1853. Russia engaged the Ottomans on the Danube
and in the Caucasus, but with no decisive result, and was soon forced to abandon the latter theater due to Austrian intervention. Unwilling to see Russia upsetting the balance in both Europe and the Middle East, Britain and France began mobilizing and declared war on Russia in March 1854 (Tate 18). A combined French-British force arrived in Bulgaria and then, reinforced by some Ottoman troops, launched an expedition against Sevastopol, a major Russian naval base. After disembarking in Crimea on September 4, they marched toward their goal and soon encountered the Russian army waiting for them.The Russian force, up to 40,000 string and led by Prince Menshikov, an experienced veteran of the Napoleonic Wars, occupied a good defensive position between the allies and Sevastopol. The river Alma was
not particularly deep but still constituted an obstacle, and its steep left bank, which was occupied by the Russians, made it even stronger (Baumgart 128). However, the Russian commander believed that the river slopes on his left flank were nigh impassable and only left a token force at this point (Baumgart 128). The allied force, up to 61,000, would have to cross the shallow river under the Russian fire and then scale the steep hills beyond. However, the French general Saint-Arnaud, who also held overall command of the allied army, noted what he saw as Menshikov’s fatal mistake. A veteran of the colonial war in Algiers, he considered the hills on the left Russian flank perfectly accessible for his hardened troops and decided to turn the Russian flank
there (Baumgart 128). As for the British commander Lord Raglan, he was charged with attacking and tying up the Russian right flank while the French did their part.Tactically speaking, each of the three armies represented a fairly different picture. The French, especially the light infantry called Zuaves, utilized their Algerian experience and fought in loose skirmish lines to maximize the effect of their rifles while lowering their own casualties (Baumgart 129). The British, still clinging to the tactics of Wellington’s times, marched forward in lines, which could deliver devastating volleys against dense formations but were also quite vulnerable to the enemy fire (Gowing). As for the Russians, they also used the tactics that served them well in the Napoleonic Wars and mostly fought and maneuvered in battalion columns
(Baumgart 68). While fearsome in bayonet charges, these columns provided an easy target for the enemy fire. The majority of the allied infantry were all armed with modern rifles with an effective range of 500-600 meters, while outdated Russian smoothbores could not fire accurately beyond 250 meters (Baumgart 68). Artillery pieces were roughly comparable in all armies and fired solid shot on the distance of up to 3-4 kilometers and canister up to 600 meters, although the accuracy decreased dramatically with range.The battle began in the morning of September 20, with the four divisions of the French army advancing against the Russian left flank and center. As mentioned above, the Russians thought their left to be inaccessible and overlooked it, leaving only a single battalion there (Baumgart 128).
The French light infantry proved this estimation wrong, climbing the steep slopes by entire battalions and even dragging field guns up (Baumgart 129). Although Menshikov understood the threat and dispatched his reserves to the left, it was too late. Although the Russian artillery fired well and inflicted casualties upon the advancing French, its canister – the only effective type of round against infantry – had roughly the same range as the French rifles (Baumgart 129). It allowed the French sharpshooters to kill the gunners quickly, and after that, the cumbersome Russian columns with their outdated smoothbores were easy to engage from the safe range. Thus, utilizing their superior tactics and weaponry, the French decimated the Russian forces that opposed them and progressed forward. This movement turned the Russians’
flank and threatened their center, which was already engaging the other half of the French army.The British, who advanced against the Russian right flank, faced more difficulty than their French counterparts. While the Russian position there was more accessible, the Russians have erected field fortifications protecting their guns from enemy fire. As the British lines advanced, Russian guns inflicted progressively heavier casualties upon them. The fire was so intense that a British soldier who fought in the battle referred to it as a “hurricane of shot and shell” (Gowing). Despite considerable casualties, the first British line managed to assault the Russian positions and take the guns. However, the Russian infantry counterattacked almost immediately and drove them away from the artillery positions with a fierce bayonet charge. According to
the eyewitness, the British “lost a great number of our men and, by overwhelming numbers… were mobbed out of the battery” (Gowing). However, the Russian overextended their counterattack and ran directly into the murderous volley fire of the second British line. After that, the British troops renewed the offensive and engaged the Russians in heavy fighting that lasted until the French pressure on its left flank and center forced the Russian army to retreat.Seeing his left flank turned and his right flank and center pushed, Menshikov decided to retreat. The allies did not attempt to pursue the Russians – a decision that owed as much to fatigue and scorching heat as to the Russian superiority in cavalry and unknown terrain (Baumgart 130). The Russian casualties were fairly heavy
in proportion to the number of troops engaged and amounted to approximately 1800 dead, 3900 wounded, and 700 missing or taken prisoner (Baumgart 131). The British lost up to 300 dead and around 2000 wounded, while the French losses were between 140 and 250 dead and 1200-1400 wounded (Baumgart 131). Put together, these figures highlight the superiority of the French tactics and especially the skirmish lines, which made the infantry less vulnerable to massed enemy fire than the Russian columns of British lines. They also demonstrate the superiority of rifles as compared to smoothbores used by most of the Russian infantry. The allied victory opened the road to Sevastopol, the siege of which would last for almost a year and constitute the most important part of the Crimean
IntroductionThe Battle of Ia Drang was the first large military engagement in the Vietnam War between the forces of the United States Army and the People’s Army of Vietnam (PAVN). Conducted as part of the Pleiku Campaign, the Battle of Ia Drang occurred in the Ia Drang valley in two stages on November 14-19, 1965 (Galloway, 2010). The battle, known for its first large-scale helicopter assault and consistent air support, established the model of further military engagements by American forces and their tactics in the Vietnam War. The purpose of this paper is to analyze the historical event of the Battle of Ia Drang from the perspective of the operational art and design concept, Joint Planning, and other appropriate joint doctrinal publications.Historical DataOn the morning of November 14,
the troops of the 1st Battalion, 7th Cavalry, initiated a heliborne assault into Landing Zone X-Ray with the purpose of preventing an attack on the Plei Me camp discovered by intelligence earlier. Towards the end of the second day, after successfully holding positions, the U.S. ordered the first use of B-52 carpet bombings, striking key positions of PAVN forces. Accurate artillery strikes throughout the battle also served as critical support for the troops, holding back PAVN forces that significantly outnumbered the Americans. On the third day, PAVN continued desperate attacks on the U.S. positions until, eventually, L.Z. X-Ray was secured. The U.S. forces lost 79 soldiers and had 121 wounded, while 634 PAVN soldiers were confirmed dead, with an estimated another 1215 dead from long-distance artillery and airstrikes
(Cash, 2001).As L.Z. X-Ray was secured, and units were dispersed to other locations. Under the command of Lt. Col. Robert McDade, the 2nd Battalion, 7th Cavalry began its path towards LZ Albany approximately 2 miles northeast. McDade’s troops encountered the remains of the PAVN 33rd and 66th regiments, resulting in an ambush that spread the U.S. troops into small groups as the initial group marched in a single-file column. The battle lasted for nearly 16 hours near LZ Albany. Eventually, air support was able to bomb areas of potential PAVN encampments at a safe distance from U.S. troops while reinforcements arrived from other L.Z.s. In the clash at LZ Albany, 155 US troops were killed or missing, with 124 wounded, while 403 PAVN soldiers were confirmed dead (Cash,
2001).Operational Art and DesignCognitive ApproachOperational art is the cognitive approach used by military leadership utilizing their capabilities and judgment to develop strategies and operations to utilize military forces through the integration of ends, ways, means, and risks based on available information. Operational design is a methodology planner which provides the structure to support the operation and methods to address the problem (Joint Chiefs of Staff, 2017). American operations in Vietnam began with Operation Rolling Thunder which consisted mostly of air bombardments and support for South Vietnamese forces. There was no clear consensus on the end to be achieved, the means that ground forces were to use, and the eventual cost. Pres. Johnson initially sought to pursue a limited war theory approach and minimize involvement (Rosen, 1982). The American
commander in Vietnam, Gen. William C. Westmoreland, saw America’s commitment to military victory, and the initial troops of two battalions were present to protect U.S. airports.Design MethodologyOperational design in joint doctrine consists of three components understanding the environment, defining the problem, and developing an operational approach. There was a need for large numbers of U.S. troop presence, especially with a division with offensive capabilities in the Central Highlands, which included the Ia Drang Valley. The primary concern of the MACV commander was that the North Vietnamese conventional units amassing in the region were preparing an offensive. This attack would have had the purpose of either destroying the South Vietnamese government, splitting apart their forces along Highway 19, or carving out an autonomous district and establishing a Communist presence
in South Vietnam (Schifferle, 1994).The three stages of the American campaign were designed to secure bases and L.Z.s for the deployment of forces, conduct deep patrolling in the vicinity of base areas, and conduct long-range search-and-destroy operations against enemy forces. All of this was meant to occur in four phases (Schifferle, 1994). Westmoreland understood the situation well that U.S. forces faced not only the threat from PAVN conventional forces but also massive guerilla warfare from the Vietcong, as well as insurgency among many rural populations, including that in South Vietnam. Operation Rolling Thunder also created the strategic requirement to guard and logistically sustain the bombing campaign. Westmoreland and other commanders believed in pursuing the ‘big-unit strategy’ with the aim of achieving the destruction of NVA main force units
in Central Highlands, despite the high costs of casualties and funding it brought (Schifferle, 1994).Finally, the operational environment (O.E.) is a key consideration for operational design. As highlighted in Joint Public 3.0, an O.E. is the combination of conditions, circumstances, and influences that impact the employment of military capabilities and the decision-making of command. This includes the physical space (land, water, air), information environment, and other factors such as social, political, infrastructure, political, and economic (Incorporating Change 1, 2018). The operational environment was hostile and challenging, with little information available; thus, the informational space was lacking. The U.S. troops had a basic understanding of the local geography but had little knowledge of the presence of PAVN forces until those chose to reveal themselves. The physical environment on land
was in favor of the adversary, given the U.S. had not previously fought in jungle terrains, and most of the military preparations stemmed from the urban and open space warfare of WWII. However, the U.S. had the advantage of uncontested air space, which it could use to its advantage for surveillance, aerial bombardment, and heliborne assaults.Operational EndsEnd StatesEnd states are the set of required conditions that must be met to achieve the strategic objective. Some of the end states for the engagement were a full defeat and pushback of PAVN forces in the Ia Drang Valley to prevent any further potential or planned assaults on U.S. camps and airports. Another end state was to conduct a successful heliborne assault of ground troops deep into enemy-controlled territory with the
support of airborne strikes and artillery fire, being the first time the strategy was implemented into practice in this manner in Vietnam. Finally, the battle was meant to be the first primary engagement of U.S. troops with the NVA forces, marking a major escalation in the Vietnam War given that previously the U.S. engaged solely through bombardments or South Vietnam proxy forces (Warren, 2017).ObjectivesObjectives are objects that, by nature, location, purpose, and use, provide an effective contribution to military action. The objectives for the forces participating in the Ia Drang assault included securing key points such as landing zones in the area. The secondary mission was to locate and eliminate enemy forces, clearing the area for the potential further progression of U.S. forces and setting up camps for
later assaults (Galloway, 2020).Operational MeansOperational ReachOperational reach is the distance and duration that a force can competently employ military capabilities. The U.S. forces were based in the Plei Me Camp, southwest of Pleiku. Gen. Westmoreland had secured the commitment of 300,000 troops; the build-up forces occurred in the summer of 1965. The U.S. forces were generally well-supplied as well as supported by South Vietnam battalions. U.S. aerial forces had an extensive range of several thousand kilometers at which they could conduct flights and bombardments. At Ia Drang, forces could be deployed either by foot or heliborne assault. However, they had to be located within a relatively short distance of the base camp to ensure the availability of reinforcements, supply chains, and otherwise effectiveness. It was an approximately 34-mile
round trip between L.Z. X-ray and Plei Me (Schifferle, 1994). As evident by the battle, the U.S. forces could hold out against PAVN even as a small force for nearly a day and longer once reinforcements arrived.CulminationCulmination refers to the point at which a military force is unable to perform its operations. It is difficult to gauge accurately what the culmination point would be in the Ia Drang offensive. However, the battle occurred near the Cambodian border with Vietnam, and regiments of NVA forces took sanctuary in the nearby country. L.Z. X-Ray was located within 10-15 miles of the border, with the assault going in that direction. It can be safe to assume that the culmination point was the border since supply chains were likely only set up
in the radium of the heliborne assault.Operational WaysCenter of Gravity (CoG)The CoG refers to the sources of strength and balance from which the force derives its freedom of action and will to fight, the source of power on which everything depends. Therefore, both one’s own force and the adversary have a center of gravity. For the U.S. forces in Vietnam, the operational center of gravity was its airports and the points dislocation for the aerial forces, critical to the U.S. strategy in the country and vital support for any troops on the ground. These had to be protected in the long term. The CoG of the adversary was, ironically, time. From a military strategy perspective, time is a significant advantage to weaker forces, particularly in defending their own
territory. As a stronger force, the U.S. fighting abroad faced a much higher chance of decisive victory, the shorter the duration of the conflict, both the Ia Drang assault and the war in Vietnam in general. Otherwise, the more prolonged the conflict becomes, the time favors the PAVN as they can wear down U.S. forces little by little by hitting at hurtful points in infrastructure and troop morale (Hughes et al., 2018)Decisive PointsOperational ways focus on the ‘how’ objectives are achieved. The decisive point of an operation is a place, event, factor, or function when acted upon, allows commanders to gain a marked advantage over adversaries. For Gen. Westmoreland, the Ia Dragen assault was the first step to hit at the NVA CoG, which is time. The assault
was meant to be rapid and to secure key areas for a deeper assault into enemy territory. In a manner of speaking, the blitzkrieg type of warfare would have benefited U.S. forces while simultaneously achieving all key objectives of pushing back the PAVN, protecting military bases, and establishing positions of control in enemy territory.The RiskRisk is absolutely critical and central to the planning and execution of operations at any level. Joint Risk Analysis defines the concept as the “probability and consequence of an event causing harm to something valued” (United States Army War College, 2020). Using the model of ends, ways, means, and risks examined in this paper, it is necessary that all are balanced, meaning that leaders must weigh options to achieve desired objectives with the likelihood
of adverse outcomes.The Ia Drang campaign was, from the start, a high-risk endeavor. The heliborne assaults were the first of their kind in the Vietnam War, carrying a wide range of risk factors from technical to operational. Second, the forces were being helicoptered into L.Z.s located essentially in the enemy controlled territory, often just a few hundred meters from the PAVN. The troops being airlifted were far outnumbered, especially initially before reinforcements arrived; the risk of being overrun was high even if the Americans were better armed. The environment was largely unfamiliar to the forces and was utilized to the advantage of the PAVN, who was masterful at tactical guerilla-type warfare in the brushes and jungle. They used it for various tactics in the attempt to split or
surround U.S. forces, which was seen both at the skirmishes at L.Z. X-Ray and later LZ Albany. The risk of the ambush was high in the context of the operational environment as well, which occurred at LZ Albany, resulting in heavy U.S. casualties (Galloway, 2020).Despite the high level of risk, it can be argued that the campaign was justified and planned to the best ability of the available information. The assault was critical to secure landing zones needed to make further attacks against the PAVN in Central Highlands. Therefore, the strategic risk was weighed, that either the operation continue or the U.S. would be defeated before the war fully began with attacks on South Vietnam. The operation had the tactical support of aviation and artillery, which were crucial
The existence and proper functioning of democracy are particularly dependent on the ability of the society to connect and interact within its communities to resolve tentative issues. The author of the article “Bowling Alone: America’s Declining Social Capital” discusses and analyzes the manifestations of the civic society of the United States of America by assessing its change. Civic society as an expression of democracy has its social capital, which is characterized by the formation of social networks between people. The quality of such connections allows for timely and effective resolution of problematic issues due to the continuous awareness and interaction of the involved individuals within the community. Indeed, Putnam states that “such networks facilitate coordination and communication, amplify reputations, and thus allow dilemmas of collective action to be
Robert Williams, the defendant had escaped out of a mental hospital and resided in Des Moines YMCA. A 10 years girl was reported missing in a wrestling match in YMCA. Williams became the main suspect of the young girls’ abduction after a young boy confessed to have seen him at the YMCA packing his car a large bundle of clothes with “skinny and white legs” on the same day the girl was missing. Williams turned himself in and was ready to confess only in the presence of his attorney in Des Moines. The investigating officer who drove him to Des Moines knew he was very religious and told Williams that the girl deserved a “Christian burial.” William responded with implicating assertions that led police to the young girls’
The case of Bridgestone vs. IBM presents an example that displays the importance of communication in cooperation between businesses. In brief, the American subsidiary of Bridgestone requested IBM to develop an extensive business system that will be capable of processing a large volume of orders. Due to several complications, the system developed by IBM was released behind schedule yet way earlier than the last steps of development, which resulted in millions of financial losses and the deterioration of both companies’ images. Analyzing the details of the case provides an understanding of common complications in significant projects and how improper execution of extensive projects can influence the reputation of collaborating companies.First, in defining what each side could do differently to improve the outcomes, one could notice immediately that both
companies had issues hindering their work and left them undiscussed. IBM had trouble working with a project already attempted several times by other vendors, which caused additional obstacles not previously discussed by the management. The obstacles resulted in delays in system release, and due to a lack of understanding in communication, Bridgestone proceeded with the release of the unfinished system. The simplest solution for Bridgestone that could have sufficiently improved the outcomes, in this case, was to postpone the release and give IBM time to finish the system. While delaying the system release could have resulted in additional expenses, the order data could have been saved without any threats to the existing customer base. Moreover, it seems that IBM insisted on running a testing launch of the system.
Therefore, the adverse outcomes could have been prevented if Bridgestone did not fail to process the vendor’s request and was not excessively focused on improving the existing system in a short time.Next, there is a significant difference in the harm that publicity around this project caused to the two companies. On the one hand, Bridgestone lost a substantial portion of customers, business partners, and brand supporters. Moreover, the company seemingly suffered crucial financial damage from unsuccessful system implementation, while the development of the system was out of Bridgestone’s competence. Thus, Bridgestone suffered more losses from the project’s failure than IBM. However, IBM’s image was more harmed by the event’s publicity when Bridgestone filed a suit against IBM. In addition to being charged in breach of contract, Bridgestone company
failed to fulfill its functions was harmed more by the event’s publicity.Lastly, considering the scale of the conflict between the two companies, it is surprising that both companies came to a mutual decision several years later. One week prior to jury selection in 2018, both companies decided to drop their claims, even though it was unclear whether any “monetary concessions” from the firms took place in the decision (Belden). In addition, both companies filed a motion with prejudice, which means that their decision is permanent and the lawsuit cannot be raised in the future. Therefore, it appears that in accepting their mistakes, the companies approached dealing with the negative consequences of the failed project with a more understanding approach than in the time of the system development.
Car theft constitutes an important problem in the United Kingdom and the countries of North America. The number of stolen motor vehicles has prompted lawmakers to obligate car manufacturers to make mechanical security more sophisticated. Although the theft rate has decreased, perpetrators found new ways to appropriate vehicles. The most prominent strategy is stealing keys, which give offenders access to cars. It is therefore essential to understand what ways of obtaining keys are used by car thieves.The main source of information on methods of key theft are offenders themselves. Incarcerated individuals, who were involved in car theft one way or another, participated in interviews. The respondents differed in race, age, and overall criminal record. The goal of interviews was to ascertain the intent of offenders, employ methods of
car theft, and other crime-related details. Although all respondents engaged in a car theft at some point, most of them were arrested for activities unrelated to car theft. It implies that stealing cars is a situational crime in many cases.There are several reasons for perpetration, presented by the offenders. The first is alert opportunism, which means that offenders did not intend to engage in cart theft, yet they recognized an easy opportunity. Such actions are not pre-planned, require minimal effort and have low risk. An important feature of alert opportunism is the responsibility of car owners, who fail to ensure basic security measures. Alert opportunism also does not imply that perpetrators were not planning to commit any crime at all. It is entirely possible that a person with
the intent of burglary found keys and took advantage of them.Another reason, which leads to auto theft, is active search. Unlike alert opportunists, who were not planning on stealing initially, active search presupposes criminal intent in the beginning. It should also be noted that car owners are once again responsible for presenting offenders with a theft opportunity. Active searchers seek open cars with keys left in them. Offenders also use people’s lack of caution to their advantage, by searching in highly populated areas and in places where alcohol drinking is rampant. In some cases, it is easier for offenders to wait until an opportunity arises, once again taking advantage of people’s carelessness. Some active searchers employ a more direct approach, such as infiltrating homes with the express intent
of stealing car keys.Both active searchers and alert opportunists avoid meeting car owners. However, there is a different strategy, which presupposes establishing contact with the owner. One way to obtain keys is to threaten owners with weapons. Another method is to use substances, which prevent victims from resisting a carjacking attempt. In both cases, a perpetrator meets a car owner and obtains keys from them with the use of objects that put victims’ lives at risk.There are various reasons for the offenders’ decision to engage in a carjacking. Sometimes, perpetrators are not skilled enough at stealing cars, which propels them to use force to obtain keys. Carjacking may also be the result of alert opportunism when offenders resort to presented carjacking opportunities while committing other crimes. Naturally, some
offenders purposely seek an owner with the desired car, physically confront them and obtain keys by force. Such an approach is an example of an active search for carjackers.However, meeting a car owner does not necessarily presuppose carjacking. Some offenders use manipulation techniques to persuade car owners to allow them in the vicinity of keys. It is important to understand that manipulation requires substantial preparation on the perpetrator’s end. In some cases, manipulators replace real keys with forged ones, which is initially unnoticed by owners. In other situations, offenders use clay to make a mould of keys. However, sometimes, manipulators convince owners into actually giving them keys or leaving the offender alone in a vehicle with keys in it. In all cases, manipulators use conversation techniques to keep
a victim distracted and unsuspecting of a potential crime.Keys are essential in starting a car, but obtaining one particular set of keys may not actually be necessary to do. There are keys that fit different models, which are known as master keys. These keys are obtained from official car dealerships under the pretext of accidentally locking a car with keys inside. Master keys are subsequently copied and distributed among other offenders. Another way of creating a set of master keys is by modifying an existing car key. Although using master keys is primarily limited to some cars manufactured in the 1900s, it does substantially facilitate car theft.Historically, the most preferred way of auto theft prevention the is mechanical improvement of security of cars. As vehicles become increasingly sophisticated,
so does the task of stealing them. Offenders’ strategy is now directed at obtaining car keys, which will allow them access to the vehicles. As a result, not only is the problem of auto theft not resolved, but it continues to be a serious public issue. It can even be stated that vehicle hardening may have actually propelled offenders to learn and become better at techniques allowing them to obtain car keys.The analysis of offenders who engage in car theft shows that opportunism does not account for all car-related crimes. While many offenders do take advantage of the opportunities presented by the carelessness of car owners, many of them are actually motivated to actively seek car owners. These perpetrators are rational in their perception of the challenges behind
focused on the security of car keys and their spares. The better owners can protect them, the more difficult it will be for perpetrators to obtain them.This advice is also applicable to commercial car dealerships, who regularly fail to identify perpetrators. Many offenders appear to be customers, while in reality, they are criminals who take advantage of salespeople’s carelessness. Ultimately, it is up to key owners to minimize the risk of key theft. It is entirely reasonable to suggest that without the negligence of regular people, many car thefts would not occur precisely because the potential offenders would not spot an easy opportunity. Considering the allure of easy rewards, it is essential to minimize the possibility of such circumstances.
In general, the business case for the Centers for Diabetes appears to be positive since the project is closely aligned with the needs of the community and the targets set by the Affordable Care Act (ACA). However, there are potential risks, as outlined in detail in the SWOT analysis, which has to be considered before the final decision is made. This note will detail the risks for the Centers for Diabetes and propose potential ways of mitigating them.First and foremost, the idea of a community health center that addresses the community health needs is closely aligned with the value-based care and the community focus that are the targets set by ACA. Moreover, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and Healthy People 2030 report cites the need to
focus on how health issues are managed from a community perspective and not an individual perspective. Hence, there is a threat of other healthcare facilities that receive reimbursements from Medicare and Medicaid in the county choosing to create a similar initiative. This is because diabetes is a common problem in the United States, affecting 10% of the general population and 14% of the Hispanic and African-American community.The only way to mitigate this risk is to begin marketing and outreach activities as soon as the project is approved and there is funding to support the further stages of operations. In this way, the community will become familiarized with the hospital and the Center, and even if other similar initiatives arise, this Center will already have an established brand image,
which can guarantee that it will also have visitors.The second significant issue identified in the report is the financial statements, since based on the assessments, the reimbursements, revenue, and grant funding will be insufficient to cover the costs of staffing and operations. Hence, there is a need to either add services that can be reimbursed under ACA or obtain an additional source of funding. Alternatively, there can be an option for cutting the costs, for example, having fewer community workers or reducing the expenditures associated with traveling to help ensure that the funds that this Center will have been covering these expenses. However, it is a better option to request additional grant funding as it is vital to make certain that this Center addresses the health education needs
health center to advocate for their health education and self-care, and in return, support the operations of this facility.In summary, this note identifies the potential risks that the Center for Diabetes may face. The two main concerns that should be considered before the launch of the Center for Diabetes are the potential threat of other community initiatives addressing the same health disparity. This issue can be resolved through early outreach and marketing. The second problem is the funding issue, as the financial statements make it clear that the revenue and grant will not be enough to cover the operational costs. Hence, the Center has an option of additional services, requesting additional grants, or asking for support from the hospital.
IntroductionArt is a phenomenon encompassing the innovative expression of humanistic dimensions on contemporary elements. Over the decades, the evolutionary cycle fostered advancement and adjustments of the practice across different domains. In this case, distinct regions uphold dynamic perspectives concerning artistry despite its distinctive sections. The UAE and more broadly the Arabian Gulf’s art scene has evolved in substantial ways over the past decades. As this part of the world witnessed exponential growth in infrastructure, industrial development, and the influx of talent, so has the landscape of modern and digitized art. This has led to a boom of artists, both locally and internationally, who are challenging the old models of curatorial interpretation and audience engagement and leveraging a robust ecosystem that offers greater support for their work (Amiri, 2021).
The contrast between traditional and modern art fosters derivation of imminent challenges towards promoting evolvement in the artistic spectrum. The research problem entails assessing the dynamic matters influencing emerging artists and the promotion of inchoate art scenes.Research QuestionWhat are the challenges facing emerging artists in modern art scenes?Thesis StatementThe contrast between modern and traditional art is one of the significant challenges facing artists in the emerging art scenes due to the optimal evolutionary prompt for innovation and creativity.Literature ReviewThe Evolution of ArtThe Flemish art period between the fifteenth and seventeenth centuries involved significant and dynamic events in the historical mark in the field of artistry. The different events that proficiently attributed to the Flemish concept encompassed Late Gothic, Renaissance, and Baroque. During these eras, pioneers portrayed profound insight
into the evolution of frameworks in the art world. One of the major evolutionary gradients during the Flemish art period engulfed the optimal use of oil for painting. According to the researchers, the initiative steered the in-depth use of realism perspective in the paintings’ shaping, texture, and structuring (Fong & Ng, 2020). In this case, the artists integrated daily livelihoods with artistry to enhance real-life experiences. Primarily, the renaissance, also known as rebirth, fostered the prominent consideration of humanism in the field of art that rendered the integration of modernism and the Greco-Roman cultural frameworks.Renaissance is a major historical event during the Flemish art era between the fifteenth and seventeenth century, posing significant insight regarding artistry. According to the researcher, the Flemish art period set off with the
late gothic era encompassing (Al Khayyal et al., 2020). The late gothic era enshrined the emergence of distinct architectural designs, such as ornate, flying buttresses, ribbed vaults, the window glasses stained with different colors (Akhmetshin et al., 2018). The architectural designs render the optimal consideration of the dynamic cultural representation across Europe, mainly in Britain, France, and the Netherlands. The late gothic period formed the foundation for the emergence of the renaissance era mainly as a result of the integration of various early renaissance ideologies for the architectural structures. Apart from the late gothic era, the baroque period involved the utilization of bright colors (Amiri, 2021), miniatures, and stained-glass windows. Essentially, the late gothic and baroque contributed to the introduction of the renaissance period through the evolutionary aspect
in the painting practice.Abstract versus Realism in ArtArt is a vital factor of practice mainly as a result of the prominent integration of visual and real-life experiences. During the early and mid-gothic era, the artists focused on contemporary objects during the drawings. However, the emergence of Flemish art encompassed the alteration of the perspectives, mainly the incorporation of humanism. Humanism is the practice of integrating artistry approaches with the significance of people and the dynamic philosophical constructs (Erie, 2019). An excellent example of a renaissance artist is Michelangelo, an Italian whose famous work is the Sistine Chapel, demonstrating theology’s rebirth. According to Michelangelo, it is crucial to use art as a visual depiction of reality (Li, 2021). Therefore, the expert utilizes the religiosity approach to enhance humanism and
realism within the artistic spectrum.Studying renaissance under the spectral view of humanism and realism fosters a profound overview regarding the interdependence between artworld and contemporary issues. Previously, Flemish art regarded the prominent use of abstract images, posing minimalist meaning to artworld mainly because of the lack of relevance to integral real-world endeavours. In this case, one of the elements of the real events during Flemish art encompassed intensifying the significance of artistry to people and the community (Salisbury, 2020). Michelangelo focused on enhancing the visual meaning of Jesus’ feast with his disciples through the painting of entities on the Sistine Chapel wall. The initiative fostered the appreciation of art locally and globally due to the humanistic perspective on ideological practices. Primarily, Michelangelo spearheads the evolutionary scale in theology
based on integrating historical accounts with visual perspectives.Gradients promoting Art’s Aesthetic ValueRenaissance fostered the alteration of the dynamic philosophical constructs in the innovative and creative perspectives. Apart from painting using oil, the artists incorporate distinct values on using various colors to enhance the visualization of the realm. In this case, colorations fostered the abstract meaning of life and the environmental mainframes articulating the individualistic personality. A researcher agrees that a different event that fostered socio-cultural and economic growth and development is capitalism (Salisbury, 2020). The concept enshrines the private ownership of property and wealth accumulation hence the individualistic essence in the international community. The rebirth era prominently influenced the dynamism of interactions among personnel and business competence. While the art world evolved along the gradient of humanism and
realism, society exploited the capitalist approach to boost the living quotient among individuals. Fundamentally, the Flemish art intensified the visual and contemporary perspective regarding the interdependent relationship between artistry and business performances.A significant percentage of the global population focused on innovation’s integral aspect, hence the intensification in business competence. In research, the author indicates that the reflection of the individualistic nature among people spanned through the artistic and economic structures. During the renaissance period, societies focused on intensifying economic growth, hence adopting dynamic frameworks and the emergence of social classification perspectives. The researcher further argues that technological advancement is an initiative that attributed to the rebirth of the Greco-Roman era that involved intense business operations and trading activities (Kryzmowski, 2022). The integration of the ideological perspectives regarding enterprise
transactions enhanced the overview and enhancement of people’s attitude on diversity. Creativity and innovation significantly contribute to boosting the living conditions among community members. An excellent example is the utilization of innovation in the architectural industry to render the construction of sustainable structures and settlement areas. Dynamism is an integral feature towards promoting growth index across distinct societies.Art Practices in Different RegionsInnovation and creativity bridge the gap between modernism and traditional appeals across the different facets of human activities. The Flemish art significantly affected the key articulation of individualism despite the profound emergence of mainframes and concepts through various phases, namely late gothic, baroque, and the renaissance to establish realism (Li, 2021). As a multidimensional phenomenon, Flemish art enhances the integration of modernism with the Roman aspects on
architectural designs and the Greek’s philosophical overviews, Napoleonic constructs. As a result, the study of the concepts fosters an insight into the evolutionary process among people while advocating for the emergence of modern society. Hong Kong and Singapore are excellent examples of countries that proficiently integrate traditional and contemporary art.Asian countries prominently use traditional medicine to treat different diseases in the modern era. The approach renders the profound impact of conventional art despite the evolutionary process. Xin et al. (2020) postulate that a significant percentage of Chinese mainly prefer conventional practices as remedies to alleviating illness. Although current medications pose distinctive effects, the majority of Chinese rely on traditional aspects. In a different spectrum, Singaporeans highly value dynamic aspects of art, mainly portraiture and ink painting. Fong and
Ng (2020) establish that the Singapore government optimally invests in conventional art as a strategy of promoting the country’s social identity while incorporating modern perspectives for better preservation of the aesthetic value. On the one hand, the initiative renders an adept opportunity to market conventional art internationally. On the other hand, the mainframe fosters a risk of acculturation. Aesthetically, it is vital to integrate modern and traditional art to appreciate the implications of the evolutionary process. Art exists in different forms thus the importance of appreciating the transition from the classical era to the present artistic structures and perceptions.Relevance of Art’s Evolutionary in UAEThe UAE is one of the members of the Gulf Cooperation Council hence attaining optimal support concerning economic development. As an Islamic state, the government
highly regards Muslims and their beliefs despite the incorporation of diversity-based religious practices and policies. The UAE administration further advocates creativity and innovation under the spectrum of distinctive elements, such as sports and architecture (Al Sallal et al., 2018). Historically, the Emiratis were nomads living in an arid and semi-arid area. However, technological advancement and unity fostered growth and diversification of socio-economic and political domains. Emerging artists are representatives of UAE entrepreneurs utilizing conceptions as formative strategies to intensify business practices within the country and abroad.Over the decades, one of the significant challenges affecting the distribution of benefits in the UAE entails gender disparity in the participation scale concerning business growth and development. Evolution steered by technological advancement fostered the necessity of equity despite gender identity. UAE is
one of the countries due to the focus on enhancing sustainability practice across the enterprise world. As a result, different government institutions focused on achieving the primary goal of boosting business performance against the outlying essence of independence. The emergent concept that stimulated the emergence of UAE as one of the safest countries globally is the advocacy for the participation of all parties. In research, entities rendered implementation process of entrepreneurial empowerment initiatives among men and women to enhance gender equality. The UAE government seeks to establish an economy that empowers locals with optimal productivity while appreciating the globalization mainframe (Salisbury, 2020). Globalization emerged as a result of effective technological advancement. In this case, individuals from different states significantly exchanged information and networked, causing a global village loop.It
is the responsibility of government institutions to implement policies that steer social justice and equality. Ethnicity and gender differences negatively affected the quality of interactions among personnel, causing an uproar among the UAE. Therefore, the UAE government implemented business policies to improve a sustainable enterprise environment for investors despite gender differences. Different indicators attributed to the establishment of competent business and entrepreneurs’ empowerment, such as advancing infrastructure and talent management among residents. Dubai is one of the cities that encounters a significant change in determining the quality of interaction among locals, promoting sustainability. As one of the ideal tourist destinations globally, the UAE government offers incentives among men and women to intensify the trickle-down effect of accrued benefits among the residents with minimal revenue leakage (Salisbury, 2020). Despite
the influx of clients in the country, the nation faces an increase in foreign workers whose salaries are transferred to their respective countries’ bank accounts. As a result, it is crucial to appreciate UAE entrepreneurs’ empowerment in the spectral view of entrepreneurial opportunities.In the digital era, online business boomed fostering a prominent impact on national economic growth and development. Research by Krzymowski (2022) establishes that the digitization of dynamic economic activities demands the implementation of policies empowering entrepreneurs in the UAE. The researchers further illustrate that promoting gender equality within the entrepreneurial world is an opportunity within the UAE economic spectrum to enhance profitability and growth. Apart from advocating for empowerment, it is crucial to establish key variants that influence men and women involvement in business establishment and
management. Empowerment encapsulates the indication of major factors enhancing effective decision-making. There are dynamic government interventions that elevate the performance of business entities. However, it is vital that the parties involved focus on promoting sustainability by appreciating productivity within the scope of distinct problem-solving perspectives.The personal traits of an individual attribute to the capacity of investing in entrepreneurial opportunities. In the study by Erie (2019), the research indicates profound results regarding the personality values that foster the emergence of entrepreneurs. The investigation encapsulated assessing the core factors that render students as entrepreneurs. In this case, the factors derived included entrepreneurial confidence, orientation, cultural support, and learning institutions’ support for entrepreneurship. Despite the dynamic indicators, Erie (2019) established that entrepreneurial confidence is significantly attributed to engagement in entrepreneurship. Primarily,
the research indicates that effective entrepreneurship empowerment enshrines advocacy for entrepreneurial confidence among distinct parties. Optimal integration of values fosters proficiency in appreciating individuality and the development of a productive investor across the UAE.It is the responsibility of the UAE government to incorporate measures that advocate equality within the scope of entrepreneurial empowerment. UAE is one of the Asian countries highly developing mainly because of prominent investment in infrastructural development. The intensification in urbanization attributes to the establishment of a suitable investment environment for foreigners. Empowering entrepreneurs in UAE is an approach that fosters equipping individuals with proficient skills and knowledge for innovative and business perspectives (Pauceanu et al., 2021). Apart from advocating for the influx of foreign investors in Dubai, it is important to intensify the pool
of residents engaging in entrepreneurial opportunities. The strategy elevates the trickle-down effect on accrual benefits based on the participation of residents in business practices. Major initiatives that promote entrepreneurial empowerment include financial literacy and determining distinct government intervention techniques. The advocacy for entrepreneurial empowerment is a multidimensional aspect that enhances optimal business competition and the adoption of innovative techniques elevating standards of operations.Analysis FrameworkSocial growth and development is an entity that encompasses the interplay of dynamic elements to boost performance outlier. The different ideologies that render an understanding to challenges facing emerging artists include functionalism and Marxism that profoundly establish a relationship between human behavioral patterns and virtuosity (Akhmetshin et al., 2018). Functionalism defines society as a multidimensional phenomenon whose advancement depends on the coordination among all stakeholders.
Marxism indicates that capitalism is an essential factor within the populace since it asserts the balance between the rich and the laborers. According to the Marxism framework, the significance of commercialism is the provision of opportunities to workers in equally accumulating wealth akin to the employers. Marxism and functionalism prominently explore the effect of imbalance in the distribution of resources among individuals. The mainframe interwove promotion of art as alleviation of key challenges among the emerging artists.Methodological ConsiderationsResearch QuestionsMain Research QuestionWhat challenges are emerging artists facing in the emerging art scene?Secondary Research Questions  * What is the contrast between traditional and modern art?  * What are the challenges facing emerging artists?  * What is the implication of issues among artists to emerging art scenes?The research
process entails a qualitative method using case studies for the assessment of the challenges affecting emerging artists in the emerging art scenes. This study focuses on the necessity of incorporating measures that alleviate negative effects on the societies and promotion of traditional and modern art. Innovation is an essential element across the global domain enhancing socio-cultural identity. The exploration of Hong Kong, Singapore, and UAE cultural facets fosters an understanding of evolutionary gradient and dynamic implications.Analysis and DiscussionDifferent countries significantly promote the art scene across distinct practices despite the emergent challenges. One of the major issues in artistry is the integration of traditional and modern art. Krzymowski (2022) postulates that the UAE proficiently supports innovation among the citizens based on the incorporation of policies enhancing entrepreneurial opportunities. The
of art is creativity hence the importance of implementing guidelines protecting the key meaning of a construct. In this case, the UAE, Hong Kong, and Singapore residents significantly maintain their traditions and incorporate minimal modernist dimensions.ConclusionIt is crucial to establish policies that promote interdependence between traditional and modern art to alleviate the core challenges. The main issues affecting emerging artists include the digitization of art and the intensification of technological advancement. Although the frameworks render an empowerment tool to diversify perspectives, it is crucial to indicate vital entities that protect aesthetic essence. UAE, Hong Kong, and Singapore prominently preserve their conventional cultural practices to boost social identity among personalities while advocating morality and ethical domains.
IntroductionThe shifts in attitudes of people towards romantic relationships and, more specifically, marriage are attributes of societal development. From this perspective, the trends common for Gen Z are incredibly informative and, therefore, used for analyzing the situation in this area (Klein, 2022). It is clear that individuals’ mindsets are formed under the influence of external circumstances, which implies the correlation of opinions about love and sex with the presence of threats to personal well-being. Hence, one cannot examine the accompanying phenomena and cause-and-effect relationships while neglecting either the human factor or the conditions of the environment. One of the articles devoted to the subject is “Are Gen Z more pragmatic about love and sex?” and its critical analysis can reveal the elements of effective writing intended for considering
complex events.Summary of the ArticleIn the selected piece, Jessica Klein narrates the tendency for representatives of Gen Z to postpone marriage and avoid long-term relationships while prioritizing personal issues. Compared to previous generations, these individuals do not view this area as a natural condition for entering adulthood due to a number of reasons. First, the advantages of single life are more attractive than settling down and help them satisfy their need for introspection (Klein, 2022).Second, people in this group adopt a pragmatic approach to the matter because they understand the necessity of gaining stability in life in order to have a family (Klein, 2022). Third, Gen Zers face more problems than their parents due to the pandemic and prefer to reflect on the kind of person they want
a possible orientation on the information received from the participants and, consequently, confirms the reliability of conclusions for conducting further research. The overall extensiveness of this publication is also supported by the inclusion of personal opinions alongside the studies mentioned above (Klein, 2022). In this way, the selection of appropriate instruments for the purposes of this article is one of its main advantages.External and Internal Factors
An initial reaction rate is an instant rate at the beginning of the response. The graph has the y and x-axis, y stands for the concentration of moles per liter, and x stands for time in seconds. In this case, the chemical reaction is going against time; at the beginning of the response, the chemical concentration is very high, hence considered a positive reaction. As time goes by, the slope decreases, giving a negative curve; therefore, the reactant concentration reduces within an interval of time.Instantaneous rate is an instant rate in time with differential rate, the reactant against time. The instant calculation is by determining the negativity of the slope and the curve for the concentration of the moles per liter against time in seconds (Du et al.,
The choice of ship is connected with the running costs of transportation. Stopford (2009) claims that the best way to reduce costs is to select newer ships, which require fewer crewmembers, less maintenance, and are more reliable. While all of these points are true, they do not automatically make newer ships the preferable choice for shipping costs. As it stands, 65% of all cargo ships in the world are over 14 years old, meaning that competition for newer ships is intense (Cheng, 2021). High demand means increased costs, which was demonstrated by the increase in cargo rates in 2021, and previously in 2016 (Cheng, 2021). Both of these surges saw a rise in demand for older ship services.As a rule, the offered costs of shipping by older vessels
two-thirds of the world’s cargo being ferried by older ships, Stopford’s conclusions about newer ships being better are rendered moot. While, on paper, such a conclusion seems obvious, in reality, a company has to contend with changing transportation rates (which are higher for newer ships), availability, and a myriad of other factors. If shipments are frequent and cannot afford delays, the shipper will have to go not with the best possible solution but with what is available at hand. Chances are, it will be an older ship.
Nursing Theory Case StudyThe measurable nursing desired outcome related to improving the chronic obstructive pulmonary disease patient’s condition is to retain respiratory stability with concise respirations. Another anticipated result is for the patient to exhibit behavior patterns that strengthen airway clearance, such as coughing successfully and expectorating secretions. Additional goals regarding the above include the advancement of the patients presenting improved respiratory rate, personal autonomy in self-care operations, improvement in exercise prejudice, and nutrient requirements that meet calorie consumption. The present research looks at frequently utilized quality indicators such as pulmonary function, overall health, exercise performance and activity level, dyspnea, acute episodes, the multifaceted BODE rating, and death rates. The current clinical practice is producing the intended care outcomes. The 75-year –old Native American has shown some improvement
in his exercise performance activity level and overall health.One of the theories of care that have been developed to help direct nursing and improve the outcomes for the hospitalized patient is the ‘care-based on-oxygenation’ (CBOO) theory. This theory focuses on providing the best possible care to the patient based on the level of oxygenation in his blood. The concept is founded on research that shows that giving the best possible care to the patient leads to improved consequences. Moreover, it is also a way of delivering care focused on the needs of the COPD patient and oxygenation to achieve the very best possible results for the client.Concept MapThe International Council of Nursing (ICN) and the World Health Organization (WHO) developed a nursing theory that asserts that the nursing
profession is an interrelated phase of human experience that provides, but not restricted to, the socioeconomic, structural, and universal healthcare framework. Nursing theory is essential to understand the nursing assistant’s role, feature, and procedure concerning a person, household, and community. The patient care role, purpose, and practice environment are characterized as an interconnected core of personal experience that provides the interpersonal, structural, sentimental, psychological, religious, and cultural milieu of the particular participant. According to this theory, nursing practice is not limited to the context and placing of the health care system.Nursing theory provides a basic understanding of core concepts, allowing many in the career field to clarify what they are doing for sick people and why they do it. This is especially essential because it enables nurses to
express information that proves the methods and techniques that underpin their profession (Suthasini, 2018). They also discover critical thinking skills, which allow them to recognize and apply data, scientific proof, and concepts from a wide range of sources and layouts.An individual who has studied nursing theory as a registered nurse has influenced their practice. It is time to delve slightly deeper now that they are in nursing education. Critical thinking and problem-solving are central to health care since both have been established through a comprehensive examination of the base of information and applying theory in the healthcare setting. Individuals can use their critical thinking skills to recognize research gaps, investigate multiple viewpoints, and summarize fresh concepts as critical thinkers.Nursing theory teaches everyone to think like a nurse by
implementing clinical reasoning and critical thinking in real-world clinical environments. Individuals will learn the meaning of nursing theory, various theoretical approaches, and how to differentiate between legitimate and invalid hypotheses in the theory class. You will also know how to develop nursing theories in a healthcare setting, which also will assist one in making rational choices and providing the best care to their patient populations. As a registered nurse (RN), one’s role would be to provide vision and management in a set-up that emphasizes treatment, convenience, and preventative measures (Thelakkadan & Chacko, 2021). As a manager, they will contribute to the definition of nursing theory notions and clinical decision-making required to provide protected, efficient treatment to those in greatest need. A healthcare professional, one will be skilled at
Global climate change, as has now been proven by the latest research, is caused by human activity. Awareness of the seriousness of the situation is gradually penetrating into world public opinion. There is still an opportunity to mitigate the consequences to avoid the worst. People can all unite in order to change the situation, even though this process may be gradual and take some time.The main difficulty is connected with the extremely uneven distribution of greenhouse gas emissions between developed and developing countries, large and small. However, it is possible to change the situation by taking small steps. For instance, the population should use public transportation instead of cars. When using cars, there is an enormous amount of exhaustive fumes released in the atmosphere. This initiative can contribute
The book, “Coaching habit: Say less, ask more & change the way you lead forever”, is by Stanier M. Bungay. The publication was released in 2016 through Box of Crayons Press. The author and publishers claim that they give “managers practical tools so they can coach in ten minutes or less” (Bungay, 2016, p. 1). One major argument that comes up is that silence does not mean lack of knowledge or disrespect. This element has been stresses in some chapters of the book due to the fact that a significant majority of managers often associate silence to some level of disrespect. According to the scholar, many times, silence might also suggest a critical and keen thought process. Notably, the scholar explains that proper coaching would help managers and
explains that it is a question “in which you discover the power of an opening question that gets the conversation happening fast and deep” (Bungay, 2016, p. 36). It can be argued that listening is a key element of any type of coaching. This can be linked to various studies that have been done on the same topic. Bungay (2016) uses this as his conclusion and it can be debated that it sums up the topic well.
At the moment, AIDS is becoming quite widespread, despite all the preventive and familiarization measures carried out in educational institutions. Thus, in order to improve the situation, college administrations are introducing various measures to combat the problem. The educational organization, Camden County College decided to install dispensers with condoms in the toilets. Henceforth, this work aims to prove that condom dispensers are an effective measure to lower the incidence of AIDS in adolescents, increase the credibility of college and develop sexual education and awareness.Therefore, as already mentioned, Camden County College decided to install special dispensers in the toilets of the educational organization. The main problem was the ambiguity of opinions about this decision. However, this work believes that this initiative can play a positive role in changing the
dynamics of sexually transmitted diseases and acquired immunodeficiency syndrome or AIDS. At the moment, it is noted that the age of sexual activity is significantly reduced. Research shows that “in a nationally representative survey of college students, only 58% of sexually active students reported condom use at last vaginal intercourse” (The Condom Dispenser Initiative para. 1). Further, one of the sources indicated that “The contributing factors are the cost, lack of convenient access, social norms, and lack of knowledge on how to use a condom effectively” (Turner 2). These indicators are disappointing since, at the same time, the risk of contracting a dangerous disease increases. Moreover, feelings of shame or lack of money can also influence the decision of young people to neglect contraceptives.Limited access to protective equipment
such as condoms is the most important obstacle in the fight against sexually transmitted diseases in young people. Hence, when installing dispensers, the incidence rate can significantly improve since it directly affects the issue. Every young person cannot worry about buying a contraceptive measure. Particular influence in this process should be paid attention to the aspect that the introduction and improvement of sexual education are crucial. It is vital to instill in students the importance of following the rules of contraception and how important it is not to have promiscuous sexual relations. This will allow a positive response to the installation of dispensers with condoms in the toilet. An equally important role is played by the social factor, which can hinder the success of the introduction of dispensers
The following paper briefly compares and contrasts the corporate social responsibilities, ethics, and diversity in Walmart, Amazon, and Apple Inc. Walmart is an American multi-global retail corporation that is presently the world’s largest business entity as per Fortune Global 500 in 2020. On the Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) front, Walmart believes in promoting the business and benefiting consumers and society. Firstly, the company emphasizes sustainability to make the world a better place by creating sustainable products, conserving nature, and eliminating dangerous emissions and sources of waste (Walmart, 2022). Moreover, the entity promotes volunteerism amongst its employees and engages in charity globally, including participating in food donations, conducting food security campaigns, and offering financial support to the needy.Amazon, founded by Jeff Bezos, is an American multinational company that delves
into technology, artificial intelligence, computing, streaming, and e-commerce. Like Walmart, Amazon is also heavy on environmental sustainability initiatives as a CSR function. During the COVID-19 pandemic, the entity ramped up CSR programs to further include the provision of food relief, educational support, and housing (Amazon, 2022). Nevertheless, some criticism arose during the pandemic concerning its working conditions and PPEs for workers.Like Amazon, Apple is another American multi-global technology enterprise that focuses on online services, software, and consumer electronics. According to Apple Inc. (2022), the company is also big on environmental initiatives through its active engagement on climate change issues, environmental sustainability and strategy initiatives, after-sales services, and a global recycling program. Apple is a leading player in the Product Red initiative that supports the global fund to combat
HIV, malaria, and TB. However, the business also faced accusations of poor working conditions in its outsourced facilities globally.According to its webpage, Walmart’s ethics revolve primarily around integrity, excellence, service, and respect. The company remains fully committed to ensuring its food products are safe and that the technologies used are ethical and sustainable (Walmart, 2022). The company prides itself on always investigating concerns raised by stakeholders, associates, and consumers. However, specific issues continue to emerge concerning employee handling. Some workers lament that the company treats them like robots rather than human beings, focusing on maintaining high employee productivity. Also, the company can let go of its workers without any warning due to perceived low productivity.Amazon’s mission statement aims to provide a healthy and safe workplace devoid of danger
and harassment and enhance employee freedoms to ensure they execute their roles unhindered. Hence, the company discourages any action that would imperil the clients, suppliers, and employees (Amazon, 2022). However, mixed reports are rife as to whether the company treats its employees ethically. Despite their schedule flexibility, good benefits, and high pay rates, some employees complain that the company overworks them, just as in Walmart’s case.Even though Apple’s management continues to stress its adherence to ethical standards, numerous complaints of unethical practices exist. These complaints touch on political influence, anti-social finance, irresponsible marketing, arms and military supply, and environmental pollution. In 2019, the Guardian reported accusations against Apple from the Democratic Republic of Congo where children died, and many others suffered severe injuries while working in cobalt mines
claims to receive its diverse perspectives from a pool of employees of various ages, genders, races, national origins, professional and life experiences, education, culture, and sexual orientation. The company has over 13 employee resource groups and about 90,000 employees in hundreds of branches globally (Amazon, 2022). On its part, Apple claims to be an accurate reflection of the contemporary world. According to figures from 2020, the company significantly increased the number of employees from underrepresented communities, including Black, Hispanic, and female employees (Apple Inc., 2022). Thus, being multinational entities, the three companies have good employee diversity.
The main impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on businesses is reflected in the havoc that this pandemic has caused to the global supply chains. Mainly, many suppliers could not produce goods for a while due to safety restrictions. Others could not deliver them due to overloaded ports, extremely high freight rates, and displaced shipping containers, among other issues. Although the pandemic’s effect had lessened over the last year when the vaccines were introduced and people were allowed to leave their homes, the effect of this global catastrophe on the supply chains prevails.The most significant impact of the pandemic and the changes within the business environments are seen with small businesses. This can be seen in the example of Amazon’s growth, which was picked during the beginning of the
pandemic. As people were ordered by their governments to stay at home, the majority of consumers chose online shopping to satisfy their needs. Hence, the customers ordered most of their items online, including groceries, clothes, personal items, and other things. Amazon was thriving with its ability to deliver goods through its developed system of supply chains, while small brick-and-mortar stores were forced to close because they could not sustain not having profits for months. Moreover, these small businesses did not have the finances to invest in establishing websites and delivery services. Apart from this, Amazon has been accused of using data from its small suppliers to popular copycat items and selling them under Amazon’s brand. Hence, the internet retail giant has the resources and capabilities to overshadow any
small business, which makes the competitive environment very challenging for small businesses, even in the post-pandemic times.Evidently, the lack of the company’s ability to get goods from suppliers has become one of the major threats to the business’s growth and development. Hence, in the post-pandemic time, executives will have to rethink the role of supply chains in their strategic plans and dedicate more attention to creating supply chains that are effective. Moreover, even when the freight rates reduce to their previous levels, the executives might want to rethink where they purchase their goods and choose local suppliers over the ones in China or developing states. This option would be safer in the case of another disruption, and considering the ongoing issues with shipments that companies currently experience, the
and businesses should restructure themselves to prepare for the new challenges. Mainly, over the two years that the pandemic has been active, consumers have gotten used to purchasing items mostly online. This is both convenient and allows one to save time and effort, and it is unlikely that consumers will revert to offline shopping when all of the restrictions are lifted. As for companies, many executives had to find ways to support their operations when the supply chains were disrupted. These new approaches allowed businesses to thrive during the pandemic, and it is possible that these business models will continue to be used in the future. Therefore, the changes in the business environment caused by the pandemic will most likely prevail in the future.
As at 2nd March 3, 2022 the number of COVID-19 global confirmed deaths are 437,333,859 (World Health Organization). Elsewhere, the number of deaths in the whole world are 5,960,972 (World Health Organization). In the United States of America, the total number of COVID-19 infections case so far are over 79 million, while deaths are estimated to be close to 952,000 (World Health Organization). In European countries such as the United Kingdom, the total COVID-19 cases so far are 19M, India 42.9M, Brazil 28.8M, and France 22.2M (World Health Organization). In term of deaths, India has 514,000 cases, Brazil has 650,000, France 136,000, and United Kingdom has 162,000 (World Health Organization). In Africa, and other developing countries, case of COVID-19 outbreak and deaths have increased drastically since the virus
was reported in China. For instance, in Kenya, there are 323,000 reported cases so far and estimated 5,639 deaths (World Health Organization).It reported that half of the total mortalities in the world are from developing countries. In relation to vaccination statistics, one should note that at least 10.7 billion of coronavirus vaccines have been administered so far across 233 locations in the world. This has been so far been achieved in 184 countries. In the United States, a total number of 553 million doses have been administered while 140 million doses in the United Kingdom (World Health Organization). In Africa as a continent, only 587 million people have been vaccinated so far, an indication that African countries are far and wide experiencing numerous challenges in as far as
vaccinating its people is concerned.The United States pharmaceutical companies-Pfizer, Moderna, and Johnson and Johnson should be required to expressly share their COVID-19 vaccine recipes as well as the technology with other countries especially developing ones. This has been a shared feeling since last year specifically as it concerns Moderna, which was the upstart biotech firm that was by far involved in complete manufacturing and development of vaccines using billions of dollars from taxpayers’ money (Nolen and Stolberg). In essence, it does not make sense when the developed countries are more than three quarter fully vaccinated in term of the whole populations while the developing countries particularly in Africa and other part of the world have vaccinated less than 10% of its people. This explains why the United States
health officials feel that the three companies have a greater responsibility in addressing the present global vaccine shortage (Nolen and Stolberg). In his word, President Biden highlighted that he believes America will never be same unless other parts of the globe are safe and their people are vaccinated from the virus.In reality, it makes no sense when some countries have made serious positive steps in term of vaccination while others are still lagging behind. COVID-19 is easily spread and if the developed countries do not take a serious initiative towards addressing the current issues, it will reciprocate and affect such countries. The silver lining in all of these issues is that President Joe Biden’s administration has urged these pharmaceutical companies to enter to joint ventures where it would
be possible to license their unique yet important technologies to contract manufacturer for purpose of offering vaccines to low- and middle-income nations (Nolen and Stolberg). While that is not enough, if these companies do no oblige with the president’s request, he should invoke the Defense Production Act. This act was enacted in 1950 and it requires the president to use his or her authority to require companies such as Moderna to urgently prioritize specific government contracts for the purpose of medical supplies to deal with national emergencies such as COVID-19.Specifically, President Biden should direct the pharmaceutical companies to strictly expand their production of COVID-19 vaccines to developing countries to deal with the present low vaccine uptake crises in the mentioned regions. The Defense Production Act would require the
disparity in terms of vaccine administration between developed and developing nations. Countries such as the United States should be at the forefront in directing and encouraging their leading pharmaceutical companies to share their technology with private companies in developing countries to deal with the existing disparity. In the end, it would mean that a collective responsibility would be the key towards dealing and complete management of the pandemic.
During the studying, I learned the essentials of great interconnection between crimes and the media that talk about these crimes. The main factor here is that the media form the perception of people about the crime level in a community and police response to it. It is common situation when local media create the picture of predatory world full of murderers and crimers, while the statictics can say the opposite. To be an intelligent user of media sources, a person should have skills to weigh different points of view to formulate the true findings and rely on reputable statistics on crime.The modern American society lives in the world of numerous media coupled with the “new media” in forms of blogs, social networks profiles, and personal sites. As a
to emphasize that Rittenhaus tried to stop violence rather than provoke it (Pollak, 2021). At the same time, left-wing media MSNBC published the blog with the title “Kyle Rittenhouse trial was designed to protect white conservatives who kill” (Jones, 2021). It is evident that the way how an average person will interpret the case will be influenced by the choice of media outlet. Thus, the political polarization impacts the way how crimes are understood in society.
From 2016 to 2018, this study summarizes sport fisheries in the Anchorage Management Area. They contained a description and historical background of each sport fishery, as well as information on how each fishery is now managed, as well as performance and escapement data for 2016–2018. According to the report, reductions in the number and size of fish available for release in locally stocked lakes have had a detrimental impact on local fisheries’ popularity and productivity. It should be mentioned that because this source gives statistical data, it may be trusted. All of this will surely be beneficial to the study, as official data must be considered.The sport fisheries in the North Gulf Coast Management Area are discussed in this study. A summary and overview of each fishery are
harvest statistics and literature reviews. The four case studies looked at how fishers, fleets, and communities responded to various interconnected stressors, such as biological decreases, market and pricing dynamics, and fisheries privatization. Experts also verified this article, which is reflected in the reliability and accuracy of the information provided. It will be useful for research because it reflects current trends and factors affecting the spread of sport fishing.
History and Impact of Employing Women and Minorities in Law EnforcementLaw enforcement shows how laws are enforced and public order is maintained. White men have been disproportionately holding positions in this field for a long time. Nowadays, the situation is different, and more women and minorities are encouraged to join law enforcement professions to reduce the impact of bureaucracy and other biases. The first women and African Americans were hired as police officers in the middle of the 19th century. In the middle of the 20th century, the Civil Rights Act removed other discrimination-based debates and supported equality in public accommodations. Racial diversification of law enforcement organizations is favored to increase confidence in the police and improve police-minority relations (Sever et al., 2018). Women in law enforcement also
The case Danovic v. Wagner addresses the claim of Emina Danovic, an unemployed senior woman, against a university professor Graham Wagner for the failure of their relationships that caused her mental health issues and emotional sufferings. From a personal perspective, what stands out about this case is its nature. In other words, an emotionally unstable woman is seeking revenge when her needs were not satisfied, however, she was clearly informed by the defendant that they would not be satisfied, and she gave her agreement. Thus, it goes without saying that the most unpleasant aspect of this case is the plaintiff’s behavior, actions, and the claim itself. It does not identify the cause of action and does not contain the material facts’ concise statement and prayer for relief (“Danovic
Shown above is a schematic of the electron transport chain (ETC) in a typical animal cell. NADH (not shown) donates electrons to Flavin mononucleotide (FMN), and FADH 2 donates electrons to an iron-sulfur complex (FeS), which donates them to ubiquinone (Q).How does transfer of electrons from one carrier to another in the ETC generate a proton gradient across the inner mitochondrial membrane?Electron transport along the transport chain is associated with a redistribution of charges in the mitochondrial membrane, resulting in excess or insufficient potential locally in certain areas. Protons tend to make up for the insufficient potential, so they will migrate to places of decreased charge or move away from places of increased charge.There are poisons that can specifically block or hinder either FMN or the Fe-S in
complex II that accepts electrons from FADH 2 . Which poison (against FMN, or against the Fe-S in complex II) will have a more detrimental effect on the proton gradient, and why?FMNH2 poisoning is expected to have a more deleterious effect on the proton gradient because one of the primary chains of electron migration within the membrane is disrupted in this case. In addition, FMNH2 is involved in the release of protons involved in migration through ATP synthase, so disabling FMNH2 would result in the loss of this proton action to a greater extent.Would the poisons described above increase oxygen consumption, decrease it, or have no effect? Explain.Oxygen consumption occurs in one of the last phases, particularly in complex IV. The poisoning of any of the phases from
The first wave of rock music met its demise due to the combination of two factors. First of all, at the end of the 1950s, rock and roll lost several important figures. In particular, Little Richard quit music and became a minister, Elvis Presley was drafted into the army, and Chuck Berry was convicted of a prison sentence (Covach and Flory 105). The fate was especially cruel to Buddy Holly, who was killed in a plane crash along with Ritchie Valence and the Big Bopper on February 3, 1959. The loss of so many popular artists significantly weakened the early rock and roll scene.In addition, the growing popularity of rock and roll threatened the business interests of the major record companies and labels. At the beginning of the
encroaching on their market share and popularity. The following payola scandal resulted in the removal of rock and roll from radio station broadcasts. Alan Freed, a DJ who played a big role in the rise of rock and roll, lost his job for taking payola gifts.As a result, rock music changed drastically by the beginning of the 1960s. Music business professionals who effectively ended the first wave of rock and roll saw the commercial potential of youth culture and rock. The industry sanitized the product by promoting clean-cut, nonthreatening, much less independent artists (Kot). Major labels focused on producing teen idols, and no big names emerged in the 60s rock until the Beatles and the British Invasion.
Construct Development and Scale CreationOperating DefinitionOperational definition of depression: a mood disorder characterized by depressed mood and anhedonia for more than two weeks, which is often accompanied by a decrease in the ability to perform daily tasks and a feeling of helplessness, including reoccurring suicidal thoughts. Guillot-Valdés et al. (2019) note that depressive disorders are clinically diagnosed when a patient has depressive symptoms for more than two weeks, one of which is low mood and anhedonia. Nguyen et al. (2018) identify depression “as persistent sadness, a loss of interest and energy, an inability to carry out daily activities, a change in appetite or sleeping time, poor concentration, hopelessness and thoughts of self-harm or suicide” (p. 2). Garcı´a-Batista et al. (2018) underline that depression is also associated with “decreased
concentration and decision-making ability, loss of self-confidence, feelings of inferiority or worthlessness and guilt” (p. 2). Additionally, depressive disorder is related to manifestations of fear and anger, as well as symptoms of anxiety (Guillot-Valdés et al., 2019). Comorbidity between depression and anxiety disorders is a significant challenge in developing definitions and symptom measurement instruments.Items used to Sample the Domain 1. Manifestations of depressed mood including feelings of sadness, worthlessness, hopelessness; 2. Loss of interest, including a decreased ability to experience pleasure and joy; 3. Reoccuring suicide thoughts; 4. Disorders in daily activities including decreased concentration and decision-making ability; 5. Manifestations of symptoms of anxiety including fear, anger, and irritability.Method of ScalingThe method of scaling appropriate for the described domain is an indication of the extent of the patient’s
symptoms, including never, sometimes, often, very often, constantly. These items, in turn, are associated with numeric scaling from 0 to 4, where 0 is never, 1 is sometimes, 2 is often, 3 is very often, 4 is constantly. This scaling method was chosen because it makes it easier for the patient to interact with the test. By noting the frequency of occurrence of symptoms, they will be able to assess their emotional manifestations more deeply. For the therapist, this scaling allows to assess the general picture of the patient’s psychological state and obtain a result that is suitable for measurement. Additionally, this scaling helps to determine not only the presence or absence of symptoms of depression but also to assess their severity preliminarily.Instrument to Query RespondentsHow often do
you experience manifestations of low mood, including feelings of sadness, worthlessness, hopelessness?  * Never;  * Sometimes;  * Often;  * Very often;  * Constantly.How often do you note the loss of interest, including a decreased ability to experience pleasure and joy?  * Never;  * Sometimes;  * Often;  * Very often;  * Constantly.How often do you note the presence of suicidal thoughts?  * Never;  * Sometimes;  * Often;  * Very often;  * Constantly.How often do you experience a decrease in the ability to complete daily tasks, including decreased concentration and decision-making ability?  * Never;  * Sometimes;  * Often;  * Very often;  * Constantly.How often do you experience symptoms of anxiety,
including fear, anger, and irritability?  * Never;  * Sometimes;  * Often;  * Very often;  * Constantly.Interview or Self-ReportThis instrument is more appropriate for patient self-reporting, as it implies a more superficial identification of the manifestation of symptoms. Stuart et al. (2014) report that “61% of the study population identified as having a history of depression using the SCID / NP also self-reporting past depression” (p. 868). Thus, this instrument can be used to determine the presence of symptoms and indications for a more detailed interview with the therapist. It provides not sufficient amount of specific information to be used in interviews.Analysis and JustificationNorm and Reliability ScoresThe definition of norm scores for a scaling instrument allows you to determine the influence of background factors
on the test results. Such aspects include gender, age, educational level, and others respondents’ characteristics. Roelofs et al. (2013) argue that a multiple regression analysis allows fairly reliable determining the predicates of the norm, as well as establishing possible interactions between them. Thus, the use of this approach provides the norm score for a more accurate interpretation of the results.Reliability is a measure of how well test results reflect reality. Nolte et al. (2019) note that this criterion consists of “internal consistency and test-retest reliability” (p. 2). There are special coefficients for measuring these specific items and checking the questionnaire for reliability. In particular, Cronbach’s alpha is used to assess internal consistency, and the intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC) is used for test-retest reliability (Massai et al., 2018). Cronbach’s
alpha allows you to evaluate how each of the items included in the test meets the purpose of the assessment. If the value of the coefficient is equal to or greater than 0.70, then the test is sufficiently reliable (Taber, 2018, p. 1293). However, when using Cronbach’s alpha, a higher ratio means more reliability, which also reflects the quality of the questionnaire. In the case of a test-retest reliability study, it is also necessary to select a model corresponding to the type of ICC questionnaire (Qin et al., 2019). For the scale presented, ANOVA Model is appropriate since it allows the researcher to consider the non-attachment of test results to time frames. Thus, reliability can be described by two coefficients and signal the need for adjustments.Number of RespondentsThe
number of respondents depends on the purpose of patient testing and may vary depending on this aspect. In this case, it is important to identify whether the test will be used for individual diagnostics or for collecting statistical data. For example, this questionnaire can be used to examine the predisposition of certain populations to depressive disorders. It can also be utilized to collect statistics on the possibilities of self-reporting questionnaires. Therapists can also use this scale for individual rapid testing of vulnerable groups or people who suspect symptoms of depression. Thus, the number of people who will be asked to undergo testing depends on the goals of its development. However, within the proposed scale, to assess the effectiveness of this test, it is necessary to offer it to
at least 8-10 people.Characteristics of RespondentsThe characteristics of the respondents can be diverse since the symptoms of depression are inherent in completely different people. As in the case of the number of respondents, their characteristics depend on the purpose of using the questionnaire. In particular, the study can be conducted for members of a specific group that has distinctive features in the form of gender, age, or conditions. For example, there are studies that target medical students, women with endometriosis, patients aged 65-80, and the general public of a particular country (Nguyen et al., 2018; Ceran et al., 2020; Djukanovic et al., 2017; Garcı´a-Batista et al., 2018). Within the proposed scale, the main characteristic of the respondents may be the suspicion of the presence of symptoms of depression.
With a sufficiently large sample of patients with different backgrounds, the norm score will help make the study more relevant. In general, the spectrum of people to whom this scale can be applied is extremely wide, but it is necessary to take into account the characteristics of patients when applying it.GeneralizationGeneralization helps researchers to establish patterns that are determined based on the results of participants and apply them to a broader population. The population to which the results can be generalized is the “totality of elements or people that have common, defined characteristics, and about whom the study results are relevant” (Polit & Beck, 2010, p. 1452). Thus, this aspect directly depends on what goals the testing pursues and who its respondents are. In the case of the
proposed scale, the generalization of the results can be carried out only when taking into account the patient’s background and factors affecting his disorder. In particular, it is necessary to take into account the differences of the respondents in the factors that are taken into account when identifying the norm score. If the scale is applied to a wide audience for individual testing and not for a specific group, the results can be generalized only if the respondents are statistically divided into such groups. However, since the purpose of testing is to confirm or refute a suspicion of depression symptoms, the results can be generalized to people who suspect they have a depressive disorder.ValidityThe validity, along with reliability, reflects how accurately the questionnaire reflects exactly those topics that
are intended for research. First of all, it is necessary to assess the face validity of the test by testing the respondents. This type of assessment makes it possible to understand how accurately, in the opinion of the participants, the questionnaire touches on the topic under study. Content validity should be produced by professionals in the field who can tell how well items reflect aspects important for diagnosing a depressive disorder. Concurrent validity allows correlating the results of the questionnaire with findings from other sources. It is necessary to collect data on a specific group of respondents, for which the patterns of manifestation of symptoms of depression have already been established.For a more accurate measurement of validity, Confirmatory factor analysis (CFA) is also used, which aims to identify
in the compilation of the questionnaire (Oosterveld, 2019). The rational method involves several stages: 1. Concept analysis within which the researcher analyzes the available in the literature information and creates the operational definition of the construct; 2. The item production stage involves selecting items based on known data using informal and intuitive criteria; 3. The scale construction involves evaluating items by an expert based on their face validity; 4. The evaluation includes an assessment of validity and reliability, as well as a comparison of test and clinical examination results.Cut-Off Scores
Confusion about Art Deco and Depression styles is common even among scholars who fail to notice the significant differences in the artistic directions. Art Deco is a French stylistic trend that stems from the Lalique, Art Noveau, and works of the famous artist Picasso. In contrast, the Depression style presents the difficulties of poor mental states of working people and seeks for them to find comfort in Depression art. Overall, even though the aforementioned artistic directions are sometimes mixed into the Deco style, they are entirely different and carry distinct meanings to society.To elaborate, the styles are dissimilar in their primary characteristics, materials, colors, and shapes. Thus, Art Deco is more provocative with bright tones and attractive ornaments, such as triangles, zigzags, and even trapezoids. This direction is
There are three main types of domestic violence arrest laws manifest in the United States. The arrest regulations employed by various states include mandatory arrest, pro-arrest, and permissive arrest laws. Consequently, there often arises a debate on which of the policies serves best in protecting the victims of domestic violence. As a result, there are endless arguments on the strengths and limitations of each regulation, as postulated by scholars and laypeople alike. However, the best method of discerning which stipulations best protect victims involves gathering data on which techniques lead to lower re-offending rates.The primary aim of any domestic violence arrest law is to protect the victim and ensure no recurrence of the cruelty within homes while also preserving families. Surveys from the criminal justice system indicate that
from home, protecting the victim. Mandatory arrests separate married couples to allow them time to reflect on their marriage and find the way forward. In many instances, the policies remove the need for retribution against the offender by the battered spouse. The offender’s removal protects both the offender and victim from further crimes and homicides. According to the National Institute of Justice, mandatory arrest laws are the most prevalent in US states, indicating a widespread agreement on their effectiveness.
In her book Doughnut Economics , Kate Raworth discusses the main aspects of the modern economy, the challenges of economic growth, and changes to be promoted in society. Despite my desire to find a purpose in economics, reading economic literature is not always easy to follow. Most books and articles contain various complex terms and definitions that confuse and frighten a novice reader. I admire the approach chosen by Raworth that differentiates her from other theorists by analyzing economics from new perspectives that can be interesting to non-economists. It is always a responsible step for me to learn the first chapters and realize if the whole book could attract my attention with time. At this moment, I got a chance to investigate the preface “Who Want to Be
an Economist?” and the first chapter, “Change the Goal.” Each section has its purpose, and my major discovery is that it is necessary for modern economists to change something right now to achieve positive outcomes with time.A preface of the book is a great opportunity for me to understand the main questions raised in the book and develop several personal and professional expectations. Raworth (2017) begins her discussion by mentioning the name of an ordinary student, Yuan Yang, who decided to study economics and got frustrated about her choice soon. On the one hand, I have many questions concerning such a dubious decision to begin the book about economics with severe criticism of economic theories and education in general. Raworth (2017) states that students either “walked away from
economics or swallowed its theories whole and built a lucrative career out of their qualification” (p. 2). I think that not many individuals would like to proceed with studying the subject after such honest and provocative statements. On the other hand, I notice that the author challenges the reader and herself with the necessity to prove that economics is worth attention and research if correct priorities are set. Therefore, I wanted to continue reading the section and find out Raworth’s attitude toward economics that allowed her to create the Doughnut concept.The financial crisis, student protests, and a symbolic revolution of economics are the themes that increase my desire to continue reading. I believe that, instead of supporting the readers in their choices to study economics, Raworth (2017) deliberately
underlines that it is high time to reveal confusing old ideas and replace them with new ones for inspiration. I agree with the decision to address statistical facts, including the number of people who live in poverty, unemployment issues, overpopulation, and climate change, to support her position (Raworth, 2017). I like the idea of combining environmental, social, and economic concerns to show why to study economics from a new perspective. Mentioning such economists as John Maynard Keynes, Friedrich von Hayek, and Paul Samuelson makes me surf the web and improve my background knowledge about the importance of economic history and theoretical background. At the end of this section, I learn the essence of Doughnut Economics, with seven ways to think about a modern economist. They include changing the
goal, seeing the big picture, nurturing human nature, getting savvy with systems, designing to distribute, creating to regenerate, and being agnostic about growth (Raworth, 2017). Each element has caught my attention, and I want to find out more about Doughnut Economics.The chapter “Change the Goal” is devoted to the first layer of the doughnut in Raworth’s theory. I believe that the essence of conventional economic theory is that person’s satisfaction is based on the power of consumption and utility of ideas (Raworth, 2017). I have never thought that the growth of Gross Domestic Product (GDP) should be the major indicator of how successful or failed the economy is. Raworth (2017) shares the same position, and I admire her brevity to admit that society has been mistakenly obsessed with
readings is full of positive emotions and gratitude to Kate Raworth for her contributions to a better understanding of economic studies and their importance in human life. Regarding current social, political, and economic challenges, it is not always easy for a person to choose the economy for an educational purpose. However, right now, I am confident that my choice of the subject is correct. I am eager to continue reading this book and learn six more ways to think like the 21st-century economist. Although economics has failed people, it is my responsibility to change things and improve the overall situation in my country or even across the globe.
OutlineThe ecology of literature is very similar to humanities in that a person’s worldview directly affects everything they do. Many people disagree and believe that each worldview should be personal and not influence decisions made in a public setting. To understand literature, a reader must first try to understand the writer’s worldview because getting to know the author will help them interpret the main idea of the writing. A person’s life experience shapes their worldview and getting to know the writer and the world around them can assist in understanding and interpreting literature. Thus, humanities, the disciplines that study societies and cultures, in combination with literature, serve as conduits for the author’s values and beliefs, which helps to better understand the writer’s work and its supposed effect.IntroductionLiterature is
an integral part of social life and human existence. However, it is not just an amalgam of history, cultures, creativity, and possibly, psychology. This field allows people to reach the writer’s thoughts through their words and ponder the deep meanings and lessons the author wants the reader to comprehend (Steinberg). Moreover, it can shed light on the author’s way of thinking and his perception of life and the world. Writers’ works, as a result, affect people’s perception of the world as they start to apply specific literary images to their everyday lives. Thus, literature must be discussed from a sociological point of view.The premise of human nature is likely to be affected by society and various trends since people, being social creatures, tend to mimic the behavioral patterns
of the majority. Sociological studies, therefore, claim that people are inevitably affected by what they hear and see because imitating this information is a part of the “social glue” or processing of social information. It is, therefore, logical that writers hold power to influence people and their perceptions with the help of the images they create in their writings. From a biblical sense, it can be seen how much influence the Bible has on cultures, nations, and communities (Green). Such a connection between the author and readers resembles the relationship with the Bible (Dockery). The combination of words, phrases, ideas, and images helps shape the message, which can resonate with billions of people.Consequently, the power of words and the story behind the work is among the most crucial
tools. It is entirely rational to synthesize and analyze the given information in the piece of writing through the prism of the writer’s life and experience. This is necessary to dwell on such information in order to define how specific images now viewed and applied by people were created.Biographical CriticismThere are many ways to analyze a work of literature, but all of them are based on the principle that the piece of writing is interpreted through either the lens of the reader or the writer. In the first case, an individual analyzes and assesses the given information according to their own set of beliefs, opinions, or experiences. There might be many variants of interpretation of a specific phrase or piece written by the author, depending on the worldview
of a reader. However, in the second case, the main idea or message only makes sense if examined together with the author’s biography.Biographical criticism implies that the writing cannot be analyzed separately from the authors’ biography or worldview because the events taking place in their lives help decode the meaning behind the work. Therefore, taking a look into the author’s worldview allows readers to perform a critical analysis of the writing. Among the examples can be the book The prince warrior s written by Priscilla Shirer. Priscilla Shirer is an American author and Christian evangelist. Thus, it is essential to use this fact while analyzing this author’s works.The given work depicts the lives of Xavier and Evan, who, along with their friends, encounter a mysterious world, Photos. During
their stay in the land, the young men battle evil and save other warriors with the help of a guide (Detwiler). While reading this book, a reader can identify specific allegories. For example, the guide that navigates the boys in their struggles and unfamiliar setting can be seen as a spiritual force or God’s help. The path of the young men can be interpreted as a battle of people on their way to the spiritual realm.Another example is the book The Lion, the Witch, and the Wardrobe , written by Lewis. In this piece of work, the author focuses on the adventure of siblings who discover the wardrobe with a path to a different world (Lewis). The path of the children is filled with struggles and encounters with
the evil, the witch. However, with the help of the lion, the children remain protected. This book is an excellent depiction of God’s love and protection for evil forces.Opposite ViewsHowever, it must be noted that looking into the author’s past may limit the person’s freedom to interpret the meaning of the writing. While reading a book, a person is on their own way of analyzing the work independently. They can decipher specific moments and try to comprehend the information without the already-known facts. In this situation, readers are free to create their understanding as long as they are not familiar with the background. As soon as some points are unraveled, the reader loses their ability to create their perception because they cannot separate already existing meaning from their
Before the outbreak of COVID-19, Panama was one of the countries in Latin America and the Caribbean that had the strongest growth rate. Its growth performance increased at an average rate of 4.7% between 2014 and 2019 before suffering severe damage from the pandemic, leading to its labor income being reduced by 18% in 2020 (Matus et al., 2021). Panama Solidario assisted the country in maintaining its poverty rate at 14.9% instead of the estimated 18.8%, posting a rise from the initial national poverty rate, which was at 12.2% before the crisis (Matus et al., 2021). Panama’s wealth is located mainly among the high-class individuals who live in urban areas, while those who live in rural areas are six times poorer than the richer.Globally, the unemployment rate increased
drastically after the COVID-19 epidemic. Panama’s unemployment rate rose from 7.07% in 2019 to 18.55% in 2020, resulting from the damage imposed by the virus outbreak (O’Neill, 2021). In 2021, it was at 10.17%, a fall from 2020 (O’Neill, 2021). The United States had an unemployment rate of about 8.3% in 2021 (O’Neill, 2021). Comparing the two countries unemployment rates, it is vividly clear that by 2020, Panama had a higher number of the labor force that did not have jobs but were currently looking for work compared to the US. Thus, the US has most of its citizens employed, making Panama worse off.Panama has its own official currency, known as the Panamanian Balboa. It has equal value to the dollar; in other words, one dollar is equivalent
to one Panamanian Balboa. However, they do not print their paper money and instead use the dollar as their currency. This dollar adoption was due to its stability in value compared to the Balboa and its fixed exchange rate with their currency.Panama has different trade ties with a number of countries across the globe. Its main trading partners are the US, China, Free Zones, and Singapore (Bakari & Mabrouki, 2017). The country has been attractive to foreign investors due to its stable political environment, increasing real estate market, and growing economy (Bakari & Mabrouki, 2017). Panama had a trade deficit worth 5 billion dollars in 2020, showing that the country’s imports were more than its exports. Its exports, expressed as a percentage of the GDP are at 40.74%
Deductive reasoning involves the construction and development of cause-and-effect solid relationships. It is noteworthy that the connection is established either between two facts or a point and the idea of how it will affect the future (Besnard & Hunter, 2018). Thus, a judgment (logical expression) includes the first – the prerequisites, the second – the conclusion. In logic, an argument is valid only when it has a form that makes it impossible for the premises to be correct and the judgment to be wrong. According to the explained three types of deductive arguments, a valid statement does not need to have actually trustworthy premises. Still, it must have ones that, if they were accurate, would guarantee that the conclusion is proper.Example: 1. All metals are heavy 2. Tin
logical necessity of the judgment, given the two assumptions. The argument would be just as valid if the premises and conclusion were wrong. However, it is essential to determine that the purpose of argumentation is to establish the truth of a judgment. An invalid argument does not achieve this goal, so it cannot be considered sound (Besnard & Hunter, 2018). A sound argument has a valid form and true premises; thus, it cannot be invalid in all cases. If the argument is invalid, then the beliefs thoroughly do not matter, and, in fact, only the conclusion remains. Therefore, this means that there is no argument in this case, especially a sound one.
The Crucible play written by Arthur Miller is a myth story of the Salem witch trials believed to rise in the Massachusetts Bay territory in 1692. The show employs apprehension of witchcraft in America that led to the increase and spread of socialism. The personalities display the destructive power of lies and corruption that preface the severe tragedy of citizens. The main aim of the story is to warn audiences about the consequences of present-day disloyalty that causes ordeal to people.The play exposes lies when Abigail talks to other girls and tells them not to admit to anything during their adventure in the forest. The experience was associated with sorcery which the people are struggling to eradicate. In addition, the characters accused each other of practicing witchcraft and
finally subsidized hatred. Further, Abigail and her friend Tituba accuse various villagers of consorting to the devil hence creating suspicion in the entire community. Lack of sufficient data on such circumstances premier injustice for the plaintiff. It is crucial to convene information from various targets to prove the deceit of the convicts.In present-day society, people have distinctive beliefs regarding culture. Socialism and tribalism have increased due to the falsehoods and faiths that some communities retain mysticism. People have lost their lives while others have lost property because of these lies and ideologies. In addition, untruths have led to an increment of wedlock divorces since people have become tribal and unfaithful to their partners. Children are most affected psychologically by family disputes in the world. Parents need to execute
loyalty and good morals in society to restrain controversies. On the contrary, some nations support the practice of the traditions legally while others do not. It is crucial to address the problem and educate people about the effects of tribalism and how to create good bonds with their neighbors.A graft is a type of misconduct undertaken by a person or organization to achieve a desired position of control to attain illegal benefits. Miller’s play expresses corruption when Parris’s greed extends by insisting on gratuitous golden candlesticks for the church and demands the deed to his house. In addition, people in the Salem village fight and kill their neighbors by blaming them for witchcraft and seizing their possessions due to resistance to laws. According to (Shashkova pp.143-154), laws have
lost value and, people have discredited them outstanding of an increase in transgression. Further, graft maneuvers mistrust between individuals and their leaders since commanders’ greediness contributes to the abuse of power and poverty increment. Citizens should elect rulers with a positive mindset and goals to maintain trust.Despite the allegation of graft and witchcraft in society, the justice system in Salem examined the matter and assembled enough evidence. Judge Danforth prosecutes the case by reiterating Proctor and the other accused individuals confess and later send them to jail. According to (Saragih pp.131-138), various approaches to legal justice, such as state constitutions stand adopted and applied to solve criminal activeness in the nation. The Justice system plays a crucial role in controlling citizens’ rights and freedoms. Territories have agreed to
in the fellowship can diminish crime and create a friendly environment for people.Deception has increased, and it has become a threat to society. People have developed misconduct to benefit unlawfully through corruption. People have lost lives and property due to deception from fraudulent individuals. It is crucial to eliminate criminality by convicting the culprits lawfully regardless of their positions. The judicial system should enforce strict laws to safeguard citizens’ rights. The leaders should formulate plans that benefit the people by increasing aid to boost citizens’ projects. Courts should congregate sufficient data before sentencing the offenders according to the law. ‘
The rapid development of Internet communication technologies requires a substantial legal base that will address all minor aspects of the line between personal data privacy and borders for governmental inspection. It appears that in addition to providing the governmental agencies all users’ information upon request, ECPA (Electronic Communications Privacy Act) allows conducting inspections in an undercover way, which violates the citizens’ rights from the First Amendment. Furthermore, several details affect the progress towards more relevant legal regulations basis for online activities.Firstly, creating a new legal base for electronic communication requires a complex approach, as due to the fast development of communication technologies, the legal base can lose its relevance in a short period. Secondly, the data communicated and stored in the online space is exposed to several threats
such as hacking and theft. Moreover, Internet communications present a potential threat to society, as dangerous groups use internet communications to sell prohibited substances and weapons.The potential threat to society is generally lower under governmental supervision; however, the limitation of citizens’ privacy leads to lower levels of freedom in the country and poor protection of citizens’ safety. While the failure to gain private information about citizens can decrease the safety levels, the prohibition of gag orders will allow the citizens to be aware of the state’s interference in their personal information. In addition, people who deliberately pose a threat to society generally can use different kinds of untraceable communication. Thus, it is essential to include the warrants for state inspections in the new legal basis to deprive the
possibility of infringement of the privacy of innocent citizens. Therefore, the state’s concerns about terrorism and crime do not justify the violation of citizens’ privacy. It is time to change the ECPA or conduct a new legal base for online communication to reflect the fast development of communication technologies and provide more freedom to citizens.Another issue that contributes to complications in the process of revising the current ECPA. In 2013 and 2015, Congress proposed legislation of ECPA revisions, but they never made it through the legislative process. Even efforts to make a companion bill to the ECPA, the Email Privacy Act, supported by 272 co-sponsors, ended in failure (Pegoraro). President Obama’s administration explained that revisions to ECPA will interfere with the state’s law enforcement activities (Pegoraro). According to
AnalysisIt is important to note that electronic health record systems and related healthcare data collection instruments are highly effective tools, which can improve the nursing practice by assisting nursing professionals as well as improving patient outcomes. Therefore, relevant policies should be implemented in order to enhance the general process of nursing care, and the given assessment will primarily propose a policy for a specific situation, which is drug administration. The policy is based on making electronic health records or EHR systems a sole platform for drug administration, medication monitoring, treatment adherence, and substance abuse screening conducted by nursing professionals in order to advance the evidence-based practice or EBP into EHR.EBP in EHROne should be aware that there is a major need to integrate core EBP elements into EHR.
It is stated that “delays in moving new EBP practice changes into the EHR are significant. These delays are sources of frustration and job dissatisfaction” (Chipps et al., 2020, p. 136). The same research also identifies that five themes, which act as a barrier for EBP and EHR merging, are EBP is not a primary goal, structure of an organization and its governance, EHR change prioritization, limited ability of nurses to change EHR, and delays and wait times (Chipps et al., 2020). In other words, the tool is not utilized to its fullest extent, and thus, the tool can be evaluated as poorly related to EBP, but giving more freedom to nurses can facilitate the merge.Work Setting and Strategic PlanThe current work setting in EHR can also be
evaluated as limited, where there are potential risks for patient safety, such as copy and paste practice. It is stated that “copy and paste can promote note bloat, internal inconsistencies, error propagation, and documentation in the wrong patient chart” (Lehmann et al., 2017, p. 12). In other words, the current EHR capabilities undermine the core principles of EBP, which can be even more problematic in regard to drug administration. In addition, EBP information used in drug administration is of paramount importance, and the current state of EHR is indicative of the fact that it is not realized to its fullest capability since nursing professionals can use EHR for all drug-related practices as well as evidence-based use of data, such as screening (Alemi et al., 2018).Efficient Workflows, Interprofessional Care,
and Patient SatisfactionA thorough analysis of EHR reveals that there is a need for its optimization in order to improve workflows since many essential functions, especially for nurses, are poorly available or unavailable. For example, the copy and paste option is a prime example of how drug administration and recording can be prone to errors due to a lack of ways to identify which parts are copied and which are inserted manually (Lehmann et al., 2017). Interprofessional care can also be enhanced in order to improve, which is even more relevant in nursing since the communicative element of EHR is critical for promoting EBP principles of care, which can lead to better patient outcomes and satisfaction due to orderly and timely care delivery (McGonigle & Mastrian, 2018).In conclusion,
it is important to note that EHRs are highly useful tools, which can enhance a wide range of areas of nursing practice and care. However, the evidence suggests that there is a greater need for improvements in EHR in order for it to be able to promote and integrate EBP principles. The assessment specifically evaluated drug administration, which requires more functional features from EHR and policy changes since governance is among the main barriers for EBP’s incorporation into EHR.PolicyPolicy: Nursing professionals need to be able to use EHR systems alone in order to conduct drug administration, medication monitoring, treatment adherence, and substance abuse screening of patients since evidence suggests that it will move core EBP principles to EHR, which implies that there is a need for EHR functionality
and communicative enhancement, and thus, these objectives require prioritization and need not to be secondary factors.The evidence suggests that EHR change prioritization, organizational governance, and structure, as well as a limited impact of nursing professionals to be part of necessary changes to the EHR system, are the main barriers (Chipps et al., 2020). Therefore, it is of paramount importance to provide more freedom and influence to nursing professionals to be able to participate in the development and functional modifications to EHR in order to promote EBP through drug screening and interprofessional collaboration. Such a need for functional improvements are copy and paste identification functions, medication monitoring of a patient, drug incompatibility monitoring, substance abuse adherence monitoring, and drug screening (Lehmann et al., 2017). These changes will inevitably affect
The End and the Beginning and Hitler’s First Photograph by Wisława Szymborska are two poems that share thematic elements concerned with time, war, and the invisibility of evil. The poems will be analyzed and contrasted with the central theme and each other. The thesis of this work suggests that both works by Szymborska illuminate the duality of time, both as reciting historical patterns with ease, such as the aftermath of war, and being completely untelling of events to come, such as the transformation of an innocent baby into a mass murderer.The End and the Beginning by Szymborska recounts the reconstruction of affected areas after a war. The particular imagery refers to the effects of the Second World War, the pushing of rubble, the collection of corpses, and miring
in sofa springs and glass. However, the poem begins with “after every war, someone has to clean up” (Szymborska, lines 1-2), which is the focal point of the poem. Wars exist within a universal timeline as outlined by Szymborska. She illuminates a process in which the war demolishes nations, the press and media become disinterested at its end, and as rebuilding begins, the nation becomes populated with individuals who knew little or nothing of the war (Szymborska, lines 1-4). Here Szymborska refers to the generations that will inhabit the heritage which they did not live (lines 39-42). Birth and innocence become a prevalent theme at the end of the poem and will be especially vital in understanding the thematic analysis of both works by the author.The second poem,
recalls how no omen of death or signs of the future prior to his birth were visible (line 13), which supports her thesis that no person is born evil. The normalcy of Hitler’s youth is supported through images of him being alike with other children in family albums and prone to regular child-like behaviors of crying when waiting too long for the photographer to take a picture.
Sula is a novel by Nobel Prize-winning author Toni Morrison, written in 1973. It is an African American literary fiction that reveals deep concepts of love, morality, and moral principles. The novel has some symbolic elements through which the author reveals one’s outlook on life. A characteristic feature of the novel is duality in some aspects; for example, some die from drowning and some from a fire. Due to such techniques, Toni Morrison was able to accomplish the novel’s purpose of conveying the duality of the world. The double structure of the novel, along with its end, symbolizes the optimistic aspect due to the representation of sincerity, important values of life, and the deep meaning of the “circles of sorrow”.One may notice the representation of the duality of
the world, namely good and evil, and at the end of the novel, despite all the previous events, the sincere impulse of Sula’s friend formulates a culmination. Thus, one may notice a strong Nel’s reaction: “It was a fine cry—loud and long—but it had no bottom, and it had no top, just circles and circles of sorrow” (Morrison, 79). Namely, this event implies Nel’s duality of emotions, since all the time, the hero seemed to miss Jude, Nel’s husband. However, in a burst of sincere sadness at the end of the novel, Nel realizes that the melancholy is caused by the time spent without Sula. Just like all the citizens of the city, that would seem that they hate Sula. However, no one realized that the heroine was
the reason for their solidarity.Duality is also represented in the novel’s symbol, namely the mole above Sula’s eye. The change in the mole’s appearance symbolizes the heroine’s maturity and the gradual rejection of social conventions. In turn, it is also the opposite feature of Nel’s character, which accepts all the norms. Further, there was an ambivalent perception of the mole by different characters: Nel thought it was a rose, representing love, feminine beauty, and friendship. Jude perceived it as deceit and seduction, that is, dual and opposite to Nel. Thus, the author was able to express the ambiguity of the world and material and non-material things. In addition, Toni Morison was able to immerse the reader in the idea that the perception of things largely depends on how
one sees them.The duality of the novel also characterizes the end of the book, which at first glance seems tragic. The heroine’s death, sadness, tears, and depressive impulse do not seem to belong to an optimistic perception. However, the author’s main motive was to display a ray of light in the form of a sincere outburst of love and friendship through Nel’s sadness. This formulates the circles of sadness: the first, implicit, displayed in the entire storyline. Namely, all the negative events and the environment of the heroes: connection with husbands, difficult living conditions, and the murder of children by the mother. Finally, the second obvious circle of sadness symbolizes the main aspects of human life, namely sincerity, self-sacrifice, love, and friendship. All this was expressed in a
small but main part of the novel, namely in the final impulse of Nel.The ambiguity and depth of the essence of Toni Morrison’s novel can also be seen by analyzing the criticism of the book. Thus, at first glance, it seems that the plot describes the impact of betrayal on the friendship of two African American women, but the author does not stop there (Nittle, 56). The novel makes one think about what makes a person good or bad and where the line between these concepts lies (Nittle, 56). It formulates the vagueness of the boundaries between the basic concepts of morality and life, which gives the reader additional space for analysis. In addition, it also symbolizes the ambiguity of the perception of the ending of the novel.
The story of the extreme rise and the following fall of the Enron Corporation still interests many people. Not everyone is aware of all the circumstances and factors that affected the company’s struggle, and only some people know how many resources, including places and people, were involved in the corporation. The record-breaking bankruptcy of “the seventh largest company in the United States and the sixth largest energy company in the world” was surprising for the society (The Nigerian Professional Accountant, n.d., para. 2). This company was founded in 1985, and its first year in the market was already characterized by a huge loss and an enormous amount of debt. However, thanks to the changes in American governmental policy related to the natural gas industry operations, Enron managed to
proponent of asset-rich infrastructure development philosophy. Both leaders could not agree on whether the return on investments was a long-term process. Their actions were too different and competing, but many projects in which Mark invested large amounts of money failed later, adding to the corporation’s huge debt. Overall, this disagreement is the main reason why the Enron Corporation has been struggling for many years.
In his text entitled “The Entitlement Theory”, the philosopher Robert Nozick speculates on a truly just economic structure in the ideal form of the state. Nozick focuses on the issue of property, its transfer and ratification, offering a model for claiming just entitlement (Vaughn, 2019). Real justice, according to Nozick, consists in the appropriation of holdings or their original acquisition, their fair and consensual transfer and the protection of the right to their property.According to the principle of fair acquisition, people can take possession of property if they do not take it from others and do not worsen the situation of others in the process. The principle of fair transfer implies the right to donate property or voluntarily exchange it. Nozick imagines a world in which free exchange
is through the circumstances or actions of acquisition that one can judge the fairness of the possession of a thing. Borrowing from John Locke’s principle of the self-property of people, Nozick says that people represent a set of talents that belong to them. Combining these talents with the surrounding world, they can encroach on the acquisition of part of this world by agreement, that is, to acquire property.
The Alabama State constitution strives to provide and protect a wide array of citizens’ rights. Most notably, some of these rights are replicated in the American Bill of Rights. Like the American Bill of Rights, the Alabama State constitution is equally detailed and has different sections that are dedicated to enhancing and protecting citizens’ liberties. The standout element within the Alabama State constitution regarding the protection of rights is the freedom of speech. Within the Bill of Rights, The First Amendment guards the citizens’ freedom of speech as it enables them to not only express themselves through speech but also via protest groups (Weinberger, 2019). The Alabama State constitution echoes similar sentiment as Section 4 prevents the development of any laws that would curtail the citizens’ freedom of
IntroductionPeoples’ behaviors and decisions are often the central scope of sociological inquiry. Flint (Michigan) water crisis can be seen as an illustration of such decisions and behaviors that have led to severe issues with multiple implications. To understand the causes of the crisis and ways to prevent such problems in the future, it is possible to employ the Marxist approach. The class concept of this paradigm best fits into the analysis of the situation as a conflict between two major groups is apparent.Flint (Michigan): DemographicsIn the middle of the twentieth century Flint (Michigan) was a rapidly developing and prosperous city that hosted such giants as General Motors. However, in the 1980s, the town started to degrade due to the severe oil crisis that hit the automotive industry (Pauli,
2020). The city saw tremendous demographic shifts because thousands of people left searching for better employment and living conditions. At present, the city’s population is slightly over 96 thousand people (Data USA, 2021). The majority of residents are Black, and a third is White. The poverty rate is relatively high and reached 39% in 2020, while the median age is quite low (35,5 years). These figures suggest that the socio-economic situation in Flint is alarming, and significant changes are needed.Water Crisis in Flint (Michigan)The crisis started in 2014, and officials in collaboration and supervision of the public and scientists could not solve it until 2019. In 2014, officials had to change the water source due to the difficulties with maintaining the existing infrastructure (Krings et al., 2018). No
rapid measures to improve the infrastructure were implemented. The same year, people addressed officials due to their dissatisfaction with water quality, which remained unattained. After several studies and data publications regarding extreme violation of water quality standards (high lead level, harmful bacteria), the officials were forced to take action. As a result, pipes were replaced, and the necessary improvement to the infrastructure was made with the help of the federal budget funds.Water Crisis in Flint (Michigan): CausesOne of the central issues that caused the crisis was the city’s constraints related to infrastructure. Flint’s budget could hardly ensure proper maintenance of pipes and other infrastructure components (Pauli, 2020). Due to the economic situation in the city, the public had less control over the actions and decisions of an emergency
manager and Governor Rick Snyder. Residents addressed the authorities, but their claims received little attention as the authorities concentrated on the economic development of the city rather than public health or safety.Flint Water Crisis: Social Concept AppliedWhen addressing the causes of the crisis, it is necessary to apply the concept of class. Although various scholars note that class is a subjective construct created for analytical purposes, this notion is a relevant component of population stratification (Neilson, 2017). People identify with a particular group, such as workers (proletariat) or big business owners (bourgeoisie). In Flint, this stratification is relevant as there is almost no middle class. Apparently, officials concentrated on the needs of big businesses rather than workers.Marxist Theory: ClassAccording to the Marxist theory of class, human society is
mainly divided into the proletariat (laborers) and bourgeoisie (those who usurp laborers’ resources). The former are working people with little resources as they are taken over by the rich (Neilson, 2017). These two groups are in constant conflict, and their resolution can be achieved by revolution. The revolution can be implemented peacefully in terms of the coalition with a part (minority) of bourgeois and proletariat or due to violent struggle. Marx believed in the victory of the proletariat and the establishment of communism with its justice and proper distribution of resources.Marxist Perspective Regarding the CrisisIn the situation in Flint, the officials took the side of the bourgeoisie, paying no attention to potential outcomes. Authorities made some decisions to allocate funds to boost the development of the economy supporting
business. However, the proletariat was the class deprived of higher living standards as poor people had to live in older communities with old water pipes contaminated considerably. Water was the resource that became central to the conflict between the two classes. Proletariat won the struggle, which could be explained by the success of the peaceful revolution with the coalition of workers and some part of business owners.Marxist Perspective Regarding the Crisis (Social Concepts)The discussion of the crisis from the Marxist theory of class perspective makes it possible to take a closer look at such concepts as civil society and race. Civil society is regarded as a construct bringing society to balance and ensuring that all groups’ interests are addressed (Neilson, 2017). Race is another social concept that can
be applied as most of the city’s residents are Black. The poverty rate in this population is also the highest (Data USA, 2021). This group has the lowest access to proper living conditions (good neighborhoods), employment, and health care. This is the most vulnerable group that was the primary force empowering the civil society, which led to considerable improvements and crisis resolution.The Crisis from Bourdieu’s PerspectiveThe Flint water crisis can be viewed from Bourdieu’s perspective based on the idea that classes are analytical constructs. Instead, different groups, with individuals joining and leaving these clusters, collaborate or find themselves in a conflict. There was no clear-cut working class in Flint, and the big business struggled for resources. However, workers, unemployed people, small business owners, big business owners, officials, scientists,
of public health, people managed to force officials to make the right choices and address the water issue. The representative of different classes and clusters of society formed the civil society that became the power bringing the solution. The authorities had to implement appropriate measures to solve the problem. It is clear that civil society can be a supervisory force to ensure that officials make proper decisions.
The four goals of anti-bias education are forming identity, promoting diversity, teaching justice, and fostering activism. Identity formation presupposes that each child sees himself or herself as an individuum who associates himself with a certain family group. Diversity presupposes learning to respect differences between individuals and cultures. Teaching justice means teaching children to understand where wrong is done and to behave respectfully to all people (Derman-Sparks & Edwards, 2019). Activism is about educating children to be self-confident and not afraid to speak out for themselves. These goals are valuable since they allow us to educate people who will respect others, be responsible for their actions, and be ready to call attention to the wrongs that are done.The challenges of anti-bias education are making children behave respectfully even to
Aristotle made a discovery fundamental to all logic by introducing variables. Thus, it was shown that logic is not just a specific doctrine of specific things or terms, but the science of the laws of syllogisms, such as modus ponens or modus tollens, expressed in variables. Studying various judgments, formal logic abstracts from their specific content, revealing a structure common to objects of different content.Syllogism is the discovery of Aristotle and is the main and most original part of his logic. In the theory of syllogisms, Aristotle defined syllogism and distinguished its types, defined working and non-working types of syllogisms, and established three figures of syllogism. I find it particularly interesting that Aristotle was the first to make reasoning methods the subject of scientific research. He introduced the
lacks some characteristic philosophical features – it is more straightforward and technical. Modern logic is often called mathematical logic, thereby emphasizing the originality of its new methods compared to those used previously. In this sense, it is of less interest for discussion because it relies on exact sciences and computer technologists and avoids ambiguity. Thus, modern logic is built on artificial language and intelligence, which in itself is rather boring compared to traditional concepts.
IntroductionThe study of philosophy boosts a person’s problem-solving skills and opens one’s imagination to aspects of life beyond material science. Philosophical skills allow scholars to examine ideas, definitions, arguments, and issues that directly affect the perception of life (Blanshard 12). Such skills add to the ability to organize thoughts and concerns, cope with matters of worth, and extract what is vital from vast volumes of information. Through its demands on intellectual engagement, philosophy contributes significantly to the educational endeavor. This essay is based on the theme that philosophy is crucial as it opens the scholar’s mind in higher education to world views on thought frequency, vibration, and energy. In higher education, philosophy entails becoming acquainted with significant figures and improvements in antiquity, mastering current techniques, and accepting philosophical
issues. Exposure to the concepts in philosophy helps scholars develop critical, analytic, and observational abilities that may be considered the most valuable in the greater scheme of life.Fundamental Traits of a PhilosopherPhilosophy makes a critical contribution to achieving four criteria that should be foundational to any institute of higher learning. The foundational skills include instilling basic thought patterns in students and improving their text interpretation, writing, and good communication skills. These skills are essential in developing cultural identities and encouraging scholars to engage critical questions about reality, knowledge, and relevance (Rick 583). Specific fundamental traits make a scholar a good philosopher ready to engage in constructive arguments that shape decisions in daily life. The most common characteristics include open-mindedness, skepticism, and a systemic thinking approach.Open-MindednessOpen-mindedness is one of
the important that s that define a scholar as a philosopher. Open-mindedness is better understood as a predisposition rather than an occurrence. Open-mindedness is not about one’s honest opinions but about one’s willingness to revise them under suitable conditions. It requires genuine humility in the face of admitted fallibility and adjusting the perception of existing problems (Blanshard 32). Open-mindedness is a constructive virtue in a philosophical framework. It acts as a correction to confirmation bias, an epistemic fault. In this context, open-mindedness is the epistemically virtuous inclination to resist the detrimental consequences of confirmation bias on our capacity to reason correctly and analyze facts and arguments.SkepticismA good philosopher is also supposed to have some levels of skepticism that provide for more research invalidating the information provided in a
than on previous occurrences. A few philosophers have demonstrated some of these trains, including Socrates, a Greek philosopher from Athens credited with establishing Western philosophy.Argumentative Case for SocratesSocrates emerges as a paradigmatic scholar who understands philosophy as applying logic and reason to pursue knowledge. According to Socrates, such knowledge may be gained by contact with the surrounding (Blanshard 22). Socrates established that philosophy is concerned with the topic of investigation, even though such a study seldom understands the subject. Plato’s Socratic dialogues demonstrate that philosophy is a process of self-examination, examination of other aspects of life, and recognition of known limitations.
IntroductionI selected the Gardens by the Bay because of their unique design and Singapore’s innovation to develop a city within a garden. The buildings also posit a potential future that entails integration between nature and urbanization, showcasing the possibility for future generations to coexist with flora (PMP, 2022). Its beautiful design and elegant structures also have an aesthetic pull that motivated me to research their architect and inspiration for making them. Before taking this class, I knew about the Gardens by the Bay; however, my knowledge was limited to their location and accolades collected over the years.Architect and their Motivation to Carry out the WorkThe Gardens by the Bay were designed by two firms working in tandem, the Wilkinson Eyre Architects and Grant Associates. When the Supertrees are
lit at night, they look like cocktail glasses. The structures’ lead design director, Andrew Grant, claimed he drew inspiration for this form after visiting his brother in Australia and going to the Valley of the Giants. He saw aerial walkways that permeate a canopy of tingle and karri trees (PMP, 2022). Additionally, it is important to consider the influence of Singapore’s national flower, the orchid. This master plan emphasizes the beauty of these flowers via the exotic gardens while expressing their physiology via the structures’ distinct infrastructure to manage water, energy, and waste. It is also important to consider Singapore’s motivation for this attraction as it involved plans to create a ‘city in a garden, raising the life quality through intricate flora and greenery in the city.Form and
FunctionIt is Singapore’s national garden and a leading horticultural attraction for its citizens and international visitors. The gardens are a showpiece of garden and horticulture artistry, illustrating a novel way to view the plant kingdom. They integrate nature and urban living, intertwined in a mutually beneficial way (Gardens by the Bay, 2022). Additionally, the Gardens by the Bay was developed as a form of entertainment while it educates visitors on plants that many people around the Asiatic region rarely see. It combines plant species from cool regions, temperate climates, tropical habitats, and forests. The Gardens by the Bay is the world’s largest garden with supertrees.Personal Reaction to this WorkThe Gardens by the Bay is one of the world’s most unique and environmentally-friendly structures. The supertrees mimic ecological functions,
using technology to illustrate similar properties as plant photosynthesis (Gardens by the Bay, 2022). The structures collect rainwater, further illustrating the impressive commitment by Singapore to protect the environment. Its choice to plant exotic plants in an education-designed attraction is also a noble feat. While the country gains monetary value for its structures, it helps protect some plant species and elicits interest in younger generations about the beauty of diversity. The exotic plants help individuals in the region glimpse the natural greenery and horticulture in other places; few locations can boast of attempting such a feat.Influence on the Work’s View based on Architect Knowledge and Structures’ UseThe structures’ use in Singapore has a major influence on how I view the Gardens by the Bay. Additionally, I do not
believe the architect has influenced my perception of the works. Nonetheless, it is important to state that Grant’s building design had a noble inspiration as it focused on integrating nature and urban buildings (BBC Travel, 2022). It aims at utilizing natural energy, water, and waste conservation methods to fuel a modern lifestyle. My positive perception is greatly hinged on the environment-friendly nature of the buildings, illustrating the capacity for individuals to construct concrete structures while mimicking organic material to safeguard the planet and promote environment-consciousness.Formal Elements of Architectural DesignBalanceThe Gardens by the Bay are balanced as the supertrees involve vertical circular columns. Furthermore, the Bay Gardens are also balanced despite lacking column support, as in some dome-shaped buildings (Vinnitskaya, 2011).ContrastThe structures do not exhibit any form of contrast.
luminous flowers (Vinnitskaya, 2011).Symmetry and AsymmetryThe Bay Gardens are asymmetrical, while the supertrees are symmetrical. However, the latter exhibit varied sizes to mimic the nature of a forest, with tall and shorter structures.Proportion and ScaleThe structures have high ceilings, with one of the Bay Gardens hosting the second tallest indoor waterfall in the world. The large rooms aim to reflect the vast nature of open space rather than a room.
Kaplan analyzes the portrayal of women in a film using Laura Mulvey’s The Male Gaze theory and psychoanalysis. Kaplan argues that historically women have only been the focus of attention in the melodrama genre, and while melodrama exposes the limitations that the family places on women, it also forces women to accept those limitations as inevitable and normal. Kaplan argues that culture is deeply rooted in male and female dominance-submission patterns. The male gaze calls for a sexual, political gaze and offers a sexualized way of looking that empowers men and objectifies women. In the male gaze, a woman is visually positioned as an object of heterosexual male desire. Her feelings, thoughts, and sexual desires are less important than her framing of male desire.The Postman Always Rings Twice
Indeed, the viewer knows that Cora is sexy even before knowing her name. Using close-ups, the camera forces the viewer to look at Cora’s body. It creates a way of looking that is sexy and connected to the point of view of the male protagonist. In terms of contemporary examples, the Transformers film series (2006–2014) presents women as desirable sex objects.Filmmakers often try to avoid portraying female characters as just sex objects by giving them complex backstories, strong motivations, and an active role in the plot of their story. However, the male gaze is still common. Catwoman in The Dark Knight Rises (2012) has important personal motivations, but she is still clearly there to be looked at.
The Grand Canyon is one of the most grandiose sightseeing spots in the world. It took quite some time to discover and explore this natural work of art due to the structure’s immense size. Over time, the Grand Canyon became one of the symbols of the United States and the State of Arizona in particular. It is crucial to investigate the past of the Grand Canyon in order to realize its potential and see how this natural wonder could affect human lives beyond traveling and sightseeing. The current paper will conduct a thorough study of three articles on the topic of the Grand Canyon to validate that idea.First, it must be noted that the history and culture of Americans living in the area are directly connected to the
Grand Canyon. For example, Sara Maverick suggested that the rich human history could not be left behind since Native American tribes and numerous miners and archaeologists visited and explored the Grand Canyon throughout the years (“The Grand Canyon,” 2022). Maverick talked about how the Anasazi became one of the biggest groups to populate the Grand Canyon in an attempt to protect themselves from nomads. Nevertheless, it is believed that a severe drought has forced the Anasazi to leave their houses carved inside the Grand Canyon (“The Grand Canyon,” 2022). The rich history of mining also haunts this natural wonder to this day, as some of the mines located in the Grand Canyon produced silver, copper, and uranium oxide.Conversely, one should pay attention to the geological history of the
Grand Canyon and appreciate its natural features. For instance, Marisol West dwelled on the presence of 2-billion-year-old rocks at the bottom of the Grand Canyon (“The Grand Canyon,” 2022). As a result of a powerful erosion, the Grand Canyon remains a gigantic reminder of the previous eras when natural calamities were much more severe and powerful. The fact that the Grand Canyon is still home to the Navajo Indians shows how the natural state of the structure was preserved. Every geologic event that occurred since the first settlements of the Anasazi shaped the Grand Canyon in a number of unique ways that are visible to today’s tourists (“The Grand Canyon,” 2022). Thus, numerous floods and erosions only made the Grand Canyon even more grandiose than before.The Grand Canyon
visitors have to use their receptors carefully.Overall, it is safe to say that the Grand Canyon truly affects humans beyond being a sightseeing spot and a natural wonder. For many scientists and research enthusiasts, the Grand Canyon is going to remain an unremitting source of knowledge. Many visitors would be amazed by the history of the Anasazi and the Navajo Indians who lived and still live inside the Grand Canyon, respectively. Hence, the Grand Canyon is an impressive natural wonder that appeals to everyone.
for jobs where they could satisfy their desires.It is significant to mention that the purpose of the article is to inform employers about which factors can encourage the younger generation to work for their company. McKnight has also included some essential advice that is beneficial to recruiters. The author’s central thesis is that there are changes in the workplace now, and successful employers should conform to the major trends in order to retain workers (McKnight, 2021). The article completely achieves the purpose of informing employers of the processes and steps that need to be implemented to ensure that work satisfies the expectations and desires of employees.
IntroductionA large portion of different societies is structured and administered according to a set of rules, ethics, morality, and laws. Interestingly, when ancient civilizations evolved, they depended on rules and codes to maintain order throughout the empire. The Code of Hammurabi, written on stole stele and clay tablets, was the earliest written system of laws, consisting of 282 enshrined rules. The set of legislation was coined by Hammurabi (r. 1795-1750 BCE), the Babylonian monarch who invaded and subsequently governed ancient Mesopotamia. The codes are considered to have had a significant impact on the lives of Babylonians, spanning from political significance, ensuring fairness, economic significance, as well family and criminal legislation.Justice and ProsperityThe codes have acted as an inspiration for creating justice in various civilizations. Hammurabi had a broad
view of justice for all people. In conclusion to The Code, he claimed, “The great gods have summoned me, and I am certainly a shepherd who is bringing peace and whose sceptre is righteous.” While attempting to address future leaders, The Code asserts in the epilogue: May the ruler selected in the land examine the just words I have carved on my monument for a long time to come. As an element of the idea of justice, Hammurabi also asserts that he would defend the vulnerable against injustice by the strong.As a portion of his idea of equality and justice, prosperity is addressed. When Hammurabi asserts that he has provided “wealth to the population forever,” he is talking about welfare concerning economic prosperity and the well-being of his
people. However, considering the focus dedicated to private ownership, contracts, salaries, and markets, it is possible to argue that Hammurabi was interested in the economic challenges of the Babylonians. Thus, Hammurabi sought to create an institutional framework appropriate for economic growth by prioritizing prosperity alongside justice.Recognition of Economic ActorsAgriculture and international trading was the primary activity in Hammurabi’s domain. The Code relates to merchants acting via an agency in international commerce instead of themselves. The merchants fulfilled specific tasks of banking in the Babylonian economic system. One component of banking is receiving deposits and serving as custodians of these funds. For example, in order to deposit expensive items such as silver and gold, The Code requires that an agreement be written out in the company of witnesses. According
to law 122 of The Code, if a man intends to offer gold or silver to a man for safe custody, he must present whatever he provides to witnesses. Similar to today’s legal system, The Code establishes the necessity of witnesses and unbiased judges. The law makes it apparent that there can be no viable claim without an agreement or a witness.Recognition of Private PropertyAccordingly, The Code recognizes private ownership in the sense of land and personal assets. In the absence of private property laws and their execution, the Babylonian economy, with its agents, merchants, and landowner-cultivators, could not operate. Violations of property rights carried severe punishments, including the death penalty. According to Law six, if a man steals something belonging to a deity or a kingdom, he
should be sentenced to death, as shall everyone who receives the stolen stuff from his hands. The law makes no difference between an innocent recipient of stolen goods and a knowing recipient of stolen things. The death penalty is sentenced to both the offender and the recipients of stolen items.Enslaved people were considered property under The Code, and enslavers’ privileges were vigorously enforced. Law 15 specifies that if a man allows an enslaved person or slave girl from a palace to escape, he should be sentenced to death. The Babylonian society considered robbery attempts as a grave offence. According to Law 21, if a man breaks into a house, he should be put to death and hanged. Additionally, firefighters who attempted to seize the assets of the fire
victims were also sentenced to death. According to Law 25, if a fire breaks out in a man’s house and the individual who goes to extinguish takes an item from the house, that man should be flung into the flames. Thus, it is apparent that The Code regarded property rights breaches seriously and punished them with the death penalty in most cases. Hammurabi’s Code establishes particular punishments for various offences, as with modern laws.Sanctity of ContractsThe Code and various clay tablets and stele from the Hammurabi period demonstrate that no transaction was deemed legal without a documented contract. Once the agreement was signed, all parties were obligated to abide by its provisions. Any infringement was subject to dire consequences or sanctioning. According to Law 36, a chieftain’s farm,
garden, and residence cannot be sold. These are comparable to feudal estates in that they are bestowed by the monarch in exchange for royal service and are thus permanent in the sense that they cannot be auctioned. If someone purchases these properties, they will incur a financial loss. According to Law 37, if a man purchases the field, plantation, or home of a runner, his transaction is void, and he loses his money; the field and plantation. Strict conditions of agreement control the relationship between the landowner and the tenants.Economic Value of ChildrenThe Code places emphasis on the economic value of having children. The Code presumes that marriage is for the intent of childbearing. This is evident when The Code permits a man to wed another lady if
his first wife is barren. It was also usual for a childless mother to acquire a slave-girl for the partner to conceive children. Law 145 states that if a man has married a woman and fails to supply him with boys, he should marry a slave-girl and accept her into his home. Law 147 is clear about the role of the slave-girl in giving birth to boys. The law reads that if she fails to give birth to boys, the man’s first wife may sell her. 15 Children were meant to have economic worth, given the Babylonian economy’s agricultural predominance. For upper-class landowners, sons were likely sought not for their work but for their assistance in administering the estate and subsequently as successors to the inheritance.Concept of EquityThe
Code puts focus on equity as well as price fairness. Law 108 is an illustration of the equity principle. The law reads that if an alewife refuses to receive grain in exchange for liquor but takes silver by the heavyweight, they must condemn her and hurl her into the water. The Code anticipates that farmers would be cash-strapped between planting and harvesting but will have significant free time to spend at the pub. Additionally, as stated in the Preface, The Code ensures that the powerful do not abuse the weak. This is evident in how it establishes compensation responsibilities for people who suffer losses, orphans, and widows.Upon the demise of her spouse, the widow is obliged to the dowry and any agreement he made for her. Law 171
specifies the first wife to retain her bride prize and the settlements her husband allocated to her in writing on a tablet and reside in her husband’s residence. Law 172 goes a step farther in protecting the widow against her sons’ plans. If her spouse does not form an agreement with her, they are required by law to make good on her dowry and give her a share of her husband’s assets equivalent to an heir. If her sons continue to persecute her to force her out of the dwelling, the judges shall arbitrate her case and impose a sanction on the sons; that lady shall not leave her husband’s home. Similar to today’s court system, Hammurabi’s Code establishes the procedure for conducting trials. Hammurabi ensured that widows
and orphans were protected with this set of inheritance rules. What’s remarkable is that Hammurabi achieved his purpose of protecting the vulnerable through inheritance rules, not welfare state programs.Control of PriceGiven that The Code is a mirror of the Babylonian system, it is reasonable to conclude that the Babylonian economy operated under stringent control under Hammurabi. Law 215 establishes a fixed charge for doctors and surgeons. In it, it is stated that a surgeon who saves the life of a free man by making a deep incision in his body with a blade of bronze is entitled to ten shekels of silver. However, the charge is determined by the patient’s social hierarchy position. Five shekels are required of a free man, while an enslaver is required to pay
two shekels for an enslaved person.The Code, on the other hand, penalizes medical negligence severely. According to Law 218, if a surgeon makes a deep cut in a person’s body with a bronze blade and provokes the person’s death, they must amputate his forearm. As a result, a surgeon who has been found convicted of malpractice will be unable to continue with the profession. If the victim is enslaved, on the other hand, the punishment towards the surgeon is less harsh. It is not restitution but rather compensation for a discrepancy in type. Suppose an enslaved person dies while under the surgeon’s care; the slave will be replaced by the surgeon. If a surgeon accidentally removes the eye of an enslaved person, the physician is liable for half
the slave’s purchase price in silver.Reasons Why Hammurabi’s Code Can Be Viewed as TrivialDespite The Code addressing a variety of economic themes, there are several conspicuous omissions. One of them is a flagrant disregard for supply and demand. As previously stated, wage and price regulations are fairly extensive. By inscribing these prices and wages in stone, Hammurabi established their permanence. Anyone who ventured to violate The Code’s rules was cursed, as described in the epilogue. Hammurabi’s pricing theory matched the ancient scholastic traditions of Thomas Aquinas in its stress on just price, as opposed to Adam Smith’s stress on the market system as a determinant of price. This accords with Hammurabi’s declaration of himself as the ruler of justice.The financial duties to the state of the citizens are
and execute property rights. Additionally, The Code created the notion that the powerful cannot abuse the weak, thus ensuring economic fairness. Many of the components of contemporary capitalism are included in Hammurabi’s Code: private property, the use of product money and credit, and rule by a system of enforced laws. Therefore, The Code may be viewed as an institution-building effort. However, The Code is unclear on financial management by the public and does not acknowledge the principles of supply and demand. Ultimately, The Code incorporates other critical economic concepts such as efficiency, justice, and productivity.
In this chapter, Joseph Campbell writes about the significance of female figures in the adventures of heroes. More specifically, he states that “The Lady of the House of Sleep is a familiar figure in fairy tale and myth” (Campbell, 2004, p. 101). This claim means that the narrative would be incomplete without such a character, and the men would not be motivated to pursue their goals in adventures in the absence of ladies. Indeed, the end target is essential for overcoming hardships on the way, and the granted reward should be comparable to the challenges. Hence, the thesis confirms that the specified characteristic of heroic stories is one of the cornerstones of the narrative of this type.In order to support this standpoint, the author puts this quote in
the context of popular legends. For this objective, he traces the origin of this approach from the ancient Irish oral tradition and, more specifically, “the tale of the Prince of the Lonesome Isle and the Lady of Tubber Tintye” (Campbell, 2004, p. 101). This method helps him determine the common elements of all similar literary works and, consequently, underpin his suggestions with credible evidence. In this case, these components include the challenges one faces to make them start a journey, the detailed description of hardships on the way, and the ultimate victory, accompanied by meeting a beautiful woman.Considering the context and the general meaning of the quote, it can be stated that the selected phrase implies the presence of similarities in all fairy tales and myths across different
cultures. It means that female figures in these pieces are generally powerful, and their importance is no less significant than that of male heroes. Since princes and warriors in all literary works of the genre are willing to fight monsters and overcome numerous obstacles to reach them, this opinion seems credible. In addition, the fact that the women are sleeping adds to their perception as inactive characters, which greatly depend on their saviors.The main reason why the selected quote is the primary claim of the text is the incorporation of all details of this part in one sentence. For instance, the phrase solely refers to females as the ladies are stated as important figures. It also specifies that they are sleeping and waiting for the male heroes to
Campbell, is a compelling piece of writing characterized by its combination of brevity and comprehensiveness. It speaks about the particular significance of female characters in myths and fairy tales and, more specifically, their role in the motivation of male heroes to overcome obstacles in their adventures. By referring to famous legends for context, the author explains that this feature’s development took centuries, and it is still present in contemporary works. In turn, the selection of the quote for examination was conditional upon the inclusion of essential details on the subject. Thus, the review of this part of the book showed that the specified circumstance is a common characteristic of different stories within the genre.
The immigration stations of Ellis Island and Angel Island are sites with great historical significance. Until this day, these places keep stories of millions of immigrants that passed through the doors of the stations between 1880 and 1930. In this period, Ellis Island was the largest and the busiest immigration station for people coming to the USA, mostly from Europe. It was interesting for me to learn that many women were detained by the Ellis Island officials, as before World War II, women were not allowed to enter the country without men. It was also interesting to learn that since 1907 children under 16 were not allowed to enter the country without a parent. Those who arrived at Ellis Island alone were sent back to their home countries.
People who did not pass medical inspection were also sent back home from the station.It seems astonishing to me that the station officials managed to inspect so many immigrants daily. The photos and video footages that have been preserved in the archives of the station show that the number of people passing through was incredibly high. Another fact that seemed interesting to me is that the station officials could separate children from their parents if they did not believe that they were, in fact, related. For example, when Lucy Attarian recalls the day she and her family were passing the inspection at Ellis Island, the official did not believe that she was related to her parents. 1 Her hair and general appearance were different from theirs, and the
official told them to leave without Lucy. However, when she started crying after them, he believed that she was their daughter. The officials were cautious because there were many orphans coming to the country with other people’s families.Although the Angel Island Immigration Station was often referred to as the “Ellis Island” of the West, the conditions in these sites were very different, and so was the treatment of the arriving immigrants. This was due to the fact that people passing through the Angel Island station were mainly from China, and the Chinese Exclusion Act of 1882 had introduced strict regulations for immigrants of Asian origin. Many of them had to face “detention, quarantine, interrogation, and even deportation”. 2 Detention barracks for men and women were overcrowded and unsanitary,
The global pandemic has severely influenced the typical style of living people were used to before the strike of the harmful virus. The research paper focuses on the mental repercussions of the infection on students in Saudi Arabia. To be more precise, the authors aimed to investigate whether the transition to a new lifestyle due to the pandemic has impacted the anxiety levels of university youth.Naturally, the researchers needed to convey practical analysis to obtain data to form conclusions regarding the alterations in anxiety levels among students. That is why Khoshaim et al. (2020) surveyed 400 students from different universities on an online platform, asking the participants about their mental state and whether they noticed any changes in their behavior or perception because of COVID-19. It seems significant
is focused on an important topic, considering that students are still affected by the changes to global education as a result of COVID-19.Unfortunately, the results of this research cannot be claimed to be reliable as the students could experience anxiety due to different reasons that could not be omitted in their answers to the online questionnaire. Still, this work is a solid foundation for further studies with more narrowed scopes that could investigate the mental issues among the youth as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic and the following restrictions. In addition, the government can use the obtained data to assist students in overcoming their anxiety to enhance their academic performance and well-being.
In the modern world, when all countries are closely interacting with each other, such events as war can have a significant impact on the global economy. Even though the Russian invasion has just started, it has already caused a number of economic issues. The major problems include the increasing transportation costs and disruption of the global supply chain. Also, since Russia is considered to have one of the most substantial cyber warfare capabilities, worldwide cyber aggression may become a major economic threat.In the present moment, the main concern for the global economy is the disruption of supply chains that are caused by Russia engaging in the war. Russian suppliers are distributed all around the globe. More than 2100 the U.S and 1200 European firms have at least one
direct supplier from Russia or Ukraine. However, regarding indirect suppliers, the number of affected organizations increases significantly, reaching about 200000 firms in the U.S. and 150000 firms in Europe. Therefore, the indirect impact of the conflict on the global supply chain is profound, which results in soaring prices for various materials and goods.The war has a significant impact on commodities and materials. Firstly, Russia is the biggest wheat exporter, and Ukraine is among the world’s top exporters of corn. The result of their economic isolation can be a price shock on food in the countries that depend on Russian and Ukrainian exports. Secondly, the invasion impacts the supply of metals and raw materials from these countries, which is a significant threat to some manufacturing companies. For instance, Russia
possesses about 10% of the world’s copper reserves, apart from other metals, and Ukraine, according to experts, is a profound supplier of minerals.In addition, natural gas and oil prices are also spiking, which leads to increased transportation costs and expensive electricity. Since natural gas has become an essential source of energy, the limited supply from Russia can result in financial difficulties for manufacturers and other electricity-dependent facilities. For instance, Germany is highly dependent on natural gas in electricity production and manufacturing, making it vulnerable to a gas shortage. As a result, the export of automobiles, transport equipment, and electronics from Germany is now disrupted. While limited gas supply impedes the world’s manufacturing process, soaring oil prices interfere with global transportation. Being one of the leading oil producers, Russia
Drug ClassArtemisinin class drugs.DescriptionArtesunate is an antimalarial drug for injection, artemisinin derivative, and is used to treat malaria in patients of various ages. The effective action of Artesunate is supported by its advantage of a hydrophilic group (Khanal, 2021). Artesunate is a first-line treatment followed by an entire course of malaria treatment.Mechanism of ActionArtesunate metabolized into dihydroartemisinin (DHA), which contains the endoperoxide bridge responsible for combating Plasmodium falciparum, a parasite that causes malaria. DHA reacts with heme resulting in free radicals, which inhibit proteins and nucleic acid synthesis.Drug Administration and DosageArtesunate is supplied as a white powder for further dilution with sterile diluent and production of a colorless solution. Recommended doses of Artesunate are 2.4 mg per kg of body weight for adults and children are heavier than
20 kilograms, and 3 mg per kg for children less than 20 kilograms (Kitabi et al., 2021). The drug is administered intravenously at 0, 12, 24 hours, and after that – daily.Drug InteractionsThe drugs ritonavir, nevirapine, or UDP-Glucuronosyltransferase (UGT) inducers may reduce the antimalarial effects of Artesunate (FDA, 2020). UGT Inhibitors can enhance the side effects of Artesunate drug action. These aspects need to be monitored with the simultaneous use of Artesunate injections and mentioned drugs.Potential Side Effects/Adverse Effects/ToxicitiesAccording to FDA (2020), clinical trials of Artesunate drug have identified potential side effects and adverse reactions:  * hemoglobinuria;  * acute renal failure requiring dialysis;  * jaundice;  * anemia;  * thrombocytopenia;  * lymphopenia;  * neutropenia;  * pneumonia;  * diarrhea;  *
elevated creatinine;  * pulmonary edema;  * pyrexia;  * abdominal pain;  * vomiting;  * dizziness;  * headache;  * cough.Lab Effects/InterferenceClinical studies tested the efficacy and safety of the Artesunate drug. Two studies found that compared to another broadly used antimalaria drug – quinine, Artesunate reduces mortality rate and the risk of hypoglycemia (Khanal, 2021). Another study expanded the understanding of drug action by proving less risk for patients to have coma and convulsions. A clinical trial comparing Artesunate with artemether also showed less mortality rate and faster recovery with Artesunate.Special ConsiderationsIn the case of a sensitive reaction to a drug, such as dyspnea or rash, it is necessary to consider the possibility of treatment with another drug. After Artesunate treatment, patient follow-up
monitoring is needed to identify possible hemolytic anemia. Clinical trials have not identified threats to the mother and fetus during pregnancy, as opposed to the severe risks of delayed malaria treatment.Nursing managementThe healthcare practitioners first assess the needs or possible treatment of severe malaria by Artesunate drug. The preparation of the solution from the powder must be carried out using the diluent supplied. The nurse should take 11 ml of diluent with a needle to add to the powder and swirl until all the powder is completely dissolved. The drug is recommended to be administered as a slow bolus during 1-2 minutes. It is recommended to store the medication at room temperature, not freeze, not heat, and avoid light ingress. Health care providers must not use the medicine
Macroeconomic variables are indicators of production and consumption volumes, income and expenses, activity, and efficiency of the global economical level. These are also indicators of the rank of the well-being of the population, exports and imports operations, the overall rate of economic growth, and other economic processes. Macroeconomic variables tend to reflect general trends in the economy, the following circumstances, and their current level.The main indicator of the system of the macroeconomy is the gross domestic product (GDP). It characterizes the value of final goods and services produced by residents of the country for a certain period, minus the costs of intermediate consumption. GDP is measured at market costs for final consumption at prices paid by the buyer, including all trade and transport margins and taxes on products.
During an economic crisis or a lack of internal resources, this indicator can rapidly fluctuate and decline. If GDP increases, it means that more goods and services are produced in the country, the income and tax deductions of which can be included in the country’s income (Dvorský et al., 2020). If the GDP declines, this indicates the beginning of an economic crisis that negatively affects both: the target and business.Inflation is another economic indicator to track the level of a country. The process can begin for various reasons, including a shortage of goods on the market, monopoly of large firms, currency instability, and so on. Inflation has a huge impact on the economy and all types of financial instruments. Inflation is a steady rise in the general price
of raw materials, goods for sale, payment of employee salaries, and so on (Dvorský et al., 2020). The higher the inflation rate, the more unstable the market situation for businesses and customers.Macroeconomic indicators are the central indicators of the economy, with the help of which it is possible to determine the state of the economy as a whole. Critical changes of any of the indicators can portend a sharp change in a situation on markets and with currencies. Therefore, leading economists, brokers, and traders are constantly monitoring the latest macroeconomic data to update the state and the relevant strategy.
Essentially, the cause is the independent variable; its value is unchanged by the other factors in the research. The effect is the dependent variable, and changes influence its importance in the independent variable. The relationship between the independent and dependent variables is the primary focus of the research (Pokhariyal, 2019). The independent variable in the research idea is the situation that makes people feel nervous and unsure of themselves. Hence, the dependent variable is people’s level of conformity when facing stressful situations. Moreover, conditions affect whether people are more likely to exhibit conformity.The two most important features of any research are reliability and validity. According to Cypress (2017), the rigor of research equals the ideas of reliability and validity, which are all crucial components of quality. The more
The case tells about an elderly lesbian interracial couple Ruth and Janice. They have been living together for 42 years in a small town in a Southern state. However, due to a car accident, Ruth suffered a life-threatening condition and now the couple faces a challenge that entails complications in the various fronts of life. As Ruth has to receive long-term nursing care through Medicare and Medicaid, the couple faces a financial issue associated with healthcare. In addition, during the process, Ruth and Janice had to deal with issues associated with their identity of being a lesbian interracial couple. This included issues with internalized homophobia and institutional heterosexism.After leg and shoulder surgeries, Ruth was placed in the nursing home, where the couple faced first complications, such as a
Overpopulation is a concerning factor considering it has led to adverse environmental and societal effects. The consequences of overpopulation include the depletion of natural resources and climate change which have hindered the conservation of natural resources such as water and animals (Weber & Sciubba, 2019). Therefore, there is an urgent need to control overpopulation considering the fact that it will lead to the planet’s conservation (Weber & Sciubba, 2019). Therefore, everyone is obligated to control human population growth since it has steered increased extraction of resources from the environment, such as overfishing, contamination of water, and soil degradation, leading to depletion.Water has become a scarce commodity due to activities such as the over-pumping of groundwater. People consume large amounts of water as their population increases, leading to its
Religion is one of the most significant elements for immigrant groups. Religious beliefs and rituals unite people with common roots in the United States. The religion of the Jamaica West Indies people is the chosen cultural element to consider. The Jamaica West Indies, according to the interviewee, practice Methodist and Anglican traditions which are branches of Christianity ( Methodist vs Anglican , n.d). These two directions are connected with each other more than with other religious Christian traditions. Methodism is more common as it offers a greater focus on spiritual practices, as the Anglican Church is more formal. Jamaica West Indies immigrants additionally bring features of their culture into the Christian religious traditions, which is reflected in the integration of music into worship, which is not characteristic of
the original branches.In the home country of the interviewee, the Methodist and Anglican traditions are extremely common. It is noted that in the country more than 60% of the population professes the Christian religion, while the rest practice local directions, including Rastafarianism ( Faith , n.d). The historical roots of the Christian faith in Jamaica come from Europe and, along with the Methodist and Anglican churches, there are “Roman Catholic, Baptist, Presbyterian, Pentecostal, Seventh Day Adventist, Moravian” ( Faith , n.d). It is also important that the island has more churches per square kilometer than any other country. This fact emphasizes how important the Christian faith in its various traditions is for the local population ( Faith , n.d). Moreover, several educational institutions in Jamaica, as well as
charitable organizations, are run by the Christian Church ( Faith , n.d). There are official Christian religious holidays in Jamaica, four of which are also associated with church services. Thus, although the Methodist and Anglican churches are not mainstream, they are practiced along with other Christian denominations.Jamaica West Indies US immigrants’ religion is not much different from native practices on the island. Diamant (2021) in the Pew Research Center material reports that currently, Black immigrants to the US practice Christianity to a greater extent. Whereas US-born Blacks most often tend to practice the Protestant religion (Diamat, 2021). Most of them attend existing churches of various denominations including Methodist and Anglican. Additionally, some immigrants attend congregations that are dedicated to specific branches of the Christian religion and offer specific
Christianity in all its forms is extremely widespread, which makes religious practices quite common for this group in the United States. However, despite the practice of Methodism, Jamaica West Indies brought a special feature to their worship in the form of the use of musical instruments. Jamaica West Indies bands use music to set the rhythm for religious services, which distinguishes their practice from traditional branches.
An alien invasion is a famous plot in the literature, but Ndedi Okorafor enriches it with a few important details. In his Lagoon, the author chooses Lagos, one of the most populated world cities, as a center of invasion. In particular, the invasion of aliens begins at Bar Beach that is described as a place of mixing (Okorafor, 2014). This statement denotes that the world is full of contrast, and one state can quickly turn into another one. For example, Okorafor (2014) mentions that sand mixed with the ocean, while the poor mixed with the wealthy. This information reveals that the narrative will focus on a change. The given topic is also discussed in the prologue to Chapter 1, but the inclusion of Bar Beach to convey this
message is a less direct but still significant way to do it.Ayodele is an alien that comes to Earth to establish contact, and the author relies on specific means to describe the character. In particular, the focus is on how Adaora responds to the alien’s presence to show what Ayodele is. According to Okorafor (2014), Adaora experienced both attractive and repellent feelings while talking to the alien. On the one hand, this information means that Ayodele is a human-resembling character, and this feature is attractive for others. On the other hand, the alien has an idealistic appearance and exaggerated mannerisms, and these facts make people believe that something wrong is with Ayodele. It seems that Okorafor (2014) has decided to make the given character contradictory, and Adaora’s reaction
to her presence reveals this fact. Consequently, such an ambivalent description of the alien is necessary to convey that it is not known what to expect from this creature.Another significant detail refers to a personal space that is represented by Adaora’s laboratory. The author offers a detailed description of this location that the character uses to analyze the alien tissue (Okorafor, 2014). It is possible to suggest that Adaora always spends much time in her laboratory. One should admit that such a personal space is a shared feature of numerous scientists, engineers, and designers representing other fiction works. According to Gil (2018), a laboratory can be a metaphor of a state when a character conducts a philosophical experiment with variables to analyze unfamiliar phenomena or events. That is
The Lessons from Yusufiyah article retells the events surrounding the infamous 2006 massacre at Yusufiyah. The tragic story involved four American Soldiers who in drunken rage entered an Iraqi Civilian household, gang-raping the daughter and murdering the whole Family. This would have been not discovered and covered up if not for the bravery and moral agency of Pvt. Justin P. Watt, a young member of the platoon who privately investigated the unfolding events and eventually chose to report it in order to bring those responsible to justice. In his time in Iraq, Pvt. Watt faced a potentially morally injurious experience serving as an indirect witness to the massacre, which created psychological distress and ethical challenges for him, and an action plan for renewal is discussed.Morally injurious experiences (MIEs)
define as events, exposures, or triggers that transgress or violate an individual’s deeply held moral beliefs or values, associated with psychological distress as a response. The MIE which affected Pvt. Watt was the massacre. He was not present, but he was a second-hand witness, first hearing the story from Sgt. Yribe and later receiving greater detail from Pfc. Howard. Pvt. Watt was also on radio guard the night of the massacre, and he used the pieces of information to determine the approximate context of what had occurred. Pvt. Watt realizes his platoon friends with Green and potentially others had raped a teenager, murdered a Family, and covered up evidence. Furthermore, that Sgt. Yribe failed his responsibility as team leader to attain justice despite knowing the facts, and is
responsible for the cover-up as well. Pvt. Watt reflects, “I couldn’t imagine what it would have been like, hearing everyone screaming,” which suggests that he is visualizing the events based on known information. Despite not physically present or involved in the massacre, he is feeling the guilt and aftereffects not dissimilar to if he seen it happen. These are signs of PTSD and psychological distress.This event has a direct negative impact on the Soldier by placing him in a morally compromising position. Pvt. Watt is torn between loyalty to his platoon and friends and the Army code and moral values, experiencing psychological distress. Furthermore, the Soldier is noticeably horrified at the potential that his platoon members and American Soldiers could have engaged in such unethical and monstrous behavior.
Pvt. Watt griefs for the loss of innocent Civilian lives and questions his morality as a Soldier and member of the US Army. He has to consider the impact of his choices on his ethics as well as the families of those Soldiers and Civilians that had died in the war. Pvt. Watt sees rightly that the massacre represents an act of disproportionate violence inflicted on others, particularly Civilians. The US Soldiers committed the murder of innocents, children, and abused this Civilian Family both, more harshly than any combatant and without regard for their dignity and life. This is a direct root for cause of a MIE.The first repair/renewal response that will help Pvt. Watt in this case is connection. He feels isolated and hated, receiving death threats
and what they believe the consequences to their life should be. This can be a conversation with a real being or not, potentially if the individual is religious, with God or a representative of God, such as a pastor. The entity on the receiving end must not want the Soldier to suffer excessively and move towards forgiveness and restoration.During his service, Pvt. Watt faced a morally injurious experience by being an indirect witness and investigator to his platoon members and friends committing a horrific massacre of innocents at Yusufiyah. This creates psychological distress and puts the Soldier in a morally compromising position. He should utilize the renewal resources of connection and dialogue with moral authority to aid in processing these events.
IntroductionCulture is, in essence, a collection of common beliefs held by a group of individuals. Certain behaviors are deemed normal and correct by cultural standards, whereas others are deemed weird or incorrect (Tombleson et al. 16). In some traditions, personal relationships and unofficial arrangements are significantly more enforceable than any contractual obligation. Cultural interaction refers to the use of speech and other expressive tools by individuals and societies to carry out their operations and responsibilities through symbolic resources (Tombleson et al. 21). Regional diversity affects every area of global interaction. Even the medium of communication chosen may have cultural implications (Tombleson et al. 22). For instance, it has been observed that industrialized countries increasingly depend on computer technologies and place a premium on written text over spoken or
face-to-face contact.How Cultural Communications Affect Lockheed Martin’s Managers Globally CultureIn certain countries, conflict is seen positively, while others want to prevent it. Although confrontation is not generally encouraged in the United States, individuals are encouraged to resolve disputes immediately (Wilce et al. 243). In many Eastern countries, it is preferable to resolve disagreements privately. Furthermore, regional diversity would influence how Lockheed administrators approach activities. There are various reasons for this, including disparities in resource distribution, differing perceptions of time, and divergent views on how partnership and task-oriented labor should coexist. For instance, Asian and Hispanic civilizations focus on group processes at the beginning of the project and divert their attention to the ultimate goal as the program unfolds (Wilce et al. 243). In contrast, European-American cultures place a
premium on the task at hand and leave connections to evolve naturally.Decisions are commonly transferred to a junior in the United States. Self-determination is highly prized in several Southern European and Latin American cultures. In group situations, popular sovereignty works best in the United States, as in the case of Lockheed, whereas concurrence is preferred in Japan. Additionally, some cultures prohibit emotional engagement, the reasons for a quarrel, or private information (Ferraro 72). While specific inquiries may seem casual to a person, they may be inappropriate to someone from another culture. Thus, Lockheed managers would acknowledge this before they can gain a firm grasp on the perspectives and objectives of the individuals with whom they deal. Finally, diverse societies have varying perspectives on knowledge acquisition (Ferraro 72). Europeans
value information obtained by numbering and quantifying more than data collected through other techniques (Ferraro 73). On the other hand, certain African cultures place a premium on information acquired through symbolism, while certain Asian cultures place a premium on knowledge acquired through transcendence.Reason and passion both play a part in international commercial transactions. The one that prevails determines individuals’ effectiveness, their propensity for expressing feelings, or people’s emotional neutrality (Wilce et al. 241). Citizens of collectivistic cultures do not communicate their emotions openly but rather keep them strictly regulated and suppressed. In high-affect societies, individuals express their emotions openly by smiling and occasionally crying or yelling (Wilce et al. 241). Additionally, some civilizations regard time as a linear resource that may be saved or squandered. Other cultures perceive
time synchronously, as a continuous influx to be perceived today, and as an uncontrollable force (Wilce et al. 243). Thus, the perspective of Lockheed’s directors in worldwide interactions with countries with a culture opposed to that of the USA may influence their economic dealings.NormsIn the West, eye contact conveys assertiveness but can be interpreted as impolite or demanding in the Middle East and Asia. Additionally, there are gender-specific restrictions regarding facial expression, with many Eastern cultures prohibiting women from maintaining eye contact with men since it indicates power or physical intimacy (Lee et al. 112). Touch is commonly utilized in conversation, especially in business settings, as demonstrated by norms such as shaking hands. However, other civilizations regard physical contact with other individuals as impolite. Asians are more conservative
better to avoid entering anyone’s personal boundaries, around 2 feet (Odine 55). Certain parts of the United States are happy with completely calm appearances, while others take umbrage at the sight of a bare forearm or leg (Odine 55). The prudent course of action is to wear appropriate. Therefore, when moving to countries where the code of dressing disregards loosened attires, Lockheed’s personnel must dress appropriately; otherwise, no business dealing will transcend. Additionally, one can loosen up their attire if it becomes clear that doing so is okay.Non-verbal Communication
Shakespeare’s play Macbeth has been filmed dozens of times by great directors from all over the world. The film analyzed here was released in Britain in 2010 and directed by Rupert Goold. In fact, the British gave the world the most significant number of Macbeth ’s adaptations. This version of Macbeth is not considered to be the most viewed and discussed one. However, it has a lot of great qualities to be in the range of the best movies based on Shakespeare’s plays.The major attractive part about this film is the actor that plays Macbeth’s role in the movie. It is Patrick Stewart, the well-known actor for his role in the X-Men film series. Stewart has performed a tremendous work to feel the depth of Shakespeare’s Macbeth. In
the gestures, the way of speaking, and delivery, one can feel the two-sided nature of this Scottish general. While Stewart demonstrates Macbeth’s power and force, there is also a sense of vulnerability and uneasiness in character. As for the other actors, I was not familiar with them before watching the movie. The actor whose style and play I liked is Kate Fleetwood as Lady Mcbeth. She looks really evil and frightening because of her icy manner.The design of the costumes and locations is really modern, which makes this adaptation to be highly changed from the original. While Shakespeare’s play happened in the 11th century in Scotland, the movie’s design is more similar to the events of the 20th century. It is unusual to see such a kind of
author’s “reading” of the play, which everyone knows from school days. It seems that Goold wanted to analyse the totalitarian regimes of the 20th century through the prism of the 11th-century play. The most remarkable scene is when the man, whose face was not shown, watched the military parade of troops similar to Soviet or Nazi marches. After that, the movie shows a large hall with a portrait of Macbeth, decorated in the style of communist leaders (Stalin or Mao Zedong).Corresponding to the era of the first half of the 20th century, the costumes in the film Macbeth make sense. As for me, almost all the costumes resemble the NKVD officers’ clothes and the top leadership’s uniforms during the Great Terror of the 1930s. For example, in the
In addition to the titles of academic journals and articles, it is possible to determine which field of science an article belongs to from its content, the language used, and the focus of the study. For example, an article from the humanities explores people’s relationships of communication, satisfaction, and beliefs (Willoughby et al. 1631). These parameters are quite abstract and relate more to the field of human perception than to precise measurements. The article from the field of social sciences already uses the study of correlations, describing the relationship between phenomena and their influence on each other (Geist 1).Additionally, the researchers use more different graphs and numbers and focus on social and economic contexts. An article from the field of natural sciences no longer uses statistical data but
the study of various phenomena through the construction of systems and models. For example, Schacht and Kramer consider the human mating system through the lens of its influence on evolution (2). Thus, these articles use a more experimental design with application to the global development of the human species.Within the framework of the differences in articles that relate to various fields of science, a number of features can be distinguished by which a scientific area can be identified. First of all, the humanities pay more attention to the perception of a particular phenomenon and use surveys of participants for research. The social sciences are characterized by the search for correlations between phenomena and the social context, as well as the identification of statistical patterns. Finally, for the natural
sciences, an experimental study is important that can describe one or another phenomenon of nature or humans.Articles also differ in organizational structure depending on the field of science to which they belong. Thus, an article from the humanities field contains background information, a description of the research methodology, including the measurement procedure, presents the results, as well as a discussion. The social science article contains background information, data and methodology, results, discussion, and conclusion. Notably, the social science article clearly lists the data that will be used to find correlates. At the same time, in an article that refers to the humanities, various characteristics are used that are identified through various survey points.The article from the natural sciences is a literary review, so its structure reflects the description
of key concepts related to the influence of monogamy on the evolution of the human species. Compared to other papers presented, this paper focuses solely on the biological factors that shape the behavior of an entire species. The structure of the article reflects its focus and describes correlates such as concealed ovulation, testis size, sexual dimorphism, and others.Looking more closely at one of the articles, important writing techniques can be used in other papers. In particular, Willoughby et al. use their research and its results to test existing views and models of marital centrality. The authors use existing theoretical knowledge as a framework to shape their own research. This technique allows them to make their paper more evidence-based while also offering significant correlates that already exist for research
and consideration. This aspect offers an interesting technique that can be used to write research papers. First of all, it helps in the effective use of existing information in the field to form a new body of knowledge.I could borrow this strategy into my own writing as it will allow me to create more professional academic papers. This technique allows you to build a consistent structure of the study. Within this structure, the authors first present the existing knowledge and later present the gaps that can be identified in it. After that, the authors propose their own research, which could provide results to fill the existing gaps in this area. In my opinion, this technique offers consistent guidelines for writing a quality academic paper that I can use
For the political and legal system to operate properly, all their elements should align. Although U.S. states have large autonomy and have their own constitutions, they should not contradict the federal U.S. Constitution, including the first ten amendments to it – the Bill of Rights. The former outlines responsibilities and rights of different branches of power and the latter contains a list of basic human rights. If the state constitution contradicts the federal one, it might signal a lack of unity and democracy within the country. The paper aims to analyze Article I of the Florida Constitution in terms of its correspondence to the U.S. Constitution and, specifically, the Bill of Rights.Each article of the Constitution of the State of Florida covers different legal aspects. Article I contains
the declaration of rights guaranteed to all the state’s citizens and is presented in 27 sections (The Florida Senate). The present analysis will focus on the three of them: religious freedom, rights of accused and of victims, right of privacy. Each of them is presented in separate sections of Article I.Religious freedom is one of the basic rights that ensures democracy. It is enshrined in Article I’s Section 3 of the Florida Constitution, which states that no law will make people follow any religion or prohibit or penalize its free exercise (The Florida Senate). It corresponds to Amendment I of the Bill of Rights (U.S. Senate). Moreover, the Florida Constitution highlights that “religious freedom shall not justify practices inconsistent with public morals, peace or safety” (The Florida Senate).
Thus, in terms of religious freedom, the Florida Constitution aligns with the Bill of Rights and has an important additional note.The rights of the accused and of crime victims describe the rights of those involved in criminal prosecutions. They are enumerated in Article I’s Section 16 (The Florida Senate). Firstly, the section states that the accused must “be informed of the nature of the accusation,” have the right to present witnesses, confront adverse witnesses, and have a speedy, public, and impartial trial (The Florida Senate). It corresponds to Amendment VI to the U.S. Constitution, where the same rights are enumerated (U.S. Senate). Section 16 has been recently amended to emphasize and ensure the victim’s rights (Cassell & Garvin, 2020). Now, it guarantees the protection of crime victims’ rights
of the State of Florida generally aligns with the U.S. Constitution and the Bill of Rights, which shows that the state shares the same basic democratic values as all Americans. They include religious freedom and the rights of the accused during a criminal prosecution. However, as with other state constitutions, it presents an extended set of rights and guidelines specifically for its citizens. For instance, it offers a detailed list of crime victims’ rights and explicitly formulated right of privacy, absent in the U.S. Constitution.
Key Players and Business ModelsMedicare Advantage (MA) provides beneficiaries with health plans covered by Medicare-approved private companies. In Los Angeles, CA, the key players are Humana, UnitedHealthcare, Blue Cross Blue Shield, CVS Health, Centene, Cigna, and Kaiser Permanente (Freed et al., 2021b). Six large health systems account for half of the total market, but the market share of each system does not exceed 11% (Yegian & Connolly, 2021).Major business models in MA in Los Angeles are the partial and complete downside risk, with the full risk being used by UnitedHealthcare and Humana (Galewitz, 2018). In particular, a part of UnitedHealthcare called Optum has full-risk contracts with about a half million people in Los Angeles (Yegian & Connolly, 2021). Insurance companies also employ or are affiliated with physicians and
number of people enrolled in the plans. In Los Angeles, 50.5% of people were enrolled in MA plans in 2019 (Yegian & Connolly, 2021). Furthermore, the share of people enrolled in special needs plans are increasing (Freed et al., 2021a). These outcomes are driven by such factors as federal reimbursement, Medicare population growth, decreased employer-sponsored retiree insurance, ease of entering the MA business, and the growth of SNPs (Blum & Hsieh, 2020). Although patients are mostly satisfied with the coverage, they may sometimes be losers because of such issues as high deductibles, limited provider networks, and surprise medical bills (Pollitz et al., 2019). The winners in the market are healthcare providers included in the network and insurance companies.
Today, the research department at Merrill Lynch represents an inclusive environment where much attention is focused on talent development and work culture. I think that I would feel very comfortable working in this type of environment, mainly because of the fact that junior analysts are valued as much as senior analysts. In addition, working at Merrill Lynch would provide me with an opportunity to learn from other analysts and knowledgeable professionals, participating in collaborations and working in teams with them. The culture of research department at Merrill Lynch is based on making people feel as a part of something important, encouraging them to learn and accomplish their goals.As mentioned above, collaborations are an integral part of Merrill’s research department. Candace Browning, head of Global Research at Merrill, puts
great emphasis on developing initiatives to promote collaboration among the research analysts. Browning intended for the company “to move from a star culture where everybody operates as their own individual silo to a Merrill Lynch franchise culture where no one analyst is bigger than Merrill Lynch” (Groysberg & Vargas, 2007, p. 4). To achieve this, the research department had to increase transparency and communication between analysts. The main obstacles and challenges to this were related to the difficulty of encouraging local industries like retail and real estate to collaborate on a global level. Thus, some of the major challenges in this context included “different time zones, currencies, and accounting standards” (Groysberg & Vargas, 2007, p. 6). Despite these challenges, the company continued to work on developing different forms
of collaboration.It can be argued that one of the most successful collaborations was a cross-asset research collaboration. This from implied that analysts from different sectors and securities combined their efforts and perspectives to gain a better understanding of the company’s goals and strategies. Cross-asset collaboration at the Merrill research department also produced valuable analyses of the interconnections of different types of assets in certain industries (Bank of America, n.d.). These analyses were referred to as the capital-structure reports and were highly valuable for the company, because they had a significant success among clients, which increased the importance and credibility of the department.I believe that analysts will continue to participate in collaborative work in the future because it has been demonstrated that there are important advantages to it. First,
Studying the literature of previous times can provide valuable insight into how society was organized and what people had views on social, political, and other problems. This work explores the literary work of Franz Kafka, “Metamorphoses.” Therefore, this paper is a piece of literature that is still relevant and could be applied to society today in several ways. The main problem of this response highlights the problem of loneliness of people in the world, despite the simple idea of a good life.Before discussing the relevance of the work under study, it is necessary to have an understanding of its plot. Therefore, “Metamorphosis” will tell about Gregor Zamsa, an ordinary seller who one day a man realizes that he has turned into an insect of enormous size. The rest
technologies. Individuals are increasingly locked into their separate worlds and cease to interact even with the close people themselves.In conclusion, it must be underlined that Franz Kafka created his works during such a period as modernism. It is characterized by the destruction and confrontation of established social norms. Therefore, the author of “The Metamorphosis” focuses on the problem of lack of love and loneliness of people, which can be related to the modern world. Despite the fact that this problem cannot be immediately identified, many experiences internal suffering from having such feelings.
As the Mongols expanded their territory, not only did they become powerful, but they also left behind a trail of pain to those that resisted their rule. In the account of the Abbasid Empire and Section 7: The Rise of the Mongols, one trait associated with the Mongols is that in their approach and stopped at nothing to achieve power. For example, in the account of the Abbasid Empire, the Mongols used negotiations and instructions to compel the Muslims to submit to their rule.However, when the Muslims neglected the call for military reinforcement against the Persians, Hulagu murdered the people in Baghdad and depopulated the city only to recover decades later. In their rise, Genghis Khan realized the Muslim states were powerful, like his grandson, Hulagu, who tried
killing every living thing in his wake.One contrast between the two reads us that in section 7 when Chinson Bayan invaded Southern China, Kublai Khan led the Mongols to allow the Southern China Empress to live pleasurably inside an opulent palace. When her husband, the Song Emperor, heard how they treated his wife, he returned to China only to be seized and beheaded. On the contrary, the invasion of the Abbasid Empire saw Hulagu lead his horse riders in singling outhouse of learning for destruction. The people were massacred by the bushel, Abbasid Caliph included. Contrary to Genghis Khan, who poured molten gold down the throat of the sultan, Hulagu ordered his men to roll the caliph up in a carpet and rode their horses over him.
The stories written by Edgar Allan Poe always intrigue and fascinate the reader for various reasons. His “Murders in the Rue Morgue” is a unique narration of how a non-human murderer could disclose serious shortages in criminal investigation and underline the importance of observation and attention to the details. The intrinsically perplexing crime causes the reader to ask a multitude of questions about the seemingly contradictory evidence, a lack of means and motive, and superhuman mutilation; through these complexities, the reader is moved around the chessboard of mystery at the mystery of Dupin – the analyst with all the answers.When a crime scene is analyzed, people focus on the presence or absence of evidence, and Poe complicates the case by contradictory facts and notes. Using a metaphor of
“Coronation of Poppea” describes how Poppea, who has an extramarital affair with the fifth Roman emperor Nero, becomes an empress. Nero promises to bring her to power and makes her his bride despite being married to Ottavia and conflicts with Seneca (Tommasini 34). The opera could be considered problematic since it celebrates adultery rather than the sanctity of marriage. Based on historical events, it shows how a powerful man can betray his spouse and even make her exiled from her land without punishment or social condemnation.Arias, recitatives, and choruses are three separate terms from the music field. An aria is a type of musical composition that represents a song for a solo performance and is usually a part of a larger composition, such as an opera. Arias can
string instruments, including violas, violins, or double basses, and instruments from the woodwind family, such as bassoons, oboes, or flutes. Continuo instruments, for instance, organs, were implemented to balance the other components and add depth and dynamics to the performed works. Orchestras also actively implemented components from the percussion family, for example, kettledrums, to support musical pieces’ rhythm while also adding harmony. Finally, brass instruments, including Baroque trumpets, were another common feature of Baroque orchestras.
Patients at any point need an advanced care and proper safety at all times. According to the Joint Commission, hospitals should focus on seven patient safety goals for 2021 (Clarkson, 2021). The organization uses new evidence on emerging patient safety issues to inform its goals for the coming year. This data inspires other Joint Commission Center for Transforming Healthcare initiatives and teaching materials. Listed below are some of the hospital’s goals and how they align. When delivering care, treatment, and services, make sure to use at least two methods of identifying the patient. Misdiagnosis and mistreatment of patients can occur at any stage of the process.First, the person for whom the service or treatment is intended must be reliably recognized. A person’s name, a government-issued ID number, a
phone number, or other unique identifier is permitted. Unable to speak, babies have fewer identifying characteristics (Clarkson, 2021). Misidentification led to serving a mother’s breastmilk to the wrong newborn, posing a danger of transmitting bodily fluids and possible diseases to the newborn. In this case, all providers must use the same identifying scheme.In perioperative and other procedural settings, mark all medications, medication containers, and other solutions entering or leaving the sterile field. A syringe is a medication container, while medicine cups and basins are others. Unlabeled containers of medications or other solutions make it impossible to track down the contents. Mistakes occur when drugs and other solutions have been transferred from their original containers to unmarked containers, some of which have been catastrophic. Despite the dangers of this
approach, it is a commonplace in many businesses and organizations. Safe medication management requires the labeling of all medications and the containers in which they are stored. This procedure tackles a well-known risk factor in the delivery of drugs in perioperative and other procedural settings.Reduce the risk of anticoagulant therapy-related harm to patients. Prophylactic anticoagulation for preventing venous thromboembolism in regular settings does not meet these criteria (for example, related to procedures or hospitalization) (Clarkson 2021). Anticoagulation is used to treat several conditions, but the most prevalent include atrial fibrillation, DVT, PE, and mechanical heart valve implant. Complications in administration, monitoring, and patient compliance make anticoagulants more harmful than other drugs. This National Patient Safety Goal may also improve the safety of patients taking this class of medications.Moreover,
This week focused on the second chapter of the textbook that discusses the nature of people and culture. The first key point is the understanding that culture is the framework of life and influences the aspects of life for every individual (De Melendez & Beck, 2018). Therefore, everything a person does, how they perceive things, their dress code, likes and dislikes, approach to social and political issues, and interaction with others is influenced by one’s culture. This understanding will improve how I view and relate to people at work and in social spaces because different cultures will create different life approaches and styles.It is crucial to find an explanation for classroom behavior among learners. The second point from the text states that students’ manners, conduct, and reactions can
best experiences for every learner in the classroom.Lastly, although culture belongs to society, there are differences between individuals in the same cultural groups. Such distinctions are seen in a classroom where each learner has a unique way of expressing themselves and reacting to various topics. Therefore, even people within the same family or community may exhibit varying behaviors and manners (De Melendez & Beck, 2018). Such differences originate from socialization and individual distinctions. After reading this chapter, while in the classroom, I will treat each student as unique and culturally different guarantee each of them receives the best attention and directions during the learning process.
The artist’s name: Unknown; The title of the artifact: Nefertiti Bust; The date of the artifact completed: 1331-1354 BC; The size of the artifact: 47 cm high; The medium of the artifact: Sculpture.One of the cultural artifacts that denote the life of women in Ancient Egypt is the sculpture under the title Nefertiti Bust. It is a life-sized 47-cm high bust of the queen of Egypt, Nefertiti, who was pharaoh’s wife and lived in the 13 th century BC (“The bust,” 2022). The artifact is currently displayed at the Egyptian Museum of Berlin. Due to the high social and political status of the queen, this cultural artifact might have served as a commemorative or burial attribute. Commonly, bust sculptures in Ancient Egypt were “assigned to the realm of
The constitution of each state enshrined provision for the protection of individual rights of citizens, which also applies to New Jersey. In particular, the state constitution contains 21 provisions in Article I, which describe the rights and freedoms of individuals ( 1947 State Constitution , n.d). In particular, people are defined as free and independent by nature, and the freedom and security of the individual are paramount values. Additionally, every person has the right to participate in political life and has innate political power. At the same time, it is clarified that state institutions can restrict freedoms if the public good requires it.An important point in the protection of individual rights is freedom of speech and expression. However, it is also emphasized that a citizen “may freely speak,
The article describes a recent Chicago hot dog restaurant incident that can be considered an ethical issue. The incident involved a man who was asked to wear a mask to use the restaurant’s services (Sutton, 2022). In response, the man offended the restaurant employee by throwing snow in their face several times (Sutton, 2022). Additionally, the offender broke the glass door with an unknown object (Sutton, 2022). This incident can be considered an ethical issue because the offender’s actions were disproportional to the situation, apart from the obvious property damage offense. Furthermore, throwing snow at an employee might not count as illegal; however, it is blatantly disrespectful toward an individual.A utilitarian point of view would consider this incident wrong by examining the consequences of the offender’s actions. The
the restaurant’s property can be immoral. As such, dismissing the moral law renders the offender irrational in the eyes of a follower of a Kantian moral theory.I believe that utilitarianism is the most logical way to conclude this ethical problem. The reason for that is that negative consequences for anybody can be the best moral compass for almost any decision. The Kantian moral theory is based on moral law, which can be subjective in some people’s minds. As such, according to Kantian theory, some people might disagree that the incident is an ethical issue. In contrast, according to utilitarianism, a negative impact on any individual renders an action wrong.
In Liu and Asimov’s short stories, the authors define human beings and how artificial intelligence differs from the human mind. The author of The Algorithms for Love , Liu Ken, writes that humans are too young and too immature to understand the global laws of the universe. However, it seems to many that human self-sufficiency and autonomy in desires and actions is prohibitive. Asimov’s Liar is unique in that it is one of the author’s first attempts to reflect from different angles on the modern world’s clash of high technology and morality. Liu and Asimov approach the problem of artificial intelligence differently, but they agree that there is a strong similarity between the thinking of robots and humans.Liu Ken wonders where the boundary is between artificial and natural
intelligence. He is interested whether the robot’s self-learning program can be considered a person (Ken 5). After all, in essence, the decisions it makes are based on experience and knowledge – humans reason the same way. The author goes on to ask his readers whether humans can be considered robots with artificial intelligence, in case one considers that there is no essential difference between the latter and people (Ken 5). Thus, Liu Ken brings readers to his final question of who programmed humans in this case.Ken’s story is about a young woman named Elena, a programmer and designer for a company that creates unusual toys – robot androids. Improving from model to model, she finally manages to create a robot that can easily cope with the Turing test,
able to communicate like a real person. However, she is the only one who understands that this apparent intelligence is only the result of talented and competent programming. Analyzing the results of her work, Elena comes to a frightening question. She begins to worry that there is a possibility that people are not intelligent either and only work out the algorithms embedded in their internal program from day to day. In this story, Ken Liu once again managed to combine serious science fiction with subtle psychology and the dramatic fate of the main character in a small story. This literary work makes its readers embrace the idea of the identity of the artificial and human intelligence.Among the works of Isaac Asimov, one of the most significant and unique
Technological advance has resulted in business transitioning online, which, in turn, requires efficient market placements online through media. Naturally, traditional sources people are used to are now outweighed by the numerous benefits of new media. To be more exact, legacy media targets a broad audience, which is, obviously, ineffective and leads to companies wasting their money on a few integrations. This type of promotion focuses on old news presentations, such as billboards, television commercials, or printed materials (Vara-Miguel, 2020). Therefore, the audience that sees the advertisements is not narrowed correctly, meaning that most viewers do not find the commercials exciting and do not buy the presented products.In contrast, new media is adjusted to the modern view of society that is constantly engaged in interaction with various technological devices. In addition, Generation Z is more likely to be motivated to purchase the advertised goods when seeing the advertisements on social media (Vara-Miguel, 2020). That is why new media is mainly positioned on popular social networks, such as YouTube, Instagram, Twitter, and especially Tik Tok (Vara-Miguel, 2020). The influencers partner with many companies, advertising their products or service online to their followers, which is apparently more efficient than the old methods of legacy media. By and large, people are more likely to buy the items that are recommended by their favorite bloggers, models, actors, and other celebrities or accomplished social-media influencers.
The article by Will Douglas Heaven titled “The new version of GPT-3 has much better behaved (and should be less toxic)” focuses on how Generative Pre-Trained Transformer 3 or GPT-3 improved significantly due to the InstructGPT update. It is stated that “large language models like GPT-3 are trained using vast bodies of text, much it was taken from the internet, in which they encounter the best and worst of what people put down in words” (Heaven par. 2). Since the given tool from OpenAI relies on learning from all sources of English texts, it is used to produce highly offensive and toxic language. However, the new update minimizes such a problem by a significant margin, which generates less erroneous, misinformed, and offensive texts.It is important to note that
to perform these tasks much more effectively and efficiently.In conclusion, I think that GPT-3 is a highly promising instrument, which requires learning assistance conducted frequently. I agree that GPT-3 should not rely solely on self-learning, and professionals should direct the AI. The text generator is of paramount importance when it comes to making a substantial shift in progress toward automating many text-related jobs, which also include programming. Although the tool will not replace all software developers, it will make the mundane elements of code generation highly efficient.
Frankenstein possesses both positive and negative traits that help readers build his character. The main hero can be looked at from diverse perspectives; therefore, the creation of Frankenstein’s character can be seen as believable or even sympathetic. Due to his life difficulties, such as losing many of his family members or friends, Frankenstein is generally pitied by the majority of the audience. Later, the reader can understand that the main hero feels quite lonely and pays much attention to his research and studies to cover this inner loneliness caused by the loss of his beloved ones. Despite several inappropriate or sometimes immoral actions performed by Viktor Frankenstein, the readers have a tendency to consider his character quite sympathetic because of his traumatic past and lonely present. Additionally, the
researchers may see that not all inventions are really demanded by society and can bring more risks than profits. The monster had the ability to feel, think, understand, and even pronounce some words, which can be considered a type of artificial intelligence (Agustina et al., 2020). However, the invented creature turns out to be a threat to Frankenstein’s life which proves that people need to be careful when trying to substitute their loneliness or inner struggles with their artificial “friends’ ‘.
Treating people is a difficult job, and even the most competent doctor will not manage to do it alone. Nurses are an essential link in the work of the medical system and the process of saving the lives of the population. Thinking about my past, I find events that led me to the profession of nurse. The people’s experience significantly forms their character and thoughts, which determines many life choices (Woźniak, 2019). My experience in various circumstances helped me realize my vocation. These situations in my life may seem ordinary, but for me, they have become pivotal and those that prove that all events are not coincident at all.Issues of difficulties and challenges people face, for instance, global problems and similar concerns, have occupied my mind since childhood.
I kept wondering what could be done to change something. In response, thoughts arise about changing the world, environmental protests, the invention of technologies that will save the ocean. However, although these activities are critical, they seemed unsuitable for my character, and I wanted to do something more practical and influential. These thoughts are the first reason that led me to the profession of nurse. For me medicine and care change the world for the better. Moreover, without them, humanity would have never reached the modern standard of living. Changing the lives of even one patient for the better is also important as changing the whole world.Many of us had some experience of illness and even being in hospitals in childhood. Such a situation happened to me –
I had to stay in the medical center for treatment for several days. Being a child, I was terrified and worried, especially at night. However, there was a nurse who managed to calm me down and support me. She even let me call her by her name, Tina, and I felt that we became friends. I always recalled her with joy, and when I grew up, I realized how valuable and important her actions were for a little child. This situation was the second reason that led me to the profession of a nurse – I understood that there are many people in the world who, like me then, need the same support and comfort, and I can give them.We have to deal with diseases and injuries not
strived to help but did not want to harm. This event was another reason that prompted me to decide to become a nurse. First aid skills, and even simple help in measuring pressure, can be life-saving.Thus, several important events and long reflections when making decisions are behind my decision to become a nurse. I see many advantages in the work of nurses and believe in their particular importance. Saving lives and giving comfort and care to many people is what I want to do. Kindness, attentiveness, and support are what our world needs, and these features can bring wellbeing to the population.
The visual argument will be published in a one-page spread of a newspaper. The visual argumentation will target the general population to address ocean dumping. The audience values environmental preservation in the oceans and understands the threats of sea dumping on aqua life and the environment. There is, however, less awareness of deep-sea drilling and the impacts on the habitat and human life in the oceans and along the coasts. The augmentation will create an apprehension of the environmental effects oil companies drilling close to water bodies have on human and aqua life. The theme of the argumentation is to stop deep-sea drilling. To make my request clear and direct so that the audience would comprehend it without any misunderstanding or appearing of additional questions about the content
of my visual argument, I will use an image with a help of the text reflecting on deep-water drilling, threats to habitats, and life. People unevenly feel the impacts of ocean drilling, and the newspaper spread should enhance awareness among the general populationThe core of the argument is the environmental impacts of deep-sea drilling. The core argument should challenge the human/environment dichotomy. Deep-sea drilling creates very high risks of oil spillage that is disastrous to marine wildlife and contributes to climate change. The continued utilization of the extraction method causes a rise in the sea level, extinction, and decline in marine life and threatens the landscape environment and human life. The core argument will highlight the possible future calamities following extensive deep-sea drilling. The visual argumentation will be
implicitly expressed in one visual image and a slogan. The visual image will be impressive, catching, clear, and appealing to the audience, supported by the slogan.Appropriate use of font sizes, styles, color, and layout will catch the audience’s attention at first glance. The spacing and design will be proportional to the page size and the type of paper. Double spacing and precise words in the slogan for good formatting and avoiding clutter. A simple conventional typeface in the slogan will improve the readability of the augmentation. The slogan will be relatively large to emphasize the critical idea. The color selection in the image will be catchy and communicate the concept behind the design in the visual argumentation. The color will create deep meaning and reflection of the image.
be individuals covered with oil-like substances. The image should evoke emotions of sympathy and horror in the viewers. The image will demonstrate the direct impacts of oil spillage resulting from ocean drilling on human and marine life. The marine life soaked with oil will create an emotional appeal to the suffering inflicted on the animals. People covered in oil demonstrate the reciprocating effect ocean drilling can have on human life. By depicting significant risks, the relevant authorities should respond to put environmental considerations over the monetary benefits of oil extraction (Meyer 5). The image should appeal to the broader audience to abandon oil dependency and embrace sustainable energy sources.
The Hippocratic Oath, created in the fifth century B.C., is among history’s earliest writings. Although the authors meant it to be a formal commitment, modern doctors consider it as a vow to protect the art of medicine and work in the best interest of the patient. Throughout generations, the medical industry has amended the vow to reflect changes in healthcare and the community. One of the variants of the oath was written by Dr. Louis Lasagna in 1948.The most drastic difference between the original oath and the modern version is addressing the oath. The traditional version of the oath, for instance, is sworn by Apollo and other Greek gods of medicine ( Various physician’s oaths , n.d.). Today’s variants of the oath are sworn by anything sacred, or
patients ( Various physicians’ oaths , n.d.).Hence, the Oath of Hippocrates does consider the interests of the patient, but it is accustomed to the realia of that time. In comparison, the oath by Dr. Louis Lasagna reflects my ideals and values more. I put the patient’s interests first and believe that it is necessary to remain humane and respectful while performing my duties. Moreover, I also see the part of not being ashamed of personal unfamiliarity as vital since it can always give impetus to learning something new.
The project is devoted to analyzing the painting Madonna Adoring the Child , painted in 1480 by Francesco Botticini. It is one of the masterpieces of the Renaissance embodying the typical lines and techniques of that period.The artwork depicts Madonna staying close to Jesus’ Child. She looks with passion and love at him, while the baby looks at the Virgin Mary. The composition of the paper is balanced. First, the eye looks at Madonna and her head, but then it moves to a child and his image. The activity of the painting remains within the image borders, as only background scenery is seen. The work is not monumental; however, its size helps to create a specific composition with full-size figures on it. However, the baby might seem too
big, which can be symbolic to emphasize his importance.The colors used are neutral as the painter avoids using bright spots. The overall gamma is neutral, with the closes and figures’ heads being the most notable elements. All colors are naturalistic as the painter tried to create an accurate image of these two outstanding figures. Thus, the use of oil and tempera adds some specific roughness to brushstrokes and makes the painting look unique.The image also managed to create a clear illusion of depth as the background depicts a particular landscape that also looks realistic. The main figures are in the center and at the bottom of the composition, which helps to find them, seeing the background at the same time. All lines are clear and well-defined, and many
as such motifs, colors, and shapes were typical for artists of that period. The artist wanted to show the human nature of Jesus and, at the same time, emphasize the purity of the whole family.Altogether, Madonna Adoring the Child is a picture perfectly demonstrating the style and ideas of that period. Its central theme, which is depicting the Virgin Mary and Jesus, is one of the frequently used motifs of that period. The choice of shapes, colors and the whole composition is similar to other works painted by artists who worked during Renaissance.
The emergence of information society has sparked the further creation of multiple opportunities for revisiting the current sociocultural, socioeconomic, and sociopolitical issues. Specifically, the problem of inequities in the modern community has been established as one of the primary global concerns (Chakravartty 298). In turn, civil society organizations as the bodies that seek to address the presence of injustice have been applying additional effort to manage the observed injustice. According to the World Summit on Information Society (WSIS), the post-colonial context must be clearly understood in order to build policies based on the concept of equity.A similar sentiment is expressed in Aginam’s essay, where the author introduces an example of a situation that requires the force of WIS to address the problem of inequity. Specifically, according to Aginam, the focus on the transcultural economy and involvement of a greater range of global participants into the trade process will allow leveraging some of the existing inequalities (247). Specifically, by seeking partnerships and business expansion opportunities with foreign communities, one will be able to focus on building socioeconomic equality and raise the voices of the victims of colonialism.The idea of supporting minority countries in the post-colonial economy with the help of WSIS and the related organizations appears to be quite promising. However, ensuring that the actions taken by the involved parties are based solely on the principles of ethics and diversity suggests introducing practical control tools. For this reason, creating a global communication channel for post-colonial communities will be necessary.
A shareholder is a person who buys or receives securities from an issuing company in exchange for material or intellectual resources. Several types of capital are often attracted for the development of a private enterprise. Contributions can be financial, in the form of personnel and equipment. In addition, risk diversification (minimization) is a logical explanation for why an entrepreneur wants to share industrial responsibility with other partners. For several people to become co-owners of the company, the capital is converted into shares. This usually happens during a period of steady economic growth of the enterprise, when the founders attract new funds for business development.The scope of shareholders’ rights depends on the number and category of shares owned (the basic rights of the owners of ordinary shares). A shareholder
The global firm is PwC India, a company located in India. The company focuses on vital areas, including the government and public sector, digital services, and technology consulting. PwC India is on its optimization level as per the global project management maturity model (Naim et al., 2021). Such is attributed to its maturity stage, which is also considered the highest regarding capability maturity model integration. By implementing a global project management framework, PwC India has benefited highly from a series of events. Firstly, the firm has evolved and continues to improve its operational processes radically. Secondly, the implementation has resulted in a noticeable improvement in the innovation sector. According to Naim, Alahmari & Rahim (2021), innovation has resulted in key development, which has contributed greatly to the performance. Finally, the framework has enhanced the building of people’s capabilities, which have instituted effective delivery of high-quality complex information and technology programs on a timely basis—actions that have improved Indians returns on IT investments.Being on the final and topmost level of global project management, I would recommend PwC India firm actively engage its staff on managerial aspects. The move will aim to maximize the relatable instance that could jeopardize the operations and operation systems (Naim et al., 2021). Furthermore, since the firm is in its last stage, absolute improvement and consistent observation will be instrumental in retaining the company for the next 2-5years.
My discipline is Networking and I have chosen two articles related to the modern technology. The first article is written by Benzaid and Taleb (2020) published in IEEE Network, and it examines how artificial intelligence influence 5G network. The second article is by Zhang et al. (2021) and it analyzes the interoperability of BIM software tools and addresses the problems in the process of data exchange. It was published in Computer Applications in Engineering Education journal. In addition to researchers, the audience of the first article is data security agents as it provides some insights on how the use of artificial intelligence to 5G can be venerable to external attacks. The second article’s audience is educators in engineering education as it discusses about the method of teaching engineering.
This paper examines articles of Benzaid and Taleb (2020) and Zhang et al. (2021).To begin with, there is a need to understand the content of each article. Both articles are scientific and made by the use of quantitative and qualitative research methods. Benzaid and Taleb (2020) warn the audience that to fully reap the benefits of 5G, it is critical to develop robust and long-lasting security mechanisms that can deal with the ever-changing threat landscape. They suggest that traditional security measures are not enough. This is because of given the growing number of vulnerabilities, the sophistication of cyber threats, the high volume of traffic, and the diverse technologies (e.g., SDN, NFV) and services that will shape next-generation wireless networks. According to Benzaid and Taleb (2020), a new security
measure that needs to be considers is the adoption of Artificial Intelligence (AI). They describe AI as a method that would enable intelligent, adaptive, and autonomous security management, allowing for prompt and cost-effective detection and mitigation of security threats. Their description provides an impression that AI is a promising direction. Moreover, Benzaid and Taleb (2020) illustrate AI’s positive aides, such as its ability to identify hidden patterns in a vast set of time-varying multi-dimensional data that allow faster and more accurate decision-making.With regards to the second article of Zhang et al. (2021), it reports a case study of the development of the new capstone project for engineering major students. It is based on team-based learning (TBL) combined with the 360-degree evaluation feedback method to increase students’ BIM competency.
Data is collected and analyzed using a mix of qualitative and quantitative methodologies in order to assess students’ learning outcomes and BIM competency. The findings show that TBL, when combined with 360-degree feedback in the capstone project, can significantly improve graduates’ BIM expertise. This research examines the interoperability of BIM software platforms, data sharing issues, and recommendations for improving the course and BIM team collaboration. Compared to the first article, the second one is based on a study and has significant evidence to support their claim. The article of Benzaid and Taleb (2020) appeals to the audience by considering all potential security scenarios and analyzing specific aspects of AI and 5G network.The study of Zhang et al. (2021) discovered how students’ professional capabilities may be increased through a
capstone project, and educators can use the BIM course to build engineers that closely match industry needs. The paper makes a case for using the capstone project to help engineering students improve and cultivate their BIM proficiency in MEP systems. This research established a new paradigm for using TBL and 360-degree feedback in engineering education. In terms of the support for each article’s claims, Zhang et al. (2021) is more reliable as it has a specific case.In terms of the format of both articles, they are both heavily theoretical, meaning that there are numerous citations and the use of previous literature. Benzaid and Taleb (2020) provide images of how AI and 5G work, interpreting their explanation. It was done to make easier understanding for the audience. For example,
they illustrate mapping of the adversarial ML attacks to the ML5G high-level architecture. Meanwhile, Zhang et al. (2021) provide descriptive statistics and t test results as a table while making a comprehensive analysis of the data. As such, it can be assumed that both articles rely on logos rather than pathos as they are written scientifically, meaning that they are based on facts. In both articles, there was also a logical progression of ideas and claims that were supported by a great variety of numerical facts and evidence.The importance of AI in encouraging security in 5G and beyond networks was highlighted in Benzaid and Taleb (2020) article. Meanwhile, it emphasized the security concerns that may accompany the anticipated AI benefits if unscrupulous actors take use of their potential
or flaws. We advised many defense measures while advising on which components of the ML5G unified architecture they may be implemented in order to increase resilience to AI attacks. Despite their merits, each of the recommended countermeasures has its own set of limitations, and none of them can be considered an all-in-one solution for dealing with all AI dangers. As a result, one possible research avenue is to investigate how those countermeasures could be combined to satisfy both security and performance goals.Zhang et al. (2021) are trying to convince their audience that applying TBL and 360-degree evaluation feedback is suitable for engineering education. If Industry 4.0 is to be effectively embraced across the construction industry, enhanced BIM competencies for the AECO sector are critical; engineering educational programs play
a significant role in achieving this important goal. The unique combination of TBL and 360-degree evaluation feedback as part of the engineering capstone project plays a vital role in developing, evaluating, and acquiring educational capacity in undergraduate engineering majors, according to this empirical research study. The relationship between 360-degree assessment feedback and TBL integration to enable BIM competences in MEP systems for engineering students is the subject of this study, which is the first of its kind. The findings of the case study analysis show that BIM competencies are developed through all-around evaluation feedback and practice. The findings also show that collaborative ability has a significant impact, particularly in the cycle of evaluation, feedback, and improvement through reflection, which is critical for students’ BIM competency development.The contents of
both articles provide a comprehensive approach on their topics. The goal of articles is to inform the audience about their findings. The articles also want to convince the audience in importance of their work. The organization of articles is similar to each other, yet Benzaid and Taleb (2020) article has many sub-topics that help readers to understand the text properly. For example, there are various sb-topics related to 5G network management and risk assessment. The paragraphs of both articles are long and contain factual data along with their analysis. Each paper provides in depth literature review that states about the state of scholarship for the current time and some insights on aspects that were addressed in the literature. These previous scholarly works were cited by the use of
Harvard citation style. From a reader’s perspective, the chosen citation style was suitable and convenient to check the sources.The used methodology in both papers differs as they examine substantially different topics. Zhang et al. (2020) research study’s framework is separated into five sections. The study started with a look at BIM education and capstone projects in MEP systems, as well as TBL and 360-degree evaluation feedback in education. Second, in the BIM capstone, the TBL educational approach was devised, which was integrated with 360-degree evaluation feedback. This BIM capstone project approach (i.e., TBL paired with BIM 360-degree evaluation feedback) seeks to assist students and teachers through MEP systems teaching and practice, and its teaching content can be tailored to various engineering specialties’ needs. Third, TBL was paired with
360-degree evaluation feedback in the BIM capstone, followed by the use of 360-degree evaluation feedback to evaluate students’ learning outcomes and BIM competency, using a university in China as an example. Finally, the students’ teamwork, professional qualities, and BIM expertise were discussed, as well as the benefits of the BIM capstone project and suggestions for improvement.The experimental research method was used in this work, and a case study method was used to describe the BIM capstone project in detail. The goal is to use the new capstone project in conjunction with TBL and 360-degree evaluation feedback as an intervention measure to see how it affects BIM capability. It was not possible to construct a control group due to the small number of students in this major, the same
learning resources and environment for all participants, and the need to complete the requirements of the graduation audit and graduate easily. As a result, we used a series of experimental designs for comparative testing to determine the impact of the new capstone program’s implementation. The comparison of the experimental design’s learning effect aids in the exploration of the potential usefulness of new teaching techniques and curriculum innovation, which is appropriate for this study’s experimental setting. A semi-structured interview, evaluation criteria for capstone results, capstone scores and comparative test scores, and a review of the capstone process logbook are all part of the data gathering process for this study.With regards to Benzaid and Taleb (2020) study, unlike Zhang et al. (2021), they provide potential actions of attackers to 5G
network through the use of AI. Following that, they also demonstrate several defense mechanisms of how AI can be sued to prevent or even stop the attackers’ mechanisms. For example, defensive distillation is a training approach that employs the knowledge learned from a machine learning model to improve the model’s resilience to hostile cases. Both adversarial training and defensive distillation conduct implicit gradient masking, which consists of making the model’s gradient worthless by altering its direction or setting it to zero. Indeed, the lack of an actual gradient makes the development of adversarial cases more difficult, allowing the model to be more robust. This does not rule out the possibility that the model would be sensitive to adversarial samples created via transferability-based black-box attacks. Furthermore, the increased robustness
provided by adversarial training and defensive distillation comes at the expense of reduced accuracy on clean data.To create a robust model, ensemble methods mix multiple models. Ensemble approaches improve the model’s robustness while also raising its accuracy on clean samples. The advantage of ensemble approaches, however, comes at the cost of greater model complexity and processing cost. Defense Before feeding them into the ML model, GANs try to denoise input samples from adversarial perturbations by projecting them on to the range of the GAN’s generator. In other words, they want to select the sample that comes closest to the adversarial example that the GAN’s generator can generate and feed it into the ML model. Benzaid and Taleb (2020) also present some types of attack that can be mitigated
Historical OverviewMultiple religions characterize Brazil as the Church emerged due to the Portuguese conquests. It is believed that the first religion to enter Brazil with the Portuguese was Catholicism. The starting point is the Catholic Mass of 1500, verified by some of the first colonizers. Subject to the strong influence of colonization and the rigidity of their forces, Brazil struggled to cope with the religious onslaught. Missionary and educational activities helped strengthen Catholicism and the formation of elite communities. Although the influence was strong, early Catholicism intertwined traditional motifs and cultural beliefs.Catholicism spread to Brazil for two centuries: monasteries and indigenous church schools. By 1551 a separate diocese was formed, and then the first bishop became the head of the religious current. By the end of the 17th
century, Bahia became the seat of Catholicism, followed by bishoprics in Rio de Janeiro, Pernambuco, and Maranhão. Bishops, orders, and holy clergy led the Catholic Church to unite the people. During the period of Catholicism, the citizens of Brazil fought for their independence, trying to find a way to overthrow the colonial system. Brazilian independence was declared in 1822, after which the first Brazilian constitution was adopted. The constitution regulated the rights and freedoms of Brazilian citizens and freedom of religion. It led to the Roman Catholic Church becoming the state church, so believers were legally protected. In 1889 Brazil declared itself a republic, after which the Church was separated from the state.Until 1930, the Catholic Church had a strong influence on the population’s life. The Church intervened
in public discourse and imposed restrictions on private life. In the 1930s, the Church supported an authoritarian regime, bringing the Church back to the forefront. After World War II, however, Catholicism began to lose its influence. Brazilian citizens were finally able to receive a diverse education, which lowered the status of the Church’s schools. The military dictatorships of 1964 and 1980 were catalysts in the subversion of the population and the Church. Catholicism had divided into currents by the end of the 20th century, with radical or conservative churches responding differently to social problems. Catholicism has declined significantly since the last century due to political and social divisions.The Current SituationBrazil is a multireligious country with Protestantism, Orthodox Christianity, marginal communes, and Catholicism. Catholicism is widespread among about two-thirds
of the population and permeates various structures: politics is mainly influenced by religion. In Brazil, at least five party formations have incorporated Christian values into their ideological platforms. For example, the Christian Workers Party was formed in 1985 and is a conservative political branch. The Social Democratic Christian Party of Brazil (PSDB) advocates center-right movements toward neoliberalism. Although the religious ideas of public figures are not limited to parties, politicians and officials have certain beliefs broadcast to the public. This presentation leads to social conflicts in electioneering.The other side of the religious component of Brazilian political life is discrimination. Although Brazil is generally regarded as a country of tolerance, including racial-religious, tolerance figures for minority religions are still far from ideal. In general, the state preserves the rights
Pontifical Catholic University of Minas Gerais is recognized as the best among the private universities, providing predominantly academic training but with a permanent message of social inclusion.Competition and discrimination between movements caused Catholicism to surrender to the influence of other denominations. Protestantism in Brazil is growing steadily, the crucial branch being the Pentecostals. Their number reaches about 22% of the country’s population. In the 21st century, we can state that the religious agenda is returning to Brazil. The expansion of the new heavyweights of religious-political space – Protestants and Pentecostals in particular – will be a defining trend in the religious sphere in Brazil in the coming years. With their resources and influence, the Protestants are likely to seriously challenge the traditional player, the Catholic Church.
The Rise of the Trans-Atlantic Slave Trade in Western Africa, 1300–1589 is a book by Toby Green that examines conditions in Iberia and West Africa in the 14 th and 15 th centuries that set the stage for the subsequent complex interactions between Europeans and Africans. Despite the title, the book mostly focuses on 1460 to 1589, when Cape Verde Islands hosted most of the trade. The book will interest Atlantic explorers and the general public curious about European expansion and maritime trade (Shumway 731). However, it may not be the most accurate predictor of the subsequent historical events. Green thoroughly analyzes Cape Verde as becoming a place where European colonizers shipped, traded, and used enslaved Africans for agricultural cultivation. He then portrays the settlers from Iberia, mostly
New Christian Jews, arguing that their prior exposure to violence and exclusion in Europe influenced how they based a new society on slavery and the slave trade in the new location. The narrative then compares the African situation with other slave trades, including Islamic slave-owners engaged in the trans-Saharan trade, Mandinka diaspora, and early slave trade from Upper Guinea by Portuguese. Drawing on archival sources in Europe, Latin America, and the Caribbean, most of the narrative focuses almost exclusively on coastal and island locations of the Iberian trade. Additionally, inland Africa and places in Europe and the Americas connected to Cape Verde by sea trade are occasionally mentioned. Green covers the earliest European maritime activity and settlement phase in the Cape Verde Islands and the West African coast
between the Senegal River and Sierra Leone. The last part of the narrative states that colonizers then used the slave trade experience in West Africa in the Americas to suppress the Native American population.The author’s overarching aim in comparing worldwide slave trades is to state that many of the historical numbers have been underestimated. However, this argument does not address a still highly uncertain number of enslaved Africans taken out on slave ships, and thus the quantitative methods to estimate the volume of trade will likely refute this interpretation. Moreover, Greene rejects that African gold was more important than slaves to the first generations of European traders in Africa, a generally supported historical view (Shumway 730). Lastly, Green fails to see the global picture: for instance, the Upper
migration of Africans to the Americas. Such a claim is untrue – there is prevailing acknowledged information on America’s labor shortage and its’ impact of increased colonists’ demand for slaves in public education (Shumway 730). Overall, The Rise of the Trans-Atlantic Slave Trade in Western Africa, 1300-1589 contributes to the historical understanding of the beginning of the European slave trade in Africa and places the Cape Verde Islands at the center of its history.
The work Promises and challenges of Blockchain in education by Jae Park examines the blockchain concept, which has the potential to become a leading socio-economic technology in the context of network neutrality and big data. This study suggests that current trends in the Internet space will set new standards for digital ownership and storage. A comprehensive study of industrial and financial blockchain will greatly contribute to crypto education, crypto administration, human resources management, financial procurement, and other related fields.The principal purpose of the study is to observe the proposed tasks set by blockchain technology and the challenges expected in this direction. Blockchain was originally developed to operate with digital documents in 1991. In 2009, the technology started to be used in terms of cryptocurrency and has been proving
Considering that free will means that no one can be punished, having free will justifies some punitive practices and punishments. Thus, the presence of free will is important for marking a person as guilty and subsequent punishment. Often those who deny free will bear no responsibility for their crimes. Free will means the obligation to personalize actions, which also affects decision-making. In such a case, the policeman’s decision to incarcerate normally violent and dangerous offenders will be justified, which will protect the rest of society. However, there is still no consensus on free will and responsibility.Causal indeterminism is the theory that free actions do not have to be caused by anything, nor do they have any intrinsic causal structure. It argues that free actions must be uncaused, while
remains responsible for all committed actions since they have reasons for them. It is much more difficult to give a clear definition of the concept of the soul than of matter (Pleasants, 2019). Since ancient times, it has been believed that the physical shell of the soul, the human body, acts as matter, so we can easily define matter. We can define the soul as the consciousness of matter, its mental world, responsible for it.
SummaryThe analyzed research was dedicated to discussing the essential role of nurses in diagnostic error prevention. The researcher estimated nurses’ engagement in the diagnosis process based on the empirical literature review. Then, they proposed the conceptual framework of how the medical organization can reduce diagnosis errors. The conceptual framework was oriented toward designing and offering the model to expand the nurses’ engagement in the diagnostic process. The last step was to present the results of the framework appliance. Based on the theoretical literature review, the research authors provided an extensive model of full nursing engagement called the tripartite framework (Baker et al., 2017). The model included three essential components: interprofessional teamwork, patient empowerment, and the nurses’ engagement in identifying the diagnostic signs (Baker et al., 2017). According to
the practical model appliance, the outcomes showed a decrease in diagnostic errors and misses, increased diagnosis time, and total growth in patient safety rates (Baker et al., 2017). The model also emphasized the role of the patient experience and engagement in the diagnosis process through the nurses.The structured literature data presented in the form of the framework was applied within the particular organization. The empirical results contributed to the formulation of the four potential barriers to nursing engagement, including culture, education, regulation, and operations (Baker et al., 2017). Scientists also provided the solutions to mentioned challenges as an additional part of the conceptual framework. Concerning the cultural barrier, the psychology of the nurses’ self-identification was a vital problem. A vast percentage of nurses and clinicians supposed that nurses
should not participate in the diagnosis process (Baker et al., 2017). However, the research highlighted that nurses could not be separated from the diagnosis because they have a role in establishing patient-physician relationships.Including nurses in the diagnosis, the process was implemented by various medical institutions. Researchers provided examples of such implementation and analyzed the results showing an increased patient satisfaction level and a lower rate of medication errors (Baker et al., 2017). In an attempt to overcome this barrier, the researcher suggested implementing the engaging policy by the medical administrative bodies. In order to overcome the education barrier, medical providers should offer nurse education programs focused on specific diagnosis principles (Baker et al., 2017). Moreover, licensed educational organizations should implement interprofessional training classes in the regular students’ curricula.
StorytellingMost leaders and those who want to become one have heard about the importance of leadership qualities. Often, these abilities include various skills related to communication, emotional intelligence, professionalism, confidence, and ethics. However, not all leaders consider the powerful tool of storytelling. People view the world from their point of view for most of their lives. One point of view will never give a complete picture of what is happening. When a person hears the story of the interlocutor, he feels this different point of view, built on other beliefs, on a different life experience (Snyder et al., 2017). In this case, if a person is imbued with history, he is imbued with a new point of view and is already transforming his beliefs. In the hands of
leaders, such a tool can change the mindset of their mentees for better results.In order to break the status quo of prejudice and stereotypes, a leader must do more than just tell a story from his life. Any leader’s narrative contains a conflict, structure that is understandable to the interlocutor, and often hidden morality that prompts people to take the necessary action. Today we will talk about how storytelling from the mouth of a leader can become one of the main tools of leadership processes and why everyone benefits from it.AdvantagesStories are memorable, inspiring, and naturally transform often dry information. It often turns out that storytelling is the only possible way to convey thoughts to people. Graphics, printed materials, messages are devoid of the emotional and natural component
that a person always puts into his stories. First, the leader demonstrates his humanity by telling stories that, for many employees, the boss’s fear is a step forward towards a relationship of trust. Second, storytelling is creativity, and to some extent, even art. The same story told by two people can sound completely different. In addition, this tool promotes inclusiveness and diversification within the team since storytelling is a fundamental phenomenon for all nations, societies, and cultures and has taken place since time immemorial (Denning, 2017). Third, this tool demonstrates the experience to avoid mistakes in the future. Any story itself comes from the outside, and only through the mouth of a person, its meaning is told. A leader can communicate the vision and mission of the company
through their stories, thereby engaging employees in work processes more and more. In mergers and acquisitions, storytelling for new hires is critical, far more important than salary and schedule (Orr & Bennett, 2017). Finally, stories work in situations where direct orders are ineffective (van Hulst, 2017). People cannot become creative and obey obscure rules until they know what is behind these decisions. A leader’s story is a highly reliable source in this situation. As a result, a simple human life story builds trust and relationships between leaders and employees.ImportanceOther tools for building trust between managers and employees include the following. The first tool is open communication and feedback built on fairness. In part, this tool is the flip side of storytelling in the sense that in the story,
a person shares his emotions and beliefs, and in the case of feedback, he is ready to accept the feelings and opinions of another person. The result is a complete cycle essential for the healthy development of the atmosphere and efficiency within any company. The second tool is the introduction of company values ​​and the encouragement of appreciation. The tool is built on the foundations of corporate ethics and current trends in social responsibility. Employee values ​​can also be instilled through storytelling, transformational leadership models, or training (van Hulst, 2017). As a result of these activities, both the involvement and the satisfaction of employees in the workplace increases.Do you have a story?Let me share with you a story to illustrate an unpopular point of view. Leadership qualities and
all related tools can be applied not only in organizations and companies. Good governance is equally vital in simple everyday situations and complex disasters outside the office. Serious problems can arise in various spheres of human life, where the confident calmness of the leader is required. One story told by a friend of mine made a strong impression on me and fully reinforced this idea.My storyI once spoke with a close friend of mine who is very interested in Eastern philosophy and travels the world searching for answers to eternal questions. Fate brought him to Bombay, one of the largest and most resilient cities in India. On the streets, in houses, and in slums, there is always some activity very different from the traffic on the roads, for
example, in New York. He had the honor to share the slum life with the indigenous people, at the head of this territorial community, as it is supposed, was a leader. Every day, if he was not busy with business, he courted the slums and told stories to his residents, laughing heartily and teaching something. However, his methods of management seemed strange to my friend, and his punishments raised many questions. For example, he once quarreled with siblings; he tightly tied leg to leg with a scarf until the end of the day, reminding them that they are relatives to each other and no quarrels can separate their bond, which he so metaphorically conveyed. The leader was always accompanied by an unshakable confidence in his own actions. A
a manager on severe problems, although there are undoubtedly such “fires” in the activities of every company, with the difference that there is no question of life and death. The instructive “punishment” of the two brothers is inherently humane and metaphorical; the brothers agreed to play by his rules and probably forgot about the quarrel in the evening. By telling stories, this Indian leader recognized each of his inhabitants as a person and revealed himself to him as a person. That is why, in the event of a problematic situation, no one left the settlement in trouble, and behind this, there is much more than fear for their own property.
For Sanlu, melamine in their powdered milk could not have been found at a worse time. The stakeholders affected by the scandal were primarily Sanlu executives, suppliers, farmers, and operators of the milk collection stations and were ordered not to spread any news about the scandal. Fonterra, the largest trader of dairy products and Sanlu’s partner, is also considered a major stakeholder, but Sanlu shared the information of melamine with them. Sanlu and Fonterra took five weeks to decide what to do to avoid a major scandal, after which Fonterra recalled all their milk products (Mooney, 2008). However, Sanlu refused to do so in fear of ruining the company’s reputation, risking many infants’ lives (Mooney, 2008). It took New Zealand’s government’s intervention for the Chinese company to admit
Fonterra and Sanlu suffered significant losses in the process; some of them were arrested for adding melamine. The shareholders of Sanlu and Fonterra pressured the companies to keep quiet since they would lose all the money if the news of the contamination spread (Mooney, 2008). The media did not participate in investigating the stories of sick children due to the government’s ban on any negative news and reports that might affect the Olympics. The case of tainted milk provides evidence of how media can be pressed in manipulating crucial information flow.
The population of interest consisted of American citizens from all 50 states of the USA and the District of Columbia aged 18 and higher. Generally, the population of interest was presented by random 1038 American citizens who are allowed to participate in political processes and changing laws. Therefore, any American citizen who is in the voting age and lives in the United States is the target audience of the research.The sample was selected randomly; the researchers chose landline telephone numbers randomly among the listed numbers. At the same time, cellphone numbers were chosen by utilizing random-digit-dial methods (Saad 2012). Respondents within a household were selected based on their birthday date; the person with the latest birthday date became the participant.Each sample consisted of a minimum quota of 400

hypothesis: having thumbs has no impact on the efficiency and speed of basic everyday activities. The alternative hypothesis is that having thumbs is vital in all procedures and increases their speed. 3. I came up with the hypothesis when thinking about how my life would change if I would not have thumbs. Thus, most activities I could imagine would involve a significant role of thumbs in my daily routine. 4. My primary prediction was to get larger indicators for time spent on each procedure without thumbs than on the ones using thumbs. Moreover, my idea was it would take roughly two times more to perform a certain activity without using thumbs than with thumbs. 5. The control in this experiment is the indication of the time needed to
Seasonal Agriculture Worker Program (SAWP) is a governmental program that allows Canadian farmers to hire employees from the Caribbean and Mexico. Foreign workers receive temporary visas during the seasons of planting and harvest. Migrant farmworkers face problems of abuse during their working season. There are many cases of violation of labor in migrant employees, and it is essential to examine how SAWP undermines accommodations for Caribbean and Mexico migrants and seek an efficient solution.Many struggles exist in SAWP that should be fixed. For instance, migrant farmers work up to fourteen hours a day and receive a small salary. Work conditions are horrible, but workers’ complaints do not help fix the situation. Moreover, the workplaces for immigrant workers are often overcrowded; many employees report violating attitudes towards them. There
is no free access to medical equipment and attention; COVID-19 is ignored, and people have to infect each other.Lack of proper resources such as masks, sanitizers, and gloves makes the work unsafe for health. Places where migrant farmworkers sleep are called bunkhouses. These bunkhouses are overcrowded with people, and workers have to sleep very close to each other; it raises the risk of infection with COVID-19 (Mojtehedzadeh, 2020). It is important to note that many workers are elderly; it is known that older people get infected and bear the disease in a far more complicated way than young people. Thus, the 55 years old Juan Lopes Chaparro died because of coronavirus when he got infected on the farm (Dubinski, 2020). “Lopez Chaparro’s death has caused shock and devastation
to his family in Mexico,” the article reports (Dubinski, 2020, p. 2). He was a loving father of four children, and now his family is abandoned without support in Mexico.Everything I have learned from these articles caused emotional discomfort in me. I feel disappointed and very sorry for migrant farmworkers, as I cannot imagine being violated as they are. It is a manifestation of cruelty to migrant people. Significantly, the news about death from COVID-19 shocked me, as death is always frightening and devastating. I cannot imagine that such labor conditions exist in the modern world, where most of us have access to medicine, masks, and necessary medicaments.There are many political and economic reasons for hiring migrant workers for seasonal work. For instance, their labor is cheaper than
it is worth arranging periodic checks of the living and working conditions in the workplace. Many people strive to help migrant workers, for example, local volunteers. These people often are connected with the public administration, and in case rules are violated, volunteers can report, as migrants often do not know English. Volunteer programs might help improve the situation with abusive workplaces through checks, gathering reviews and complaints, and voluntary help if needed.
Using innovative technologies, ADNOC is planning to apply its electronic developments in all spheres of activity and production as early as next year. An equally noteworthy example of the diversity and multifunctionality of the use of artificial intelligence is the predictive ability of computer programs. The company is developing a computer capable of processing an impressive amount of large data and suggesting strategies for the company’s actions depending on the forecast. The developers of software for ADNOC strive to build a machine that would work according to a certain theory but would be able to offer the possibility of effective data reading. That is why, within the framework of the company, a powerful program was developed not only for material processing but also for its visualization. By using
The second industrial revolution, also commonly referred to as the technological revolution, denotes a period of enhanced industrialization, mass production, standardization, and scientific discovery. The first industrial revolution’s end resulted in a slowdown in essential inventions. However, the advent of the second revolution sparked numerous manufacturing innovations, like steel production, the manufacture of interchangeable parts, and innovations in the machine tool industry. Many historians dated the second industrial revolution from 1870 to the First World War in 1914.The second industrial revolution played a critical role in urbanization. Initially, up to 80% of humankind resided in rural areas and depended on animal husbandry and farming (Huberman et al., 2017). The staggering expansion of telegraph and rail lines, gas, sewage systems, and water supply led to a population boom in
The Signal and the Noise by Nate Silver reveals a heartfelt approach to statistical interpretations and predictions of data. The text explains why so many predictions fail and how researchers fall victim to masses of data while finding important signals is mostly a matter of caution, diligence, and correctly assessing one’s abilities. The text asserts that most predictions are wrong because the investigators poorly understand uncertainty and probability. A certain statistical problem is presented and evaluated; then, a tentative solution is offered.The author also suggests that statisticians can often benefit from applying multiple perspectives toward a problem. However, while it might be possible to obtain multiple data sets for something like weather forecasts, such an approach becomes more challenging with a field like economics or politics. Silver (145)
argues that many statistical errors occur when researchers attempt to predict too accurately and are overly confident in their abilities. He implies that while economic and weather forecasts are equally coarse, economic ones attempt to predict polls and rates in exact numbers rather than settling for an expected range of outcomes (Silver 146). Thus, combining multiple attempts with various predictions will yield a more accurate result.Furthermore, the current overabundance of nearly any data type results in muddling the real signals. Given the human tendency to seek patterns, people perceive them where they do not exist and build predictions based on false alarms. Silver (155) reminds the readers that “correlation does not imply causation.” For instance, with the sheer multitude of economic indicators, some coincidental correlations are bound to
arise (Silver 153). Therefore, each potential causation should be not only subjected to the standard test of statistical significance but the simple test of common sense.After systematically refuting the wrongs in the world of statistical predictions, Silver usually offers some solutions for the given problem. His all-encompassing suggestion to make the predictions better is to use Bayes’ theorem of conditional probability or Bayesian reasoning. The theorem allows predicting the likelihood of a theory or hypothesis under the assumption that some even has happened before that (Silver 198). Silver (198) uses the opportunity to remind readers that the idea behind Bayes’ theorem is not that one updates the probability estimates just once. Rather, The Signal and the Noise calls for continuous review of assumptions and predictions as new evidence
presents itself. In this part of the book, the author highlights the vitality of staying open to new information and thinking ‘probabilistically’ about the world.Subsequently, the argument is posed that all models simplify the universe, as they must otherwise be given endless details. In that, Silver (188) is a firmer believer that “all models are wrong, but some models are useful.” Therefore, it is wrong to believe that applying an ideal and universal model to a given problem is possible, given the often intermixed and incomplete nature of the real world. However, Silver (327) notes that imperfect predictability is not an excuse to abandon action altogether – he draws on the example of climate change, admitting the uncertainty in climate models. However, this uncertainty justifies the need to
are coming from to make truly careful and exact predictions. Furthermore, Silver (368) encourages statisticians to try and err, making many attempts and tests of the ideas that come to mind. The author ponders human perceptions of predictability, warning the researchers against the common bias of thinking that they are better at prediction than in reality. Overall, this book presents a powerful argument supporting scientific mindset and critical thinking using reliable data analysis.
The social determinants of health are the conditions in the environment in which people live, learn, work, play, worship, and age. I agree that the social environment in which people live can affect their health status. Health outcomes are not determined solely by biological factors or access to quality health care (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, n.d.). Resources that improve the quality of life can significantly impact the health of a population.Examples of these resources include safe and affordable housing, access to education, public safety, availability of healthy food, local emergency services, and an environment free of life-threatening toxins (Office of Disease Prevention and Health Promotion, n.d.). I also support the recent shift in the view that it is solely up to the individual to influence their
The reason for the military conflict between the United States and Spain was the American government’s support for the Cubans’ long battle for independence from the Spanish crown. The US invasion of Cuba became evident when the USS “Maine” sank under mysterious conditions in the waters of Havana. Around the same time, in February 1898, hasty preparations for war began, while the Spaniards were accused in absentia of undermining the battleship (Mortenson & Springer, 2019). In general, one can talk about a long-term political game with Spain, in which several provocations tightened relations with the country on the eve of the war.The liberation of Cuba seemed like a financially attractive prospect for the US and provided strategic advantages. In addition, the American empire was then just gaining momentum
The Spirit bear of the British Colony is a unique species of bears that amaze with their appearance and are of particular importance to the population of British Columbia. This type of animal is a kind of Kermode bear and is a subspecies of black bears, which often have dark fur (Service, 2017). However, due to a genetic mutation, some of the representatives of spirit bears have a white coat color, which is why they have such an interesting name (Langlois, 2017). Like many representatives of this species, they weigh an average of two hundred kilograms (Service, 2017). Many sources note the extreme rarity of this type of bear and only estimated about four hundred species in British Columbia, which determines the need to preserve them (Groc, n.d.).Moreover,
As a business consultant for Sun City Boards, I would suggest that the company adopt the SWOT analysis as a strategic Management tool. The firm needs to engage in a planning process by starting with the process of setting tangible goals and defining specific actions that are needed to achieve the said goals. Goals are the basic foundation of planning and are usually acquired from a firm’s mission and vision statements (FCSJ., 2021). They explain what the company wants to achieve and not what it can achieve. Therefore, the company needs to adopt the SWOT analysis as a strategic management tool of tackling its business problems.Sun City Boards can use the SWOT analysis to leverage on its own strengths, address its weaknesses, limit its threats, and take advantage
the best way to achieve future growth or handle a current situation to propel the business in the right direction (Visual Paradigm, 2022). SWOT analysis will help Sun City Boards to realize the importance of setting goals that are derived from its mission and vision statements. The company will also realize the importance of having mission and vision statements as a planning tool. The SWOT analysis will help the company to understand its position and encourage it to create ideas and decisions on how to build on its strengths, capitalize on its opportunities, limit its weaknesses, and help in the creation of business opportunities.
The main topic of discussion is the Supreme Court’s cancellation of vaccines and weekly check-ups against the coronavirus mandate for businesses. According to the mandate, OSHA would become the regulatory body for compliance with the rule at any enterprise with more than 100 employees. Contrary to the acute coronavirus situation, the Supreme Court recognized that OSHA exceeded its authority since the right to comply with such a mandate should remain with the employer.One of the points of view is that the COVID situation is getting worse, and the mandate was a logical continuation of Biden’s policy to combat coronavirus. According to CNBC’s analysis of Johns Hopkins University data, more than 731,000 new daily infections were registered in seven days, which is 4% more than the previous week (Kimball,
territory of broad public health measures (Bickel et al., 2022). The court also explained that coronavirus infection was included in universal risk diseases and could be compared with the risk of everyday dangers, which has nothing to do with the employee’s workplace (Bickel et al., 2022). The final argument against the mandate’s introduction may be that OSHA did not have enough historical practice to conduct such a broad experiment. This leads to the logical conclusion that the court’s decision and the point of view expressed in the discussion are fully justified and have much more negative sides than it seems at first glance.
Today, the importance of technology makes many people prefer to scroll through the timeline rather than get a few hours of sleep. Teenagers who are deprived of controlling their free time or filtering information coming from social networks are especially susceptible to this. Absorbing all the information that the Internet introduces, teenagers tend to stop evaluating the acquired knowledge sensibly. This leads to a deterioration of mental state physical health and increases the risk of falling into the hands of fraudsters. Since the spread of the Internet provides easier access to extensive knowledge and carries hidden harm, research has been conducted to analyze the impact of the Internet on adolescents. These studies were aimed at identifying the dangers that teenagers face on the Internet, finding their causes and
measures that can help overcome them. This paper examines some of the main effects of new technologies on adolescents and young people, including deterioration of the physical and mental condition, increased risk of becoming a victim of a fraudster, and the gradual loss of moral values in an entire generation.The interest of young people in social networks has specific consequences in the form of mental and physical health problems. For example, sitting in a constantly uncomfortable posture while checking social networks leads to the deterioration of the neck and back, provoking chronic pain in these areas. Moreover, bright light contributes to the damage of vision and sleep disorders, such as lack of sleep or even insomnia. Online interactions affect a teen’s emotional state, which can never be restored
when it comes to mental health. Adolescents have learned to interact with people while staying behind the curve, which disrupts communication abilities (Bibi et al. 480). This proves that when technology is used incorrectly, it harms comprehensively.The use of social networks by young people also weakens the institution of moral education and disregard for moral values. Uncontrolled publications on the social network Instagram with a demonstration of tobacco or the smoking process lead to the popularization of smoking among teenagers. Another problem is the distribution of images with alcohol consumption in the same social network, which erases the boundaries of what is permissible for minors. In addition, the lack of filtering of images of aggression and cruelty also leads to an increase in the risks of immoral behavior
teenager due to the influence of the availability of sexual content (Senadjki et al. 63). As a result, the number of sexual crimes, where the victims are teenagers, is increasing because of the lack of filtering information in social networks.From all of the above, it follows that the Internet has a huge negative impact of unverified information on the still unformed personalities of teenagers. All this leads to the understanding that the quantity and quality of resources viewed by teenagers must be controlled. Moreover, it is worth raising awareness among young people about the dangers and risks that await them with excessive use of technology.
The whole field of astrophysics and astronomy, in general, is quite perplexing. The rich history and significant discoveries made by well-known scientists paved the way for the technological revolutions of the 20th and 21st centuries. However, these distinct discoveries would not have been made without equipment. The article The telescope in the seventeenth century written by Albert Van Helden, sheds light on the device and its significant importance in the history of astronomy.In this article, the author made several strong arguments. In the beginning, he indicates that the telescope was used against the enemies as a terrestrial instrument. However, with the advancement and multiple improvements to the lense, the writer indicates that the telescope started to be applied to magnify objects (Van Helden 1974). According to Van Helden,
it was the telescope that made the difference in science, and it is the main reason why astronomers encouraged the telescope-makers to work on lenses (Van Helden 1974). I agree that the telescope can be the conduit of information for astronomers, and with its help, they can gather new data and make new discoveries. Nevertheless, I disagree that it is the only source of achieving such significant results in the astronomy.Consequently, as has been mentioned by Van Helden, different methods of encouragement of telescope makers were used. There are also other sciences that contribute to the development of engineering. For example, physics and chemistry focus on the appliance of knowledge about forces, pressure, and chemicals and their combination. The most recent developments might include the development of new
prohibited if they jeopardize the health or lives of people. The activity of engineering is, therefore, controlled by special laws.Hence, the development of telescopes and the improvement of the lenses gave an impetus to the advances in astronomy. While the telescope was first used as a terrestrial tool, it soon became astronomers’ tool. With the help of telescope-makers and developments of lenses, it was possible to make discoveries. However, other kinds of sciences, such as physics and chemistry, contribute to the technological advancements of our time. While there are no strong prohibitions of engineering, it is unlawful to jeopardize the health or lives of people.
The rock and music pop scene were introduced to and gained popularity on television through massive hit shows for teenagers. The three primary ones were Where the Action Is on CBS, Shinding on ABC, and Hullabaloo on NBC. As more households had access to televisions along with the growth of widespread range of programming, including musical ones, the television played a significant role in distributing the music to the public. The bands that appeared on these hit TV shows went on to see significant success in the charts. The television shows helped to articulate the new sort of youth music culture and almost became a star-making mechanism in a relationship and profits that the music and television industries shared. Some bands, such as the Monkees, the American response
to the Beatles, were created with the purpose of television performance as their acting and on-camera comfort as a group were initially prioritized over music. However, the Monkees’ music took off astronomically beyond anyone’s expectations. Nevertheless, they were a band groomed by the entertainment industry with an emphasis on television performances which took away much of the authenticity, even when compared to their counterparts The Beatles, who although made visual content, focused on their own music strongly (Covach and Flory 212).Television drastically went on to change the landscape of the music industry. First, a split formed among artists and fans, with one side focusing on the pop-oriented, performance-focused television music, while the other, typically older audience was drawn to serious-minded music of rock which continued to be played
done before and similarly created a new genre of music-television entertainment. However, until the advent of cable-network of television resulting in dedicated channels such as MTV, the television phenomenon in the 1960s had its limitations. Most TV sets at the time had poor audio and visual quality, and as recording and radio sound quality improved with hi-fi recording and FM, the disparities were noticeable. Television is not by nature of design a sound medium, and the musical experience is meant to be enveloping leading to the split in the fanbase, where younger audiences who generally cared less about sound quality appreciated the visual medium to their music (Frith 279).
Artificial intelligence in marketing is a method of using customer data and AI concepts, including machine learning, to predict the next step of the consumer and meet his needs, even those that the consumer has not yet formulated. The evolution of Big data and advanced analytical solutions have enabled marketers to create a clearer picture of their target audience than ever before. It is advisable to consider in more detail the tools of artificial intelligence used by large companies for a deep understanding of consumers.Marketers are trying to understand the vast repository of data understand the root cause and likelihood of repeating certain actions, so machine learning platforms are needed to help identify trends or common events and anticipate key ideas and reactions (Ma & Sun, 2020). Machine
learning can be used not only to reveal previously hidden ideas but also to teach and implement open ideas in new PR campaigns, optimizing consumer reach, focusing only on relevant users.Big data is a concept of the ability of marketers to aggregate and segment large amounts of data with minimal manual consumption. In the digital economy, there are thousands of data points attached to the target audience that can be accurately analyzed by bots to understand which message someone will like (Wirth, 2018). Marketers can then use this data to deliver the right message to the right person at the right time on the chosen channel.Numerous elements and factors are now influencing the current reality of companies in the market. They’re complicated, highly connected, and can be tough
to quantify. One of the issues that managers confront is predicting the precise direction of the business or product in a small amount of time utilizing a complicated system of data sources. Many learning algorithms are meant to identify trends from a large number of inputs and assist marketers in forecasting the desired future. Suggestions are a great illustration of how AI may be used in marketing (Wirth, 2018). E-commerce sites, blogs, social networks, and media sites use artificial intelligence to analyze consumers’ online activities and recommend products and content for better conversion, as well as to spend more time on their sites. Tracking content with AI will help you better connect with visitors to specific sites and show them more relevant content.Coca-Cola is an example of a
base in 200 countries, the company operates a huge amount of data. Experts use AI and big data technology to develop new products (Leadbeater, 2021). Cherry Sprite, for example, was launched based on data from vending machines in which customers mixed drinks to their liking.The more information is invested in the training of the chatbot, the better it performs its duties. Experts advise launching chatbots at certain points in the sales funnel. This will help you sell more and improve your conversion rates. For example, Google Play uses AI to help customers find the app they want and share their music (Wiggers, 2019). AI offers music based on past searches, time of day, and genres that people have listened to before.
Based on the Texas Board of nursing consequences are taken by a DWI 9 license obtained by an RN on an annual renewal form in Texas within nine months. In Texas, handling such a scenario requires the Texas Board of Nursing (TBON) to think that not all complaints about a nurse’s capacity to practice safely will need the same level of board involvement or result in disciplinary action. Furthermore, the TBON thinks that substance use disorders are curable diseases and that nurses who have made a stable recovery may safely offer care to patients in specific circumstances (Bettinardi-Angres, 2020). In this case, the Registered Nurse should expect a Tex. Occ. Code 301.4521.The board of nursing considers all of the details surrounding the specific incidents in the issue. In
The theme of education is not central yet tightly woven into both “Everyday Use” by Alice Walker and “Sonny’s Blues” by James Baldwin. Exploring this theme in two short stories revealed that Baldwin made a more significant focus on education comparable to Walker. Nonetheless, both stories contain similar notions, topics, and perceptions of education. Both works highlight and discuss the impact of education’s presence or absence on the characters’ lives.These short stories tell about siblings: Walker’s work narrates about two sisters while Baldwin describes the life of two brothers. In both stories, one of the siblings graduated from high school while another lacked education. Thereby, it seems that stories aim to compare the lives and intelligence of siblings. Initially, in both stories, the authors emphasize the success linked
might create a delusion about one’s intelligence, overstating the significance of existing knowledge and competencies. Education was perceived as a privilege in the stories, and those who could attend high school and graduate seemed to be given the right to condemn less fortunate people by default. Stories of Walker and Baldwin revealed the truth: particular skills, worldly knowledge, daily human experiences, and understandings of life frequently cannot be achieved in high school.
Ethical egoism is a normative theory that advocates that a person’s own good is consistent with the concept of morality. Ethical egoism also does not require moral agents to prejudice the interests and well-being of others by making their moral choices. Thus, ethical egoism claims that actions whose consequences benefit the performer of these actions are ethical. A possible moral choice in the situation can also be interpreted from the point of view of the theory of existentialism and hedonism.Point of View of the Theory of Ethical EgoismOn the one hand, it seems that Nora’s impulse to copy off a friend’s report is consistent with the basic concepts of ethical egoism because she will benefit from this action. However, the concept of ethical egoism does not necessarily entail
that, in pursuit of one’s interests, people should always do what they want if the fulfillment of momentary desires can negatively affect a person in the future. A thoughtlessly written off report entails quite tangible consequences, and getting a poor mark is only one of them. If it is possible to choose a good variant without harming others, then it is the right choice. Setting up a friend in this way will not lead to a good outcome for Nora: she will lose her trust and ruin her reputation. Thus, from the point of view of ethical egoism, Nora must weigh the risks and make a choice in favor of the minimum negative consequences for herself, taking into account the possibility of a damaged relationship with the friend,
loss of reputation, a poor mark, as well as possible shame for what she did.Point of View of Other Ethical TheoriesOne of the most advantageous theories applicable to the whole situation is the ethical theory of existentialism. Evaluation of Nora’s moral choice is impossible from the point of view of theories based on the result obtained during the analysis since it is unpredictable in this situation. If Nora writes off the work, she and her friend will be in danger of being punished. However, everything can go well, and no one will notice the decommissioned work. There is another option: if Nora honestly tells the teacher that she does not have enough time to finish the work, the punishment can be mitigated. Nora can also ask her classmate
for help; perhaps together, they will have enough time to do something before the deadline. From the existential point of view, the very fact of having a free choice makes a person exist, which means that it is not so important whether the choice is good or bad. On the other hand, the concept of hedonism puts the pleasure of the individual above anything else; the attempt to avoid punishment and the possible benefit, as well as the pleasure of resolving the situation, can be worth deception.Ethical Issues of Using DronesIn the 2010s, the US administration adopted a drone program; over several years, five hundred and sixty-three drone strikes were carried out in Pakistan, Somalia, and Yemen, killing more than 800 civilians. Naturally, questions about the ethics of
using such weapons quickly arose in society. The moral question, not based on legality, is whether it is morally good or bad to use drones. The main moral issue regarding drones is the ambiguous impact of this technology on the pilots’ health.The government’s point of view suggests that remote weapon drones are a good solution for minimizing physical costs in the military. Indeed, drone pilots are not physically present on the battlefield. However, although the pilots are not near the drone, they play a major role from the ethical side of the issue. Moreover, the risks to human life and health are not limited to physical damage. Many cases of psychological stress of operations’ participants have been registered, and the harm of moral injuries negatively affects health as
physical ones. Some may argue that the psychological harm to the drone pilot is exaggerated, but technology does not standstill. Rapidly advancing technology in general calls for a rethinking of many ethical issues (Quinn, 2020). As this technology improves, RPA pilots will see the target not as mere pixels but as a person; therefore, increased psychological consequences are inevitable.One more ethical issue is associated with the use of drones related to the difficulty of the decision to start a war on the part of the state. The possibility of remote warfare makes the decision to start a war too easy. Therefore, any decision to start a war under such circumstances may be unfair. Another ethical complication is how far the goals of such a war justify the means:
civilian casualties and danger to the pilot. Of course, casualties among the population are inevitable in the conduct of any war; with drone technology, casualties can be minimized, but it does not occur. It is still impossible to imagine a war completely remote from all sides. Even if the drone pilot himself is safe, the person supporting the operation from the ground is in mortal danger. Thus, the assumption that long-range combat capabilities lead to risk-free wars is empirically untenable.The Drawbacks of the Utilitarianism Ethical TheoryThe standard definition of utilitarianism is that actions are defined as ‘right’ or ‘correct’ based on their ability to promote happiness. If any action causes a backlash, it can be called ‘wrong.’ Such thinking assumes that the goal justifies the means to achieve
a particular result. Utilitarianism suggests that if an action brings more happiness than any other available alternative, that choice is considered the right one. From a utilitarian point of view, actions are considered right only if the outcome of the decision maximizes what is classified as good versus what can be considered bad. Thus, utilitarianism comes from the assumption that happiness is always good for a person. The concept of utilitarianism has several disadvantages: not considering the unpredictability of future results, the subjectivity of the concept of happiness, the features of feeling happiness, and the possibility of absolute dominance of the majority.One of the main drawbacks of utilitarianism is that it focuses on the outcome of a choice rather than the action itself. There is no moral judgment
about the actions a person decides to take. The only consequences occur if the outcome does not somehow maximize happiness. If a person’s actions bring maximum happiness, then it doesn’t matter that other people think it’s wrong. Utilitarianism suggests people look to the future and then predict what will bring them the highest level of happiness today. Moreover, happiness is a completely subjective concept: what brings joy to one person is terrible for another. It is also impossible to accurately calculate or measure a certain amount of happiness that a person receives from something. Such a vague category for assessing the moral aspects of actions is untenable.Every activity that a person tries will always be exciting if the first experience is positive. Each time this action is repeated,
the amount of happiness received may decrease, which is normal. From the point of view of this theory, it turns out that a person should stop the action if it ceases to bring happiness, which seems not quite adequate. In addition, utilitarianism would allow the majority to have full power over all aspects of public life. For example, if most people considered pedophilia acceptable and normal, that would justify any laws or regulations that allow such behavior, even if such a choice would be seen as a clear moral wrong.Evaluation of the Complete Act from the Point of View of Various Ethical TheoriesAhmed’s act can almost unequivocally be viewed from a bad side. Firstly, it is almost illegal from the point of view of the law on non-disclosure
coffee producer, the producers will profit, and Ahmed himself. Thus, everyone will approach the highest possible level of happiness. Another very likely outcome of events: if customers find out who provided their personal data, they will refuse Ahmed’s services, which will ruin his reputation. Thus, in the short term, the action could lead to happiness, and in the long term, it can completely destroy the person’s reputation. Since utilitarianism is not capable of working with delayed consequences, it is impossible to fully evaluate an act from the point of view of this theory.
‘Global complementation’ refers to a process that restructures production plants from being local producers of a good into being able to create the same product for export. This concept was first seen during a crisis situation occurring in a Toyota manufacturing plant in Thailand. Sales of Toyota cars dropped by fifty percent within a month in terms of local sales. Toyota made the decision to refurbish this plant into an export-focused facility. It took time but resulted in a beneficial outcome, with the Thailand plant being able to manufacture products for non-local sales. Toyota representatives stated that if the plant was initially designed to switch between local and international sales, the loss would be minimal.The phrase ‘global complementation’ was coined by Toyota themselves and essentially can be summarized
In order to better understand the higher prevalence of diabetes within the county, it is essential to observe both national and local trends of the illness. According to the CDC (2022), while new cases of diabetes have steadily decreased over the decades, the prevalence of the disease among people aged below twenty has not. Similarly, the prevention and management of diabetes among older adults is largely unsatisfactory and could be vastly improved. A number of socio-cultural factors also influence the prevalence of diabetes. For instance, individuals with Hispanic backgrounds are more prone to have the condition. Other factors such as age, smoking, physical inactivity, and obesity among residents could also be impacting the prominence of diabetes.Within the setting of the county, it is likely that age, elevated hypertension,
Panama is a developing country with a fast-growing economy located in Central America. It has one of the highest GDPs in Latin America but is not devoid of domestic economic problems, such as income inequality and poverty. This paper aims to review two current news articles about Panama, which reveal the issue of the high unemployment rate in this country, which continues to increase and has taken the form of a crisis.The first article appeared in a Panama news outlet called Newsroom Panama . It reports that, in 2021, 108,975 people in Panama were searching for a job, and the unemployment rates among women were higher than among men (Newsroom Panama, 2022). Unemployment results from a lack of new jobs, and the government has to pay subsidies to
a rise in unemployment.In conclusion, Panama is an export-oriented country, and services constitute the basis of its economy. Although the country’s economy is growing, this growth is not noticeable to its citizens, many of whom cannot find a formal full-time job. In order to address this issue, the country needs to increase the qualification of its labor force and create new jobs, for example, by investing in infrastructure.
The devastation and challenges of World War II were tremendous. The U.S. faced severe and significant objectives that would define the future state of America and European countries. It was essential for the U.S. to oppose Communist expansion in Europe and Asia, so there were specific policies that addressed this aim, and evaluating their efficiency and success may provide valuable insights.First, it is essential to discuss the policy of containment that was adopted by America and its allies. The purpose of this strategy was to prevent the spread of communism and respond to the Soviet Union’s moves to expand its influence in a number of countries by providing struggling nations with more funding (Corbett et al., 2014). It is possible to say that this policy was effective because
popularity of communism. The third relatively successful reform was the Vietnam conflict (“Domino theory,” 2018). In this war, South Vietnam and the U.S. acted against North Vietnam’s communist government (Corbett et al., 2014). Though the U.S. did not manage to protect South Vietnam from communist forces, its spread to the rest of Southeast Asia was blocked, and it is possible to consider this reform effective. Finally, one would state that the United States should not have feared international communist subversion during the Cold War era. The reason is that America’s strength allowed it to resist communist forces, and the fear could have undermined the nation’s confidence.
Writers’ use of various semantic meanings in their creative works is traditionally associated with the author’s internal desire to carry a particular thought through that image. Readers who study literature independently tend to interpret these meanings through the prism of their own experience, which means that it is highly likely that the use of the same elements by different authors and even in different books by the same author may not be understood in the same way. On the contrary, it is often the case that different authors seek to bring similar meanings to works using the same semantic imagery. Among these, the role of contrast, which is achieved on the integration of dark and light images, is particularly noteworthy. The most notable use of dark styles is
found in John Milton’s Paradise Lost and William Shakespeare’s Othello . In these classic works of poetry, dark imagery is used extensively by the authors to reinforce opposition to light styles, but additionally, the playwrights showed that darkness should not be taken unequivocally. This essay aims to qualitatively explore the use of such meanings in the two works mentioned.One of the central themes of Shakespeare’s classic tragedy is the juxtaposition of contrasts. The reader is made aware of this almost from the very beginning when the protagonist Othello is introduced as an African of Moorish descent. For sixteenth-century British poetry, the use of dark-skinned characters in prominent plot positions was novel because racist slogans in public sentiment were still strong. This is perfectly illustrated in Othello , when
the dark-skinned protagonist, which inevitably gives rise to thoughts of “crude Africans,” turns out to be a decent and pious character. Thus, one of the first and most obvious uses of dark imagery is aimed at Shakespeare’s desire to show that not everything “dark” is characterized as evil and bad, as it might seem at first glance.However, it would be erroneous to say that Shakespeare did not use dark imagery, among other things, to demonstrate a dark, hidden style. The tragedy of Othello is replete with various uses of dark signs and characters to emphasize the character’s unkindness. One of these is Iago’s lieutenant, whose actions are often described in the context of a deep, dark night. Against the background of the angelic bright Desdemona, who traditionally wears
The Walmart Foundation is a major provider of funding that uses the advantages of being a part of the Walmart business chain to create opportunities for people and make the world a better place. The foundation works in different fields, providing grants to those who share Walmart’s philanthropic priorities. The proposal guidelines are available in open access, and organizations willing to receive a grant can quickly check if they are eligible to do it and inspect the application rules.The Walmart Foundation funds many projects, and its philanthropy is based on diversity, equity, and inclusion. Thus, the organization focuses its support on specific areas, namely those associated with creating opportunities, advancing sustainability, strengthening community, and advancing racial equity (Walmart Foundation, 2022). People can qualify for grants in the fields
of economic opportunity in retail and diversity in the talent pipeline. The Walmart Foundation’s sustainability programs include climate, waste, natural resources, and people working in supply chains. The organization supports local communities, promotes healthy food, and uses its resources to identify upcoming disasters and help people prepare for them. Furthermore, the foundation has its own Center for Racial Equity to fight racism and accelerate change in society (Walmart Foundation, 2022). Organizations operating in the areas mentioned above have a high chance of receiving grants from the Walmart Foundation.Although the foundation does not focus on education, it supports the corresponding programs to advance racial equity. In October 2021, Walmart Inc. and Walmart.org announced several initiatives related to increasing access to education for Black and African Americans (Walmart Foundation, 2022).
The program implied that three Historically Black Colleges and Universities (HBCUs) would become Walmart’s partners, and the foundation would pay tuition and books in full (Walmart Foundation, 2022). In addition, the foundation invested a lot of money to provide a set of grants as a contribution to the educational system. Everything mentioned above demonstrates that the Walmart Foundation tries to support the world as much as possible, even if it does not focus on a particular field.Still, the Walmart Foundation is a large funding provider, meaning that applying for a grant might require sending a proposal that would stand out from other submissions. First of all, applications are invitation-only in almost all focus areas of the foundation. The only exception is the field of local community support, which
IntroductionThe white-tailed deer can be found in Canada and most of the United States, excluding Hawaii, Alaska, and the Southwest. It has a grayish-brown coat in the winter and reddish-brown in summer. The underside of its tail is white hence the title “white-tailed deer.” The nose, throat, belly, and areas around the mouth of a white-tailed deer are also white. The coat of a young deer less than six months old is covered with white spots. Males contain horns or bony antlers that fall off every year in January or December and grow back in April or May.HabitatWhite-tailed deer is highly adaptable and thrives in different habitats. A mixture of croplands, hardwood, pasturelands, and bushlands provides the most suitable environment (Ballard 36). They opt to stay in bushy
areas, croplands, forested woodlots, and meadows. However, newborn fawns require a habitat different from adult deer, which leads to different habitat arrangements and types. The survival of fawns is a vital part of population growth compared to adult survival because they are susceptible to environmental extremes and predation.ReproductionThe breeding season of a white-tailed deer starts in late autumn to early winter, with a gestation period of approximately 202 days. Female deer generally birth at around one and a half years of age (Bartylla 65). Females bred as “yearlings” birth one fawn while older females birth twins throughout their lifespan, which may continue to approximately 10-15 years in the Adirondacks. Most fawns are born in early June or late May and weigh around 3-6 pounds at birth (Bartylla 67).
The newborns also have a full coat of reddish-brown fur with white spots. Their eyes are open and nurse from a standing position when they are less than 24 hours of age, even though they are somewhat unsteady on their legs. At about one year of age, bucks begin growing their first antlers, and a new set will grow yearly. Antlers will continue to grow every year until around six years of age and then decreaseApproximately 60% of the body growth of a deer occurs in the first year of its life, and at the age of about three years, long bone growth is complete. Fawns have a slight odor at 7-10 days old and tend to move less except to nurse and react to disturbances like approaching
predators by remaining still while flattened on the ground (Dewey). At 3-4 weeks old, fawns begin to consume vegetation and accompany females. Weaning is usually by four months but can take up to 6 months or longer. The winter grayish-brown replaces the spotted pattern in fawns from September to October. White-tailed dears attain sexual maturity at 1.5 years though many males will not breed until older.Food and Feeding BehaviorWhite-tailed deer are herbivores and follow well-used trails to their feeding grounds. They feed in the morning and late afternoon hours, and their diet varies with the season and habitat. In fall, they feed on acorns, corn, and other nuts, twigs of woody plants and buds in winter, and green plants in summer and spring (Gallina and Lopez 7). The
white-tailed deer is a ruminant hence has four stomach chambers for digesting food. Food is mixed with bile to form cud in the reticulum and rumen chambers. The cud is then regurgitated, re-chewed, swallowed and passed to the omasum through the rumen, where water is removed. The food finally enters the abomasum, where it is directed to the small intestine, and the nutrients present in the food are absorbed.An adult white-tailed deer needs around 5-7 pounds of food every day. Energy needs are different with seasons and are greatest for males in autumn. Lactating and pregnant females require more energy in severe winter weather than other deer (Bartylla 83). Metabolism, however, decreases in wither under control for the photoperiod and increases from late winter to summer. During the
winter period, fat and browsing reserves provide energy needs. When deep snow cover exceeds a hundred days, starvation can cause massive death compared to moderate Adirondack winters.Activity and MovementIn the spring, the white-tailed deer are mainly active at twilight or crepuscular, while in summer, they are active during daylight hours. Bouts of activity occur equally in late autumn, at the beginning of the rut, and throughout this period. In winter, their activity is more likely in the afternoon (Ballard 40). Activity may be reduced by storms at any time of year, with increased activity happening before and after inclement weather. In late winter and spring, general levels of activity increase as the day length increases in summer and late autumn. When inactive, deer bend down or stand quietly.
Increasing metabolism and day length are overlapped by long periods of snow cover. Starvation is caused by a lack of nutritious browse and depletion of fats, although they can lose 25-30% of their body and still survive (Ballard 43). Fawns from the previous year are most likely to starve since they lack enough time to store fat before winter. Severe winters impact the productivity of females and the survival of white-tailed deer.RangeThe home range of a deer is generally less than a square mile. Deer collect in family groups comprising a mother and her fawns, and a doe is solitary when she has no fawn (Bartylla 15). Excluding the mating season when the males are solitary, the male bucks live in groups comprising three or four individuals.PredationDeer are
mainly managed by hunting parasites, and diseases also increase with the increase in their population, hence having few natural predators. The white-tailed deer is prey to mountain lions and gray wolves. A coyote is another predator of the white-tailed deer, but dogs and humans are the main predators (Gallina and Lopez 8). Deer populations can sometimes go high for their environment due to fewer predators, but they can starve to death. However, this can be controlled through hunting which is often allowed when their population grows out of control.AdaptationsThe hollow hairs on a deer’s coat help it to remain insulated during cold weather. The deer can camouflage better due to the coat of colors changing seasonally. Due to their spotted coats, the fawns can also hide on the
forest floor. White-tailed deer have four-chambered stomachs since they are ruminants. This adaptation allows them to chew their food rapidly or quickly, store it for further chewing and later digest it (Bartylla 103). They can also eat quickly on grounds where they may have to look out for predators due to this adaptation. They are also able to eat plants that other animals cannot digest.They can quickly notice danger because they have good hearing and a sense of smell. White-tailed deer stomp their hooves when alarmed or snort in an attempt to warn other deer. They may also show their white underside by raising their tail which are their distress signals or “flag.” This white underside helps fawns follow their mother when she is running. White-tailed deer run
A white-tailed deer require approximately 5 to 7 pounds of food in a single day. Their activeness also depends on the season, and in summer, they are active in daylight, while in spring, they are active in twilight. They have few natural predators, although these change with time, especially when their population has significantly increased. They have various adaptations that enable them to thrive in their habitat. These include their coat, four-chambered stomach, speed of up to 30 miles per hour, leaping, and swimming abilit.
The adversarial criminal justice system is one where the law is applied equally to all segments of the society. It is a system that presumes that one is innocent that shifts the burden of proof to the prosecution to prove beyond any shadow of a doubt. The advantage lies on the side of the defendant if there is any doubt. The accused is granted the right to silence and cannot be forced to respond to accusation levelled against them.This system poses some ethical problems because most of its procedural safeguards are always in favour of the accused. The favours that are granted to the accused include the right of appeal, the right to remain silent, the right to have an attorney, and the right to be free from
a tendency that has been brought about by racism in the American judicial system and racial inequality in policing. Moreover, the black man is more likely to be convicted than a white woman who has committed a similar crime. According to a report by the United States Sentencing Commission, a black man who is found the same crime as the white man have a potential of receiving nearly 20% longer prison term (Ingraham, 2017). These disparities are due to cases of racism and bias found within the American criminal justice system.
Woman with a Parasol – Madame Monet and Her Son is a painting by the French artist Claude Monet, a founder and one of the most outstanding representatives of impressionism. Painted in 1875, this canvas became one of Monet’s most well-known and influential works (Brodskaïa and Kalitina). The two figures in the painting are Monet’s wife Camille and his son Jean.The lower third of the painting shows a grassy area, and the other two-thirds contain the figures of a woman and a little boy behind her. Monet’s wife and child are the focal points of the composition. The lower viewpoint allows seeing the blue sky with white clouds behind the figures, which creates a unique lightning effect (Daily Dose of Art). Placed in the distance from the woman,
Daniel R. Spanjer discusses what tools are the most valuable to use in the initial consideration of the world around. Spanjer notes that humans “are neither merely products of the natural world nor entirely limited by it” (3). Thus, moral lows were created by God to guide the free will of man. In this regard, Christians need to study the religious worldview in order to understand how the world around them works. In turn, the study of Christianity is the basis for considering Liberal Arts (2). The study of God and his interaction with humans is necessary both for understanding the existing world and for its development in the future.The universe consists of three essential spheres, which through interaction with each other, form the complex world. They include
understand how they work together.The main idea of ​​this chapter, therefore, is the need to understand the laws of the subject of study. Spanjer emphasizes that it is impossible to understand the principle of operation of a particular sphere, ignoring its natural laws. This view, within the framework of the study of Christianity, seems to be the most effective since it allows us to integrate the consideration of the human essence and morality into a broader context. In this case, it is important to understand that human beings are also part of a larger system. Studying Liberal Arts allows you to structure knowledge about the world, depending on their levels and relationships.
Theodore Roosevelt was one of the youngest American presidents known for his progressive ideas and the desire to change society, addressing the existing distrust and helplessness. The decision to promote progressive ideas was not spontaneous, and he saw the movement as the possibility to protect the real rule of humans (Roosevelt, 1912). The characteristics of a progressive are the intention to stand for social justice, achieve good for all people, and improve the environment in which individuals should grow and develop. Being a progressive means being optimistic about every initiative and participating in problem-solving processes. There is no need to hide behind or keep silent but to act and become passionate about changes and transformations.Despite the desire to support progressive thoughts, there are also some examples of anti-progressives.
autoantibodies (Quintero et al., 2021). Individuals with Hashimoto thyroiditis and observable hypothyroidism are usually prescribed thyroid hormone treatment for the rest of their lives (Quintero et al., 2021). When a woman’s thyroid part starts being irritated after giving birth, it is known as postpartum thyroiditis.Treatment of thyroiditis should be concentrated on specific symptoms and manifestations. Screening, observation, and medical follow-up are suggested in all instances of thyroiditis to evaluate alterations in thyroid function (Quintero et al., 2021). Acute symptoms can be treated, and thyroid function will normally recover and remain stable over time (Franquemont & Galvez, 2021). A common technique for diagnosing thyroiditis is to palpate the thyroid gland throughout a medical assessment.
A clinical office assistant is an employee who has numerous clerical and administrative tasks that need to be performed quickly and qualitatively. Time management tools are the most practical options that enhance the work process. One of the most generally applied tools is Call Please , which optimizes receiving and making calls (Helms, 2021). It dramatically simplifies the process of logging and allows one to compile a list of outgoing rings in a specific order. Therefore, Call Please reserves a lot of time and eliminates the case of omitting a patient or contacting the wrong person.Evernote is another frequently used tool that is an advanced workspace for increasing productivity. It can be utilized to upload vital notes, create messages, commotion lists, tables, and access the data to any
other devices (Helms, 2021). It is beneficial during patient care and registration, as its functionality enables one to organize snapshots, store handwritten notices, create photos of documents, make scans, and send them to doctors.Moreover, clinical office assistants use Todoist , which allows monitoring task statuses in one place. It synchronizes with other applications and makes it feasible to form the daily schedule and plan the work (Helms, 2021). Thus, one can intelligently distribute the available time on the number of tasks and assess productivity at the end of the day. No less critical tool is NueMD , a medical billing software with electronic record capabilities. It includes an online patient portal, electronic prescriptions, and labs; furthermore, the tool has custom reporting capabilities (Helms, 2021). Its prominence is hard
the work process and reduce the number of skipped appointments.The clinical office assistant is often the first person to interact with patients and familiarize themselves with their needs. The Medical Assisting Pocket is a tool that enables them to improve and give immediate and quality service (Helms, 2021). An accurate pocket guide provides access to medical abbreviations, billing tips, and insurance coding. It also has several handbooks and training in administrative and clinical skills, allowing one to improve mastery and reduce the time it takes to complete the tasks. Thus, there are many tools for time management, but those mentioned above are considered the most appropriate for assistants.
In the present competitive environment especially affected by the pandemic, the majority of automobile brands undertake all efforts to attract new clients and improve customer loyalty. Toyota is a company known worldwide for its continuous focus on exceeding consumers’ expectations through its product’s quality and sustainability. For instance, it is strongly committed to the achievement of zero CO2 emissions in the future, offering hybrid electric and nitrogen options. During the pandemic, it is attracting partners, dealers, and customers by emphasizing its adherence to careful infection prevention measures (Cenizo, 2020). In addition, Toyota pays particular attention to the quality of its customer support, ensuring that service center employees have all necessary problem-solving skills. The company offers an immediate and free examination of a vehicle in the case of its
Volvo has 33% of customer loyalty (Suneson, 2019). A considerable number of Volvo drivers do not plan to purchase this brand’s products again, and auto reviewers suggest better options. However, the company does not implement any efficient strategy to improve consumer satisfaction and influence the opinion of experts. In general, not only the price and quality form customer loyalty, but the brand’s responsiveness to any complaints or suggestions contributes to people’s delight and brand awareness as well.
Executive SummaryToyota Motor Manufacturing UK should focus on the United Arab Emirates as its next market. Following a macro-environment evaluation, the country has a stable environment, which is conducive to the company. The country has a stable government, a growing economy, and a well-developed infrastructure (Guéraiche, 2019). Furthermore, because of the low unemployment rate in the UAE, a large number of citizens can afford a Corolla Hybrid model. Therefore, a joint venture, exportation, and foreign direct investment are all options for the company to enter the country. However, in order to mitigate the potential risks associated with the entry strategies, the company may want to consider increasing its research and putting more emphasis on the quality of its products.IntroductionToyota motor manufacturing in the UK is one of the
best-performing Toyota manufacturing plants. The level of UK production has made Toyota a major player in the country’s manufacturing industry, with most of its output being shipped overseas. The company was incorporated in 1989 to consolidate Toyota’s market base (Toyota Motor Manufacturing UK, 2022). It is located in Derby and is part of the motor vehicle manufacturing industry. The company employs more than 2,725 employees and generates about $3 billion in sales. One of the company’s core products is Corolla Hybrid because it offers outstanding value to the customers in the market (Germain Toyota of Columbus, 2022). As a result, the rationale for going into the United Arab Emirates (UAE) is to gain a competitive advantage in the motor vehicle manufacturing industry.Analysis and DiscussionThe Core Product of the
CompanyCorolla Hybrid is the core product of Toyota motor manufacturing based in the UK. It is among the first model of Toyota Corolla’s new version. The model integrates an award-winning compact sedan’s proven formula with a hybrid powertrain (Germain Toyota of Columbus, 2022). This gives it the ability to deliver remarkable efficiency in the market. In addition, the vehicle comes with features of a contemporary vehicle, such as a smart key system and Toyota safety sense. With these features, the vehicle will attract more buyers.Figure 1: Corolla Hybrid from (Germain Toyota of Columbus, 2022)PESTEL Analysis ModelPESTEL analysis model plays an integral role in analyzing the external environment of a business. The model has advantages and disadvantages that should be considered when analyzing a macro environment (Madsen and Grønseth,
2022). This one helps organizations figure out and look at the main factors that lead to change in a strategic business environment. The tool also helps them respond to changes in the environment more effectively and efficiently. On the other hand, the model does not provide essential information, such as the degree of competition in the environment. Despite the challenges, the PESTEL model is important in understanding the macro environment of an organization.Political FactorsThe UAE is a constitutional federation and among the most stable governments in the Middle East. It comprises of Abu Dhabi, Ajman, Dubai, Fujairah, Ras Al Khaimah, Sharjah, and Umm Al Quwain (Guéraiche, 2019). Each of these emirates is ruled by a leader, whereas the Federal Supreme Council, the UAE’s supreme constitutional body, comprises all
seven leaders. Abu Dhabi is the UAE’s capital and operational hub for most government operations. The UAE is a significant player in the Middle East and holds considerable influence on a global scale (Guéraiche, 2019). It maintains strong diplomatic and commercial ties with the US, Saudi Arabia, India, China, and other nations across the globe. Based on this, Toyota motor manufacturing UK can effectively operate in this environment.Economic FactorsThe economic environment is a critical aspect of the analysis of the UAE. The country is part of economic and political groups. First of all, it is the world’s 29th-largest economy. Its GDP is expected to be more than $400 billion in 2022. (Hammour and Mckeown, 2022). Petroleum, gold, and diamonds are some of the main things the UAE sells
outside of the country. India, Japan, China, Oman, and Switzerland are the top places to send your products. Most of its imports on major products, such as automobiles, come from China, India, Germany, the UK, and Turkey. This means that Toyota manufacturing UK can easily get market for its Corolla Hybrid. The company is likely to benefit from the country’s economic performance.The UAE is one of the wealthiest countries in the world in terms of per capita income. Over the years, it has made considerable economic progress from its abundant natural resources, economic diversification, innovation, and foreign direct investment inflows (Facchini, Jaeck, and Bouhaddioui, 2021). In addition, it has developed a diverse range of industries, such as tourism and real estate development, that assist it in maintaining its
position as one of the world’s wealthiest countries. However, the company’s excessive reliance on the petroleum sector is a flaw. This indicates that the country’s economy might decline if petroleum is diminished. Therefore, although its reliance on petroleum is dangerous, the UAE’s economy is stable and provides a conducive environment for foreign companies to operate effectively.Social FactorsThe United Arab Emirates is one of the most liberal countries in the region. Dubai, in particular, is a thriving international business hub and a very dynamic emirate (Schilirò, 2021). It is technologically advanced and well-connected to the rest of the world. The UAE’s population is estimated to be around nine million people. Emirati nationals account for roughly 20% of the total population, making the country one of the most immigrant-heavy in
the world (Abaido, 2020, p.350). As a result, the UAE is home to people from different cultures and countries, making it one of the world’s most cosmopolitan cities. The leaders of the company are assured of a conducive environment to conduct their research and operate.The Emirati society is characterized by luxurious lifestyles, in which the possession of lavish goods reflects an individual’s personality, social image, and social position. Family members and peers influence personal purchase decisions. The number of Emiratis pursuing higher education continues to grow (Ashour, 2020). Expatriate workers are a significant factor in the UAE’s national identity and social demographics. For example, foreign workers account for a sizable portion of the UAE’s national workforce, resulting in disproportionate population demographics. The country attracts people from all over
the world, which makes it a business hub. More vehicles will be required to take people to their destinations. As a result, labor markets will almost certainly face new regulations to reclaim national identity.Technological FactorsTechnological factors play an integral role in running businesses in the UAE. The UAE’s people are tech-savvy, allowing companies to leverage technology (Aminova, Mareef, and Machado, 2020). This indicates that an organization can use technological operations, especially when marketing its products. For example, most Emiratis use social media, making it easy for an organization to reach them. In addition, the government has invested heavily in ICT, which provides a good platform for contemporary organizations. Organizations can access internet services and use available infrastructure to support their operations. Therefore, the UAE’s technological environment is effective
because it supports the activities of modern businesses.The United Arab Emirates invests in cutting-edge technology, which leads to new technology-based ideas. The country is at the top of global rankings for networked readiness and internet use, with well-connected schools in all areas (Dutta and Lanvin, 2019). This has helped build a more technical workforce that can help the economy grow in many different ways. The UAE’s information and communication technology (ICT) market are competitive. The government has taken a number of initiatives to foster the growth of a knowledge-based economy. For example, Toyota motor manufacturing will use the existing ICT infrastructure to effectively run its operations, especially in the area of marketing. As a result, the country is a major importer of new technological equipment to transform its
operations and adopts innovations.Environmental FactorsThe UAE is the most visited country due to its infrastructural development. However, with this massive development comes environmental issues. The country is experiencing the impact of rapid development and the effects of climate change and globalization. The UAE’s rapid economic growth has led to serious environmental problems (Gill, Viswanathan, and Hassan, 2018). These problems arise from the high rate of population growth, the need for more energy, and the rapid development of cities, which releases a lot of greenhouse gases and other pollutants into the air (Al-mulali and Che Sab, 2018). For example, when many visit the country, they are more likely to hire vehicles to take them to the hotel and different areas, which pollutes the environment. Therefore, the country’s economic development
contributes to climate change.However, the protection of the environment is among the topics that get the attention of the UAE government. As a result, the government is introducing measures to reduce its impact on the environment. For example, the emirate’s government stated that Dubai intends to lower its carbon footprint by 30% in eight years (The New Arab Staff & Agencies, 2022). As a major regional, business, and logistic hub, Dubai contributes a greater percentage of the country’s overall carbon footprint. In addition, the net-zero goal of 2050 made by the UAE government is part of the Paris Agreement, which asks countries to come up with long-term plans to cut greenhouse gas emissions. Thus, the UAE government has a roadmap to reduce its carbon footprint.Legal FactorsThe legal environment
is one of the factors used to analyze the UAE. The country is a federal constitutional monarchy led by a king who is head of the country (Zhao, Naidu, and Wallis, 2019). It has a labor law that applies to all staff and employees, no matter where they come from. The maximum amount of time an adult can work is eight hours a day. However, it can be a little different based on the type of business. In addition, people who live in the UAU are very safe because there are not many crimes in the country. It shows that rules and regulations in the country are very strict. Therefore, the legal framework of the UAE provides a conducive environment for the operations of businesses.The Analysis of The
PESTEL Model In UAEThe company should enter the United Arab Emirates (UAE) to widen its market base. The UK has been one of the major markets for the company. Following Brexit, the company is likely to experience a number of challenges, such as labor shortages, economic impacts, and many more. To counter this impact, the company should consider entering the UAE. This country is becoming a major investment hub for most companies across the globe (Aminova, Mareef, and Machado, 2020). One of the reasons is its growing economy over the years. It has a bright future and presents a lot of opportunities for organizations. In addition, the country’s government has heavily invested in economic growth to boost its performance. As a result, the country can be a good
market for the company when considering outside Europe.Porter’s Five ForcesPorter’s five forces model is among the best tools used to understand the external environment. One of its benefits is analyzing the competitiveness of an industry in an organization (Kay, 2019). In addition, it shows the degree of rivalry in a sector to allow an organization to make an informed decision. The other aspect is determining the influence of major stakeholders on an organization, such as buyers and suppliers (Kingsnorth, 2019). However, the tool ignores the influence of government in an environment.Table 1: Porter’s Five ForcesPorter’s five forces                         Explanation      
                                                                                                                               
                                           * There are many buyers in the market. Due to the low unemployment rate, most people living in the UAE have the ability to Corolla Hybrid.  Bargaining power of buyers (High)              * Buyers can easily switch from one brand to another, especially when their needs are not met.                       
                                                                     * The customers do not threaten backward integration (Kay, 2019).                                                 
                         Bargaining power of suppliers (Low)            * There are many suppliers in the market. For example, Toyota motor manufacturing UK can get their suppliers within and outside the country.                                               * The suppliers do not pose any threat of backward integration.       
                                                                     The threat of new entrants (Low)               * A large amount of capital is required to enter the industry.                           
                                                                                                 * Existing automobiles have established brands and image.                       
                                                           The threat of substitute (Low)                 * The existing alternatives, such as trains and buses do not provide convenience as personal vehicles.                                
     The intensity of competitive rivalry (High)    * There is a moderate number of competitors in the market. For example, General Motors, Jaguar Land Rover, and many more.                                                                  * Customers are often loyal to their brands. For example, those used to Jaguar Land Rover may not shift to Corolla Hybrid.      
           Other Factors to Consider When Analyzing UAEDemand and Supply of LaborLabor is one of the crucial factors required for effective operations of an organization. Without labor, it is impossible to run business operations and achieve the set goals. In the UAE, non-nationals constitute most of the workforce in most jobs because of demographic imbalances. Most of the time, the private sector in this country determines the workforce number. The federal and local governments hire about 19% of the overall labor force (Hijazi, Saeed, and Alfaki, 2019). This leaves about 80% of the country’s private sector’s labor market. As a rule, most of the government jobs in the UAE have been held by its citizens. Based on this,
most private organizations have been run by employees from other countries across the globe (Hijazi, Saeed, and Alfaki, 2019). As a result, the labor market growth in this country has reduced, reducing the number of jobs.The Availability of InfrastructureUAE government has invested heavily in building modern infrastructure. As a result, the country is surrounded by beautiful buildings, roads, airports, and many more. UAE has the best road network that promotes smooth movement from one destination to another through the road. A global competitiveness report issued by World Economic Forum indicates that UAE is in the seventh position globally in terms of road quality (United Arab Emirates, 2022). In addition, the country is home to beautiful hotels and buildings. For example, Jumeirah Al Naseem is a UAE hotel that
provides excellent services. With this infrastructure and facilities, international businesses can find a conducive environment to perform their operations.The Appropriate Strategies for Entry into UAEExportingExporting is when an organization sells products to customers in a different country right from their business. It is one of the most common ways to get into a new country and the least risky (Samiee and Chirapanda, 2019). It may also be cheaper because an organization does not need production facilities in the chosen country. For example, Corolla Hybrid will still be manufactured in the home country and taken to UAE for sale. In the near future, however, transportation costs are likely to rise, which will raise the cost of exporting. Most of the costs of exporting come from marketing costs. An organization
needs to work with a transportation company, warehouse, and the UAE government most of the time.Foreign Direct Investment (FDI)Foreign direct investment is a strategy that the company can use to enter into UAE. It is a type of cross-border investment where an investor from one country has a long-term interest and a lot of power over a business from another (Konara and Wei, 2019). FDI can be done by creating a new venture or acquiring an existing company in the UAE. For example, the company can choose to set up a new business. The main advantage of this strategy is that it gives the company the ability to control its operations directly. It also increases a company’s income because they do not have a share of other companies.
However, this requires a lot of capital to cater for costs such as premises, human resources, infrastructure, and other areas (Konara and Wei, 2019). Therefore, despite the challenge of cost, FDI can benefit the company.Joint VentureA joint venture is one of the strategies that the organization can use to enter into UAE. It is a business arrangement where two or more parties agree to pool their resources to achieve a specific objective (Nippa and Reuer, 2019). After the agreement, the parties involved form a jointly-owned business. In this arrangement, one of the parties must be a local business. For example, the company can work with Al-Futtaim Motors, a firm selling used Toyota vehicles in UAE. The parties create a management team and share the control of the new
business. With this strategy, the company uses local knowledge and shares costs. However, there are some problems, such as figuring out who should invest what and how to split the profits can be hard. Although the strategy has some disadvantages, the benefits are more.Risk Minimization StrategiesTable: RisksInternational entry strategies  Risks identified                                                                      Minimization strategies

RecommendationsDrawing from the macro-environment, the organization should consider the following aspects. First, even as it enters the UAE, a team should be established to handle the transition to avoid mistakes that can seriously affect the
In addition, with a low unemployment rate, many UAE citizens can afford a Corolla Hybrid model. The company can enter the country through a joint venture, exportation, and foreign direct investment. However, to mitigate the possible risks experienced through the entry strategies, the company should consider increasing its research and focusing on the quality of products. Extensive research enables leaders to make the appropriate decisions. In the long run, this will have a positive impact on an organization.
A trade secret is one of the most valuable components of a company’s functioning, which can provide it with a significant competitive advantage. Hence, it consists in confidential information that describes the processes or things that characterize the organization. It can be a phrase, a slogan, a symbol, or a mixture of these aspects. To qualify for a trademark, the information must correspond to specific points. It must have commercial value for the company, must be known to a limited number of people, and fall under such documents as consent to conceal data for the persons by whom it is used.Unlike a trademark, a trade secret is characterized by large scales. The first concept includes the protection of the name, logo, packaging of a product or service under
Welcome to the Geological Time Machine, the one-of-a-kind invention that allows people an opportunity to visit past geologic times with sightseeing tours. Our unique product offers three types of tours designated for three geological eras. In general, the geological eras represent the distinct changes that the planet Earth and its environment faced through the course of history. The following travel guide will provide more detailed information about the characteristics of each era and its main attractions that you can visit through our tours.Paleozoic Era TourTime period: Paleozoic Era began 541 million years ago and ended 252 million years agoFigure 1. Image of the ocean landscape during Devonian Era (Andrejs Lazovskis, n.d.Figure 2. The image of animals that went extinct after the Permian period (Penn, J., & Deutsch, C.,
2018. The tour takes place during two of the most exciting and extraordinary periods of the Paleozoic era: the Devonian and the Permian periods. The Devonian part of the tour focuses on displaying the life of various marine animals that lived in the ocean. On the other hand, the Permian period part of the tour illustrates what animals could live on the planet if the Permian excitation did not occur.The Paleozoic Era defined the beginning of modern life and is characterized by the creation of various life forms and organisms. The Paleozoic era began with significant growth and development of new life and ended with a massive extinction of most creatures known as the Permian extinction. The processes of global warming caused the Permian extinction.Figure 3 Image of
underwater life in the Paleozoic era (Hovorkova, A., n.d.).Mesozoic Era TourPeriods within the ara: Cambrian, Ordovician, Silurian, Devonian, Carboniferous, PermianFigure 4. Image of life forms during the Mesozoic Era (Publiphoto, n.d.).Time period: Paleozoic Era began 252 million years ago and ended 66 million years ago.Figure 5. Image of Dinosaurs in the Mesozoic Era landscape (Publiphoto, n.d.)The Mesozoic Era is the second major geologic era that is widely known for the existence of dinosaurs. In addition, this era is also characterized by the development of the early ancestors of modern animals. This tour is recommended for the younger audience and people interested in animals. The mammal animals, birds, and several plants developed during the Mesozoic era. The era could also be characterized by a different climate that was significantly
other life forms. The era is characterized by a drastic increase in the number of various species and subspecies of mammals and animals. Another significant moment that distinguishes the era is that the continents’ movement stopped in their current positions. The climate also has changed from warm and mild in the Mesozoic era. The temperatures significantly cooled down, which resulted in the formation of polar ice caps and glaciations. The tour of the Cenozoic era presents a series of time jumps that allow the visitors to witness the rise of mountains and the development of human settlements.Figure 9. Image of an early human settlement (Daily Sabah, n.d.).Periods within the era: Tertiary(Paleogene), Tertiary(Neogene), Quaternary.
Social isolation induces behavioral and emotional changes in human beings and animals. Cho et al. (2017) conducted a study to determine the treadmill exercise effect on depression. This study used female and male Sprague-Dawley socially isolated rat pups. Researchers ensured that the procedures used aligned with the National Health Institute and Korean Medical Sciences Academy. The delivery day was designated day 0, and the rats were categorized into four. The groups included: the social isolation group, the control group, and the exercise and social isolation and exercise group (Cho et al., 2017). The social isolation group’s rat pups were housed individually. On the contrary, the exercise and the control groups’ rat pups were housed under standard conditions and with their mothers. Each day, every rat pup was injected
with 5-Bromo-2′-deoxyuridine (50-mg/kg BrdU) (Cho et al., 2017). This was conducted sixty minutes from postnatal day 21 to 26 before starting the treadmill exercise.The researchers used different methods and materials to conduct the study. In the treadmill exercise protocol, the rat pups ran on the treadmill once a day for half an hour from the 21 st to the 34 th day. Additionally, a forced swimming examination was conducted to determine the rat pups’ degree of depression. Tissue preparation happens by anesthetizing the animals with Zoletil 50 to start the sacrificial process (Cho et al., 2017).A response absence prompted the researchers to use 50 mM phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) and 500 mM phosphate buffer. Cho et al. ( 2017) expound that the researchers also aimed to evaluate tryptophan hydroxylase
(TPH)-positive and 5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT)-positive cells in the dorsal raphe by conducting immunofluorescence. Moreover, BrdU immunohistochemistry was performed to identify the hippocampal dentate gyrus newly generated cells. Cho et al. (2017) explain that western blot analysis was performed using a tyrosine kinase B (TrkB) and BDNF. The transfer of proteins to nitrocellulose was performed, and an anti-BDNF rabbit polyclonal antibody helped to probe the blots. An enhanced chemiluminescence detection kit helped to detect immunoreactivity. One-way analysis and Duncan’s post hoc examination evaluated the groups’ differences.The depression state evaluation was examined by forced swimming. The social isolation group’s resting time was longer than the control group. The treadmill exercise significantly decreased the resting time of the social isolation group rat pups. Additionally, the control group’s mobility time was longer than
played a crucial role in enhancing the social isolation group rat pups’ TrkB and BDNF expression (Cho et al., 2017). Therefore, the researchers concluded that treadmill exercise increases neuronal generation by ameliorating the symptoms of stress from social isolation.In summary, physical activity is an essential behavioral intervention strategy because it enhances the generation of new cells. Additionally, exercise helps in hippocampal dentate gyrus survival. The Increased neurogenesis is closely related to a depressive state ameliorating effect. Physical activity plays a significant role in humans and animals because it has an antidepressant effect on them. There exists a close connection between hippocampal neurogenesis and antidepressant medications. As a result, hippocampal neurogenesis significantly impacts the effects of antidepressants.
When learning about religions and philosophies, I find that origins or backgrounds are essential in interpreting the context and content of a religion. For Jainism, it was vital to learn that it is substantially older than a more well-known and contemporary Sikhism. Though both have close ties with Hinduism, Sihkism’s origins date back to only about 500 years ago while Jainism has a history of nearly 2500 years (Molloy 191). Sikhism exhibits a more militaristic approach to monotheism despite being more modern. As such, the Jainist belief that no Creator exists and that the universe is simply guided by natural forces becomes especially interesting as it rejects a very traditional integration of deities into theology.Following this, it is also interesting to me to observe in what ways a
Mary Midgley’s philosophical legacy is very diverse and essential in the corpus of English-language philosophy of the second half of the twentieth century. This period was marked by an intense revival of interest in relativism and ethics, accompanied by a simultaneous disillusionment with modern autonomous reason and morality ideals. Trying Out One’s New Sword is a story about refuting the theory of moral isolationism and barriers that divide the world into independent units with their values and traditions.The article’s central idea revolves around a ritual in feudal Japan, the purpose of which is to test the effectiveness of an untried sword or another weapon. For this objective, the samurai chop up a random passerby encountered at a crossroads. Abnormal traditions exist not only in Japan but also in
Major League Baseball (MLB) player Tyler Skaggs died several years ago. He was found in his team hotel room in Texas, choking on his vomit, on July 1, 2019 (Wagner, 2021). The main cause of death was ruled as “an intoxication from the substances,” including fentanyl, oxycodone, and alcohol (Wagner, 2021, para. 8). Fentanyl is a fast-acting opioid, which is 50-100 times more powerful than morphine and 30-50 times than heroin (Han et al., 2019). This opioid drug is frequently used in medicine to manage severe pain in cancer patients and perioperative pain. However, it is also used outside of clinical settings and often leads to fatal overdoses. The case of Tyler Skaggs serves as a reminder of the problem that is crucial in the United States nowadays
– the opioid crisis.The opioid-related deaths are not new, and one of their reasons is illicitly produced and distributed opioid drugs. The U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) is responsible for reducing “the Aggregate Production Quota (APQ) of opioids each year since 2017” (Schatman & Wegrzyn, 2020, p. 2629). According to the DEA’s 2020 report, the “total domestic opioid production has decreased by 53% since 2016” (Schatman & Wegrzyn, 2020, p. 2629). Still, the number of deaths from opioid overdose continues to increase, and Skaggs’s death is one such case. Since the baseball player did not receive the drugs from his doctor, the DEA began to investigate his overdose-death in general and the source of the drugs in particular.The DEA is responsible for the health and safety of American
communities and neighborhoods. That is why the organization is involved in investigating Skaggs’s death. The main goals of the DEA are to identify and affect the sources of illicit drugs and reduce drug-related violence (DEA, 2021). Moreover, it aims to assist and contribute to local drug use prevention activities and bring justice to the families of persons who died because they did not know what drugs they used (Nishida, 2021). Thus, the DEA created the Overdose Justice Task Force to investigate opioid-related deaths, most of which were caused by fentanyl (Nishida, 2021). Since Skaggs’s death was also caused by fentanyl overdose, the DEA interfered with his case and started its investigation.When it is clear why the DEA is involved in Skaggs’s death investigation, it is still unclear how
it is involved. Thus, federal law enforcement agents interviewed other team members, friends, and relatives of the victim, trying to discover how the man obtained the drug. The investigation showed that fentanyl was detected everywhere, “even in marijuana” (Quinn, 2019, para. 5). Thus, the DEA started its cooperation with law enforcement to reduce domestic opioid production and drug-related deaths. The organization’s investigation led to Eric Kay, who worked in the communication department of the baseball team where Skaggs played. The man was charged for supplying Skaggs counterfeit drugs with fentanyl that caused the player’s death and distributing oxycodone and fentanyl since at least 2017 (Castillo, 2022). Although Kay’s fault has not yet been proven, the DEA’s contribution to this investigation is significant.Skaggs’s death is a reminder of the
existing opioid crisis in the U.S. This case demonstrates that the opioid epidemic is a societal problem associated with governmental blindness and unwillingness or inability to solve this issue. According to Fischer et al. (2020), illicitly produced and distributed synthetic opioid drugs, including fentanyl, have appeared during the last five years. They are distributed as counterfeit prescriptions along with other medications. Therefore, neither consumers nor law enforcement can detect the source of such drugs. For this reason, the number of opioid-related deaths in the United States has increased by 300% between 2013 and 2017 (Fischer et al., 2020). Most opioid-related deaths involve fentanyl, which is why the current drug crisis is identified as a “fentanyl epidemic” (Fischer et al., 2020, p. 2). The U.S. government needs to understand
painkillers? Further research is required in order to answer these questions and find the guilty for Skaggs’s death.The opioid epidemic is a national problem that needs to be managed immediately. Nowadays, people have open access to prescribed and illicit opioid products, leading to misuse, overdose, and even death. If the DEA wants to change the situation, it should cooperate with law enforcement and offer stricter regulations and control of opioid drug prescriptions. Moreover, state and federal government agencies and health organizations should also address this epidemic, improving the existing rules and policies and emphasizing pain prevention, not just treatment. Finally, synthetic illegal opioid drugs entering the United States from outside markets should be eliminated.
It is common for businesses to develop and grow differently, so there is a vast number of ways that companies may evolve. It usually depends on the management, industry, objectives, and specific leadership vision. These structural types have their own advantages, weaknesses, and challenges. For example, many firms face issues while allocating work and then coordinating diverse efforts after dividing responsibilities among groups of employees. The former process is called differentiation, and the latter is known as integration, and both play an essential role in organizational structure.To begin with, differentiation is a process of separating a business into key components like units or departments. This division is especially common in major corporations because the larger a firm grows, the more challenging it becomes for a single leader to
control all its operations. Thus, highly differentiated companies provide autonomy to their departments and units, making it easier to organize productive and effective work in all components. Noticeably, the corporate environment and culture may vary significantly in different units, which sometimes brings additional issues. Amazon and Apple are examples of companies that successfully differentiate their operations and have many different units.Further, when firms apply differentiation, they still need to effectively perform their various tasks, which is why the process of integration is also significant. Overall, integration is the specific coordination of differentiated responsibilities and the work of all components. In other words, an organization that is highly integrated can have many various departments that are still closely connected and do not have much independence and autonomy. For instance,
McDonald’s is a tightly controlled company, and most essential decisions are made by its small administrative group. Both integration and differentiation are extremely important and should be basic structures in organizations in order for them to operate effectively and be stronger than their competitors.When it comes to integration, it is essential that firms choose carefully between the two available options. Overall, their choices should depend on the company’s industry, level of differentiation and its effectiveness, qualifications of managers, and other crucial factors. Organizations can coordinate group and individual efforts in two ways: vertically and laterally. The former is tighter, while the latter is more relaxed, informal, flexible, and simple.Vertical integration refers to the system in which a firm’s higher levels use rules and policy, authority, and control and
groups gather to negotiate and help dovetail the efforts and tasks of various departments. Spontaneous informal meetings make it possible for workers from different divisions to discuss some issues. Additionally, tasks forces allow the collaboration of diverse specialists when a rapid solution for a problem is required. The animation studio Pixar is an example of a company that integrates lateral coordination and does that extremely successfully: the informal connection between the workers and the three main groups allows them to develop more ideas and solve issues quickly.
The current wealth distribution patterns in the U.S. are far from the embodiment of justice. One occupation that I feel is underpaid at the present time is the registered nurse in various healthcare environments. Based on things learned from my acquaintances working as hospital RNs, the degree of responsibility for patients’ well-being does not align with the average financial compensation that these specialists receive. One profession that I believe is overpaid is the National Football League player. Prominent clubs’ growing profits and football matches’ increasing accessibility due to technology advancements probably explain why footballers’ wages are extremely high.The reasons for selecting these examples pertain to compensation sizes’ desired dependence on the work’s degree of social importance. Specifically, utilitarian ethics could be applied to justify the selection of examples.
The central pillar of utilitarianism is an emphasis on actions and choices that maximize well-being and promote the happiness of a substantial number of individuals (Woodard, 2019). In accordance with utilitarianism, an action is good and important if it brings benefits to the masses. Products that RNs and NFL players bring to society cannot be equal in significance. If there were no RNs, hospital inpatients would receive treatment from doctors but would be left without care and constant supervision, resulting in more frequent hospital infections, post-surgery complications left unnoticed until it is too late, and preventable deaths. In contrast, if there were no NFL players, sports fans would have fewer choices when watching sports, which is incompatible with the benefits from RNs’ work. Paying less to footballers and
representatives of overpaid occupations. Imposing profit use rules on large sports entities to make them obliged to donate a considerable part of profits to charity is another controversial but possible opportunity. In these circumstances, large leagues and teams would have to restrict wages. Another way of correcting the injustice would involve petitioning for legislative action to increase minimum wages for RNs. For this step, society’s support would be gathered with the help of arguments that higher wages intensify competition, and competition would lead to increases in care quality, thus promoting better public health outcomes.
This question has a hypothesis that answers and figures out the components of matter, the essential element of all materials and objects on earth. For instance, it leads to understanding water’s nature and behaviour elements as oxygen and hydrogen.This scientific question describes the different origins and nature of the materials that make the world look the way it looks today. The constituents of matter, such as water, break down to oxygen (the gas which supports burning) and hydrogen (the flammable gas) (BBC. 3). In this case, it can be argued that this scientific question plays an essential role in conducting experiments and creating inventions that have played a vital role in promoting humanity.The world has developed and reached it through notable scientists and inventions who worked tirelessly to
understand the world and nature. Indeed, they played an essential role in going deeper and acquiring knowledge that others at their time could never contemplate. Through their sacrifice, hard work and learning, and quest to know more, they were able to achieve inventions that, up to date, have been developed by their successors to create a better world in which human beings are living today.This scientific question is vital in trying to identify what powers humanity. Indeed, human beings’ development and inventions depend on energy. This energy is essential in powering life and enabling people to live comfortably (BBC. 1). This quest led to the creation of chariots used to carry amour and soldiers along the coast. The same pursuit led to the integration of mathematicians and created
to its current economic, social, and political success (BBC, 2). However, noble people and successful, wealthy business people had the desire. They funded scientific experiments to invest the technology in their territories and businesses to benefit from it.This scientific question was vital in understanding earth with its relations to the universe. Indeed, the hypothesis of this question was a key driver in understanding earth and connecting it to the universe so that the world would be developed with effectiveness and efficiency. Indeed, the experiment that started in ancient Greece was a key stepping stone in understanding the world and its relation to the solar system.
Unemployment is a significant social and economic problem. Not always positive aspects of enterprise development contribute to a decrease in the percentage of unemployed. The negative impact may be cumulative along with phenomena such as inflation external factors, including the pandemic. Difficulties in obtaining an education for low-income families only widen the gap between the rich and the poor, which in America is already the largest in the world (Telford, 2019). Consequently, the leading causes of unemployment are inflation, advanced technology, and lack of education or skills for employment.Inflation drives up prices in the economy. Naturally, the price of both products and the materials they have produced increases. Employers seek to recoup the costs of inflation by constantly increasing the financial performance of sales. One of these methods
Despite the low unemployment rate in the U.S, Black Americans are twice susceptible to unemployment compared to white Americans. The Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) recorded a 7.1% unemployment rate of African Americans compared to the national average of 4.2% (BLS, 2022). Racism and inequality in education in the U.S causes structural, cyclical, and frictional unemployment. Structural racism in education has disadvantaged Black Americans by offering them lower levers of education resulting in a higher unemployment rate as compared to the other races.Systemic racism in the U.S. is the primary cause of the unemployment gap. Even with compatible qualifications, black workers are less likely to be employed than white workers causing structural unemployment. According to Montenovo et al. (2020), the majority of the job placements in the U.S
Sex trafficking is a major and often overlooked problem of modern societies around the world. According to the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime (2009), sex exploitation is the primary cause of human slavery, accounting for approximately 79% of all cases. In my opinion, such a crime is fueled by people’s greed, lack of media coverage and governmental attention, and the presence of substantial demand. As for the latter, often not socially acceptable forms of sexual desires and the search for lower prices serve as the sufficient driving force behind the sex slavery market.However, what is more, important is the lack of attention from the government officials and other institutions to this problem leads to large public unawareness. On the one hand, the real and potential victims
do not know how to recognize sex traffickers and behave when they encounter them. On the other hand, the general public has prejudice that most prostitutes have freedom when deciding to sell their bodies due to inability to find another job, drug abuse, or other reasons. However, modern researches and investigations into this topic reveal that it is not true in many cases. Therefore, for a long period of time, women were blamed for selling their bodies rather than men who forced them.For a similar reason, some of the men who use the prostitutes’ services are unaware that they support the crime. Yet, there are other people who understand that they engage in sexual relationships with underage girls or enslaved women and should be punished similarly to those
Television has “helped change the differential Negro into the proud Black,” has “given women an outside view of their incarceration in the home… enhanced their aura and prestige (Nye, 2006).” I selected this quote because it illustrates how technology can be used in the educational system to teach students by watching educational programs on television. This resonates with the educational system because television helped a black American to transform into a proud and self-esteemed person in society because of the educative programs he or she watched on television. This aligns with how technology can be used in schools to support learning. The wisdom that this quote provides when one thinks of using technology in the future is incorporating it into learning. Students learn to conceive technological solutions to
issues that affect them, and in doing this they change their imaginations (Nye, 2006). Technology in modern times applies to many sectors, including manufacturing, education, health, and governance. Currently, technology is being used to shape this world.Globalization and innovation waves have generated both losers and winners. The winners’ group comprises entrepreneurs, investors, and high-skilled workers that have embraced new inventions and fast-growing markets. The losers are individuals who depend on high-cost labor markets because their skills cannot match the pace of globalizing markets and technological change. Therefore, technological advancements such as the use of robots lead to disruption in the job markets. Robots are used in many fields comprising medical, and education. Robots play a critical role in the operation room where they assist with complex surgeries like
cardiac valve repair. Robots can replace human surgeons because they can do what humans cannot. They also assist people with severe speech and hearing impairments. Robots have also been adopted in some countries to serve as teaching assistants in computer and science classes (Ross, 2016). Robots also facilitate communication in students with autism.Consequently, educators need to teach their students the need to embrace technology such as robots because that is where the future is. In this modern-day technology-driven world, educators need to teach robotics to students throughout their education life to increase their capacity to be innovative and creative thinkers and become more productive people in society. Educators would have to advocate for laws and create programs that would integrate robotics into the education system. Parents and teachers
way allowing the business to engage with them in real-time. Companies can better identify operational issues, understand their customers, manage supply chains, and detect fraudulent transactions through big data applications. Big data enables New Zealand to enhance its dairy and beef production for export to China (Ross, 2016). Companies that fail to adapt to big data applications are deemed to perish in the current big data-driven economies.
Vaccination is one of the most effective medical interventions that save millions of lives from diseases and suffering. It reduces the level of social inequality, increases access to health services in general, and even helps to reduce poverty. To ensure a high and fair level of vaccination services, it is necessary to understand the obstacles faced by population groups where this level is insufficient. This academic work focuses on approaches designed to improve health among young people.To make vaccination accessible, acceptable, convenient, and attractive for young people, it is necessary to consider both individual behavioral factors and contextual and social mechanisms that influence their behavior. Psychological analysis shows that young people use, often unconsciously, simplified rules of thumb to process incoming information and make decisions. Such mechanisms are
helpful because they allow young people to react quickly to situations that arise in everyday life. However, they can lead to a distorted perception of risk and a bias towards vaccination and health-related information.When developing interventions to increase the use of vaccination services among young people, it is necessary to consider these psychological mechanisms and how they affect individual behavior. At the same time, the above considerations should not encourage health authorities to focus only on personal aspects (Paul et al., 2021). Moreover, they should not rely on providing information as the only way to influence young people’s vaccination behavior. Such an approach will lead to only minor positive behavioral shifts. It is based on the assumption that if young people have sufficient knowledge or receive well-thought-out messages,
they will inevitably make the “right” decision.However, it should be noted that other essential influences on behavioral aspects are ignored. Scientific psychology proves that directly motivating young people to get vaccinated can have a more significant impact than changing what they think and how they relate to vaccinations in theory (Dubé et al., 2018). Therefore, systemic factors such as policy, provision of medical services, costs, and logistics are essential aspects of influencing the behavior of young people to vaccination. One of the most effective approaches is the Tailoring Immunization Programs (TIP) developed by the WHO Regional Office for Europe.The Tailoring Immunization ProgramsTailoring Immunization Program considers national and global health goals and contributes to their achievement. The solution of ambitious tasks to ensure immunization compliance with the principles of
justice requires specific actions of both young people-patients and medical workers. TIP contributes to determining the optimal ways to support and motivate such actions, helping health authorities achieve their goals (Dubé et al., 2018). TIP processes aim to achieve a high and appropriate level of vaccination services, and the desire to ensure equality in vaccination issues is a vital principle of the TIP approach.TIP covers individual and social elements and offers a conceptual framework and methodology for analyzing and describing a wide range of factors affecting vaccination rates. In such a conceptual framework, the most crucial moment in the decision-making process on vaccination is the patient’s contact or the child’s parents with medical professionals (Dubé et al., 2018). This approach favorably changes the attitude of this population group
to vaccination, increases the degree of trust in medical professionals, and positively affects the level of social responsibility.TIP is based on objective data from medical anthropology, psychology, sociology, and communication theory. In such processes, to obtain context-specific information and ideas, national, regional, and global data are analyzed, and the results of proven research methods (Dubé et al., 2018). Interventions aimed at increasing the level of use of vaccination services are based on evidence and not on subjective assumptions or traditional solutions.This approach minimizes inequalities in the health status of young people, as it is based on proper vaccination, taking into account the economic, ethnic, and cultural differences of people. It does not ignore the critical components of public health in modern society and the most vital issues of
social justice (Dubé et al., 2018). TIP is the result of the hard work of the World Health Organization aimed at a new way of thinking about the direction of the policy of eliminating any inequality in the health status of any population group.The Importance of Interdisciplinary TeamsMonitoring and evaluation allow determining to what extent interventions are successful and outline ways to improve further. The participation of interdisciplinary medical professionals in strengthening young people’s health is significant since such interaction contributes to the full implementation of immunization programs (Paul et al., 2021). It should be mentioned that the main objectives of immunization programs are equity, people-centered, evidence-based, integrated, and participatory. In turn, the main tasks of interdisciplinary medical workers are:  * The formulation of individual health promotion
It is important to note that it is highly common for one culture not to be able to understand the state, internal struggles, and intricacies of a different culture. The given notion is called ethnocentrism, where one’s perspective and views are centered around his or her own culture. For example, the book states: “people in America don’t understand, but when an American chain opens in a third-world country, people go crazy” (Noah 188). As a person living in Canada, I embody Canadian culture, where most people from developing nations might not fully understand that a mere fast food restaurant chain is not such a thrilling occurrence for regular consumers. The book also states that “Westerners are shocked and confused by that, but it’s a case of the West
why it is true for current leaders in Canada as well. The text states: “so in Europe and America, yes, Hitler is the Greatest Madman in History, In Africa, he’s just another strongman from history books” (Noah 196). Although Canada did not have such tyrants, many people outside Canada perceive that our leaders are perfect and representative of true democracy. However, it is not always true because they also face challenges for power struggles and do not always behave in the nation’s best interests, which are becoming more evident in recent events.
This essay will explain the value and sexuality of women in the Islamic religion compared to Christianity. One central concern is the deflation of individuals or the suppression of people under the defense of religion. Religion has emerged to be a central tool of abuse in terms of treating different gender. Throughout Islamic holy books, women are subject to oppression, which Allah accepts. This is almost similar to Christianity since they devaluate the same women (The Holy Bible). However, there are incredible differences that I will be addressing in this essay. My argument is that women in the Islamic religion and Christianity have different values and treatments.Firstly, I will analyze and elaborate on the motives of oppression directly from the holy books. I will analyze how some pages
of Hadith and Quran justify oppression towards women as acceptable by Allah (Moore, 2017). I will analyze how this is different from the Bible since the cruelest view of females in the Bible is more gracious than that of women in Islam. Any discussion regarding the religious justification for the way men, children, or women are treated is mostly justified through texts from the holy booksI will address how women are treated in service in the church and what they can offer in the Mosques. The Islamic religion has a diverse understanding of the value of women since some view women as subservient while others view them as equals. Women in most Christian churches are viewed as equal, whereas in some churches, they are teachers of the word,
nuns, and fully participate in the ministry (Ali, 2018). In the Islamic religion, women do not have a position in their church or their service and activities in the Mosque.My essay will address the position of women in marriage in both religions. Men in the Islamic faith can be involved in a polygamous marriage which is most advisable. A man can marry several women but not more than four if they can provide and treat them equally. In Christianity, the Bible discusses polygamous marriages but does not advise men to polygamous families (Lassen, 2021). Most Christian churches advocate for monogamous families. I will address how a woman is expected to behave in the family and the role they are expected to play in their homes in both religions.Finally,
are required to submit to their husbands.Religion is the power and the reason behind most abuse that happens to women. This essay will answer the question: is it true that women in Christianity and Islamic religions are devalued? I will conclude my essay by saying how things change through education and different forms of education. Feminists are emerging both in the Islamic religion and Christianity. They try to ensure that women are treated equally and valued just as men are valued both in religion and the community.
In the grand scheme of things, prosecutors and victims of violent crimes are natural allies. The prosecutors strive to bring the offenders to justice, whether to fulfill their duty before the law or achieve career progress. At the same time, the victims get moral satisfaction when the criminals are brought to justice. Therefore, one might think that prosecutors and victims are naturally supposed to cooperate. However, this logical scenario does not necessarily happen in practice. Sometimes, the victims cannot adequately cooperate with the prosecutors due to the experienced shock, fear, or mistreatment in the prosecutor’s office. During the mid-70s, the Law Enforcement Assistance Administration funded the first Victim/Witness Assistance Projects (VWAPs) in order to enhance cooperation between the prosecutors’ offices and victims (Karmen, 2019). With time, the VWAPs
Over the past year and a half, the notion of change and continuous development in the nursing practice had become of utmost importance, as the global pandemic outbreak forced both practitioners and patients to embrace modified approaches to care. Such an immediate and large-scale need to redefine patient care has understandably raised a series of ethical concerns. Currently, I do my best to use the course materials to seek answers and ethically reasonable solutions to patient care, but the most meaningful insight I have gained so far is that every solution to an ethical dilemma remains ambiguous.For example, during one of my interactions with the patient, I was asked whether the hospital had the policy to avoid face-to-face interaction during the pandemic with the help of video examinations.
I had to address my supervisors, who explained that at the time, this option was unavailable due to the high risks of data security breach and lack of corporate video software to contact the patients without using personal accounts. After this interaction, I decided to dwell on the ethical implications of replacing face-to-face interaction with the medical examiner.On the one hand, the practice of remote patient supervision should be perceived as considerate given the risks of COVID-19 infection during face-to-face interactions. It is natural for public health care to identify ways to modify the principles of accessing care. For example, in the empirical study by Shaw et al. (2020), the researchers decided to compare face-to-face interactions with the instances of video consultations. While estimating that video consultations tend
to completely alter the flow of the conversation and level of trust between the patient and the practitioner, the overall prognosis for implementing video consultations is optimistic (Shaw et al., 2020). Based on this evidence, it is reasonable to assume that the gradual shift towards online communication between clinicians and patients is inevitable. For this reason, public institutions need to elaborate on the framework for safe virtual communication by presenting hospital software with limited data access.On the other hand, however, the challenge of embracing digital interaction with patients has a series of potential threats to the practice. One of the primary risks of such a rapid change is the clinicians and patients distancing themselves from the conventional approaches to a medical examination. Once video consultations become widely used
to practice telemedicine.Thus, having taken everything into consideration, it becomes evident that nursing and the medical field, in general, cannot exist without a critical appraisal of the modifications introduced to health care. For every argument in favor of introducing such a change as remote therapy, one can find a series of reasons to criticize it. Hence, learning to perceive such phenomena as new technology critically is the first step towards creating a sensitive approach to care.
IntroductionThe piece for visual analysis was created by Cindy Sherman, and the photograph is from one of the collections devoted to the representation of female film characters. Its selection was conditional upon the informativeness of the image regarding the ambiguity of black-and-white portraits in general, as well as the possibility to reveal the reason behind this phenomenon (Public Delivery, 2021). This rationale is supported by the fact that the engaging power of the image is ensured by the reflections about the people and their lives it evokes. Thus, the condition why it is worthy of analysis is the opportunity to examine the cultural aspects of cinema by focusing on a single picture about the gaze (“COMS3410 week three,” n.d.).The image used for this purpose is known as “Untitled
Film Still #21,” made in 1978, using gelatin silver print, and it is currently available in the online collection of MoMA Learning (Sherman, n.d.). Hence, the analysis of this piece is feasible from the perspective of demonstrating the importance of the sociological underpinning of cultural products and the way visual techniques are used for transmitting the message.Visual DescriptionThe black-and-white photograph appears to be quite minimalistic at first sight; however, a closer look confirms the presence of a more complex motivation of its creator. Initially, a viewer pays attention to the woman, glancing to the left with a sad look on her face (Sherman, n.d.). This characteristic, which is avoiding the camera, is one of the main features of Sherman’s collection as a whole, and it is seen in
the picture (Public Delivery, 2021). In the background, there are several buildings, and the setting, which is likely to be a city center, does not seem to be accidental (see Appendix A). It speaks about millions of other people, resembling the depicted woman, who encounter similar struggles. Even though it is unclear what kind of a challenge it might be without referencing the past, one can easily suggest that it is related to the position of female citizens in society (Public Delivery, 2021). Hence, the selected piece is informative from the standpoint of historical trends as well as their typical portrayal.The described visual qualities and details of the photograph are complemented by the technical aspect, compositional solutions, and social practices, which play a significant role in understanding the
examined work. According to Gillian Rose’s framework, technology is critical for analysis, and, in this situation, it is presented by the simplicity of technique, deliberately emphasized to reflect the spirit of the age (“COMS3410 week two,” n.d.; Sherman, n.d.). In turn, the choice of colors supports this opinion, and the spatial organization and, more specifically, the distance between the woman and the buildings, confirms the alleged lack of understanding between her and the world. The societal part of this work is represented by the relationships between people based on gender bias and, consequently, isolation of the person (Public Delivery, 2021). In this case, “the separation between her and the audience” is complemented by “the shine of sweat, humidity, and fear,” thereby implying the existence of global problems (Public
Delivery, 2021). In this way, the selected piece can be characterized by a simple medium in combination with the complexity of issues typical for the female population of the previous century.Compositional AnalysisCompositional ModalityIn the assessment of the image, compositional modality is one of the most crucial parameters which should be taken into account to support the significance of its parts for the whole message. Thus, as per Rose’s framework, the genre is crucial, and in this case, it is black-and-white photography as a means of demonstrating the situations in the past (“COMS3410 week two,” n.d.; Sherman, n.d.). It is more suitable for this objective since relying on modern techniques would be detrimental to the overall perception of the piece by the audience (“COMS3410 week 4,” n.d.). Meanwhile, the
composition is relatively stable in terms of remaining unchanged when examining it closer and serving as evidence of a biased attitude toward women’s portrayal (Public Delivery, 2021). The only viewing position offered to people is that of an outsider, and it underpins the societal issues referred to by the creator.Overall, the composition and its details serve as evidence of proper organization and elimination of distractions while showing the photographer’s concerns. In this situation, the image as it is currently presented can convey the general challenge of the perception of the female population as attractive regardless of personal circumstances (Public Delivery, 2021). This approach was common in the twentieth century, and the fact that it is employed in this picture confirms its historical accuracy (Sherman, n.d.). In addition, the
possibility of placing it in a different context is unlikely to change the message unless other details are included.Gaze and Tishman’s Approach: Significance for InterpretationAnother factor, which should be considered in the present analysis, is the importance of the male gaze for interpreting the image. The emphasis on this perspective is conditional upon the fact that Hollywood movies are usually viewed through this lens, and female characters are shown as “highly sexualized objects of male desire” (“COMS3410 week three,” n.d.). The woman in the picture resembles other photographs in the genre and, therefore, can be seen as belonging to this category (Sherman, n.d.). This perspective is supported by other works in the collection as the mentioned feature is attributed to all of them (Public Delivery, 2021). The link
between the identity of people and their femininity is proved by the attention to makeup as a means for claiming one’s place in the world (Public Delivery, 2021). Thus, the examined picture fully corresponds to the described standards while being intended for depicting them in the right light or, in other words, criticizing societal trends of the past.Moreover, the details of the piece contribute to the general perception of this work as one belonging to the past. As per Tishman’s framework, the colors, lines, and shapes, which are critical for observation, are arranged in such a manner that a viewer has no doubts regarding the historical focus of the creator (“COMS3410 week two,” n.d.). The black-and-white objects and simple and clear contours are, therefore, crucial for interpretation, while
the distance between the woman and the world behind her transmits the general message of isolation (“COMS3410 week two,” n.d.). In addition, the contrast between these two parts of the photographs reminds the audience of this fact while also being vital for supporting the importance of characteristics discussed in previous sections.Connection to Visual Themes and Larger IdeasThe composition of “Untitled Film Still #21,” examined above, is explicitly linked to larger ideas, which are visually portrayed by the photographer. Thus, the connection is seen in the correlation between the woman’s face in the foreground and the importance of makeup for claiming a position in society (Public Delivery, n.d.). In other words, the sociological motives incorporated in the art become apparent after observing this picture (“COMS3410 week 5,” n.d.). The
Walmart is an international firm that has served customers in worldwide markets for a long time. The corporation has established over 15,000 retail outlets worldwide (Courtemanche et al., 2019). Nevertheless, as the firm’s retail shop number has grown, it has faced issues that have hampered its customer experience. The fundamental problem is that the corporation was not able to provide any assistance or incentive for outstanding performance by the workers in their everyday work routines. Companies that neglect to compensate their staff frequently experience a decrease in productivity as a result of the workers’ decreased work satisfaction. Consequently, job satisfaction was dismal in the absence of support from the company’s general management.Based on the aforementioned issue, the ideal answer is for the firm to compensate its workers for any improvements recognized at the workplace. This will aid in enhancing the team’s productivity. The company should also consider the personnel’s interests, such as their hopes, ideals, and concerns about their jobs. The firm should consider the benefits and strive to improve them in order to drive people to work to their maximum capacity. Nevertheless, it should be mentioned that most businesses function best when their people are motivated by positive ideas and attitudes.
Being a global corporation, Walmart has to consider numerous ways of penetrating domestic markets. The appearance of any new entities is complicated by the already saturated state of most markets. However, Walmart has the advantage of being one of the world’s largest companies, which gives it leverage when entering a new market. At the same time, even Walmart is not invincible to local specifics. Nuances in-laws, financial and economic conditions, and even cultural relativity can offset the efforts of new entrants. Therefore, using the same strategy for every market is short-sighted. I agree with Walmart’s decision to penetrate domestic markets via different ownership forms.A joint venture is a form of ownership that presupposes sharing of risks and costs between parent companies. Companies use this strategy when the risk
of entering the market on one’s own (for instance, using the form of a wholly owned subsidiary) is too high. Such instability is particularly characteristic of emerging markets, such as India. Although it is a growing economy, there are risks pertaining to taxes, bureaucracy, and cultural misunderstanding. Therefore, partnering with a local conglomerate Bharti Enterprises was a risk reduction stem for Walmart. It should also be noted that this particular venture was ultimately canceled by Walmart buying Bharti’s shares; it did smooth the former’s entrance to the market.A similar situation can be observed in South Africa, where local Massmart sold more than fifty percent of its shares to Walmart. Once again, a similar approach is used: diversifying risks by partnering with a local company to enter a high-growth
market. It should also be noted that unlike in India, Walmart bought the majority stake (51%). In essence, it allows the company to make all major decisions in South Africa while delegating day-to-day operations to Massmart, thus capitalizing on local conditions.Walmart’s strategy in Mexico was similar to the one in South Africa – it established a joint venture with CIFRA. Later Walmart acquired a majority in CIFRA and proceeded to rename it into Walmart de Mexico, which continues to operate under this label. Expanding into Mexico was not as risky as would later be the case with India, as Mexico is closer to the United States both geographically and economically. The most important threat was anti-monopoly laws, which threatened to damage Walmart’s policy of lower prices; however, as
to another company. As a result, Walmart could make all decisions itself without considering the needs of a partner.However, it should also be noted that Walmart ultimately sold the majority of its stakes. As such, it appears that entering a foreign market should be done with a partnering company, even if it means sharing revenues. In India, South Africa, and Mexico, Walmart retains the majority, while in the UK, it is now barely present. Therefore, a joint venture is the most viable option for entering and staying in a foreign market.
Trends and Changes of the External Environment influencing the Company’s Marketing PlanTechnologyWalmart employs blockchain, using a distributed ledger technology, to develop an automated technique to manage payments and invoices from its 70 outsourced freight carriers (Vitasek et al., 2022). It consulted DLT Labs, a pioneer in deploying and developing inventive enterprise solutions via distributed ledger technology (Vitasek et al., 2022). Walmart’s decision to use blockchain technology allows it to provide its offerings to a large population in Canada without errors in orders as this system is effective, promoting loyalty among its users. Furthermore, blockchain technology provides a safe environment for the company’s customers as each transaction has a distinct identifier, eliminating possible issues with tracking. This efficiency in order provision and tracking promotes the company’s business, ensuring its
customers trust it to provide their goods without failure or payment issues.EconomicWalmart Canada decided to invest $3.5 billion in 2020 (Walmart Canada, a, 2020). Over five years, it intended to produce substantial growth to make the in-store and online shopping experience faster, simpler, and more reasonable for its customers (Walmart Canada, a, 2020). It results in a faster and better e-commerce experience and contemporary digital instruments ensuring associates serve customers best. As the organization’s business develops, especially with the-commerce and grocery illustrating an exponential growth, Walmart is unlikely to concede on offering its signature low price to customers. The company has developed trust based on this in-store and online factor. This investment would elicit many Canadian construction jobs and elicit novel partnerships with Canadian technology organizations, further marketing
Walmart as a positive force in the economy.EnvironmentalWalmart encounters various issues, including a negative reputation, stiff competition, constraints in joint ventures and business acquisitions, and rigorous cultural principles in foreign markets. For instance, Walmart has a bad reputation for polluting, as in the case of 2019 when the organization emitted 17.56m metric tonnes of greenhouse gases (Walmart Canada, a, 2020). This issue is detrimental to the company’s image, especially when sustainability and environmental protection are contentious issues for consumers. The company has stated its aim to deal with these climate effects, creating a positive image of a changing organization.Competitive EnvironmentGiant TigerThis is one of the largest discount stores in Canada and provides similar items to Walmart, making it a major competitor for the global store. It offers varying
products from hardware equipment to groceries, as with its American-based counterpart (Williston, 2021). Since 2005 the chain has expanded in the Greater Toronto Area, with more than 200 stores open across Canada. Additionally, Giant Tiger utilizes a low-price strategy similar to Walmart’s, further eliciting its capacity to cut into the latter’s market share as it is a local company with greater customer loyalty. Giant Tiger focuses its recent marketing not only on low prices but on the freshness of its products and the fun of shopping in its stores (Lombardo, 2019). These issues put it at loggerheads with Walmart as it uses similar marketing tactics to gain customers.FreshCoOne of Walmart’s chief competitors is FreshCo, an organization with a growing market share due to new locations opening up in
recent years (Toneguzzi, 2021). However, Walmart has quickly rallied its resources to develop a strong online presence, allowing it to develop cost-effective ways to provide its clients with products while alleviating the necessity to visit stores. FreshCo offers fresh, frozen, chilled products, daily baked goods, cheeses, and meats. Walmart’s low-price strategy differs from FreshCo, allowing it to operate at low prices that would be detrimental to FreshCo’s bottom line.CostcoFinally, Walmart also competes with Costco for market dominance. Costco offers a smaller variety of products to effectively promote and sustain low prices for good-quality products (Chen, 2021). Knowing that low price is the best way of marketing, Costco lowers its budget for HR and advertising. The chain has a unique placement of their warehouse stores, usually in a suburban
area, to ensure cheaper rent (Chen, 2021). Costco, similar to Walmart, implements E-commerce, which plays a key role during the global pandemic (Chen, 2021). However, despite Costco’s major investments in the company aimed at opening new stores, Walmart has more locations and can attract more customers this way.Walmart’s USDWalmart has a unique selling difference based on its ability to maintain customers through brand loyalty and low prices. It thrives because it relied on economies of scale and could outlast competitors that could not maintain this low-profit strategy. Additionally, customers trust Walmart’s products as it has operated in Canada since 1994 and is considered a household name (Walmart Canada, 2022). The company’s size also boosts its status as it has many branches around Canada, allowing it to provide fast
and reliable services to its clients.SWOT AnalysisStrengths  * Walmart can take advantage of its constantly increasing sales with a higher profit margin than its competitors (Martínez et al., 2017).  * The company has much knowledge of Canadians’ shopping practices based on decades of operations (Walmart Canada, 2022).  * Moreover, it can operate with minimal profit as it developed this strategy to compete favorably in the market.Weaknesses  * Walmart operates in unchartered territory that requires technological advantages to maintain its market share (Stanwick & Stanwick, 2020).  * With the number of stores open US, the company’s reputation is vulnerable due to the policy violations and the cases of gender and race discrimination in the US, ruining its reputation in the eyes of Canadian customers.
 * Walmart’s tainted image in terms of climate change may portray it as a destructive company, reducing its customer base.Opportunities  * The company’s large size and customer base could form a good background for expanding strategic alliances and partnerships with popular brands and other global retailers.  * It would also benefit immensely from lower costs associated with physical locations, further allowing it to gain a sizeable profit than it currently enjoys (Stanwick & Stanwick, 2020).  * Furthermore, Walmart has an opportunity to gain a larger market share due to its online store, boosting its market presence and customer base.Threats  * Walmart will have to prove its business-savvy nature to compete against major players such as Amazon.  * Online stores are easier to
Income inequality has long been considered one of the main factors that significantly undermine the quality of life. Moreover, wealth inequality, which allows a handful of people to get much more prosperous at the expense of millions, is even more disturbing. At the same time, people around the world are determined to acquire wealth by entirely different means, which can even be controversial. Therefore, a dedicated analysis is needed to fully understand the importance of wealth and power in the hierarchy of human values when inequality rates are unprecedentedly high. High inequality rates diminish people’s motivation to enhance their living standards, as luxurious lifestyle becomes the primary goal that almost always stays a dream and is full of controversy.Inequality can lead to objective hardships and diminished living standards
in many parts of the world. Nevertheless, one of the notorious effects of extreme inequality is always the psychological perception of the phenomenon. When inequality is high and growing rapidly, luxurious lifestyles are hard to ignore (Frank). Moreover, money, in many cases, can easily be transformed into power in the US, as children are taught to be success-oriented since primary school. Millions of relatively poor American citizens can still afford many things that nationals of many other states rarely even dream of. Nevertheless, it is the inner sense of injustice and powerlessness that makes the perception of low income so painful for many.In the 1920s, the rapidly increased importance of wealth led to severe changes in culture and the social sphere in general. For instance, a completely new
literary genre that centers around the life of the rich became an immediate success. One of the famous novels that provide a proper understanding of the atmosphere and the rapid shifts in social norms at that time is The Great Gatsby by F. Scott Fitzgerald. The author had first-hand experience communicating with a wide range of wealthy and influential people because of marrying a rich woman.The famous novelist provides valuable insights into the multiple psychological issues that plague the lives of the rich and make wealth acquisition a controversial goal. F. Scott Fitzgerald claims that the rich “smashed up things and creatures and then retreated back into their money or their vast carelessness, or whatever it was that kept them together and let other people clean up the
mess they had made”. Moreover, the case of the protagonist clearly indicates that the original determination to acquire wealth is, in many cases, rooted in traumas and lack of attention.The growing disproportion in the distribution of wealth has numerous long-term consequences. Parents’ wealth plays an essential role in children’s human capital accumulation (Hubmer et al., 2). Therefore, millions of children are deprived of the chance to fully enjoy meritocracy, which has long been considered one of the US cornerstones. The diminished importance of equal opportunities points to a structural problem in modern American society. For instance, between 1978 and 2018, the share of wealth owned by the top 0.1 percent increased from 7 percent to 18 percent (Saez and Zucman, 4). Therefore, it is crucial to find the
In the internet era, when almost any information is accessible to nearly anyone, privacy becomes one of the most critical factors for internet users. Amongst the fundamental individual rights, the right to privacy is protected by the public government through privacy laws. Belize is not an exception; Belize’s privacy laws are listed in the Data Protection Act. This act underlines the basic principles of data protection and describes who can access and process that data and under what conditions.Data protection implies the definition and clarification of specific essential points. In that definition, Belize’s Data Protection Act shares a lot in common with the European GDPR from 2018 and the United Kingdom’s Data Protection Act from 1998 (Bartlett, 2022). It is stated that this act controls “the collection, keeping,
use, and dissemination of personal data” (Data Protection Act, 2021). Following that statement clarifies what data can be considered private, what actions concerning it are allowed, and, most importantly, who has the authority to perform such activities.Although this authority at certain conditions belongs to the government or an organization in most cases, there are few exceptions that need to be discussed. In paragraph 10 of the Data Protection Act, that forbids personal data usage, part (l) excludes health care professionals. Later in paragraph 21, which explains the conditions of data transfer from a data subject to a data processor, sub-section (5), part (d) mentions “an obligation of professional secrecy” (Data Protection Act, 2021). This specific condition might explain the previously mentioned exclusion. In general, people tend to trust
their data to professionals upon request because they know that a professional is not likely to misuse that information.The level of trust in one’s professionalism builds upon many different factors, and reputation stands among the most principal. It is also important to mention that a professional earns his reputation by his actions and success in the chosen career. Moreover, he should match specific criteria or standards to be recognized as a professional in the first place. Following the example of a health care professional, it is possible to find the definition of those criteria. In Encyclopedia of pharmacy practice, it is possible to find eight principles of professionalism: altruism and caring, excellence, ethics, respect, communications, accountability, integrity, and justice (p. 205). Being so generalized and thus not bound
secrecy agreement are also mentioned in the Data Protection Act as those who have the right to use private data. So these individuals have to match specific criteria to be considered professionals, but they can request and use personal data as part of their job if they do match them. On the whole, personal data protection is a significant concern in modern society. Passing the Data Protection Act into law, Belize’s government attempted to ensure the safety of its people in this delicate matter.
In terms of his military mind, combat leadership, and conquest campaign, few monarchs in history can compare to Alexander the Great. By ushering in a new Hellenistic age of Greek culture and influence, the King of Macedon constructed an empire that stretched from Greece and Egypt to the Indian subcontinent, forever changing the ancient world. And all of this by the time he died at the age of 32, raising the question of what Alexander could have accomplished if he had lived longer.If Alexander had continued east, he would have met the Chinese during their ‘Warring States Period’ and therefore met the mighty Qin State, which would unify all of China a century later. Yet, given the low morale of his army, he was unlikely to have made
IntroductionThe advancement of data and communication technology provides a new possibility for developing company strategies centered on client value co-creation. This is especially noticeable in the financial sector, more specifically, the banking field. In this situation, the competitive process can be aided by e-banking operations. Financial services are currently evolving in tandem with technological advancements. Clients always had to come directly to the financial institution to perform activities with their money. However, with the progress of technologies, the same actions were allowed to be done distantly with the help of electronic banking (e-banking).Today, e-banking implies a financial information system provided by the bank using modern wireless technology to facilitate the quick and easy conduct of financial transactions. The objective of this paper is to investigate the field of
electronic banking and explore the correlation between e-banking and customer satisfaction. The significance of our study is in the critical issues of e-banking and the areas of improvement that the banks can eliminate or improve to boost customer satisfaction. To increase customer satisfaction with e-banks, businesses must increase the following factors: speed of operations, dependability, safety and confidentiality, and a client-oriented approach.Literature ReviewIn the last 10-20 years, financial institutions have significantly moved from traditional financing to E-banking (Khatoon, Zhengliang, and Hussain, 2020). The waves of development and technical breakthroughs aided banks in expanding their number of clients and E-banking products, which paved the way for financial services to flourish and become more accessible (Khatoon, Zhengliang, and Hussain, 2020). Clients now can see watch their account balances, perform cash
transactions, deposit accounts, text, and transfer payments to other individuals and companies using directions supplied to their smartphones by institutions.Electronic banking is also known as internet or mobile banking. These are platforms that banks may use to offer clients easier access to services (Nurhadi and Ilfitriah, 2020). Namely, a client utilizing online banking does so via a computer connected to the internet, while a consumer using banking apps does so using a smartphone or tablet (Khatoon, Zhengliang, and Hussain, 2020). According to Khatoon, Zhengliang, and Hussain (2020), wireless usage of e-banking demonstrates the distinction between the two types of banking settings, while users consider flexibility to be among the most crucial characteristic of the electronic banking business. The most important aspect of electronic banking is its dependability (Haq
and Awan, 2020). More significantly, bank consumers think that important online financial institutions are being utilized, even though digital banking is the least expensive route.Customer SatisfactionClient satisfaction is among the essential topics in consumer research nowadays. In general, it connects buying process to post-buying phenomena, including attitude adjustment, purchase frequency, and brand recognition (Al Ali, 2021). According to Hammoud, Bizri, and El Baba (2018), a sense of pleasure occurs when consumers share their impression of the goods or services and when their experiences align with the expectations. Thus, satisfaction levels correlate directly with the work of banks’ apps and services.Define consumer satisfaction, a variety of definitions have been presented. Nonetheless, the concept of evaluating service execution and assumptions appears to be shared by most interpretations. Hammoud, Bizri, and
El Baba (2018) describe satisfaction as a favorable post-purchase assessment judgment about a good or service. Likewise, Banu, Mohamed, and Parayitam (2019) described client satisfaction as a customer reaction to the appraisal of the observed gap between hopes and outcomes after usage. Satisfaction may also be defined as the result of a post-purchase evaluation of a service or good as opposed to the prior-buying stage’s expectations.Other studies, contrary to this, have discovered that the influence exercised throughout the purchase and consuming stages of the goods or services may also have a significant effect on the user’s judgments of contentment. Therefore, client satisfaction is a consumer’s experience of joy or unhappiness after comparing an item’s or service’s effectiveness to their expectations (Carranza et al., 2021). Following these criteria and
the context of this study, client satisfaction is the overall user’s perspective formed in reaction to utilizing any type of E-Banking service. As a result, E-Banking qualities may enhance, decline, or maintain the same level of client contentment.Customer Satisfaction and E-BankingWith a variety of research pointing to a link between e-banking customer experience and customer happiness, the issue lies within the definition of services of products that make customers increasingly happy and satisfied. According to our study’s examination of the literature, the following factors play an immense role in client satisfaction: speed of operations, dependability, safety and confidentiality, and a client-oriented approach (Usman, Monoarfa, and Marsofiyati, 2020). With the proper combination of these elements, an e-banking organization will be able to increase the level of customer satisfaction. Additionally,
to create a bigger client base, Alabsy (2018) advises banks to make a more extensive awareness of the service ambiguity.The speed of operations implies the speed of money transfers, payments, money withdrawals, or money deposits. Dependability in this situation can be described as the overall reliability of the app and the safety of its usage. Additionally, safety and confidentiality prove to play a significant role in the evaluation of satisfaction levels. In case an organization has a bad reputation and a scandalous record, the level of trust in the company can significantly decline. The last factor, the client-oriented approach, is responsible for the quick response of the support team. Proper responses from support teams can change the attitudes of clients drastically.MethodologyThe given research is based on the qualitative
approach, which focuses on the accumulation and analysis of the retrieved information. Among the chosen variables were the e-banks such as PayPal Bank, WebMoney Bank, and Payoneer Bank. The selected sample was a group of five people who willingly decided to participate in the study and share their opinions on their experiences while testing the banks mentioned above, specifically their services. The selected group analyzed in one day and shared their results via a Google platform.As has been mentioned, the analyzed literature has defined the following elements like the ones that contribute to client satisfaction from e-banks: speed of operations, dependability, safety and confidentiality, and a client-oriented approach. Therefore, the group of volunteers has been asked to test the apps of the banks and rate the given variables
from 1 to 5, which in further stages of the research helped understand the correlation between the mentioned factors and the level of satisfaction. To collect the data correctly, a platform such as Google Forms was utilized.According to the findings, the e-bank WebMoney Bank provided the lowest results and, therefore, did not lead to customer satisfaction. On the other hand, all five participants gave PayPal Bank the highest rates for speed of operations, dependability, safety and confidentiality, and a client-oriented approach. Therefore, the findings indicated that these factors influenced client satisfaction drastically. Nevertheless, the conducted research contains limitations, which could lead to low-quality results. Among the limitations is the sample size which might be considered insufficient for robust statistical data. Moreover, the chosen individuals could be biased towards
In recent years, the number of cash transfer programs in developing countries has been increasing. The authors of When the Money Runs Out point out both the promise and the limitations of this initiative in terms of permanent welfare improvement (Braid et al.169. The researchers found that cash transfers led to sustained increases in women’s educational attainment and fertility. However, the authors note that after support declined, positive outcomes, including declines in HIV rates, early marriage, and pregnancy rates, waned (Braid et al. 160). Even if the poor receive unconditional transfers, it helps in the short term to improve education and welfare.The study’s theoretical basis was the articles that argue that there is evidence of the long-term impact of the analyzed initiative on education. Researchers have not overlooked
control group that did not receive assistance with those participants who received unconditional cash transfers. For the sake of purity of the experiment, the data were evaluated two years after the program ended, and the girls stopped receiving payments (1700. The girls who participated in the experiment had to come to the distribution point every month. Interviews and questionnaires were also conducted with participants as part of this study (Braid et al. 173). One of the key findings is that this initiative has the potential to bring young girls back to school. According to the authors, CCT programs are proven to improve school performance among vulnerable populations. This research can be used to justify the need for this type of program.
One can argue that the short story “Where Are You Going, Where Have You Been?” has a fitting open ending that both represents the mythical nature of the events occurring to Connie while also providing enough evidence to indicate what had happened to her. On one end, the reader realizes that she was most likely murdered, as “she felt her breath start jerking back and forth in her lungs as if it were something Arnold Friend was stabbing her with again and again with no tenderness” (Oates). However, when Connie recovers consciousness, she is experiencing something like an out of body experience.It is obvious that she is dead and going into the afterlife, but it opens up numerous questions in the end as to who Arnold Friend really
is, how is he all-knowing and seemingly omnipotent? There is always the potential that it may be a dream, given that she went outside and could have fallen sleep knowing her tendency to daydream. The open ending arises as to what is next for Connie and whether she is going into paradise, or just an illusion of it created by her killer. Connie’s spirit has seemingly changed from her physical appearance, but the audience is never given the full picture.One critical analysis by Samantha Conover suggests that Connie actually experienced an abduction and some form of rape or sexual assault. The story does not directly portray this but potentially utilizes euphemisms and other literally devices to suggest that this powerful, rich man, that most likely stalked her was
The article focuses on the issue of how some of the Transport Security Administration (TSA) guidelines on security impede people’s privacy. The article notes that security becomes more important than privacy following the 9/11 attacks. New technologies have continued to blur the line between security and privacy (Wilkinson, 2020). Increasing security checks further enhances the views held by many critics that TSA is invading the privacy of people. The author uses a description of his encounter with security checks as an example to illustrate the privacy concerns (Wilkinson, 2020). It is worth noting that human safety is important, and, in some cases, privacy can take a back seat.Summary of Steps leading to ConclusionsThe theoretical background applied by the author is based on the interplay of privacy and security.
The article argues for the definition of privacy in a way that assists security agents in performing their work. The author notes that showing passengers’ dignity should be an important step. However, the author also indicates that security checks are important in safeguarding people due to the numerous threats. The TSA can exempt passengers from many security checks through the Redress Control Number issued by the Department of Homeland Security (Wilkinson, 2020). The author aims to provide an analysis of various privacy infringements that are necessitated by the TSA-mandated security checks.The deficit in literature is identified as a lack of a proper definition of privacy which creates confusion when enforcing certain TSA regulations. The author notes that even though privacy may be less important than security in some
Modern society is multicultural and mono-ethnic, which is a unique and highly new phenomenon for people. In the past, humanity lived in separate, often isolated, monocultural, and monoethnic groups, perceiving people who were strangers exceptionally negatively. However, over time, the world has become globalized, and due to social, historical, and economic reasons, modern people live in multicultural and heterogeneous communities. It is precisely because of this topic of interaction between people of different ethnic groups and cultures that their influence on each other is still the object of active study (Nelson et al., 2018). This paper examines the interaction and features of the development of ethnic identity for white and black early adolescents.A study by del Toro and Wang (2020) examined whether school cultural socialization of 961 African
adjusted for sample size showed that parental ethnic socialization predicted ERI study and adherence, while only peer training for bias predicted ERI adherence. The results of this study highlight the importance of both parents and peers for cultural socialization processes during adulthood (Hughes et al., 2017). Thus, the study confirms the concept of the formation of ethnic identity through communication. Finally, it supposes that cultural socialization between white and black teenagers, with an adaptive approach, is beneficial for their personality.
An aboriginal person is an individual characterized as a descendant of indigenous inhabitants of Australia. Before the arrival of Europeans, the indigenous people of Australia occupied most of the land, which they protected and fertilized to support cultivation. The aboriginal people mainly practiced hunting and gathering as their source of livelihood before adopting agricultural practices. The aboriginal people arrived in Australia from Asia via Southeast Asia and have inhabited the land between 45000 and 50000 years ago. After the arrival of European colonialists, the indigenous people faced many challenges such as economic, political, and disruption of their tradition. The aboriginal people lost their culture, land, and family without considering the extermination of European imperialism policies; they became enslaved by the Europeans. During the colonial period, the indigenous people
since they share the bloodline, customs, and beliefs with their ancestors, who lived over 50000 years ago in the land. Besides sharing cultural norms, the descendants can be classified as one people because they have a similar palace of origin: the Philippines, Brunei, Malaysia, East Timor, Singapore, and Indonesia located in the Southeast of Asia. Therefore, they deserve equal rights like any other community, enabling them to protect their culture and heritage as one person.
The fight for the independence of Latin America was of great historical significance. As a result of this struggle, the people inhabiting the former Spanish and Portuguese colonies achieved national independence that served their vital interests. Among the leaders of the struggle for independence came from different classes. However, because of the small and weak colonial bourgeoisie, the liberation movement’s leadership was, in most cases, in the hands of the Creole landlords. The growth of opposition among the Creoles and the emergence of secret Creole organizations aimed at plotting were also the reasons why this group led the uprising.By the end of the 18th century, in the Spanish and Portuguese colonies in America, the bourgeoisie formation accelerated, the layer of Creoles focused on foreign markets strengthened, and the
intelligentsia emerged. These social groups were acutely dissatisfied with the colonial authorities’ policy of severe restrictions on trade and enterprise (Doc. B). They also resented the discrimination against the Creoles in the legal sphere and the lack of favorable conditions for creative activity. At the same time, the great mass of peasants, consisting of Indians and mestizos, was brutally exploited. They sought the opportunity to work freely on their ancestral lands. The struggle of the people of Spanish America for independence objectively met the needs of capitalist development, which was impeded by the colonial regime.The international situation was favorable to the struggle for independence. At the end of the 18th and beginning of the 19th centuries, Spain was involved in devastating wars with France and England. In these
circumstances, the Creole opposition intensified its activities. During this period, secret patriotic organizations were established throughout Spanish America. Their goal was to prepare an armed action and overthrow Spanish colonial oppression. The Creole opposition led uprisings because they were in need of the elimination of colonial taxes and restrictions on trade and industry.It was for Creole entrepreneurs that the markets of the colonies and even those of the metropolises became cramped. For their continued growth, free access to the world market was vital. Moreover, it was on their side in the competition with Europeans that they had the advantage of the abundance, cheapness, and virgin fertility of the lands of the New World. In them, the ideas of liberalism found the most ardent admirers, determined fighters for complete
of Spanish America for independence objectively met the needs of capitalist development, which was impeded by the colonial regime. Nevertheless, the elimination of the colonial regime and achieving political independence were accompanied by important transformations. Almost all Latin American countries established a republican system. In several countries, slavery was completely or partially abolished, and the church’s rights were restricted. The indigenous population was exempted from paying per capita taxes and forced labor service (Doc. B). Latin American countries were allowed to actively engage in international trade, which created favorable conditions for developing capitalist relations.
According to Lufkin (2021), there is an urgent need to reduce the impact on physical and digital presenteeism in the era of pandemic and social transformations. This article focuses on the importance of recognizing true motives for presenteeism and defines the impact of subconscious biases on employee relationships. At the same time, the mere exposure and halo effects are associated with unfair or ineffective promotions that determine the quality of work. The idea that many biases unreasonably support presenteeism and negatively contribute to performance is correct, and differentiating employees’ achievements using favors seems questionable.Presenteeism is problematic because most people continue addressing their subconscious beliefs about professional growth. Lufkin (2021) notices that not all employees can come to work early and leave late to demonstrate their devotion to the
organization. Some people set priorities instead of achieving work-life balance and succeeding as an employee and a parent. They believe that their presence at the workplace helps get promotions or rewards, but the pandemic restrictions have already proved that remote work may be effective. Such attitudes towards presenteeism discourage and impose obligations that hardly improve performance.However, the attention to the halo and mere exposure effects provokes some questions and concerns. The author admits that leaders and managers think about people who bring coffee or communicate as hard workers (Lufkin, 2021). In today’s business world, management principles have been improved, and employees get access to new practices at different levels. Good leaders will never promote a worker because of an improved ability to make coffee. If changes at the
but works online to meet the deadline. An efficient manager analyzes the situation and understands the current contributions of both employees. If presenteeism fallaciously affects the attitude towards such employees, the team’s professionalism is low.It is wrong to believe that showing faces at the office is a criterion for career growth. Lufkin’s article reveals concerns about presenteeism and its impact on people’s judgments. Sometimes, a person needs a break or a day off to work effectively, and absence is not a sign of unprofessionalism and weakness. Being present gives no guarantees about the quality of work, and this assessment makes companies competitive and strong.
The spirit bear, also known as aka Kermode bear, is a unique creature that resides in British Columbia. According to Groc (2020), this is the unique species of all bears not only because of its ice-cream-colored fur but also because of its location and rareness. A single bear can weigh up to 200; knowing that bears generally possess from 80 to 600 kilograms, a maximum of two hundred seems to be low (Service, 2017). The Kermode bear is the American black bear’s subspecies, but what makes this animal so unusual is its recessive gene that colors the bears’ fur white or creamy (National Geographic, 2017).The rareness of this species attracts additional interest in these bears – only 400 spirit bears currently live in British Columbia (Groc, 2020). According
shy and mysterious in nature; therefore, if not disturbed, the representative of this species poses no threat (Service, 2017). However, the animal is considered dangerous only by tourists; according to Service (2017), indigenous populations see the spirit bear as sacred or holy mainly because of its unusual creamy color. Based on the described characteristics, it can be concluded that spirit bears are some of the most unique and rare species on the planet; hence, they need to be protected and their environment preserved.
Most American investors and people in business do not support investigative journalism in the business community. This thesis is of salience as it reveals the media’s hidden skirmishes, especially in conducting and reporting findings related to business and trade. The news houses have the right to conduct research on each sector of the economy and pass the results to the members of the society. However, this right has been compromised over time by the top businessmen. The main reasons for this struggle are the efforts of entrepreneurs to protect the image of their enterprises. This thesis, however, can be controversial as it can lead to a debate on the whole matter. The business class can argue that they only oppose investigative journalism to protect the privacy of their
business and not hide information from their goods. Publications can make one company vulnerable to its competitors. With the details, the opponent can strategize to destroy the business. This topic of discussion is of paramount salience in a journalism and society course as it divulges challenges faced in journalism and its effect on society.The American press has a role in monitoring major trends in the country’s political sector. The news houses play a crucial role in researching, compiling, disseminating, and exchanging political content. This thesis is essential as it has a wide-ranging impact on democratic governance and political practices. The rise of political media is facilitated by various reasons, including the increased freedom of speech and expression that has been granted to the media and mass communication sector.
They are using the opportunity to educate the citizens and eradicate political illiteracy. The goal can be opposed as other people can have a controversial perspective and claim that the political media is entirely a scheme sponsored by politicians. The politicians can be accused of using the media to propel their fame and tarnish the name of their opponents. This argument can also be actual as some media personnel can be corrupted to promote such aspects. This topic is critical in journalism courses as it majors on the redefined role of journalists in state governance. In society courses, it emphasized the trends in politics and how citizens engage in politics.The general population of African-Americans usually oppose some government policies, and their disgrace is revealed chiefly through their opinions
Artificial intelligence (AI) continues to grow more and more popular in the spheres that involve processing large amounts of information within limited timelines. Marketing is among those; the key to success in it lies in constant awareness of the recent tendencies in the market as well as in consumer behavior, which calls for never-ending data analysis. The use of AI, meanwhile, helps automate the process, consequently improving the productivity of businesses, possibly by up to 40% (Ramyalg, 2022, para. 3). The improvement means not only saving time and money, but also better quality of customer service due to the possibility to invest more resources in it. Another essential benefit from using AI is the reduction of error rates by minimizing the human factor (“AI could reduce,” 2018). The
algorithm does not skip anything and cannot be tired or distracted, which, along with the incomparably higher speed, makes it substantially more effective than humans are.The latter nuance actually is the reason why many assume that AI will be able to replace marketing jobs in the future. In addition, it is worth noting that the human factor involves bias and prejudice, which can distort judgement and, consequently, influence the final decision (“AI could reduce,” 2018). Considering all of the above, it seems to be relevant to guess that artificial intelligence could replace people in marketing jobs because it is substantially more reliable. In the opinion of those who support this idea, such a shift could result in substantially better understanding of consumer behavior, notably, a broader perspective on
the recent tendencies and the drivers of change.In fact, however, the use of AI cannot eliminate the involvement of people in marketing activities. The main reason is that it is able exclusively to simplify and quicken the accomplishment of certain tasks, but not organize and control the performance of a business on its own. Notably, only humans can be creative thinkers and generate the ideas that set the directions for further activity, for instance, design marketing campaigns. AI algorithms, meanwhile, are “built for repetitive tasks” and can only assist in analytical routine, but not in decision making (“Will digital marketers be out,” 2021, para. 1). The latter requires not only creativity, but also critical thinking, of which machines remain incapable.Another consequence of the fact the previous paragraph mentions
End-Stage Renal Failure (ESRF) is a decrease in the excretory filtration systems of the kidneys, which arose due to the death of nephrons and was provoked by a chronic organ disease. The extinction of renal function causes a violation of normal life, to which various body systems respond with complications. The incidence of ESRF has recently reached more than 1 in 7 adults in the US, with 144 cases per million reported globally (Cobo et al., 2018). In the last decade, the prevalence of ESRF has been steadily increasing in parallel with the rapid growth of the population, including about 759 people per one million (Benjamin & Lappin, 2021). In 2017, the ESRF-caused mortality rate was 28% worldwide, with frequent comorbidities of ESRF being hypertension, diabetes mellitus, cardiovascular
diseases, and malignancy (Cobo et al., 2018). Given this evidence, ESRF is a highly dangerous disorder with numerous adverse effects on the population’s health.The body cavity associated with the disease is the abdominal cavity, where the kidneys, the main affected organs, are located. Kidneys are gradually losing their functions, failing to filter blood; there may also be a deterioration in blood clotting, the level of prothrombin decreases, and thrombocytopenia occurs (Cobo et al., 2018). The affected body system is the urinary system, which cannot efficiently eliminate waste from the blood; however, changes in the central nervous system may also occur, such as sleep disorders, problems with concentration, and inhibited reactions.Prefixes that could be used for describing the disease are nephro-, hemato-, patho-, and reno-. While nephro- and reno-
mean kidney, which can be used to describe the organ’s failure, hemato- is defined as blood and can be utilized to specify the issues with blood filtration. Patho-, which means disease, can be used to explain the pathologic nature of ESRF. Thrombo- could also be used, as blood clotting may occur together with ESFR.A useful suffix for ESFR could be -al, defined as “about”; for example, renal is “about the kidney”. Another similar suffix is -ic, which has the same meaning. Suffixes -in and -ism can be utilized to discuss the condition of ESRF, with -ism also referring to the process. Finally, -osis explains the abnormal condition of the kidneys and body systems.Combining forms that could be used to describe ESFR can be renal, nephric, and nephritic, which
means “relating to the kidney”. Nephrosis could be used to describe the degenerative nature of the kidney tubules. Nephrogenic and renogenic are also utilized to describe the excretory body system, as these words are defined as “originating in or derived from the kidney”. Renopathy and nephropathy may be used to discuss a kidney disorder. Nephroma is another word specific for the kidney system, as it relates to the tumor of the renal cortex; a nephrocyte is a cell involved in the excretory process.As chronic renal failure causes a decrease in hemoglobin levels, hematopoiesis is a term related to this disorder. Although this process is defined as the creation of blood cells, during ESRF, it becomes suppressed. Hypertension, myocarditis, and pericarditis are also related to the disorder (Cobo et
irritability is a frequent symptom during ESRF. Anemia , or lack of hemoglobin, is also closely related to ESRF. Diarrhea is another condition that can emerge, with the patient’s bowel movements becoming watery.It is extremely difficult to keep my productivity up; I feel fatigued most of the time. I often have a dry mouth, and I recently lost a lot of body weight. I noticed that my skin is less normal, it has less color and is easily irritated.
The late 19th century saw the introduction of the first women’s page. During this period of explicit and unfiltered sexism, society believed that women had peanuts for brains. The evolution of women’s page has evolved over the years in response to need. A women’s page serves as a space to help each other and chart the way forward. Replacing the women’s page and the style section or using them interchangeably will only work to push women aside. A Style Section should not replace the women’s page because it addresses women’s issues in a male-dominated society. The women’s page will help women more, and their affairs will be well-addressed in all aspects of life.Feminist issues are still worth talking about in our time. The discrimination against women might have
reduced over the years, but all that was due to awareness being raised. There are still areas of society where sexism has not been fully addressed. Replacing the women’s page with style and fashion or using the two subjects interchangeably will only promote sexism because it communicates: “You are not that important, so we will give you the less important stuff.” While reading the newspaper, the style section is usually read for fun or not read. People want to read things that actually matter, something that impacts society at large, not “what am I going to wear today?”. In other words, women need a voice. The style section in any newspaper presents information that the public can do without, while the women’s page can actually help.Some of the
issues facing women and which the Feminist Movement has been trying to address are: 1. Domestic Labor/Chores. It is not unlikely that you would find a woman letting go of her job to “take care of her family.” Man and wife might both be working a nine-to-five job, but the woman also will prepare food for the family, do the dishes and the laundry, prepare the kids for school and still “look nice” for the man. There should be an equal division of domestic labor between spouses or at least some agreement in the family setup concerning chores. 2. The Media – Advertisements on modern televisions can subtly propagate sexist mannerisms. The media uses products widely used by society to promote stereotypic information to the masses. Few organizations
are dominated by the male ego, which has an idea of what a “real” man should look like at the cost of displaying a lesser version of women.A women’s page in a newspaper is a space where women can express themselves and communicate issues that concern them. Any other area in mainstream media has been saturated by males who know little to nothing about issues that affect women. In 2012, during the elections, a famous newspaper talked about Hillary Clinton’s pink lipstick and her sense of fashion as being off. Women have a voice and can contribute to society, thus emphasizing the women’s page rather than the style section.The women’s page encourages women to speak out, thus benefiting women. Cultural practices have pushed women to the point where
a large part of them believe that they belong at the back of the line. The frontiers of feminist women use the women’s page to encourage those women to come out and speak about issues facing them at the hands of chauvinistic men. In 1969, there was a transition from the women’s page to the styles section. The newspaper firms claimed they were “mixing things up” by bringing men into the women’s division to put more esteem on the women’s page. This move was during the rise of the feminist movement. Some women had not seen the significance of the women’s section in newspapers, which led to less readership by the masses.The 1950s saw the first mention of women being involved with “real” issues (leadership). That would have
Examining social changes occurring in the U.S. at the beginning of the 20 th century, one must admit that the pace and scale gained by the feminist movement were by far among the most impressive ones. By challenging social norms and accepted gender roles, American women transformed the perception of themselves in society, thus, redefining the gender dynamics within it. When considering the legal regulations and policies that allowed for the described change, one must mention the 19 th Amendment to the U.S. Constitution. However, the process of enforcing the acceptance of the 19 th Amendment has not been linear and consistent, mainly due to the presence of racism and race-based prejudices in some states. Though the early Suffrage movement lacked diversity and the associated perspectives, it did
lay the foundation for the 19trh Amendment despite quite vocal claims against change among some of the more racist Tennessee women, who saw the regulation as the gateway to expanding the rights of African Americans.Remarkably, the arguments that renowned suffragettes introduced in their discussion of the 19 th Amendment varied significantly. For instance, Belle Kearney, while supporting the liberation of women, focused primarily on White middle-class members, whereas Adella Hunt Logan actively promoted the emancipation of women of all races and ethnicities (Hewitt and Lawson 2019). In turn, the perspective that Kearney offered was quite different from those of other prominent suffragettes. For instance, Addams, who also actively encouraged the introduction of the 19 th Amendment into the sociocultural and sociopolitical environment of the U.S., saw it mostly
as a “natural extension of household duties” (666). Therefore, the interpretation of the significance of voting for women that Addams offered did not assign a particularly high value to the change.The specified idea of viewing the attainment of the right to vote could be seen as trivializing the tremendous change that the right to vote caused for female American citizens. Therefore, Winslow’s representation of the issue is understandably more popular since the latter insisted on the 19 th Amendment being the opportunity to address the tremendous injustice that American women had been suffering. Specifically, Winslow referred to the change in question as the ethical and cultural awakening of the U.S. Specifically, Winslow explains that significant alterations in the social dynamics are bound to happen once “the President realizes
that brutal bullying isn’t quite a statesmanlike method for setting a demand for justice at home” (669). Therefore, the perspectives on the subject matter varied significantly, yet the general idea of change was perceived as tremendously positiveUnfortunately, not all women wholeheartedly supported the introduction of the 19 th Amendment into the American sociopolitical and sociocultural setting. For instance, Tennessee women became quite infamous for their efforts to counteract the introduction of the Amendment and, effectively, ban it (Hewitt and Lawson 2019). To dissect the nature of the described conflict, one should point to the presence of explicit racism within American society of the time (Hewitt and Lawson 2019). According to Hewitt and Lawson (2019), Tennessee women assumed that the 19 th Amendment would become the gateway to African
Americans, in general, receiving the right to vote, which Tennessee protesters considered inadmissible. The protests of the Tennessee women signified major injustice within American society, proving the importance of the intersectionality of the feminist movement. Specifically, to become a legitimate fight for equal rights and against sex-based oppression, the Suffragette movement had to include African American, Native American, and Latin American women, as well as women of any descent. As a result, the significance of integration and support of African American women emerged, Logan being among the first ones to emphasize the problem directly (Hewitt and Lawson 2019).At the same time, one could argue that the suffragettes represented by the Tennessee women were in the minority. Specifically, it is likely that prominent feminists of the time would have
responded with indignation and the encouragement of supporting African American women, as well as women of other racial and ethnic minorities. For example, Logan’s arguments regarding the importance of supporting all women, including African American, Native American, and Latin American ones, should be mentioned (Hewitt and Lawson 2019). Therefore, the focus on multiculturalism and intersectionality was quite prominent despite the presence of racism in the philosophies of some members of the movement.Finally, it would be wrong to separate the American Suffragette movement from the rest of social trends observed in the U.S. community on the specified time slot. Namely, the aspects of progressivism, such as the movement against segregation and the focus on the needs of the working class intersected with the Suffragette movement to a rather substantial
problem of racism and the resulting complications in advancing the regulation have proven the necessity of inclusivity and the essential principles of humanity to be seen as inseparable for feminism. Namely, embracing the needs of all women and encouraging the interventionalist perspective, particularly, the union among women of all races, religious beliefs, and ethnic communities, has proven to be the critical focus of the feminist movement. Thus, the described change has predetermined the evolution of the American Suffrage movement.
AbstractThe construction industry is changing rapidly, modernising and improving existing house-building tools. These changes are coupled with an increasing trend towards green construction, in which the environmental and economic aspects of construction are effectively balanced, and harm to the environment and people minimised. This is especially noticeable in the cladding industry, which protects buildings from external hazards and adds aesthetic features. Different materials are used for cladding, but it is not clear which is more sustainable and user-friendly. In 2020, propelled by UK environmental organizations, the UK expert panel recommended large scale testing of cladding systems to better understand what types of cladding are more eco-friendly. In this context a review of popular cladding material aimed at finding the most eco-friendly cladding is especially relevant. An extensive literature
review of digitally available academic sources, interviews and questionnaires with professionals in the industry was undertaken to find the best façade material to meet the requirements of eco-sustainability and cost-effectiveness.In this work the comparison of different cladding materials was undertaken. They were compared in terms of durability, cost-effectiveness, water and heat retention, combustibility, and harmful emissions into the atmosphere. The data was gathered through looking at raw official statistics posted by official government bodies such as the office for national statistics and by looking at cladding ecological properties analyzed in scholarly sources. Moreover, interviews were taken from leading experts in the industry to find out modern tendencies in building.The key trends in cladding industry nowadays include the use of vinyl siding, sandwich panels, thermopanels and clinker. Siding is
made of vinyl, and though it is a low-cost material, plastic is prone to cracking, so it is not suitable for buildings situated in hot regions. Sandwich panels are cost-effective but not environmentally friendly; production of panels presupposes chemical processing, as a result of which formaldehyde is released into the environment. Moreover, strength indicators of buildings made of sandwich panels are lower that the indicators of houses made of wood or brick. Clinker is not cheap; although it has excellent performance properties, including great strength, it can hardly be used for large-scale building due to its high price. Thermopanels blend the ease of use of vinyl siding and the strength of clinkers. They are durable and resistant to decay and heat, and have excellent building properties. Moreover, thermopanels
are ecologically friendly. However, panels with polyurethane foam are more expensive than siding.The key finding of the whole study is that wood is a material with a unique combination of natural, environmentally friendly properties and a comparable low cost of use. For the UK market, wood is an excellent resource that is technically easy to transport and renewable. Based on the findings, it can be concluded that wood building materials, including recycled materials, should be used for façade cladding. This has made it possible to follow the principles of green building and invest in improving Britain’s environmental and economic agenda.IntroductionThe ongoing civilisational progress of society is naturally reflected in all professional spheres. The emergence of new ethical standards and a philosophy of concern for the environment as a
manifestation of the evolution of human consciousness impose restrictions on the activities undertaken. While in the context of professions related to environmental activism and human interaction, such transformations are evident, these trends are not so tangible in the construction industry. Nevertheless, the gradual incorporation of new social and environmental standards into the construction industry is difficult to ignore: more and more companies are starting to produce environmentally friendly materials or products with a reduced carbon footprint (REF). At the same time, the production of such materials aims to reduce non-recyclable industrial waste and reduce the company’s polluting footprint (REF).From a developer’s point of view, trends towards a new construction approach are also being seen: houses and neighbourhoods under construction are being made green and environmentally friendly (REF). This
mainly includes the use of durable but high-quality materials, whose long-term sustainability will not affect their ecological performance (REF). However, the impact on the local landscape, the number of natural resources expended, and the cumulative construction waste are also considered.At the same time, the central aim of any business, namely the preservation and multiplication of capital, dictates its requirements for companies in the construction industry (|REF). This is not a negative manifestation of capitalism, but the thesis of companies’ emphasis on profitability should be recognised as a fact. Manufacturers cannot focus only on finding and producing entirely environmentally friendly materials, as this would have a tangible effect on the financing of projects. In pursuing the perfect resource, a company risks losing all profits and delaying production, which becomes
a serious threat to local competitiveness.Consequently, companies struggling to meet current agendas and social demands need to find a sustainable balance between environmental and economic benefit strategies. For this reason, business leaders are not faced with the idea of pouring all their resources into the environmental direction, so the term most eco-friendly product may seem redundant. On the contrary, among the many evolving options, manufacturers are looking for those that best fit the company’s and the market’s economic and environmental needs.In the context of the discussion of this balance, the phenomenon of green building should be highlighted. This is a new socio-economic trend, which refers to the construction and development areas that seek to minimise their negative impact on the environment. The concept reflects an unconditional desire on
the part of the community to care for and protect nature, including in such an avant-garde area as construction. The traditional view of construction as profit maximisation with no regard for environmental damage is rapidly replaced by a green building philosophy. This is particularly noticeable in developed countries, among which the UK is a prime example. The choice of a particular European region is driven by the UK’s strong economic and investment appeal on the world stage.As a centre of international trade, the UK is highly socio-economically and culturally developed. This, in turn, is reflected in the public consciousness of both ordinary consumers and local companies: by keeping to market relevance, parties ensure that construction is environmentally friendly. This applies to choosing green neighbourhoods, reducing construction’s carbon footprint,
and investing in the most environmentally and economically balanced consumables. The UK context will therefore prove most informative in the European market to explore critical green building trends in the production and use of cladding materials.The purpose of the research workThis research project’s central and sole purpose is to examine available academic sources and case studies to identify the most environmentally friendly and cost-effective cladding material for the UK context.Objectives of the research workAs the research objective described above is complex and multi-factorial, it is appropriate to fragment it into separate goals, the sequential resolution of which is a crucial methodological strategy of the paper. Thus, the overall academic objectives of this study include, but are not limited to: 1. To conduct a comprehensive literature review based on
primary and secondary filtering criteria collected through digital academic platforms. 2. To critically evaluate and qualitatively compare the literature prepared, justify its selection and assess the reliability of the sources used. 3. To theorise and outline the academic framework of the green building phenomenon. 4. To identify the parameters governing the metrics of environmental friendliness and profitability of material production. 5. To identify the cladding material used in the UK construction market, which satisfies environmentally friendly and profitable production criteria. 6. To summarise the findings and form a unified and holistic conclusion of the entire research project.Literary overviewA brief history of constructionConstruction is one of the fundamental trades of human activity, dating back literally to the emergence of primitive communities. The first manifestations of this craft were attempts
to create safe shelter from whatever materials were available: the first rock caves and mounds that protected humans from survival threats were built (Swenson, 2020). Along with the development of human thinking, there was a parallel enhancement of creative and economic skills, often attributed to the biological evolution of the brain through the development of tools (Swenson, 2020; Fiodorov, 2021). Although there may be alternative views of this evolution, such as the religious context described by Verkaaik (2013), the phenomenon of general cognitive-labour evolution is challenging to deny. To put it another way, better houses and buildings appeared over time, corresponding to the increasing human need for comfort. Stony caves could no longer provide comfort and status to individuals, and as a result, the first decorated houses, called
dugouts, began to appear (Trofimova et al., 2019).Such structures did not have the windows and doors familiar to the modern reader, and in fact, they were earth hollows that maintained a favourable temperature regime inside (Frost, 2018). Such constructions were made more complex and improved to obtain more comfortable microclimatic conditions, applied and aesthetic appeal, as shown in Figure 1.Figure 1. Figure reflecting the everyday life of primitive people, including the form of their primitive construction (Frost, 2018).Eventually, construction reached the level of progress described by current trends. The requirements of modern humans for housing have increased to a large extent, and this is only natural given the evolutionary increase in the needs of individuals associated with general civilisational socio-economic development (Fiodorov, 2021). One such criterion for quality
housing in the new market is fulfilling the new basic requirements of safety and security and the observance of an environmental safety framework. Socially responsible individuals understand how damaging the construction business can be, encouraging environmentally conscious producers (Ghisellini et al., 2018).However, it is fair to acknowledge that this thesis is not exhaustive for contemporary society, as overpopulation and intensifying competition for resources reflect an alternative plan. More precisely, even environmentally damaging, environmentally hazardous, but relatively safe for humans, construction will find a consumer who does not consider the environmental aspects of production. This is a natural phenomenon, reflecting the ambiguity of the current phase of construction. At the same time, it can be expected that the emerging trend towards sustainable production will become a common agenda for
the years to come; for this reason, discussions about these principles are relevant now.Green buildingAs a natural stage in the development of building philosophy, the concept of green building has emerged. In general, the term refers to the construction of buildings, which aims to reduce energy and material resources consumption from the production phase to the long-term operation phases. It is a form of subsistence construction, prioritising building houses’ economic and economic needs and environmental concerns.Academic literature has identified five key challenges for green building. Firstly, the trend aims to reduce the cumulative negative impact of construction and building materials on human health and the environment. GABS (2016) writes about reducing CO2 emissions by 84 gigatons per year by 2050. Second, the green building aims to use municipal
resources more sustainably, which means more meaningful energy use. Green building is expected to reduce energy consumption by 50% by 2050 (Rakicevic, 2021). Thirdly, this philosophy invests in finding the most eco-friendly materials, which means that the research function is an integral part of green building. One of the non-obvious areas of such construction is to support the national economy by creating new jobs (Canada GBC, 2016). Finally, the green philosophy seeks to maximise the optimised use of home resources and maximise benefits with little risk to the environment.Notably, this trend for the UK is relatively recent. Figure 8 shows that academic interest in Green Building emerged around 35 years ago and increased exponentially almost every year. This confirms the hypothesis of increased environmental awareness among the population.
Remarkably, contrary to expectations, the scientific study of Green Building goes beyond a thematic focus. More specifically, Figure 9 describes the general academic categories in which scientific papers are published. Energy sciences, applied physics, plant sciences, and green sustainability research are also interested in green building. Public interest in this issue is generally stable for Britons: Figure 10 shows a histogram of google query frequencies for critical terms. From this data: people search for information on green building with equal frequency, but that activity peaks during the autumn/winter season. It can be assumed that at this time, users are actively planning home renovations, which will begin with the arrival of spring.Figure 8.

Chronogram of google query frequencies for the keywords ‘green building’ (blue) and ‘green construction’ (red) in the UK context (obtained via private access, interpreted with Google Trends).The evolution of cladding materialsOne of the developments in the construction industry has been the production of cladding materials. At this point in the scientific literature, a plurality of views has emerged about what such materials are and what functional role they fulfil. For example, Miller (2020) points out that cladding is one of the most common construction materials, including paving stones, siding, tiles, that has a breathable function. Liška
and Nečasová (2020) point to the protective role of cladding, saying that “the basic function of building cladding is to protect the interior against the effects of the external environment” (p. 127).A similar view is taken by Ginwala and John (2017), who prioritise the protective function of cladding against external stimuli. Such threats include fire, wind, and physical damage, including corrosion of building materials (Dahlstrom Roll Form, 2018). Finally, Dmitrieva et al. (2021) highlighted a unique, decorative role. In this context, it is particularly noteworthy to note that cladding materials often have aesthetic characteristics that make consumers choose them over their competitors. Figure 2 displays the differences in the cladding materials used. It shows wood, stoneware, and putty cladding materials, which give the overall exterior a unique visual
characteristic. In general, there are no rules regarding the use of cladding in terms of aesthetic objectives, with identical or similar technical aspects of materials: every builder and homeowner has the right to choose any covering that seems most attractive.Figure 2. There are three types of cladding materials on a single wall: putty, timber, and stone (Duffield Timber, 2021).Generally, it is appropriate to summarise that cladding materials are used in construction to decorate buildings and protect them from external and internal hazards, including harmful environmental influences and corrosion. This set of goals drove the creation of cladding materials from antiquity when primitive communities fortified their homes with clay, leather, wood, or stone cladding (Fiodorov, 2018; Swenson, 2020). This preserved houses from winds and other natural shocks but did
not always fulfil a strictly aesthetic function. Cladding materials first gained particular significance in ancient civilisational communities, such as Ancient Egypt and Ancient Rome (McGreevy, 2020). At that time, clay materials were used to create a fireproof protective layer and solve problems of visual significance. Figure 3 perfectly shows the first ancient Roman ceramic tile linings made of clay.Figure 3. Fragments of well-preserved ancient Roman tile cladding (McGreevy, 2020).By now, the need to clad buildings has undergone significant modernisation compared to how it used to be. The need to optimise the choice of cladding at the expense of the economy, adequate resource utilisation and optimal thermal-mechanical and anti-corrosive properties has led to the emergence of new materials, which have taken over the building material market in a few
decades. These include siding, sandwich panels, clinker panels, and thermopanels as forms of relatively new exterior coatings for structures.SidingVinyl siding was first mentioned more than seventy years ago. Siding made from polyvinyl chloride polymer was invented in the US market in the 1950s (CCH, 2020). It is a lightweight and flexible plastic material that found practical use in quickly erected timber frame houses, as shown in Figure 4. Vinyl siding was inexpensive and relatively easy to attach to the exterior wall surfaces of homes: such advantages have caused the siding material to become a traditional cladding material not only in American homes but also in Europe. The use of siding was prevalent in the former Soviet Union and Eastern Europe due to the material’s low cost (Reportbuyer, 2017).
The use of plastic technology, which flourished in the second half of the last century, has influenced the variety of commercial siding materials: has the supply of different designs of siding sheets increased and the technology used. Sheet profiles, as depicted in Figure 4, were given secure fasteners that eliminated the need for the builder to use large quantities of screws and or adhesive, as the siding plates were bonded together. This solution improved the visual characteristics of the siding and saved on construction consumables.Figure 4. Image of vinyl siding sheet profile (left) and exterior building cladding (right) (PPW, 2021).Excessive amounts of plasticisers were added to the plastics to strengthen their properties. This has solved the photodegradation of the cladding material by solar ultraviolet light (Alahapperuma and Samarasekara,
2019). Studies show improvements in mechanical properties, be it bending strength and density of the material, when shungite is added (Kopylov et al., 2021). Similar techniques include modifying iron additives instead of classic antimony oxide (Howell et al., 2020). No matter how much siding technology is upgraded, plastic remains a short-lived and ineffective cladding material. Over time, siding tends to fray and crack when exposed to warm climates (Tsongas, 2017). In addition, PVC is not flame retardant, so the choice of this material cannot be justified by economic considerations for long-lasting, sustainable construction.Sandwich panelsComplex sandwich panels based on a combination of layer technology have emerged. It is reasonable to view the panels as a natural evolution of PVC cladding. Composite panels made a revolutionary leap for all exterior
construction: the material was lightweight, comfortable, and durable and perfectly suited to decorative and functional cladding (de Sousa et al., 2021). Modern sandwiches consist of three layers, including boundary stiffening materials and a layer of sealant between them, as shown in Figure 5. Like PVC, sandwich panels are used in fast construction, which means that the mechanical characteristics of such material are not designed for durability. Thus, the additional structure of new storeys can overload the sandwich panels, causing them to warp and crack (Skrifvars et al., 2019). In addition, such panels are vulnerable to temperature fluctuations: due to the condensation of fog and dew on the inner layers of the panels, premature rotting occurs (Vidmar, 2020). In addition, such panels are often finished with formaldehyde resins to
cover gaps and strengthen the material. Still, this fact significantly degrades the environmental properties of sandwich panels (Barbu et al., 2020). As a general conclusion, such materials are not a good choice for sustainable construction.Figure 5. Profile of a sandwich panel showing its structure from the side (O’Hegarty, 2021).ClinkerIt comes as no surprise that cladding materials with a more extended history tend to be more eco-friendly. In general terms, clinker should be understood as the product of high-temperature firing of natural clay mixed with slags, small stones, and limestone (Khomenko and Purdik, 2017). The resulting mixture is finely ground to form refractory layers used in exterior finishing works (Figure 6). However, recent studies show ample evidence to support the severe respiratory hazards of ground clinker, including the threat
of cancer (Di Ciaula, 2021; Spasiano and Pirozzi, 2017). Sintered clinker used as facade scenery has no such harm. At the same time, the operating guidelines for clinker mixtures prohibit the flushing of powder into sewage systems and water bodies, as this leads to clogging of tanks and the formation of cement plugs (Portland Cement Clinker, 2015). This leads to the conclusion that clinker itself is a more environmentally friendly and cost-effective material than vinyl plastics but that its use is not entirely safe either.Figure 6. Photo of clinker slabs as cladding material (Ströher, 2021).ThermopanelsOne of Europe’s most popular cladding materials are thermopanels, which are typically thermally insulated polyurethane foams. Thermopanels are often called hygienic insulation of facades due to their functional purpose: such materials are very light
in use and can be used not only for external but also for internal walls of a building (Burlachenko et al., 2021). Compared to the previously discussed forms, thermopanel is an excellent combined material, combining the flexibility and ease of use of vinyl siding sheets, the thermal insulation properties of sandwich panels and the strength of clinkers. Often these panels are made to resemble brick tiles, allowing the imitation of an expensive façade at a comparatively lower cost, as shown in Figure 7. The use of insulating panels for both new and refurbished buildings ensures a significant reduction in heat loss (Greenspec, 2020). Ultimately, it is the most cost-effective material, although its sustainability is still unexplored.Figure 7. Image of one block of thermal insulation panel (Greenspec, 2020).Wood claddingFrom
the name, green building strives to use as many plant forms as possible in exteriors. For this reason, one of the most popular materials supporting eco-sustainability is wood. Wood cladding materials are renewable resources, mostly not requiring artificial synthetic additives in production (Almusaed, 2021). In addition, there is evidence of the low carbon footprint of such material: wood can absorb as much carbon dioxide as it releases oxygen, making it relatively neutral in terms of carbon dioxide pollution (Godinho, 2018; Almusaed, 2021). In addition, even felled wood is durable and does not rot if adequately maintained without plastic additives. At the same time, wood is relatively easy to stain and sand (Figure 11), so a façade made of this material can meet individual home design requirements.Figure 11. Wood
panelling as a form of wood cladding (Adam, 2020).Other forms of eco-friendly claddingWood cladding is not the only form of environmentally friendly cladding, however. Building activists worldwide are trying to solve the problem of a completely neutral product that can be used as a façade material. Often such answers take construction back to the stages of primitive settlements when the house was protected by natural waste. For example, one such option is cob, made from clay, sand, straw and soil mixed with water: Figure 12. Cob is a legacy from prehistoric times, as the active use of readily available natural materials is a feature of pre-industrial civilisations. At the same time, cob meets the critical needs of a modern façade material. For example, this mixture is easy to
handle and take the desired shape, is fire-resistant and retains heat indoors (Spinell et al., 2020). In addition, the hardening structure of the material makes it possible to give it any design. Although the environmental safety of this cladding material is not in doubt, the cob is quite easily damaged in the event of earthquakes.Figure 12. Photo of a house finished with cob (Dizhur, 2017).Critical material is recycled steel, which is used to make metal siding: Figure 13. It is worth saying that steel is one of the most recycled materials in the world (Nechifor et al., 2020). Although this material is safe and generally resistant to fire, steel is prone to corrosion and is difficult to manipulate in the manufacturing process. In general, there are also entirely
radical methods that cannot find a mass producer at this stage. These include sheep’s wool, cork, straw, and bamboo (Barbulianno, 2020). Ultimately, the trend towards the maximum use of recycled materials and plants is evident.Figure 13. Example of recycled steel façade design (Bates, 2019).General outcomesIn general, the apparent trend towards greater environmental awareness, not only among the public but also among the academic community, should be highlighted. More and more people are willing to invest in eco-friendly materials, with their use shown to be accompanied by good visual and performance characteristics. However, the green building philosophy opposes traditional plastic and other synthetic building materials, polluting the environment and posing a risk to humans. However, an important conclusion to be drawn from this literature review is the lack of
a formalised view of the most environmentally friendly and beneficial material to use. Consideration of this issue is central to the following sections.MethodologyThe methodological basis for this project is based on the concept of qualitative secondary research, using available data for comparative analysis. To determine the optimal type of cladding material, thematic sources presenting full or partial information on environmental and economic benefits have been studied. Academic searches were carried out using digital databases, including Google Scholar, Microsoft Academic, Research Gate and Pubmed. In addition, a standard Google search algorithm was used to identify alternative views and public opinion. The choice of a secondary research mechanism was fully justified by the low relevance of the other options to the present research work. Interviews and quantitative physical experiments were
not feasible due to insufficient and limited resources available, whereas academic search fully met all requirements.Articles, government data and websites were searched using primary filtering mechanisms that included criteria of English spelling, temporal relevance, and author and publication authority. Searches were carried out through textual and content analysis, including the use of thematic keywords. Thus, the total number of sources used was 53, of which 63% should be classified as academic literature. This fact confirms the chosen methodological framework’s reliability and supports the present study’s scientific relevance.Adherence to high ethical standards is also a necessary part of the selection methodology. Only those sources that have been placed in the public domain. In other words, there was no fraud or illegal use of educational spectrum material. At the same
time, the current work does not conflict with other studies but actively complements them through comparative analysis.ResultsResults and analysisSince the main interest of this project was to determine the optimal cladding for façade construction in the UK context, this section highlights the finding from a technical and ecological as well as economic point of view. The following table displays the key characteristics of building materials in terms of cost, durability, water and heat resistance, heat retention within the house, combustibility and harmful emission into the atmosphere.

alternative. The most durable material is clinker, but it has poor heat retentive qualities and is costly. Wood and cladding thermal systems enjoy greater air combustibility, important for creating a comfortable microclimate in the house, as well as good heat retention properties. Considering harmful emission into the atmosphere, only sandwich panels emit formaldehyde, while other materials are eco-friendly. Summing up all the data, the following may be said about cladding materials considered in this work.  * Vinyl siding, that has remained a popular cladding material over decades, in terms of cost-effectiveness, is a cheap building material. Moreover, it is ecologically friendly, since when vinyl is recycled, chlorine gas is not released into the atmosphere; vinyl can be safely incinerated and its energy reused. Its is ecologically inert
and its molecules do not interact with chemicals or other substances; vinyl panels are light and easy to install. However, they are not waterproof and can bend or deform under pressure or in fire. Vinyl has an average durability, doesn’t let air in the house due to which inhabitants have to open windows to let air in. It is not suitable for creating comfortable microclimate in the house, that is why this cladding material is not used in large-scale building.  * Sandwich panels are inexpensive alternative to vinyl siding. Technical properties of sandwich panels outdo technical characteristics of vinyl siding in terms of strength, durability, thermal insulation properties and water resistance. Like vinyl siding, sandwich panels are light and easy to install; however, they are not eco-friendly.
The process of production of sandwich panels includes pressing wood-based materials at temperatures from 160°C to 175°C. When wood-based materials are heated, they emit free formaldehyde. The emissions of formaldehyde take place not only when sandwich panels are processed but also after their installation in the houses, since it is the continuous chemical process. Formaldehyde vapors are toxic; they strongly affect the central nervous system, especially the visual organs and the retina of the eyes.  * Clinker is an environmentally friendly ceramic cladding material; its reliability and durability are very high and its strength equals that of a stone. However, click is rather costly; the use of clink significantly raises building costs, that is why clink is rarely used for large-scale building. Clinker is sometimes used for
decoration of buildings, but as a cladding material loses to all other alternatives in price. Moreover, clicker enjoys poor heat retentive properties, and clinker-cladded houses are cold in autumn and winter without proper heating.  * Thermopanels are modern materials that have high durability, strength, and are water resistant and flame retardant. In terms of ecological safety, thermopanels are eco-friendly, since they are inert and can not cause any allergic reactions. While prosessing thermopanels no harmful emissions are made into the air. However, thermopanels are not cheap that is why they would not be considered for economical building.In general, it has been found that wood is the best material for environmentally friendly and most profitable cladding. The following facts provide sufficient evidence for this choice.Firstly, it has been
shown that the choice of wood fully responds to the trend of environmentally conscious communities towards natural materials. Unlike plastic and synthetic raw materials, wood is a product of natural origin and, what is essential, is renewable. From this comes a second reason: there are at least 60,000 different biological species of trees, most of which are highly durable and relatively easy to manipulate (Cottam, 2018). This makes it possible to use wood in a variety of design configurations and to give it the desired shape, as illustrated in Figure 14. This includes the overall styling of the wood facade and the choice of material colour, density, and thickness. These variations lead to a third significant result: wood cladding has uniqueness because it is impossible to recreate the
unique structure of a sawn wood fibre.Figure 14. Thermowood, Siberian Larch and Western Red Cedar (Duffield Timber, 2021).Remarkably, the technical properties of wood cladding also make it profitable to use. Dense timber has high sound insulation properties, allowing to keep sounds inside the home. High insulation is also characteristic of heat, as wood has excellent insulating properties. This is especially true in winter in the UK, where temperatures are known to approach zero Celsius (Jaganmohan, 2021). Figure 15 shows perfectly that the inner layers of the double-layered timber façade consistently retain higher temperatures despite the lowering of the ambient air temperature. In addition, the additional modification of the wood façade with Cross-laminated timber reduces the heat loss of -1.14% compared to traditional wood cladding and -5.07% (Pelaz et
al., 2017). This confirms the tendency of wood to breathe actively and meets the required thermal performance.Figure 15. A chronogram of temperature changes of different layers of wood cladding during wintertime (Valachova, 2021, p. 11).The ecological characteristics of the wood cladding found in the study also confirm the expectation of high eco-security. In addition to being a renewable source, the use of wood in façade construction allows the accumulation of excess carbon dioxide already at the plant’s growth stage and preserves it in a bound state when used as building materials (Godinho, 2018; Almusaed, 2021). The use of wood also requires minimal transport costs, as the resource grows almost everywhere. In addition, wood is relatively easy to recycle and leaves virtually no negative impact on the environment: Figure
16. Consequently, this material can be used as a valuable biofuel at the end of its useful life.Figure 16. Environmental effects of recycling wood (Almusaed, 2021)The economic performance of timber cladding has also been of interest. The use of hardwood as a building material has been shown to increase the cost of construction by an average of up to £40 per square metre (Tradesmen, 2020). If the housebuilder decides to use untreated softwood, the cost is reduced to £8, although additional spending in treatment, be it painting and polishing, is required (Build It, 2018). This is generally well within the average cost of cladding a building from £20 per square metre across the UK (MyJobQuote, 2020). Consequently, there are significant economic benefits to using wood cladding.DiscussionThe results obtained
allow classifying wood as an eco-friendly and profitable building material for cladding work. Wood has been shown to have excellent environmental properties and is comparably easy to use, and its purchase will not put much financial pressure on the homeowner, especially with other materials. Wood is much healthier and more efficient than plastic options and is not corroded like expensive metal cladding (Dahlstrom Roll Form, 2018). At the same time, wood materials create a favourable climate inside the house and a favourable neighbourhood due to their natural feel. Sound insulation is of distinctive importance for the choice of this material, as in densely built-up areas, the internal noise of one house can disturb neighbours.As it is a natural material, it is easily affected by climatic fluctuations. On the
one hand, the high humidity characteristic of the UK leads to changes in the mechanical properties of the wood (Humar et al., 2020). On the other hand, increasing average annual temperatures hurt the material’s durability (Godinho, 2018). In addition, wood burns very well, which makes it poorly efficient in terms of fire resistance. At the same time, the naturalness of the building product leads to threats of biological hazards, namely infestation of wood cladding with fungi and insects (Vacenovská, 2020). However, the solution to these problems is obvious: it is sufficient to use hydrophobisers and flame retardants, including caffeine, which prevents the material from being affected by the threats (Šimůnková et al., 2021). Nowadays, the market offers sufficient environmentally friendly variants of liquid treatments which allow preserving the
beneficial properties of wood for a long time.ConclusionTo conclude, it must be stressed that wood remains one of the most environmentally and economically optimal alternatives out of a wide variety of cladding materials. A comprehensive literature review has shown that cladding materials are undergoing significant changes due to the development of green building philosophy. Although the modern market offers dozens of commercial cladding options, most of them are not environmentally friendly, although they are well priced. That said, green building requires a harmonious balance in these two categories. Wood is such an element, as it combines naturalness and the resulting eco-sustainability. However, it was shown that wood is not a final product, as it has some disadvantages: this confirms the hypothesis of the literature review that an utterly
Causes and ConsequencesEmployees of the company are under constant control of the management, are discriminated against, and are at risk of being dismissed for unknown reasons. The article claims that Amazon increases the efficiency of its sales due to total control over employees. At the same time, employees are often dismissed if they do not achieve goals that the management keeps secret (Blackwell, 2020). For example, among the methods for evaluating the efficiency of warehouse employees is the indicator of the number of processed packages per hour. However, the company’s management does not tell the employees what indicators must be achieved. Often employees find out about this only after receiving warnings about improper work. If an employee does not reach the secret indicators, he receives a message about
his dismissal.Amazon also installs surveillance cameras at workplaces. According to the company, this is done to reduce the number of thefts. The researchers claim that the extensive network of cameras also allows the company’s management to track every step of an employee. The articles say that when entering the warehouse, Amazon requires employees to dispose of all their personal belongings, except for a bottle of water and a transparent plastic bag with cash. The location of Amazon drivers is constantly recorded and monitored. They are required to follow the exact route that is laid out on the map. Drivers must deliver 999 packages out of every thousand on time (Blackwell, 2020). This rule has led to widespread speeding and the associated increase in the number of accidents.The article
says that Amazon employees are under constant stress, processing hundreds of orders per hour. This leads to constant panic at work. In this sense, Amazon treats workers dehumanizingly, like robots: they are persistently asked to complete task after task with relentless speed (Palmer, 2021). At the end of the day, warehouse employees are required to pass a mandatory inspection — they are checked for the possibility of theft (Palmer, 2021). Waiting for an inspection lasts from 25 minutes to an hour, and this time is not compensated in any way. According to the authors, Amazon does not consider work injuries to the extent that Amazon employees feel forced to work because of the pain and injuries they receive at work. Company regularly fires workers who fall behind their
quotas without taking into account such injuries, researchers say. In some cases, the number of severe injuries in Amazon warehouses is more than five times higher than the industry average.According to employees, unions could fight with difficult working conditions at Amazon, but the company does not allow them to occur. The employees’ words were confirmed when Amazon published the vacancies of an analyst and a senior analyst. The job descriptions said that candidates would join Amazon’s Global Intelligence Program to collect information, among other things, about threats to the organization of labor against the company. In the vacancy, trade unions are listed along with hostile groups, terrorists, and activist groups. The vacancy mentions that the collected data can be used in court to ban activist groups. After the
content of the vacancies was condemned in social networks, Amazon deleted them, noting that mistakes were made in it.Improvement of The Psychological StateOrganizational Programmes of Stress ManagementA positive socio-psychological atmosphere boosts employee productivity, enhances well-being and happiness, and encourages all types of activity. The development of an SPC in the team is a critical management approach that must be completed while taking into consideration the surrounding circumstances. On the other hand, the socio-psychological climate refers to a stable moral environment or the team’s general emotional condition, as evidenced by employee connections and attitudes toward the common good (Brooks et al., 2019). First and foremost, it is critical to building both vertical and horizontal inter-group and interpersonal relationships in order to create a good socio-psychological environment in the team.
A manager at any level must maintain vertical and horizontal relationships while maintaining feedback with all management relationships.The promotion of integrating goals between the enterprise’s upper management and the employees is required to create a positive atmosphere. The ability of management to continuously assess and change the style, means, forms, and techniques of team management, taking into account changing situations, is a necessary requirement for the development of a pleasant environment (Wang et al., 2020). It also involves the capacity to maintain a balance of rights and obligations among employees while performing job duties and the ability to operate in informal settings. Employees’ psychological condition is defined by their level of contentment with their current position. However, not only is the psychological environment important, but so is the
kind of employment, its reputation and substance, compensation, career possibilities, and the availability of alternative interesting opportunities (Cam, 2020). The following factors are distinguished from the others in the formation of the team’s socio-psychological environment:  * Each employee’s professional and personal talents are in accordance with the structure and substance of their work. This ensures a normal workday and the absence of resentment over coworkers’ achievements.  * The highest possible alignment of ethical and moral attitudes and motivations for action is required for mutual trust and understanding among coworkers. Each employee’s capabilities can complement each other and be unified in a single creative and labor process.  * Rational and fair distribution of functions among team members.Their socio-psychological compatibility primarily determines employee happiness with their role
in the team. It is based on the team members’ psychological similarities as well as the moral and professional characteristics that they share (Rasool et al., 2020). Individuals need to realize that the socio-psychological environment of a team is directly impacted not only by leadership tactics, discipline, and compatibility of people but also by their level of engagement in team management. The following activities must be completed in order to investigate the labor collective’s socio-psychological environment:  * determine the emotional attitude of team members to their occupation in general;  * to identify the nature of the relationship between employees in the team;  * to clarify the nature of the relations between managers and subordinates; to find out the degree of satisfaction of employees with the
service and living conditions of the organization of work;  * to determine how satisfied employees are with the material incentives to encourage work.The following principles should be followed when organizing meetings. The discussion is held in a democratic atmosphere. Feedback is required; once each employee has been acknowledged, all coworkers present are interviewed. The manager keeps an eye on the situation and, if there are any problems, changes the subject or attempts to diffuse the situation. Everyone can view all of the suggestions and opinions that come in. They could be placed on the walls or stated at meetings if the interaction was only with a few people rather than the full team. It is most practical to have conversations in small groups since this allows everyone
to hear what colleagues want to discuss (Walia, 2018). It is difficult to assess the situation and establish the variables that contribute to creating a socio-psychological environment in a group of more than ten people who have opposing opinions.Organizational Programmes of WellbeingEmployees should attend lectures and seminars on topics such as the fundamentals of socio-psychological interactions, methods of individual self-realization, professional ethics, and business etiquette on a regular basis to help manage the psychological environment. Communication games are often used to manage interpersonal interactions. As an analog of sociometry, they promote in the establishment of team partnerships. Managers can, for example, ask employees to draw a circle around each participant based on their level of impact on the team throughout the session. After that, red and blue lines
should be drawn between the circles to indicate the connection between specialists (Nathan, 2019). The manager will be able to identify how closely persons are related after examining the results. It should be noted, however, that without the training of a psychologist, the manager may not always be able to properly predict the outcome. People can utilize role-playing games linked to the topic if this technique appears to be too difficult.To improve the working conditions that will lead to an improvement in the condition of employees, it is necessary to take the following action. Amazon will be required to provide employees with access to KPI calculation algorithms and establish the reasons and consequences of their non-compliance (Sharma, 2020). This method provides new transparency requirements for automated productivity calculation
systems and will block the use of programs that may endanger the health and safety of employees (Lehmann et al., 2021). Employees should always have the right to legally prescribed rest, eat, and visit the restroom. This will avoid situations when the company has dismissed more than 300 warehouse employees for non-compliance with indicators in one of the branches. This was due to an automated system for tracking employee performance indicators.One of the fundamental problems of labor safety is recreation and its organization. Every person who performs any mental, physical or psychological activity needs rest and personal time. As a rule, managers are responsible for providing such rest. Each employer is obliged to organize and equip a room for rest and psychological relief at his enterprise in the
Throughout the COVID-19 global public health crisis, supply chain and transportation issues have posed a continual challenge. During the outbreak, shipping issues caused havoc on the medical equipment and healthcare institutions as a request for key items and other medical aid increased. Concerning the opportunity for improvement, it can be proposed to separate working groups into multiple teams and subgroups responsible for operating in different areas and regions.Medical equipment is utilized for the diagnosis and therapy and treatment of patients after a disease or accident; it can be used alone or in conjunction with various consumables. Healthcare equipment and supplies are essential for patients’ needs, and the inability to obtain the necessary medicament can seriously threaten life. Consequently, in terms of maintaining a high level of treatment quality,
contribution, it can be stated that I suggested the concept of splitting into smaller teams and subgroups, each focusing on a separate area. This enabled the group to segregate two full deliveries of donated medical supplies in two to three days instead of two to three. Thus, it was possible to send the healthcare equipment and medicaments successfully.In conclusion, patients’ needs for healthcare equipment and supplies are critical, and the failure to receive the appropriate medication might be life-threatening. In terms of my contribution, I proposed separating into smaller teams and subgroups, each concentrating on a different aspect of the project. This allowed the group to segregate and classify two complete deliveries of donated medical goods in two to three days rather than two to three.
For Asia and Asian governments, WWII had severe ramifications. Due to a scarcity of resources, the great colonial powers from Europe were left weak and unable to administer their colonies during WWII. They were preoccupied with their own issues, and the emergence of anti-imperialist sentiments at home slowed the decolonization process. After what they had seen after WWII, colonies were not ready to be colonized again. After the war, colonies that had aided their colonial rulers were awarded independence. Examples of countries that regained independence include the Philippines from the United States of America in 1946, India from the United Kingdom in 1947, Ceylon and Burma in 1948, and others.Prior to WWII, Japan has had an ambition of expanding its influence over other states. The invasion of Manchuria
to deter Japanese aggression and force the evacuation of Japanese soldiers from Manchuria and China. Faced with serious shortages of oil and other natural resources and motivated by a desire to dethrone the United States as the Pacific’s dominating power, Japan planned to assault the United States and British forces in Asia and take Southeast Asia’s resources. The modernity of the Japanese post-WWII indeed began in the 19th century. During this time, the Asian states have accepted the culture of the West, which allowed them to integrate into the global society and develop relationships, including economic partnerships with other nations outside Asia.
As was mentioned earlier, both pictures reflect a similar theme. Even though these two works were created in different periods, they convey the same meaning claiming that only personal struggle can create hope in people’s hearts. Both paintings have similarities and differences based on the symbolic elements depicted by the authors. The outstanding symbolic component of the Girl with the Pearl Earring painting is the earring. Considering the general girl’s appearance, the earring attracts attention. As was mentioned earlier, this symbol was created to express the illusionary nature of hope (Berg et al., 2019). It was created only through the existence of dark colors in the background. Thus, this encouraging symbol shows that the hop cannot be born without darkness and despair.Christina’s World also has a peculiar symbol
expressing the creator’s idea. However, this symbol is used to show despair. The black belt on the woman’s dress shows the paralyzed part of her body (Benson, 2020). Unlike the first work’s symbol, the belt expresses the negative background of the story. The meaning of hope is conveyed by depicting a woman’s house and her pose deliberately striving to the light. Thus, the pictures are similar in using symbolism to reflect the necessity of striving for hope. However, the number of symbols and their distributions are different.Considering the medium that could have empowered both pictures’ creation, Shakespeare’s Romeo and Juliet should be mentioned. The themes of hope and despair are inherent elements of this tragedy. Some researchers believe that Girl with the Pearl Earring was created based on
Shakespeare’s story (Berg et al., 2019). The woman turns back to her love, which is considered to be the person viewing the picture. Some analytics consider Christina’s World story similar to Shakespeare’s tragedy (Benson, 2020). Christina is separated from her loved ones by cruel fate, and only through striving for hope can she return to her family. Therefore, based on the conducted analysis, the thesis can be formulated as follows: researched paintings reflect the theme of the hope which people create themselves in the ultimate despair surrounding them.The identified theme can impact representatives of some professional directions. The activities of social workers are directly affected by the mentioned topic. Their prior aim is to help others morally and mentally, thereby increasing the quality of others’ lives. Thus, they
should be mentally stable and always create hope for themselves and the people they want to help. Teachers also can be affected by this topic because they are connected to raising the future generation. Their work is extremely important for the whole society. Being unable to create hope and strive for the better in the world’s cruelty will affect the children and make them mentally weak. Teachers should teach young people never to lose hope in their lives.As far as the discussed theme is existential, the audience for the presentation may be pretty vast. People who want to learn more about art and humanities and those who want to share their emotional struggles with others may be interested in the presentation. Moreover, the theme can also be beneficial
for the representatives of the mentioned above professions contributing to their development in humanities.Delivering the message will be rationally using the visual supportive material. For example, presenting a detailed analysis of some painting elements and symbols showing them on the screen would be rational. As far as the presentation is intended for the general audience, some of the terms applied by the scholars can be unfamiliar for people. Especially the terms regarding the historical styles and traditions which has affected the creation of paintings. In order to avoid overcomplicating the message, the terms usage should be minimized. Only the most vital for conveying the main ideas ones should be preserved. In order to get the audience accustomed to the necessary notions, it can be rational to provide the
use the symbolic elements differently to convey the same idea of the struggle for hope in human lives. Due to the overwhelming nature of the theme, its humanitarian analysis can be a matter of interest for representatives of many ages and professions. As a result of a general audience, the presentation of the theme should be oriented on the plain explanations. However, the scientific terms should not be extracted out of the narration. The description of them should be provided for the audience to be able to comprehend the topic clearly. Such an approach contributes to the most efficient conveying of the ideas implemented by the artists and researchers.
Yelling, once associated with toughness, strength, and power, is now seen as imposing and aggressive, a negative side consequence of arrogance and unearthed advantage. With the widespread public reaction towards the online clip of Republican Majority Leader Jake Corman yelling at his Democratic opponent Kate Muth, the precarious position of yelling in modern American consciousness became apparent. Screaming is currently associated with toxic masculinity and anger issues that frequently stem from it. People who lose control and start yelling are met with a mixture of surprise and humiliation. It’s not an appropriate course of action for anyone who wishes to achieve public respect and be taken seriously.A large part of this movement is undoubtedly due to a wider trend away from conduct that promotes abusive and blatantly patriarchal
be cruel, abusive, and disruptive trough other communication channels.Personally, I find the evolution of the understanding of yelling rather fascinating. Social connotations of behaviors are not fixed, but rather evolve with time, depending on the state of society itself. As the general public becomes progressively more and more respectful towards one another, at least hypothetically, it is natural for screaming to become somewhat obsolete. I only hope, that respectable people are allowed to deal with the emotions conveyed previously trough yelling in healthy ways, rather then forced to suppress them for as long as possible.
IntroductionWhile every age is said to have had its own impact on society, the 1960s are immortalized in the memories of many, even though they were not yet alive then. A decade filled with love-loving hippies, The Beatles are conquering the hearts of Americans from across the Atlantic and the roaring popularity of the civil rights movement. With activism on the rise and the atmosphere of hope and change in the air, it is easy to disregard the negative parts of the 60s, which were all too real. The Vietnam War, the inner-city riots, and assassinations played an important role in shaping the decade and becoming a turning point in American politics and society. In 1968, the US entered the Sixth Party System, with the murder of Martin
Luther King Jr. 1968 becoming a turning point in American politics and society.BackgroundAmerican Politics Pre-1960sOver the years of existence in the modern United States, there have been numerous iterations of the party systems and political structures in the attempts to address the differences between Democrats and Conservatives. The previous party system, the Fifth, was established in 1932 under Franklin D. Roosevelt. Under such a structure, the opposing factions, New Deal Coalition and Conservative Coalition consisted of the members of each of the original parties, namely Democrats and Conservatives. However, the intra-party ideological groups did not prevail for long, and after the events of the 1960s, including the Civil Rights movement and Cold War, the decade gave birth to the Sixth Party System. As a result, Republicans and conservative
ideals became more prominent in the US political scene, gaining dominance over the Democrats for decades to come.Key Events of the 1960sAs mentioned, the 60s are famous for their tremendous effect on the events of the time and the decades to come. The key events leading up to the 1968 political changes in the party system included both national and international affairs. The decade was packed with the Cold War and the Vietnam War, the Civil Rights movement, the assassination of Martin Luther King Jr. and John F. Kennedy, the Cuban Missile Crisis, and the landing on the moon. While these events might seem disconnected from each other, together, they brought together the societal and political change that allowed the decrease in government intervention in the economy and
laissez-faire capitalism. Furthermore, the rise of Christianity in the US facilitates the mass appeal of conservative ideals. Americans were no longer content with compromising their ideals, combining the opposing views, which led to the separation of conservatism from the democratic ideology and the creation of two distinct parties.The events of the 1960s showed American society the need for the limitation of governmental power in the decisions that are made on behalf of the citizens. Millions protested military action and the complacency of the American people, such as can be seen in the Port Huron Statement by the Students for a Democratic Society, 1962 (“The American Yawp Reader,” 2022). This bold statement proposed by young activists emphasizes the need for action to be taken to rescue American society from
destruction by excessive militarism and cultural alienation.Not only were the activist movements of the times loud and obnoxious, but they were often heard by authorities and even referred to, such as in Lyndon Johnson’s speech on Voting Rights in 1965 (“The American Yawp Reader,” 2022). Using the language of the activists and the promises that were made to Americans in the past years, he gave authority and validity to the societal changes. At the same time, Americans were fighting for the preservation of their identity and individual freedoms. There is no surprise that, as a result, government intervention in the economy decreased, and the general popular ideology returned to the traditional values, especially after the liberal years that preceded it.AftermathWho Triumphed?As a result of the political changes, as
the conservatives and the democrats gaining their own seats at the table. While originally, the changes led to the spike in the popularity of conservatives, over the past few years, the Democrats have begun to regain their popularity. The differences in the ideologies remain as high as ever, and the extreme nature of the opposition between the two parties does not allow for effective cooperation between them. Nevertheless, it might be the case that the new party system will be established soon, whatever it might be. All that is clear is that history shows that the changes in society drive political and structural changes and vice versa.
The Description of the Business IdeaMy business idea is a clothing boutique, Trophy Curves, for plus-size women. Nowadays, appearance plays a vital role, and many women face problems concerning their body image. The clothes that do not fit can cause not only short-term disappointment but also damage self-esteem and influence self-love for an extended period. Thus, it is extremely important to support women and demonstrate their beauty with the help of the right high-quality clothes at affordable prices. My boutique is about people and people who want to stop worrying about their everyday selection of the look of the day. The clothes give the opportunity not to apply much thought to the issue of choice between comfort and beauty because it combines both features. I have a user-friendly
Internet site with three to six days of US delivery that can satisfy even the most demanding customers.It is possible to find every piece of clothing there: from evening dresses to swimsuits. Hence, it relieves plus-size women from clothing-related problems in any season and presents a unique chance to enjoy life no matter their size! The most significant competitive advantage is the affordable price of the items. As the plus-size industry has undergone rapid development only recently, most players offer such items at the prices of the luxury or semi-lux clothing segments. Therefore, many ordinary women cannot afford to buy the clothes explicitly designed for them and are forced to go shopping in mass-market boutiques. The main message of my business is to demonstrate that every woman deserves
to wear beautiful clothes to highlight all the advantages and hide the flaws. To serve this mission, the new collection prices in my boutique are in the range of 20-30 dollars, and the items on sale cost even less.The Problem to Be SolvedThe lack of a wide selection of clothing for plus-size women due to the recentness of the social transformation in terms of tolerance of people of different shapes, sizes, etc. There are not many existing specialized boutiques, which to puts the target audience at a disadvantage because of the supply shortages.Competitive Advantage & Value PropositionThe high quality, complemented by the reasonable prices, is my competitive advantage, as other stores of plus-size clothing offer items of identical quality for much higher prices. Moreover, the range of fashionable
items offered in my boutique is more comprehensive: from everyday looks to special occasions. Value proposition – serving the uniqueness of every woman disregarding the size.The Rationale of the Business ExistenceTo enrich the clothing industry of clothes in general and ensure the accessibility of a wide selection of fashionable items for plus-size women specifically.The Activity of the BusinessTo bridge the gap between women of different sizes and put them in the same position in terms of such an essential issue as the choice of clothes to wear every day. It implies equal quality, prices, and correspondence to current trends in mass-market and semi-lux women’s clothing stores. My long-term interest in fashion, complemented by my adherence to the body-positive movement, led to the development of the idea of a
plus-size clothing boutique, which unites all women in their fashion fervor.The Location of the BusinessWith special attention to the COVID-19 pandemic, it seems reasonable for start-ups to be based in the virtual environment, especially at the beginning.The Date of the StartAs spring approaches, the demand for clothing tends to increase – thus, now is the ideal time to launch my business.Interest in the businessI am interested in fashion, and during the last fashion weeks, I noticed the increasing trend for clothes targeted not only at ‘ideal’ models but at different women. I am a good fit for this venture as I have experience designing clothes, including plus-size clothing. My university study’s theoretical and practical foundation gives me the entrepreneurial skills and knowledge necessary for the business launch. Moreover,
several people in my circle have examples of successful businesses and can share their experiences to help me avoid severe mistakes.The Target Market and Niche MarketMy target market is plus-size women in the USA. It is indeed a niche market as it covers a small market segment, so I am focusing only on the individually constructed clothes of 1x, 2x, or 3x sizes for females.The Marketing StrategyThe marketing strategy includes the intensive engagement of social networks, especially Instagram, as it seems to be the primary promotional platform nowadays due to the constantly increasing number of users and influencers. Furthermore, as the body-positive and tolerance are trending, the demand for specialized clothing is even higher. I am considering the seasonal sales and promo codes for the first shopping as
well as referral codes of the influencers to attract new customers and build awareness. My marketing budget will be around 7% of my potential sales revenue.The Defining Characteristics of the BrandThe defining characteristics of my brand are colorfulness (whereas minimalism is everywhere now), a limited quantity of every item to ensure the uniqueness of the clients, and unique construction for a plus-size format that will highlight the advantages of such a shape.The Competition in the IndustryThe women’s clothing industry, in general, is very competitive: NAICS and SIC identify 94569 business establishments in the US. However, as my business engages in the niche market – specialized clothing for plus-size women, the saturation is lower, as only 8% of brands offer such options. The industry is now in the stage
of growth as the rates of obesity in the US are steadily increasing. Between 2012 and 2019, the percentage of people in need of plus-size clothing shifted from 19% to 42%.The Revenue StreamThe main revenue stream is sales, as my business is a clothing boutique. In addition, shipping is also charged (there is an option of free local pick up in St.Petersburg, Florida).How Much It Will Cost to Start Up This BusinessMy start-up costs include the materials and the manufacturer. As the boutique is online, I spare the rent, etc. I have no employees, and there is no cost for a sales tax permit in Florida. The design and launch of the website and marketing are also on me. Therefore, the total costs of my start-up for the
is likely to rise). Thus, a bigger share of the business will remain mine as a founder of the start-up.The Biggest StrengthJust try it out, and you’ll see the difference! The new look in the plus-size industry is not as on the mass-market items of bigger size but as on individually designed trendy clothes that are on equal terms with the usual ones. Such a perspective allows women to enjoy their lives in every size and shape as there is no more difference in quality and price.
Globalization is the extent to which information, investments, trade, political cooperation, cultural values, and social ideas flow among different countries. It is creating a borderless world for managers by allowing them to conduct their operations internationally rather than locally, hire employees from different countries, buy raw materials from the best sources, and sell goods in various markets (Samson et al., 2020). Although the borderless world presents many opportunities to managers, it also entails risks, such as information security and cultural differences.A global mindset is a manager’s ability to recognize and influence people or organizations that have different cultural, social, political, and psychological backgrounds (Samson et al., 2020). It has become imperative for international companies because managers constantly interact with individuals with different perspectives. To ensure effective operations and
collaboration, managers should be able to understand these perspectives instead of sticking to a worldview prevalent in their home country.The international landscape is changing since China, India, and Brazil demonstrate economic growth and play an important role in global business. For example, China has received more foreign investments than any other place and has increased its number of Fortune Global 500 companies from 16 in 2005 to 98 in 2015 (Samson et al., 2020). While China is growing through manufacturing, India develops economically through services, software design, and precision engineering.A multinational corporation (MNC) is a company, with more than 25% of revenues which come from operations in countries other than the home country of the parent organization (Samson et al., 2020). MNCs are characterized by close cooperation among
country, while produced goods are transferred to other countries for sale. Licensing is an entry strategy in which the company in one country gives firms in other countries access to specific resources, such as technology or trademark rights, to produce and sell its products abroad (Samson et al., 2020). Direct investing is an entry strategy where the company manages its production facilities in another country.
While the situation with the COVID-19 pandemic is critical, the case with mandatory vaccination at work is controversial. I think it is justified because it helps stop the pandemic; those unwilling to vaccinate should be ensured that they will not facilitate the contamination by the coronavirus. However, such a decision requires additional measures to ensure that the vaccine is safe and beneficial for the human organism. Despite a lack of time, as the pandemic must be conquered as soon as possible, the laws which require massive mandatory vaccination, under a threat of high fines, are the radical measure. They should be implemented carefully, as they may limit human rights and even be undemocratic, despite sometimes they are necessary to cope with challenging situations. In my opinion, the pandemic

teeth, go to bed.ApplicationSocial NormsThe above field log describes the ordinary day of the female who has a family, a job, hobbies, and educational goals, from which career ambitions emerge. Therefore, I seek to allocate my resources in a way that would allow for the maximally appropriate integration of all of those, which presupposes activity in several spheres in parallel. The latter nuance, in turn, adds to the significance of the role social norms play in my life since the amount as well as a variety of my social contacts increases inevitably.Thus, during a walk, social norms involve neatness, and proper behavior that does not cause any inconvenience for the surrounding people and other. Furthermore, helping friends is actually possible to see as a norm; those who refuse
to do that are considered deviant automatically, regardless of the reason. While shopping, the essential norm-based requirement is to wait in line without trying to avoid that, for instance, by force; regarding online communication, no forms of hate speech and no fakes are socially acceptable. Even domestic life rests partly on social norms, such as cleanness and fresh breath, which hygiene procedures like brushing the teeth target.Macro-Level and Micro-Level AnalysisIt is quite apparent that norms influence both the lives of particular individuals and the performance of the entire society, as the latter actually consists of the former. A norm exists in case the community members practice certain behavior, believing that others do that as well or expecting a compliment from those whose opinion is important to them (UNICEF,
2021). Therefore, at the macro level, social norms make the vast majority of the population act similarly in specific situations and contexts. Hence, unwritten but commonly known and strongly prescribed patterns appear that eventually become integral to the culture. The micro level, meanwhile, stands for the need of a certain individual to adjust his or her everyday behavior to those recommendations so that society recognizes him or her as normal.Concept AnalysisAs the day the field log describes is quite busy, various concepts are applicable to it. One of the main among them is socialization , which is important for both individuals and society, particularly in the context of norms. Thus, Ward et al. (2019) highlight that communication not only simplifies transmitting the rules and principles of a certain
community to the next generations but also enables people to put themselves into perspective. In other words, a person acquires a chance to see how the other perceives him or her; this, in turn, determines the areas where corrections are necessary if such exist.The concept of family , whose essential role is apparent from the log, comprises two subconcepts in the given case, notably, nuclear and extended . The former is worth mentioning among the key determinants of the routine due to the need to coordinate all of the everyday actions with the partner’s lifestyle, day regimen, and demands. The extended family, meanwhile, connects the micro group, whose nuclear equivalent is, to the society, an essential agent of socialization. It is noteworthy that families may have inner traditions,
such as usual communication styles; however, those should not prevail over social norms in extrafamilial contexts. If they do, the probability that society will accept the person depends inversely on the degree of the contradiction.Interactions and impression management are also essential points, which, in fact, are closely intertwined since public opinion on an individual determines his or her social success. In sociological terms, this fact makes people develop so-called images that reflect the ways they would like others to see them (Grebelsky‐Lichtman et al., 2020). Simply stated, the need to interact with society makes its members highlight their strengths and camouflage their weaknesses to reach a higher degree of acceptance. In my case, I monitor the stylishness of my clothes and do not inform my extended family on
certain issues I am facing to make my image more favorable.ReflectionAs apparent from the analysis of my everyday life, I interact with society via a range of channels in parallel, playing several roles. Thus, within my nuclear family, I am a spouse, while the members of the extended position me as their child, grandchild, cousin, and other. The ways I interact with each circle, consequently, are dissimilar as well, primarily due to the difference between my feelings in these cases. Notably, my husband perceives me as an adult, helping me realize my responsibility and make important decisions. In the opinion of my parents as well as more distant relatives, on the contrary, I am still too young to be self-sufficient, which can be quite disappointing and, furthermore, affects
me and I affect them. The former manifests itself in the desire to make a maximally positive impression, which, for instance, encourages me to dress decently prior to leaving my home or disguise my problems and failures from my relatives. Regarding the inverse direction, my needs and opinions of mine, both as a close person and as a customer, may be essential, which may make others consider those when shaping their behavior.
I have a photo in front of me, which depicts many people, but the emphasis is only on one person, who is located in the center. He is surrounded by people who can be mentally divided into civil servants (the presence of business suits distinguishes them) and ordinary citizens. On the faces of everyone who can be seen, one can see bewilderment, a sense of injustice and lawlessness.Turning to a more in-depth analysis of this photo, I would like to note that this work attracted me by the person’s personality. It is difficult not to recognize Nelson Mandela in this work; therefore, after reading the photo’s description, you begin to remember the circumstances under which this photo was released. Looking at the picture, you can feel the emotions
behind him, ready to support him. It is like revealing the theme of the confrontation between the state and ordinary citizens. Nelson Mandela feels like a hero who is confident in himself and his victory overpower. The photo’s author shows that he is on the defendant’s side, emphasizing this with various visual effects.This work gets into the soul well; I want to analyze and visualize the photo, imagine what Mandela is saying at this moment and what people are shouting behind his back, a pleasant feeling. This work is what we call “touched to the depths of the soul”, the photo reflects a landmark historical event and conveys the right atmosphere, thanks to which we experience genuine emotions.
Many concepts have universal definitions but are still too broad because they may have unique and varied meanings to different people. Some may place great importance on money and define it as the most essential value in their life. Other people do not agree with this definition since, for them, money is only one of the ways to achieve a goal. The family also belongs to such concepts – although there are many different dictionary definitions of this social institution, people can still add their meanings to it. The purpose of this paper is to give a general description of the family, list its main characteristics, and relate them to my family.To begin with, the family is one of the most important social agents and the smallest social
unit. As noticed by Mondal (n.d.), it can be defined as “an intimate domestic group made up of people related to one another by bonds of blood, sexual mating or legal ties” (para. 1). At the same time, McCarthy (n.d.) says that the family is “people who share goals and values, have long-term commitments to one another and commonly reside in the same dwelling” (para. 2). However, some people consider themselves their own family or can extend this concept and include friends and pets in it. What is more, this group is not necessarily defined by blood relation – many married couples or single persons adopt children and form a real family unit.As mentioned above, there are many characteristics of this social group. For example, family is the
The business world is ever-changing, and companies must always be flexible to these changes. One of the changes that a business might need to adapt to is an expanding target market. P&G currently sells personal care products to a market that is comprised primarily of women. However, research shows that there is a growing market among male consumers due to the rise of male grooming. P&G should restructure to take advantage of the new market for men’s care products.P&G will need to make several changes to capitalize on the “ignored” market. The restructuring will affect various departments such as research and development, product design, and sales and marketing. Their redesign will affect their employee recruitment and selection practices (Szymczyk, 2016). For instance, currently, most employees that deal with
skin and hair care products, cosmetics, and fragrances are female. This is because the target market is mostly women, which means that the products are probably developed, designed, and marketed by women. To attract a new target audience of men, the company will need to hire more male employees (Nadube & Didia, 2018). Male consumers will be more satisfied with male-only personal care products. These products are best developed by people who are male themselves and understand what other men would want. The research and development, product design, and sales and marketing departments must comprise more male employees.The main contextual variable that led to P&G’s restructuring was the changes in the target market as revealed by a study. The study was conducted by Male Grooming Trends: Profiting in
2009 and Beyond. It showed that although female consumers dominated the market for personal grooming products, the market for male consumers was quickly expanding. P&G saw an opportunity to profit from an expanding market. Therefore, redesigning was necessitated by changes in the market characteristics.Several companies have restructured to capitalize on a larger target market. Examples include Harley Davidson Motorcycles, NFL, and Stryx. Traditionally, the demographic market for motorcycles was older white men. However, following a decrease in motorcycle sales, Harley Davidson started targeting female customers (Moreno, 2017). They customized their bikes to women’s needs and found creative ways to market these bikes to women. Second, the National Football League discovered in a study that women comprised over 40% of their viewership (Townes, 2019). They then expanded their target
A healthcare manager is a person who organizes the work of a certain number of employees in a market economy based on modern management methods. He or she is a specialist in managing and controlling processes in the health promotion and system. It is necessary to consider many nuances related to employees’ activities in the workplace to master this profession successfully. A professional in this field can properly keep performers under control and motivate them by the manager’s desires and goals. The manager forms communications between people and determines the individual contribution of each employee to the overall result. There are two main bases of influence that encourage the performer to cooperate: personal and organizational (positional). Below is a description of these abilities and the sources of their
development by managers in healthcare organizations.The sources of a manager’s power base in the healthcare organizations on a personal side include the following elements and aspects. First of all, a healthcare manager has that method of leadership under a certain level of education, knowledge, experience, skills, and abilities. The performer believes in the influencer’s special knowledge that will allow the subordinate’s needs. This is influence by reasonable faith in the skills of the leader. Secondly, the right of the head to power is conditioned by the measure of recognition of subordinates. There is a desire to influence other people, which is manifested in the desire to strengthen one’s reputation, give persistent advice, and offer help (Gopee & Galloway, 2017). Thirdly, a manager has access to the necessary information
and the ability to use it to influence subordinates. The power of information can become a source of influence, both for the manager and assistants. Thus, it is based only on managing data and not on understanding the subject. Fourth, the head influences the behavior of subordinates with the help of charisma and charm. An aide consciously or subconsciously strives to imitate the leader because he wants to be like him.The sources of a manager’s power on an organizational (positional) basis include the following components. A healthcare manager in organizations must have enough authority to influence decision-making. For example, he may use the “carrot and stick” method. As an influence on the result, a director uses the tactics of rewarding in his activities, which helps strengthen the authorities’
The success of Phineas Taylor Barnum can be largely attributed to his ability as a marketing specialist and the sensationalist nature of his products and services. In order to understand how his performance could be implemented in the modern day, it is essential to assess the appeal of such an experience and the primary elements that allowed Barnum to successfully market it as a product to interested customers. From his museum of curiosities to his circus, Barnum would often instigate curiosity within his audience. As such, a modern version of such an experience would require aggressive marketing that is slightly less direct, thereby creating mystery and curiosity within viewers (Foster, 2017). Similarly, Barnum prioritized a number of features within his marketing, including advertising to a large demographic, massive
PR stunts, persistent marketing, and providing interesting stories.Assuming this, a modern promotion of Barnum’s enterprises would include unique and continuous advertising through social media platforms. Due to the visual-heavy and experience-oriented elements of his business, video, audio, and image content would also benefit in promoting the experience. Because Barnum believed in reaching a large demographic, it is likely that not only the advertising but the experience itself could be provided digitally. In order to better implement a successful strategy, it can be neenfical to see the ways in which modern circuses or experience-based businesses operate. While many circuses continue to operate with a live audience, certain programs and businesses have found success in implementing live stream features. This would be especially beneficial for Barnum as he prefers to
reach a large customer population.While the ability to see a performance live through a television is not new, the accessibility of streaming platforms is a superior choice for businesses. This is due to the fact that an event-focused stream has no time-constrictions and has the freedom to insert advertising in desired time slots (Nichols, 2021). Essentially, this approach allows for company leaders to have complete creative control within their presentation of the experience with the only limitation being the rules of the streaming platform. Additionally, the continuous pacing of a live stream allows for the narrative element that Barnum implemented in his prior marketing strategies.Within the current day, virtual shows have become more prevalent, often hosted through conference or other communication-centered software. This has been seen with sports
and customer engagement than prior. This is an element that would likely be utilized by Barnum due to his belief that customers should be left with a feeling that they had made a worthwhile purchase.Both approaches provide a number of benefits and drawbacks. While a livestream offers content for a wide audience it compromises on engagement with the audience. On the other hand, a virtual show is likely to be more costly and have a smaller pool of customers but provides a unique experience that is likely to lead the audience satisfied. It would even be possible for Barnum to implement both strategies and different price levels. In conclusion, performative and experience-based services have potential within the world of digital marketing.
A crisis is a period or an event which may lead to a dangerous or unstable situation that distresses an individual, a society, or a group. It is an adverse change in environmental or human affairs, especially when happening abruptly, with little or no warning. A crisis may take different forms: being robbed, assaulted, or harassed, facing death or illness, or even losing a job. Sometimes, it can be prompted by inner stressors such as despair with undesirable self-talk. The crisis requires one’s attention; hence seeking assistance helps one address a range of problems they might not have considered. Early intervention can significantly improve one’s ability to cope with what has occurred and its effect on their life. During the COVID-19 pandemic, I was involved in a severe
financial crisis that triggered me to seek emergency assistance from several firms and individuals to intervene in my situation.The CrisisThe COVID-19 pandemic was an emergency disaster that caught each person unaware and unprepared. I am one of the individuals who were negatively afflicted by the outbreak in many ways. I worked in a certain company as a cashier, and my life was running smoothly since I had some income to take care of our family. Although I had a frequent income flow from the job, I had not thought of saving or investing some portion of the money. I also used the income to pay my fees since I attended part-time studies in a nearby institution. I had previously never been into any form of a financial crisis;
hence I could not think that something like that might happen to me.When the COVID outbreak was announced, the government imposed strict restrictions and regulations on businesses, such as the closure of hotels and restaurants to minimize the interaction of people. The restrictions set were to curb the spread of the disease and struck many individuals through losing their jobs, which happened abruptly with no one’s prediction. I lost my job unexpectedly with no savings, no investment, or any other source of income, and I was the breadwinner of our family. Therefore, that led me to depression since I had no clue what to do afterward, and everyone else was looking upon me to provide.At first, I thought the COVID outbreak was a short-term thing; hence I had

They helped our family get the required medication and supported us financially for a while until I got well.ConclusionA crisis can be in different forms, such as a financial crisis, and can arise anytime regardless of economic status. Therefore, it entails immediate intervention through seeking assistance from agencies, friends, or family members. In cases like the one I underwent, it is crucial to apply for any form of help. If one does not get help early after experiencing a crisis, personal distress may lengthen and lead to bad decision-making.
A global organization is not always risk-safe as the parent organization is typically situated in the nation of origin, and it sets up units in different nations. Global organizations are less impacted by limited downturns than organizations that work in one country. Organizations that work in a few countries have a more extensive pool of potential clients, which implies greater freedom to create benefits. Nonetheless, global companies need to overcome various risks that can compromise the business. Especially, localization programs might not work well in the market assessment area of multinational companies.Client perspectives and practices are exceptionally affected by cultural uniformity. When an organization moves into another market, plans of action ought to be altered to reflect neighborhood inclinations, customs, and propensities (Vaara et al., 2019). For instance,
changes ought to be made to the item and administration contributions, evaluation, and advertising. Except if nearby societies drive action plans, unfamiliar organizations have a high risk of collapse. The expenses related to risk in a foreign market can be overwhelming.While interpretation is a significant part of language administration, it is the ideal initial step for some organizations that aim to integrate localization. Applying the localization program to deal with worldwide business can be harmful. Hence, worldwide achievement usually requires a glocal outlook (Vaara et al., 2019). Glocalization alludes to the interface of both globalization and localization. Though globalization includes normalized overall cycles and administrations, localization includes cycles and item contributions custom-made to meet explicit nearby business sectors (Vaara et al., 2019). It perceives those monetary collaborations are
restricted by profoundly instilled social frameworks impervious to change. Confinement project for executives is the most common way of arranging limitation campaigns⁠, deciphering enormous groups of content into different dialects for use in regions across the world.The most well-known risk for a multinational company that is trying to localize its market is making excessive underestimating of a specific market’s latent capacity given an organization’s homegrown encounter. Unfamiliar business sectors commonly have fewer data accessible and greater inconstancy in deal gauges, which is an arrangement for disappointment. Worldwide business achievement also requires a top-to-bottom comprehension of nearby business customs (Vaara et al., 2019). Without enthusiasm for how business is done in a foreign market, new contestants can rapidly wind up on the back foot with partners.Furthermore, societies vary in
works in Latin America, just like the United States, may regret embracing such a strategy (Vaara et al., 2019). From running finance in South America to obtaining unrefined components in Asia, all aspects of the present-day worldwide business have a component of risk that should be secured.In conclusion, for administrators of global organizations, the inability to comprehend social contrasts can add to inefficient workforce choices when localizing the market. To oblige their global accomplices and offer productive help, neighborhood organizations should foster progressed strategies for leading business. A successful localization program may incorporate utilizing lean techniques, better working environment conditions, employing talented staff, and embracing productive showcasing plans.
WorkWhat I Will DoThe sphere of financial well-being directly impacts my physical and psychological health. Visiting a clinic and a psychologist always costs a lot of money, which you need to earn somewhere. My current job does not allow me to take complete care of my health because some services cost as much as half of my salary. Even though I work in a place that allows me to realize myself in the field, I study thoroughly. I want to work where I will have to give no more than a third of my income for various services.What I NeedTo find a better-paying job, I need to do a thorough search for vacancies on various Internet resources. I am not sure that going to the unemployment bureau would
be a good idea, but it’s worth considering as an option. It should help me to get to know better the areas in which I can work by taking preparatory courses. It is necessary to approach the preparation of a resume very carefully ( Creating a healthier life , 2016). It is necessary to update it and remove unnecessary things. The resume is my reflection, so it should look appropriate.SavingsWhat I Will DoAn essential part of a happy life has a financial cushion to help me cope with difficult times or acquire something significant. Every month, I manage to save a small amount, which helps me travel and not save anywhere. I have a budget for the month, which helps determine how much I should spend this month.
Thanks to my new job, I want to increase my expenses for a month to take better care of myself now and in the future.What I NeedTo save money correctly, I should contact the bank to familiarize myself with all the necessary services. Probably, I should open a deposit at a certain percentage so that my amount will grow in any case. Banking applications will allow me to track the movement of my funds better and see where it is worth cutting costs. The new job will have a decisive role in accumulating new funds and their competent expenditure.DebtWhat I Will DoI would like to have a clear understanding of my total debt and how quickly I can repay it without going beyond my budget. I think that
I will be able to figure out this issue myself, without outside help, by carefully studying the information on the Internet. It will help me avoid risks and fraud from the outside, which is my big fear to deal with this issue independently.What I NeedMany organizations in the world issue microloans that repay debts, but this has a downside. These organizations are taking inhumane measures that it’s time to return the money. A good option is to contact your bank to obtain a credit card with a specific limit. This feature will allow you to pay off most of the debts and, in the future, repay the debt to the bank without haste.RetirementWhat I Will DoI managed to open a deposit on good terms, and I will constantly
improve my emotional state. I hope that I will be able to save more and not have to borrow money or take out a loan for another purchase with a new job.What I NeedTo improve my financial well-being even more, I should spend more time studying financial literacy. There are an incalculable number of free resources for training and planning in the modern world. Together, this will give me a happy life where I stop worrying that there is not enough money or I owe someone when everything is under control. Financial control is a very responsible thing you need to start teaching at school.
The primary source for this study is the general medical journal The Lancet. It publishes the survey data and provides statistics and a comparative analysis of the obtained quantitative information. The Economist can be seen as a secondary source that describes research with less digital content. The study represents a decrease in the HIV infection rate of girls in school by stabilizing their families’ financial difficulties.The World Bank funded the study to demonstrate the value of money in reducing the spread of HIV among young, poor girls. The study was authored by Berk Özler, Lead Economist and Poverty Research Manager. The medical journal The Lancet presented statistics based on a survey in the Zomba district of Malawi (G.C. 2). The Economist later summarized the study with the most
The importance of learning is to obtain new information about events not previously known to me. At the same time, studying helps me analyze them and understand their negative and positive aspects. As a consequence, because I have received and assimilated specific knowledge, I have the opportunity to apply it. In case the background information concerns negative phenomena, oppression, and discrimination, learning enables me to prevent past mistakes and develop a fair future.It is essential to emphasize that knowledge and experiences are precious, especially if they relate to problems that have arisen with family members. Hence, the guest speaker formed his position because of his mother’s encounter with the discrimination of women. At the same time, the mother was trying to restore her lost rights and status in
society at the highest and interstate level, which was not a common practice in that period. Although, in fact, there are several cases where women have appealed to the Supreme Court and the United Nations for assistance in obtaining rights that had not been legally restored (File, 2022). Thus, Bill C-31 resulted from such a struggle, and personally, for the speaker means an opportunity for further innovation and resolution of Indigenous rights. Therefore, understanding history and analyzing it motivates individuals to advocate for the reinstatement of their own rights and interests.It is crucial to be aware of the historical record concerning illegal actions directed at indigenous populations. Although, according to the data provided by Columbus, before the invasion of the native population of Europeans, they had a facilitated
system for rights and freedoms and were immune to widespread diseases (File, 2022). At the same time, after twenty-five years, most of the population had been exterminated and exposed to genocide.In my opinion, even the documents issued by the Pope were aimed at harshly assimilating the indigenous people. Once again, even allowing children to be educated in boarding schools destroyed genetic memory and enforced new thoughts about culture and history. Significantly, the government also enacted the Gradual Civilization Act of 1857 and the Indian Act of 1876 (Hanson, 2022). While the first act assimilated the natives and forced them to abandon their roots, the second act effectively granted Canada the right to dispose of lands and resources belonging to the Indians.It seems evident that the Europeans were thus
imposing their power on the native population. The authority granted to the General Superintendent of Indian Affairs created extraordinary control of Indian status. The consequences of these laws were disobedience from the natives and a desire to regain acquired rights. Although, at first, Aboriginal authorities peacefully petitioned the Canadian government to repeal the discriminatory legislation (Hanson, 2022). I believe that the enactment, the bans on Indian self-identification, and the continuation of discrimination contributed to Aboriginal people’s growing sense of identity and willingness to assert their rights.Moreover, considering that this act significantly reduced the number of individuals who had Indian status, they lost the right to remain on reservations. Therefore, I think that the change of the land, the renaming of communities, and the transformation of Indian names contributed
to the fact that Aboriginal people wanted their land and were not ready to accept the domination of their territory by Europeans. The consequences of such government actions are still being felt today because the aboriginal people have passed on these stories to the next generation as a warning of danger. I should also mention the “Potlatch Law,” In 1884, the federal government banned this festival and other ceremonies (Hanson, 2022). The administration understood that these festivals were significant cultural and social ceremonies for the indigenous population.As a consequence of assimilation, they wanted to remove this component and grant leniency to those who would surrender their potlatch items, such as valuable masks, costumes, and cauldrons. I think the government thus intended to eradicate any opportunity for Aboriginal identity
to exterminate them lasted for several centuries. The consequence of the United Nations Universal Declaration of Human Rights led to revising the Indian Act in 1951 (Hanson, 2022). That is, indigenous people received the rights previously withdrawn from them, they were permitted to vote, hold rituals and festivals, and women were afforded non-discriminatory treatment. Accordingly, it marked the beginning of a massive struggle against discrimination against Aboriginal women in society; it contributes to the fact that in the democratic world, it is finally possible to abolish the Indian Act.
The health of the population is one of the values for the society, therefore, preserving and strengthening it is an important task in which everyone, without exception, should take part. Changes in the conditions for the functioning of state structures and the ongoing transition to market relations put forward new approaches to organizing and methodological support for the training, retraining, and advanced training of nursing specialists. Nursing personnel, carrying out the nursing process in the provision of obstetric and gynecological care, provide medical and preventive care to women and families at various periods of their lives, carry out observation, examination, rehabilitation, provide care and necessary assistance.For women, the decision to terminate a pregnancy may be based on various factors. Abortion is the purposeful or accidental termination of a
pregnancy (Endler et al., 2019). In some countries, abortions are officially allowed, while others are limited to the level of inadmissibility of targeted assistance from medical personnel. Additionally, different religions differ in their attitude towards abortion. Therefore, women who come to the idea and decision to have an abortion may have a different life situation, as well as the conditions for terminating the pregnancy.A nurse plays the role of an adviser, mentor, assistant in relation to a woman and her family. Nursing staff must fulfill all stages of the nursing process: conduct an initial assessment, identify the patient’s problems, plan the work, carry out planned care, draw conclusions from the care. Moreover, an integral part of the work of nursing staff is medical deontology. A nurse spends much
more time with patients than the medical staff (Mainey et al., 2020). The ability to observe medical ethics, to keep medical secrets and the secrets of the patient, not to disclose them is the duty of every paramedical worker. Therefore, a sensitive and conscientious attitude towards patients plays a very important role in the performance of their work.At the same time, the nursing staff strictly and rigorously fulfills all the requirements of this medical institution and the appointment of the attending physician. Nowadays, due to the expansion of knowledge in the field of physiology and pathophysiology of the processes associated with planning pregnancy, childbirth, and the postpartum period, modern methods of obstetric care, prevention, and treatment of complications of pregnancy and childbirth are being developed. However, even when
issue of abortion. At the moment of presenting such information, the soft skills of a nurse are important in order to combine the function of psychological and medical care.In conclusion, there is always a need for high professionalism of medical workers, including the nurses. A nurse must have an understanding of medical ethics and follow it when working with patients. Medical personnel must respect the decision and rights of a woman who decides to have an abortion. In this regard, when informing the patient about the possible consequences, subordination, objective narration, and the exclusion of the personal point of view of the nurse must be observed. In the same connection, the policy of confidentiality of patient information must be respected.
Early childhood wellness emphasizes earlier interventions and creating programs to keep kids healthy. This vital era, which begins at birth and lasts until the age of eight, is characterized by a kid’s most significant growth and progress. The physiological, intellectual, emotional, as well as social progress of a kid is laid out in the first few years of their existence. Several social variables, including the qualities of their families and their communities’ characteristics, impact the health and well-being of kids.Coming up with Frameworks for Health PromotionParadigms for health promotion and illness prevention may assist rural societies in implementing early childhood wellness programs. Health promotion models explain the many elements that combine to produce health behaviors that might influence health outcomes. Initiatives may use a variety of frameworks to
assist rural populations in meeting their needs and addressing health outcomes. Measures like checking sleeping habits, eating habits, physical activity, and regular screening are recommended ( Talbot & Verrinder, 2017).Creating a Health Model Across the life course of a ChildDepression and early exposure to harmful events and pressures may have long-lasting effects on the health habits of a child. Rural locations have a higher prevalence of distress, and children who live in distress are more vulnerable to face dire health consequences. The surroundings, biology, and parenting habits impact children’s health ( Black et al., 2017). This Life Course Model demonstrates that maternal and neonatal factors may affect a child’s health before birth and that early events can have a lifelong impact. To prevent this, it is recommended that
races, and ethnicities. Similarly, acknowledging sexual identity and religious views affirms the value of individuals, households, tribal groups, and societies while conserving and sustaining each individual’s dignity. Cultural competence in child care assistance should also take age into account, particularly for teenagers migrating from the child care framework. Harbach (2018) outlines that a culturally competent framework entails a determination to re-evaluate child welfare services’ exclusive, adult-centered culture at the very least and an active strategy for adolescent empowerment and inclusivity at the very best. Linguistic and cultural competence entails integrating cultural understanding into doctrine and practice.
An organizational structure is a framework that specifies how various operations within an enterprise are coordinated to meet its objectives. Joseph and Gaba (2020) enumerated that these operations may include regulations, positions, and obligations. Additionally, the management chart impacts how information moves between firm levels. In a centralized system, for instance, choices flow from the top down, but decision-making authority is spread across multiple organizational levels in a decentralized model. The firm structure permits businesses to maintain efficiency and concentration. A growth plan enables businesses to extend their operations by adding new sites, investing in client acquisition, and increasing product lines. Thus, a company’s growth plans are influenced by its sector and primary audience. This essay describes the institutional structure of Adidas Company, including details about the type
of ownership, corporate hierarchy, and business model. Moreover, the paper discusses some of the opportunities for growth available for Adidas by identifying three external factors that it needs to consider.Description of the OrganizationAdidas, or Adidas AG, is a German maker of athletic footwear, athletic gear, and general merchandise. The corporation abbreviates the name of its founder, Adolf (Adi) Dassler, to get the moniker Adidas (Adidas, 2022). It was the largest sporting goods maker in Europe and the second largest globally, after Nike, at the turn of the 21st century. Historically, Adidas items bear a three-stripe symbol, which is included in the corporation’s trefoil and mountain emblems. Adidas flourished significantly in the 1950s as association football (soccer) players adopted the institution’s lightweight, screw-in cleat-equipped shoes (Adidas, 2022).In 1963, the
firm created a line of athletic goods by manufacturing soccer balls. Adidas was the industry leader in athletic shoes for several years, but rivalry rose in the 1970s, particularly from smaller companies such as Nike (Schmid et al., 2018). Adidas’ mission and objective are to be the leading sporting equipment manufacturer worldwide with a distinctive product portfolio ranging from athletic apparel for sports enthusiasts to luxury fashion to suit all customer requirements and grow the customer base from several angles (Adidas, 2022). The Adidas AG Company’s business headquarter is in Herzogenaurach, Germany.Description of Organization’s StructureThe Adidas Group’s organizational structure is based on a matrix architecture. Adidas arranges its personnel and resources based on its function and product. Consequently, individuals in the programs, engineering, and logistics divisions may have
two managers. After completing the project, the staff will collaborate with other personalities. Matrix organizational structure is a dynamic framework that allows other sectors to collaborate, obtain diverse, innovative solutions from another unit, and gain new competencies and administrative management tasks inside the steering committee (Jin and Cedrola, 2019). There are three corporate entities within the Adidas Group: the annual general conference, the supervisory board, and the executive management. The executive board controls the organization, including its overall planning, internal surveillance and threat monitoring systems, and adherence. The governing council approves and removes members of the executive board and oversees and informs the executive board of its operations.Type of OwnershipThe type of ownership at Adidas AG Company is general public ownership. In other words, that is to mean
that the company is a publicly traded organization. The investors of a public company have an entitlement to a portion of the institution’s assets and income. Through the free trading of stock shares on trading platforms or over-the-counter (OTC) marketplaces, the control of a publicly traded corporation is divided among broad public stockholders (Silitonga, 2020). Silitonga (2020) insinuated that an initial public offering (IPO) is the procedure in which a private firm’s shares are transferred publicly for the first time. Suppose the IPO entails selling directly to a vast pool of investors, regardless of whether they are small retail investors or significant funds. In that case, this IPO is known as general public dissemination.Organizational HierarchyThe high echelon in the corporation is the CEO, who is responsible for all
of the corporation’s accomplishments and failures and assumes responsibility for overseeing the entire organization. Second, the finance department is accountable for organizing monetary and accounting tasks, such as producing and submitting appropriation statements and providing management with financial records. Human resources are responsible for hiring new staff and guaranteeing they are knowledgeable in their respective fields. The sales staff is responsible for the economic achievement of the entity by transforming brand enthusiasm into productive and long-term business growth. The brand’s department is responsible for exploring, creating, and commercializing the group’s sports and lifestyle goods by providing innovative merchandise and unique moments.IT and mechanical engineering are the two divisions of the engineering faculty. One is responsible for web design and the IT system, while the other is for machining
equipment and operations. The primary objective of this section is to aid Adidas in creating innovative technologies that will enable them to be more profitable and efficient. The operations division involves product development, manufacturing schedules, sourcing, and transportation. Its role is to increase the distribution chain’s effectiveness while assuring the highest standards for product excellence, reliability, and dispatch.Figure 1: Adidas’ Organizational Hierarchy.Business ModelAdidas’s business model relies heavily on creating creative, consumer-driven items. Instead of engaging in sponsored posts, the firm strives to show its value by developing a high-performance brand portfolio that caters to the unique needs of professionals and shoppers (Shah, 2018). It accelerates product creation and manufacturing by continually enhancing technology, procedures, and tools. In addition, they stress considerably reduced group-level fragmentation by reducing the worldwide
product portfolio, unifying the storage base, and standardizing above-market service. The goal is to provide the greatest branded retail experience across all client connections. Innovative distribution channel concepts accelerate the response time to consumer demands. This technique has prompted investors worldwide to acquire Adidas’ common stock, and the corporation has maintained constant expansion over the years (Shah, 2018). The public ownership framework of the business has been a vital component of long-term success.Discussion of External Influences that Impact GrowthCompetitionAdidas faces severe rivalry from its conventional rival Nike Inc. in the sportswear and clothing industry, which significantly impacts its potential development. Nike Inc.’s brand is valued at $122.3 billion, contrasted to Adidas’ $20.19 billion (Ennis, 2020). Nike’s luxury pricing approach, best cost provider methodology, offers Adidas severe competition since
it pursues customers who build a unique level of familiarity with the commodity, eventually forming brand loyalty. Nike makes use of the fact that brand trust has been developed to link purchasers with their prices. Therefore, Nike knows buyers will be willing to pay for its branded merchandise.In addition, Nike notably emphasizes a broad differentiation approach beating Adidas’ corporate-level approach. Based on this philosophy, Nike creates its athletic merchandise in three mechanisms (Ennis, 2020). Firstly, the company produces for three distinct demographic groups: men, women, and children. Secondly, it distinguishes its goods by providing a selection of gear and peripherals, such as shoes, gym bags, mittens, and skates. Thirdly, Nike has the license to produce and market non-athletic commodities such as school supplies, broadcast media gadgets, and smartwatches
under the Nike name (Ennis, 2020). This plan is superior to Adidas’ corporate strategy, which concentrates on creativity and attempts to create new goods, solutions, and procedures to compete.Political UncertaintiesThe most significant political challenges affecting Adidas are shifting trade policies and political turmoil in numerous nations. Adidas must address these concerns to maintain its worldwide presence and economic performance. The Trump administration implemented trade restrictions and levies (Ennis, 2020). Regarding price increases, US tariffs on Chinese commodities continue to be a significant source of worry for Adidas and other athletic apparel manufacturers. Germany is a significant exporter, and US import restrictions and taxes could cost the country as much as 20 billion euros (Ennis, 2020). Adidas’ global activities include the shipment and delivery of items and offerings. Adidas
cannot fulfill its ultimate targets and objectives without enhancing its multifaceted distribution network to adhere to worldwide and political regulations. Therefore, this will negatively impact Adidas’ sales, revenue, and brand recognition.E-Commerce PlatformFollowing the popularity of its online operations, e-commerce allows Adidas to expand its digital capabilities. Performance in digital sales outlets is also reflected in the net sales growth of the institution’s highest-ranked online vendors. The three largest online retailers by net sales, adidas.com, adidas.co.uk, and reebok.com, have all significantly improved their net sales compared to 2019. Reebok.com recorded the highest year-over-year growth of 125%, with overall net sales exceeding €262 million (Russell, 2021). Therefore, it is reducing the gap with adidas.co.uk, which produced improved net sales in 2020 (€322 million) (Russell, 2021). By integrating offline and online
Mark Hendrickson’s article titled “Advance agent of expanding empires: George F. Becker and mineral exploration in South Africa and the Philippines” investigates the geologist’s role in shaping the American imagination of imperial expansion. The first few paragraphs of the article describe the period in which the British Empire suffered as a result of its inaccurate colonial politics, especially in South Africa, where the British had constant conflicts with the local Boer government. With this in mind, the author smoothly attracts readers’ attention to George Becker’s persona, who had an experience working in the South Africa region full of gold mines and political instability (Hendrickson 2019). He also worked in the Philippines, which was recently occupied after Admiral Dewey’s victory over the Spanish.I believe the main argument proposed by
the author is that given the global empire transformation of the United States, the country needed people like Becker. These are people who might enlighten both politicians and the public about the peoples, their traditions, and resources of unfamiliar and outlying countries. In this way, Hendrickson underlined Becker’s exceptional position as an educator within the American political elite of that time (Hendrickson 2019). For instance, Theodore Roosevelt, the future United States 26 th president, was a big fan of Becker for his comprehensive knowledge of the Philippines, including the political reality of the Asian country.I partially do agree with this statement since, indeed, Becker contributed to raising awareness about specific regions’ resources and to American geopolitical achievements. However, Becker’s becoming one of the most influential scientists of his
time in scientific and political societies was not instantly. Shortly after his return from South Africa, he gave a lecture about the political situation in the country where he spent more than a half year at Columbia University, and this speech became his gateway to popularity. Later, Becker wrote his reflection on what he thought to be the leading cause of political problems in South Africa (Hendrickson 2019). That was a lack of political leaders who could govern the country in light of recent geo-economic discoveries, which turned out to be a prophetical prediction.Subsequently, Becker was missioned to the Philippines to obtain general information about the country’s mineral wealth. Later, the general public was told that America’s mission was to bring civilization to the corners, remaining uncivilized. A
the American audience at the request of US Senator Beveridge. Moreover, they called rebels “sincere though misguided patriots,” “adventurers,” and “pursuers of charms of an exciting life” (Kramer 2018). This changed the reasons and motives of rebels on a fundamental basis in the eyes of the American public.It must be noted that Becker’s image of gold deposits in South Africa strongly affected both mining processes and British colonial policy in Africa, justifying British aggression against local people. Moreover, he the same justification he applied in the case of American imperialistic expansions in the Philippines and beyond (Hendrickson 2019). Thus, Becker was one of the significant contributors to American expansionist policy and determined most western countries’ foreign policy concerning countries that are weaker but rich in mineral sources.
There is an adverse effect of the opioid crisis on the United States. These substances typically result in an addiction, and a more significant aspect implies that they do not address the problem of the source of pain. Instead of it, opioids develop a feeling of euphoria that masks suffering. That is why it is evident that there is no need to legalize heroin, meaning that alternative pain relievers should be created.Since heroin and other opioids adversely impact the entire nation, a reasonable step is to fund alternative treatments for pain. For example, some researchers consider using marijuana as a pain reliever, but this substance also has some health risks, meaning that this decision should be made with caution (Saloner et al., 2018). However, if medical scientists manage
why there is no doubt that it is necessary to invest in alternative pain management medicines.In conclusion, it has been identified that the opioid crisis is a significant challenge for the United States. This problem results in thousands of injured and dead, denoting that alternative pain relievers should be found. Marijuana is a suitable option, but the possible harmful effects of this substance represent why the healthcare industry has not started using it. In any case, researchers should look for alternative pain relievers to protect patients and reduce healthcare expenditures.
One of the prominent areas of anthropology, primatology, studies nonhuman primates, their behavior, and social capabilities to provide valuable details about human evolution. Next, one of the primary traits that could characterize most apes, especially chimpanzees, is aggression among the male species. However, while aggression presents a significant component of social structure and gender differences among nonhuman primates, its role and influence in human evolution remain implicit. This essay will explore various manifestations of aggression among chimpanzees and bonobos, analyze and compare their causes, and determine whether aggression presents a significant component of human evolution.One of the most developed representatives of the great apes’ group, also known as humans’ closes living relatives, the chimpanzees, are known for their intelligence. Chimps are rarely associated with aggressive behavior as they
“lack the weapons” typically associated with violence, such as claws and string canines (Stanford, 2018). However, despite their high level of development, chimps also exhibit a very high amount of aggression to the point of lethal outcomes, even for the members of their own community. In fact, only a few animals besides humans are capable of such violent behavior. However, according to Preis and Jacob (2019), many chimps learned several strategies for avoiding aggressive behavior, such as cooperation and conflict management, because of the natural fear of injury. While most of the time, chimpanzees live in peace, several reasons could cause aggressive interactions.The prominent reason for aggressive interaction among chimps is dominance relationships. Chimps are highly protective of their territories as territory size is closely connected to food
resources. Food availability also presents one of the components of higher social status among chimps. According to Preis et al. (2019), a higher dominance level or social status is associated with many fitness benefits, such as better health, longevity of life, and even faster healing processes. The dominance and subordination ranks are reflected in levels of glucocorticoid hormones used to assess Hypothalamus-Pituitary-Adrenal (HPA) axis activity. The research conducted by Preis et al. (2019) suggests that urinary glucocorticoid levels are positively correlated with aggression rates, meaning that elevated aggression influences glucocorticoid levels. Another study by Preis and Jacob (2019) defined that status competition causes psychosocial stress on all-male species, even during periods of low rates of aggression, which was discovered through the analysis of urinary cortisol levels. Therefore, male
chimps are stressed more during periods of high competition, while aggression arises mainly during periods of low competition because of social instability caused by food availability or mating.Furthermore, considering that aggression in male chimpanzees is an outcome of adaptive strategy provides important context about human evolution. According to Stanford (2018), while violent behavior among chimps is considered immoral because of their connection with humans, in reality, aggression among chimpanzees’ is an amoral tool for obtaining more resources by eliminating competitors. Moreover, it was determined by Preis et al. (2019) that in cases with high risks of escalation, some chimps prefer avoiding aggression. Avoiding aggression and introducing different forms of behavior to show their competitiveness proves that chimps are capable of using adaptive strategies and elements of conflict management.On
the other hand, aggression is less common among bonobos, who are also considered close human relatives. Besides sharing physical differences with chimpanzees, bonobos have different social structure patterns, which influences conflict-resolving methods in bonobos. While bonobos, like chimpanzees, are also protective of their territory, bonobos have more complex inter-group relationships where they often meet to interact, which relates them to humans (Tokuyama et al., 2019). Even though bonobos tend to express aggression only to attack out-group individuals, they have never been seen killing other bonobos, compared to the level of aggression in chimps.Moreover, there are considerable gender differences between female chimps and bonobos, as female bonobos have significantly higher social status. While there could be competition among male bonobos for social ranking, according to Tokuyama et al. (2019),
mating is more influenced by the female mating partner’s choice and the social status of the male bonobo’s mother. Such a rational approach to mating differs from chimps, who frequently show aggression towards females. In turn, female chimps rarely show aggression towards male chimps, which is one factor that influences the overall level of aggression in chimps. According to King (2021), aggression in chimpanzees is shaped at a young age. Young chimpanzees become more aggressive when young chimps spend with protective mothers and time with aggressive males (King, 2021). A similar tendency is found in humans: suggesting that aggressive behavior is more acceptable for boys results in men being more physically aggressive. Therefore, the continuous dynamic of male chimps showing more aggression than female chimps reaffirms aggressive interactions
among males.Next, another significant environmental difference between bonobos that influenced their social structure and conditional gender equality is food availability. Higher social status and physical strength among chimpanzees suggest more available food resources. In addition, access to more food resources guarantees increased reproductive capabilities and success. On the other hand, Bonobos are less influenced by food availability as, according to Tokuyama et al. (2019), they exist in areas with an abundance of food resources with low seasonality. Therefore, the physical strength of bonobos plays a minor role as food is available in quantitates sufficient for several groups of bonobos, which results in relative equality of female and male bonobos. Moreover, as bonobo mothers often participate in competitions alongside their sons, female bonobos are not disregarded like chimpanzee females.Lastly,
bonobos revealed that environmental factors, such as food availability, determined key differences of social structure and aggression patterns in chimps and bonobos. Therefore, from the point of human evolution, aggression patterns in people could be connected to environmental factors and the availability of recourses. People historically tend to show more intense proactive aggression in fighting and starting wars for resources. This essay analyzed why proactive aggression in chimps and humans has similar reasons and provided an outlook on what human evolution would look like if there were plenty of resources available for the humankind.
The current global landscape of the agricultural economy is composed of large companies. In fact, their presence is prevalent enough to dictate and formulate policies and standards within the industry (Chemnitz et al., 2017). In practice, this has resulted in a number of discrepancies such as environmental damages, violations of human and labor rights, and even the lack of effort to minimize poverty. While the scale of the issue may seem too large to resolve, alterations of consumer buying habits have the potential to foster diversity within such industries. However, buying habits are only a small fragment of a number of interventions that are necessary. Perhaps the most vital change that is missing includes government presence.The most interesting aspect of the reading to me was focused on how
Alan Westin identifies four primary functions of privacy: personal autonomy, emotional release, self-evaluation, and limited and protected communication. The first one refers to how privacy is central to maintaining one’s sense of individuality (Halbert & Inguilli, 2014). Emotional release means the individuals’ need to relieve themselves of the psychological stress that is inseparable from living n a society for which privacy is also indispensable (Halbert & Inguilli, 2014). Privacy is also important for self-evaluation because it is often a preliminary condition for a thorough self-reflection (Halbert & Inguilli, 2014). As for limited and protected communication, privacy is essential for allowing people to share sensitive information only with those they want instead of everyone.The Constitution does not mention the right to privacy explicitly. The position of the Supreme Court
being secure in one’s digital communication corresponds directly to Westin’s function of limited and protected communication. Similarly, the amount of personal information stored on an average cellphone can make it an important component of the extended self, making it valuable for both personal autonomy and self-reflation. Thus, the Supreme Court’s position on privacy implicitly recognizes the value of privacy functions as defined by Westin.
Rhinoceros is an incredible woodcut made by Albrecht Durer. He created a woodcut picture that was reproduced several thousand times of the animal, which demonstrated a significant interest of the European people in Asia. His work was considered a masterpiece of that time that served informative and aesthetic purposes. The story of the picture can be used to describe the relationships between Europe, India, and the Islamic world.It is crucial to start with several facts from the biography of Albrecht Durer. He was a famous and well-known artist that made special artworks. It was found that Durer had never seen the beast himself and that created his work based on a drawing and written samples sent from Lisbon (Monson 51). Durer was an extremely influential Italian, and he
knew many other influential people of the time, including Raphael, Leonardo da Vinci, and Bellini. Even though Durer had never seen a live rhino and depicted it inaccurately, Durer’s Rhinoceros became one of the most popular pictures of the time.The picture of the rhino created in 1515 was inaccurate. The picture shows that a rhino is covered with plates of armor. Indeed, the audience can observe the shift in its meaning from an exact source of zoological information to a pictorial source of aesthetic pleasure throughout the construction of the history of the Rhinoceros (Feiman 22). Durer’s Rhinoceros also has a small horn on the back, scaly legs, and saw-like rear quarters. These features are not present in a rhino. The fact that Durer was interested in the
animal and many people bought woodcut pictures of the rhino show how interested the public was in the gift from the East.The rhinoceros depicted by Durer had a fascinating history. It was first sent as a gift numerous times and always was the special art that every receiver would admire (Feiman 22). For example, it was sent to King Manual of Portugal, where it became extremely popular. King Manual even started a fight between an elephant and the rhino to see who would be the winner. It became one of the most precious possessions of the king. However, King Manual still sent the animal as a gift to Pope Leo X in 1515. This demonstrates how the Islamic world wanted to build relationships with Europe, how India lived
in animals from the East. Even though Durer had not seen the rhino, he created a woodcut print of the animal, knowing that it would get popular. The story of the rhinoceros’ travels demonstrates the diplomatic interests of India, the Islamic world, and Europe, as the animal was first gifted by Indians to an Islamic king, then to a European king, and then to the Pope.
In this study, the researchers utilized multiple linear regression to identify the relationship between alcohol consumption and the characteristics of the neighborhood. The dependent variable for this study is alcohol consumption among students (Freitas et al., 2020). The study has five independent variables; firstly, is people often get mugged, robbed, or attacked in the neighborhood. Secondly, people in my neighborhood look out for each other and thirdly, people sold or used drugs in the neighborhood. Fourthly, people in my neighborhood generally got along with each other, and lastly, I feel safe being out alone in my neighborhood during the night.From table 1.0, the value of R square is 0.026, which means that 2.6% of the variation on students drinking alcohol can be explained by the combined variation of
people in neighborhood getting along with each other, people sell or use drugs in the neighborhood, I feel safe being out alone in my neighborhood, people often get mugged, robbed or attacked in my neighborhood, and people in my neighborhood could be trusted. However, the adjusted R square, which considers the number of variables and the sample size, shows that only 0.3% of the variation in the dependent variable can be explained by combined variations of the dependent variable (Ramachandran & Tsokos, 2021).From table 2.0, the p-value is 0.342, which is greater than 0.05. This means that the regression analysis is not significant to explain the dependent variable using the independent variables (Maneejuk & Yamaka, 2020). From the correlations results in table 3.0; I feel safe being out
alone in my neighborhood, people often get mugged, robbed or attacked in my neighborhood, and people in my neighborhood generally got along with each other have a weak positive correlation with how often do you have a drink containing alcohol? People sell or use drugs in my neighborhood, and People in my neighborhood could be trusted has a weak negative correlation with how often do you have a drink containing alcohol?

This study’s independent variable was a helpful message on the back of the dining check regarding the upcoming specials. The dependent variable was the percentage of the bill left as a tip to the waiter. This study operationalizes the restaurant tipping culture by focusing on the tip percentage. The potential confounding variables of this experiment may be the food quality, the server’s gender, the dining party’s size, and whether the customers were regulars.The study’s strengths include design transparency, implementation simplicity, and potential replication in different settings. However, the message’s content varied depending on the special, appealing differently to customers. Furthermore, the study was conducted only in one restaurant, which renders extrapolation to different establishment classes difficult. These factors could impact the tipping outcomes and, therefore, the study results.Furthermore,
it is unclear whether the mere presence of a personalized message or the message content itself drove the outcome. To evaluate this possibility, the authors could have asked waiters to write different messages, some with no useful content, such as wishing a good day or drawing a smiley face. Moreover, the researchers could have used alternative arrangements, assigning the waiters randomly instead of assigning dining parties randomly.Several aspects of this study could impact its internal validity. The researchers have instructed servers to keep their behavior consistent, thus limiting potential confounding variables. Varying attitudes may affect the final tip, thus undermining the causal relationship. Furthermore, a few hypothetical aspects could limit the research’s external validity. For instance, if the waiter were a young female adult, applying the same conclusions
a private country club, extrapolating the result onto the high-class restaurant and casual diners alike would be unreliable. If the meal was buffet-style, the overall tipping percentage might have been lower due to the perceived lesser effort of a waiter, thus impacting its wider applicability.Lastly, the study only used two groups, servers, and dining parties, with no size specification. The authors could have employed a third group of solo dining parties, thus separating groups from those dining by themselves. Such an addition would allow addressing the question of the groups’ size effect and individual, interpersonal interactions. Lastly, implementing the design with solo dining parties would address the effect of gender on the outcome.
The idea of Whiteness in Get OutGet Out shatters the myth of America as a post-racist country. Everything frightening, as everything funny, in Get Out comes from the fear that members of the former master race and the former slave race have for each other. Holmes notes that in this movie, the antagonists are not whites who hate blacks for their race. The director shows whites who love blacks and even envy them with scary, dangerous, and insensitive machines. It debunks the notion of an ideal culture of political correctness as if proclaiming that it is racist to treat someone positively just because of their skin color.Get Out at first resembles, and somewhere directly parodies, Guess Who’s Coming to Dinner Stanley Kramer’s not the most outstanding but historically
significant film about a girl who introduces her parents to a black groom. It was made exactly 50 years ago – when interracial marriage was a scandal and just stopped being a crime. Nowadays, it seems like a wildness from the past; however, the question still arises: “Has everything got better since then?”. In Kramer’s film, the nuance was that the parents were progressive liberals, but their daughter’s engagement to Sidney Poitier was a shock even for them. Peel corrects for the Obama era and takes the situation to the point of absurdity – Rose’s parents and their friends, elderly rich whites, go out of their way to show their openness. They praise Obama, talk about Jesse Owens and Tiger Woods, use awkward jargon, and almost start rapping.
But all this, of course, only proves that the rift that separates the American people has not gone away; a beautiful fence has surrounded it.Peele uses these minor, everyday incidents in Get Out to show how someone accidentally or intentionally makes another feel like an outsider. According to Grant, this creates an ever-increasing sense of hostility. The film’s strength is that it uses terrible moments to convey to the audience the truth about manifestations of racism. Peele’s film appeals both to people who have experienced racism and people who may not always understand that they are committing it.Examples in film, television, or media where whiteness seems to be the defaultIndeed, in many films, for a black hero to be recognized by the viewer, they need to have some
impressive story. In turn, Syed asserts that white characters are interesting for the very fact of their existence. For example, films such as Jezebel (1938), Gone with the Wind (1939), Dixiana (1930), and Mississippi (1935) both mask and expose the capitalist exploitation of Africans. These films portray American labor through images of opulent plantations and dazzlingly wealthy white southern families. In these films, the rigidity of whiteness is maintained by interracial relationships. Whites dominate but are dependent on blacks, to the point where the actions of African-American characters on-screen serve as an expression of the emotions of white characters to maintain a restrained vision of the world of whiteness. Thus, black characters arouse the viewer’s interest, based on pity for them in these films.An equally striking example is
Tony is popular in his environment.However, there are films where the directors go against Hollywood whiteness. Despite some criticism of acts of unjust racial oppression, Ryan Coogler’s Black Panther (2018) is such a film. The film aims to fundamentally destroy the core function of Hollywood as the lifeblood of whiteness and white supremacy. Coogler’s work seems to be mainly about creating a Black Hollywood aesthetic. Thus, Black Panther raises the question of whether a black film can be a box office success.
Terrorism is one of the main problems faced by humanity in the 21st century and, despite considerable countermeasures, it remains topical. Islamic terrorism is one of the most prominent forms of the radicalism of the past decades, which manifested itself in several tragic events. The movement began when Osama Bin Laden formed al Qaeda in 1989, which conducted its first attack in Yemen by placing a bomb in a hotel housing American troops (“Osama bin Laden,” 2020). Osama Bin Laden espoused the idea of worldwide Jihad, a holy war of Muslims against the infidels and especially the United States. The main terrorist attack of al Qaeda was the 9/11 Bombing of the World Trade Centers, claiming the lives of thousands of people and leading to the beginning of
the War on Terror (“Osama bin Laden,” 2020). Eventually, the United States Military located Osama bin Laden and killed him, yet it did not stop other Islamic radicals from carrying out attacks. One of them was the Boston Marathon Bombings event which were orchestrated by followers of Osama bin Laden (Breuninger, 2021).The continuing terrorist attacks cause numerous concerns to emerge over the effectiveness of the United States War on Terror. Yet, it is still one of the responsibilities of the country to act as the world’s “policeman” since the United States is the only global superpower capable of establishing control overseas. Essentially, by ensuring its military presence in problematic regions, the United States manages to contain the existing threats to global peace. The Middle East is one such
radical movements in the region, which, if left unchecked, can continue building support networks worldwide, including in the United States. Such a development can lead to new terrorist attacks, as well as the rise of Islamist governments in the Middle East, which will be hostile to western nations. As a result, the terrorist threat in the world would only increase if the United States completely left the Middle East. In such an event, local terrorist groups would seize power and gain access to more resources allowing them to further incite violence and destruction. Moreover, there is also a threat of Islamist groups gaining control over nuclear weapons, thus putting the safety of the entire world at risk.
Several reports have been sent to the United States Department of Agriculture’s Agricultural Research Service concerning the recent spread of an unknown epidemic on a farm in Montana. The report describes that cattle started exhibiting strange and abnormal behavior. Particularly, the cows started losing weight drastically and without any obvious reason, producing a reduced amount of milk and having problems with orientation (Broucek et al., 2017). The study of the relevant literature revealed that one of the potential causes of the disease might be bovine spongiform encephalopathy (BSE) or ‘mad cow disease’ due to prions (Houston and Andréoletti, 2019). The latter is named PrPSc and is considered to be a misfolded form of protein PrPC that can be replicated and transmitted among the same species and also to
other species.In this regard, it is fair to suspect that BSE could be transmitted to humans through the ingestion of diseased cattle meat. In humans, transmitted prions cause a disease that is called the new variant of Creutzfeldt–Jakob disease (vCJD) (Thomas, 2019). It is associated with developing neurological and psychological problems, mental deterioration, change in behavior, and reduced coordination. However, according to the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (2017), the average incubation period of this type of prion disease in humans is ten years, whereas, for cattle, it is two times less. Thus, there is a high risk that farmers already have vCJD but without any symptoms yet. For this reason, I was sent to the farm to collect the brain tissue sample of the recently
dead animals, and some of the supposedly affected farmers were invited to the research center. That was done in order to confirm or reject the original hypothesis concerning BSE and vCJD.Indeed, the laboratory results show that both the cattle and some farmers have isoforms of PrPC prion protein – PrPSc. As for the cattle, the brain tissue of the dead animals was collected as this method is the only one that can provide reliable results (U.S. Food & Drug Administration, 2020). On the other hand, Thomas (2019) maintains that in humans, the disease can be detected by the analysis of the lymphoid tissue. However, first, the patients were tested on electroencephalogram and MRI, and some small changes in their brains were detected. Therefore, the lymphoid tissue was analyzed
to get more certain results. In the laboratory, the first step included the conventional histopathology analysis of the brain and lymphoid tissues. Next, an immunohistochemistry test was conducted to identify whether the sample tissues have PrPSc prion protein. As a result, the laboratory tests fully approved the initial hypothesis.Both ‘mad cow disease’ and vCJD are relatively recently discovered diseases. The first case of BSE was registered in 1986 in the U.K., and the first case of vCJD was reported just several years later in the same country (Kim et al., 2016). The original cause of the BSE was found to be a meat-and-bone meal. For this reason, our investigation of the disease’s etymology started from the food that the cattle consume. The farm manager explained that they use
supplements from the same company in the U.K. as our farmers in Montana. Therefore, the primary source of the BSE and vCJD epidemic was identified.Unfortunately, there is no treatment developed to cure both BSE and vCJD. Usually, the sick animals die in a period of two weeks to several months. As for the affected farmers, they can live as long as 12 years after the first symptoms appear. In this regard, it is suggested that all the cattle on the farm be quarantined until all the animals and farmers are tested.
Active Political, Social, Cultural, and Economic EnvironmentIn order to understand the complexities of a country’s development and evaluate its prospects regarding its economic, social, and political well-being, a comprehensive analysis is typically needed. While the presence of external factors is also of essential significance, the resources available to state residents, as well as capacities that the state in question possess, play a nonetheless essential part in promoting further economic and sociocultural development. For Australia, the described factors have been quite positive over the past couple of decades, allowing the state to evolve and promote the sustainable use of its economic resources and other types of assets.Political Stability and Instability StructureWhen evaluating the factors that must have contributed to the current rates of political stability within Australia, one should
mention the fact that it has not been significantly affected by the British colonialism. Due to the geographic location that complicated the process of colonialism, Australia had been isolated from the impact of the British rule for a while, which helped the state to develop its agency and start political changes within it s framework based on the unique factors attributed to its setting. Moreover, once getting rid of the British rule, Australia managed to establish relationships with other states on equal footing, which advanced its political performance to a significant extent. As a result, the current structure of political stability within Australia is quite resilient and strong, allowing the state to be flexible in its political interactions with foreign countries.At the same time, the current situation observed
within the political stance of Australia may come into question in the nearest future. Due to the rapidly changing dynamics of international relationships, Australia may need to revisit some of its current political standards and approaches to building economic and political relationships. Namely, the Australian government, as well as organizations involved in international trade, may introduce more accurate tools for political and financial forecasting. As Black explains,Given the volatility of international relations, of environmental developments such as population growth, resource availability, global temperature change, and pandemics, and of other aspects of the future, such discussion may appear very problematic. 1Thus, Australia will need to include precise tools for geopolitical analysis so that it could forecast; likely changes in the global economic setting and examine the available routes. For
instance, the increase in China’s political and economic influence in the global setting is to be taken into consideration. Namely, Friedman explains that the recent change observed in the Chinese economic setting indicates that China is likely to become a strong economic partner for Australia in the future:China has also emerged as a major industrial power in the last generation, with growth surpassing that of any other major economy in the world, although its economy is still far smaller than that of Japan or the United States. 2Similarly, other Asian and South Asian countries that have been advancing in their economic and technological development represent a rather lucrative opportunity for Australia, which is why the state authorities need to encourage private and public sector to build connections with
the specified states as well. At the same time, relationships must be maintained with European and the U.S. Although the present-day setting affected heavily by the coronavirus pandemic still represents a range of challenges, Australia has a plethora of opportunities to succeed.Access to Strategic Human, Natural, and Economic Skill and ResourcesAdditionally, Australia has quite broad access to human, natural, and economic resources. Due to the rapid development within the Australian market, local businesses have been enjoying quite a range of opportunities. Moreover, since Australia has been a very popular tourist destination, it has gained quite a range of economic resources. 3Access to Allies and EnemiesExamining the problems in the relationships between Australia and other countries, particularly, Europe and the U.S. will lead to the discovery that Australia has
remarkably few political opponents. Granted that there is a plethora of economic rivals in the global market for Australia, the range of openly antagonistic relationships between Australia and other countries is surprisingly small. Indeed, considering the present political environment closely will show that Australia has no political opponents. The lack of conflicts with other state scan be ascribed to Australia’s geopolitical situation; namely, having been isolated form other states for quite a while due to its geographic location, Australia has not developed any antagonistic interactions with other countries. Therefore, Australia has virtually no enemies. However, even if it had, the immediate access to them would be fairly limited due to the problem of geographic location mentioned above.In turn, the range of positive interactions that Australia has been enjoying
in the global economic and political settings have been quite vast. With the rise in globalization and the development of opportunities for fast transfer of products and information globally, Australia has been participating in the global trade successfully. 4 Currently, Australia has well-established partnership-based trade relationships with the U.S., UK, South Korea, Japan, and China. Moreover, Australian has been participating in free-trade relationships with the U.S. and New Zealand, which has allowed it to expand its economic development extensively and create long and effective supply chains globally. Overall, Australia’s current ratio of enemies and allies in regard to its economic and political stance is beyond positive.Supply Chains and Trade RoutesAs emphasized above, Australia has well-developed supply chains due to its positive economic interactions with other states. To evaluate
the efficacy and extent of development within Australia’s supply chains, one should consider the changes in the Australian GDP observed lately. According to the 2020 report, “In the most recent fiscal year, Australia’s exports amounted to $419 billion and its imports amounted to $395 billion, the equivalent of 22 and 21 per cent of total GDP respectively” (Ball, 2020, para. 4). Since the specified number exceeds the one observed the year prior in the Australian economic setting, the general trend within the Australian economic environment can be described as positive. 5Similarly, with the increase in t opportunities for long-term transportation, Australia has expanded its trade routes, connoting to Asia, Europe, and the U.S. The specified change has made it possible for Australia to explore every single possibility for
Executive SummaryBottega Veneta is a worldwide famous brand, but its performance might need a boost owing to the company’s recent growth needs. Bottega’s options include product diversification and the production of a new line of items. The company’s brand must be reinvented by emphasizing the significance of quality in daily things and minimizing the level of luxury associated with its products. Bottega will be capable to establish a novel production line by developing the brand impression in a way that relates it to the firm’s principal identity.IntroductionTransitioning from a premium company to one that sells things for daily usage is practically impossible. Bottega Veneta, on the other hand, will identify whether all aspects of the corporate communications process are in harmony (Weingerl and Javoršek, 2018). Assuring customers that
their daily routines are comfortable while adding a touch of luxury, Bottega will be able to develop an entirely new and extraordinarily profitable brand.Audit of the BrandPen Portrait and Analysis of CompetitorsBottega Veneta brands are primarily focused on attracting feminine as well as macho women, as seen by the photographs. The women here are smart and stylish, live in the contemporary world, are self-assured, and sophisticated. Given that Bottega’s women’s fashion trends are mostly irrelevant, the photographs depict ladies who have their own perspective and discern what is best and more importantly, what garments fit them best. Indeed, these women appreciate comfort above everything else and are willing to spend their money on high-end Bottega brand items. Bottega’s consumers prioritize comfort above innovation, but not rejecting the latter.
Additionally, the target population is likely to live in the fast lane because of their proclivity for digital technologies.Digital Pen PortraitFigure 1: Digital Pen Portrait.Analysis of Digital Competitors (POPs and PODs)PODs will include user comfort, since Gucci, Burberry, and Loewe all market luxury in a similar manner as Bottega, but do not focus on daily things and their use (Achim, 2019). In other words, the items are distinguished by superior materials and timeless designs, which sets them apart from the competitors. Bottega’s majority of items are premium priced because to their exquisite brands and high-quality textiles (Zhang and Zhao, 2019). High quality and efficacy are the primary POPs, which Bottega will need to thoroughly examine to guarantee that the standards established satisfy those used by other firms in
the industry.Brand InventoryHeritage and History of the BrandSince 1966, Bottega Veneta has been recognized as a luxury goods and designer clothing company. The firm, based in Italy, has amassed considerable influence in the premium design sector. By concentrating on establishing the brand that will serve as the foundation for a fresh and distinctive brand identity, one may successfully capture the luxury daily items market.Brand DNAThe brand DNA will enable the business to portray itself as innovative while concentrating on quality and consumer comfort. As a result, the DNA will be designed with the goal of fostering a pleasant existence. The brand’s objective will be to ease everyday routines while also adding excitement and satisfaction. Integrity, customer attention, accountability, and excellent quality will serve as the cornerstone for the
brand DNA’s growth (see Fig. 2). The proposed technique, based on the Onion Model, will aid in tracing the transition from the existing brand to the one set to emerge.Brand PersonalityTo explain the personality of the brand that will be developed, the Aaker Model will be required. By using Aaker’s five personality characteristics, one may determine that the brand to be established is truthful, highly competent, and fairly sophisticated (Kakitek, 2018). Additionally, the presence of luxurious components may provide a touch of excitement. The harshness of the items will be kept to a minimum in order to preserve their sophistication (see Fig. 3).Figure 3: Aaker Model for Brand PersonalityюBrand IdentificationThe brand’s identity will be developed utilizing Kapferer’s method. As seen in Figure 4, it is critical to establish
an intercultural relationship between the sender and receiver (Cuofano, n.d.). In the instance of Bottega, a feedback system will be used to build a relationship between the consumer and the firm. The data collected via surveys and questionnaires will be used to include culturally relevant components into brand goods and to adjust them to the unique demands of individual customers.Figure 4: Kapferer’s method analysis (Cuofano, n.d.)юEquity in a brandTo boost Bottega’s brand equity, especially with its new range of items, one must examine Keller’s Brand Equity Model (see Fig. 5). According to the approach, brand identity should be built around how consumers and the business interact; beginning with the organization’s basic values and the viewpoint, it brings to company-customer communication. Thus, Bottega’s new range of goods’ brand equity
should be organized on the use of high quality, inventive design to infuse moments of luxury into their customers’ daily lives.Figure 5: Keller’s brand equity model (Keller’s brand equity model: building a powerful brand, 2021).Architecture of the BrandBottega’s contemporary architecture may be regarded as a branded home, in whom all goods are housed under the Bottega primary brand. However, when a new brand is created that incorporates daily; the need to rethink the present branding strategy may arise. In order to reach their target audience, the firm will need to develop a house of brands.Brand LeveragingBottega will heavily on the strength of its present brand in the early phases of advertising its new items. As a result, the new brand must contain features of the existing one, including
the title and potentially the typeface. However, the company’s corporate philosophy, which values individualism and confidence, may be included into the design of the innovative product. Because of their high quality and end outcome, Bottega will strive to promote their emerging brand as dependable.Brand PositioningWhile the current Bottega brand in the desired corporate environment is largely rooted in luxury, the successor one must be grounded on practicality and presented as useful in everyday life. Luxury elements, such as unique architecture and materials used in the new products, will be offered as bonus items, helping to raise brand recognition (Brunetti, Confente, and Kaufmann, 2019). Like Bottega Veneta, the new brand should focus on artisanship and everyday convenience, if not luxury.Strategy for BrandingAIDA. To generate public attention in the brand,
the AIDA model will be required (Prathapan, et al., 2018). Bottega will seek to enlighten the community about its new venture, generate curiosity in the new everyday product brand, and encourage target shoppers to acquire them. Advertising and a webpage will be created, where advertisements will emphasize luxury and comfort to entice buyers with the help of a customer loyalty program to encourage the exercise.RACE . Additionally, the RACE (Reach, Act, Convert, Engage) Model must be used to advertise the items and pique the audience’s interest. To be more precise, a new communication channel comprised of ICT and contemporary media will be developed in order to reach out to consumers. To promote action (“Act”), the website will have interactive components that allow buyers to tailor their experience. The
conversion process will begin after Bottega has amassed a following of committed fans via discounts, gift certificates, and similar methods. Finally, the engagement step will include listening to customer input and tailoring items to their specific requirements.Licensing/IPBottega will retain ownership of the intellectual property and goods, since the new brand will be released under its name. Thus, Bottega will be given intellectual property rights not for the items themselves, but for the idea underlying them, namely the incorporation of comfort and a touch of elegance into everyday routines. Due to the incorporation of the company’s present logo into the mark to be produced for the aforementioned items; it will be important to acknowledge Bottega’s property rights as the owner of the aforementioned intellectual property.Elements of a BrandBottega’s current
brand identity is composed of various themes, incorporating opulence and beautiful austerity. To sum up what luxury is and how it can be expressed via accessories and garments, Bottega Veneta’s slogan is “When your initials are sufficient.” (‘Bottega Veneta’ 2019). The logo, printing, symbols, packaging, and colors are all presented as brand aspects.Logotype for Brand IdentityThe present brand identification logo is fairly simple and, as a result, one-of-a-kind. As a consequence, the enterprise’s redesigned trade logo must be beautiful and stylized. The logo must keep the shape of the company’s letters printed in a sans serif typeface for this reason. The defined method will emphasize the company’s integrity while maintaining a strong commitment to its principles and philosophy.Color of the LogoCustomers will immediately distinguish Bottega’s items due to
the usage of color-coding. It will be prudent to utilize colors that enable instant differentiation of items; hence, a brand’s category will be distinguished by divergent colors like red, blue, yellow, green, or any other shade that helps the product stand out.Icons and PhotographsTo be immediately distinct from the logo, the brand icons will need to be far less detailed than the logo. However, simplifying the current brand is more challenging given that it is reflected by the company’s name. Although the purposeful choice of sans serif fonts simplifies the effort, there are still significant barriers to overcome. To do this, the logo must be reduced to the first two letters (BV) in a classic sans serif typeface and the allotted color.PackagingPackaging shall be biodegradable, recyclable, reusable, non-toxic,
and skin – friendly. Bottega must position itself as an eco-friendly company, which includes sensitive packaging. Each produced item will be delivered in three, six, or twelve-packs to conserve resources.Branding StrategiesThe New Brand Strategy’s Five ObjectivesTo Increase Brand AwarenessThis increases market share and establishes Bottega as an industry leader.To enlarge our social communitiesThis goal may be accomplished by using a variety of social media platforms and tactics to provide content that expands our social network communities and viewers.To bolster customer engagement techniques in order to boost customer loyaltyThe aim here will be to recruit reputable or prominent members of the target audience to serve as brand ambassadors.To Keep a Close Eye on Customer FeedbackIt is critical for recording customer sentiments on relevant items that serve as a barometer
of satisfaction and progress.To convert social media followers into qualified leads and new businessBrand content generates social media followers and dialogues that result in new clients. The amount of leads generated through social media platforms is a key performance indicator in this case.RecommendationsTo acclimatize Bottega to the internet age, social media should be utilized to market new products to clients. Additionally, an application must be built to assist prospective purchasers in navigating the corporation’s manufacturing process more effectively (Dwivedi et al., 2021). The investigation revealed that Bottega’s internet ads and visibility are still lacking, despite the fact that the digital revolution has taken over. To remain current and preserve its leadership position, the business should use other social media channels in conjunction with its website possibilities.Customer Engagement in
the Digital AgeBottega’s digital consumer profile is highly sophisticated. Now, it includes a regard for workmanship, brand loyalty, and customization choices. The emphasis on personalization is anticipated to rise in the digital environment (Shukla and Nigam, 2018). As a result, the potential to enjoy items designed exclusively for them must be leveraged to entice consumers. The corporation will need to explore many variations of each item, such as tote bags and umbrellas with distinctive designs.Execution of the Brand10 Instagram Messages 1.

A thorough awareness of the operational environment and target audience enables the development of appropriate goals and the adjustment of business strategies. In the instance of the Bottega fashion brand, using digital technology, particularly social media platforms, in conjunction with a solid market positioning boosts brand recognition among consumers.
The import of raw materials and resources for the production of goods is of particular value. However, the procedure for importing products from one country to another may often have some disadvantages. Hence, in some cases, there is a need for a large duty on the product, which reduces its profitability for the organization. This work aims to consider two strategies for reducing this financial indicator for companies.The first strategy that can be applied to reduce the cost of import duties on resources is to optimize documentation. Hence, the organization must be sure of the validity of the documents (Planitzer, 2020; Voudouris & Plomaritou, 2020). Incorrect and incomplete filling of the boom associated with the transportation of goods or raw materials from abroad may result in an increase
Ethics shape the state of many businesses and display the owners’ intentions towards bettering the consumers’ lives. Ethical considerations are rules that the company should adhere to while making significant decisions concerning their customers and creditors (Schmitz & Leoni, 2019). The integrity of Key West Stores is an ethical consideration since it affects the business’s operations. Accountant does not display integrity in their job and place themselves at risk since the creditors are offended. It is also unfair when the business transfers the blame to the mailroom and the post office, knowing they are liable for the delay in delivery of the checks. It is unethical for Key West Stores to hold the bills and lie to their creditors to avoid penalties.The stakeholders affected negatively by the conspiracy
are the creditors, the mailroom, and the post office. Whereas the creditors lose money by paying more interest, the mailroom and the post office blame the delays in the checks. The creditors cannot complain since they are dependent on the business and thus pay for the excessively demanded money by Key West Stores. Conversely, the firm earns from the perfected delays hence the only party that benefits. Tiffany Lyons is another party that may be a victim of the activities. It will derail her emotions if she is not okay with conducting the lies.Tiffany should not continue with the immoral practices started by Jay because they place her at risk of losing her trustworthiness in the organization. The business should give her a position to conduct her duty
without oppression. It is Tiffany’s right to protect her reputation in the industry by opposing behaviors that put her at risk of losing her job. If she continues perpetrating the delays, her integrity becomes questionable, and she does not fit to stand for the position of assistant accountant. Jay has a chance to refuse to continue the delays if she is willing to protect her future career as an accountant. It is against the Financial Accounting Standards to delay accounting information since it affects decision-making by the users of accounting information. If the employer denies her a chance in the office due to her integrity levels, Tiffany may opt to leave the job and protect her image as a professional accountant.The American Institute of Certified Public Accountants (AICPA)
The story of medical research has been rather unkind to women, often neglecting the differences of the female anatomy and failing to acknowledge female-specific issues, centering on male ones. However, even when healthcare research does prioritize women, the manner in which it does so often remains quite deplorable, as the case of Henrietta Lacks demonstrates. Representing a case of blatant abuse of women’s rights, as well as unmasked racism and neglect for patient’s dignity, the case of Henrietta Lacks stirred the global community, yet it was only Rebecca Skloot who did Lacks’ narrative justice. By pinpointing the nature of the problem, specifically, outlining racism and disregard for the integrity of women’s bodily autonomy, Skloot condemns the abuse that Lacks suffered, therefore, paving the way to new, fair and
unbiased, medical research.What makes Skloot’s work remarkable is the focus of the narrative. Specifically, Skloot does not diminish the significance and effect of the discovery that researchers made. Indeed, the discovery of HeLa cells can be seen as a massive breakthrough in addressing the issues of social, academic, and racial injustice observed in the case under analysis. Instead, Skloot appeals to the principles of research participants’ autonomy and the fundamental rights of an individual, particularly, the right to bodily integrity: “All I remember is that she had this disease, and right after she died they called me in the office wanting to get my permission to take a sample of some kind. I decided not to let them” (Skloot). Thus, the plight of the narrator becomes especially reasonable
and easy to understand.Moreover, the sociocultural issues that can be seen as prerequisites to the case have been discussed profusely and with due insight in the narrative. Specifically, Skloot outlines the role of racism in the choices that researchers made when deciding to conceal the nature of the medical process to which Lacks was subjected. Namely, Skloot states that African American women, in general, have been silenced for quite long: “But one member of the family remained voiceless: Henrietta’s daughter, Deborah” (Skloot). The presence of racial injustice makes Lacks’ plight particularly sympathetic and her case especially deplorable. Namely, Skloot explains quite expressively that, by denying Lacks her right to opt for participating in the experiment and donating her cells for the sake of the further promotion of cancer
to the victims of systemic injustice, particularly, racism, Skloot creates the narrative that elicits deep sympathy for Lacks and at the same time promotes the importance of combatting racism. Namely, the story focuses on the need to recognize the humanity of oppressed groups, especially African American women, who have been subjected to a variety of injustices, the denial of their dignity and autonomy being one of the most egregious examples.
There are numerous US criminal cases that raise the question of trying juvenile offenders in adult courts. Currently, almost in half of the states in the country, juveniles can be prosecuted and tried in adult courts. Pennsylvania is one such state, as there is no lower limit for the age someone can be charged as an adult with homicide. The 2009 case involving a double murder illustrates the numerous issues that take place in all similar cases.In February 2009, state police found 26-year-old Kenzie Houk, who was eight months pregnant, in her bed with a bullet through her head. Jordan Brown, the son of the victim’s fiancé, is one of the youngest suspects in the country to be charged with murder. According to Heide (2021), juvenile murder arrests
Moreover, a dedicated analysis is needed to realize the effectiveness of the already existing programs and institutions aimed at reducing the risks of violent crime among juveniles. Furthermore, the issue of recidivism should be widely discussed, as preventing it has always been considered one of the primary goals of the institutions that work with juvenile criminals. A large number of evidence-based practices are to be considered when providing the best solutions that can help develop a uniform approach to the issue in all states.
Directed by the American film producer and director Martin Scorsese, The Irishman is a 2019 film that tells the story of the typical operations and life of members of gang families and groups in the mid-20th century. The film is based on Charles Brandt’s 2004 novel I Hear You Paint Houses . Specifically, the film is based on the memories of Frank Sheeran, an elderly Irish-American man who served in the Second World War before becoming a hitman for the Mafia groups in America. Sheeran, when in a nursing home, recounts the events during his time as a hitman in the 1950s and thereafter. From his recounts, the film shows the events that surrounded the operations, relationships, and lives of the gang families during the period. Throughout the
film, the director uses various cinematic approaches to tell the story and create meaning. Signs are intensively used in the film to create meaning in various scenes and scenarios. In the same way, the film portrays the application of the cinematic approach, with composition, camera, costumes, effects, hair and makeup, set design, and color used to tell the story from Sheeran’s recounts.Signs are important means of conveying meaning in various aspects of human life and relationships. As the theory of semiotics states, films use signs to signify or covey meanings through the various things that humans typically employ. Words, body language, gestures, pictures, letters, and visual illustrations are some of the various methods that humans use to convey messages. Combinations of these signs help the filmmakers effectively convey
meanings and messages.Like most modern films, The Irishman demonstrates the use of these signs in addition to codes and conventions to convey meaning in the same way that words and languages are used to construct meaning in communication. At the petrol station scene where Sheeran first meets Russel Bufalino, there are some signs that he is not meeting a common businessman but a shrewd, cunning, and dangerous individual. Bufalino’s body language, when explaining the mechanical problem involving Sheeran’s car, is suggestive of a member of the Mafia, but Sheeran cannot notice at this time. Here, Bufalino tells Sheeran, “you are back in business, kid” ( The Irishman ), yet Sheeran is around 56 years and almost the same age as Bufalino. These words, when analyzed from an in-depth
perspective, are a sign that Bufalino is a boss somewhere and leads an influential group. In addition, the quick way in which Bufalino finds an answer to the mechanical problem in Sheeran’s truck is a sign suggesting his shrewdness and ability to lead, which are seen later in the film.Similarly, in the Friendly Lounge scenario when Sheeran meets Skinny Razor Dutillio, some signs signify the other type of business that the group operates. Sheeran is delivering meat to the hotel that is owned by Dutillio. During their meeting, Skinny Razor’s body language signifies that he is a tough guy not just in business but probably in other aspects of life. For instance, he changes his face and looks straight into Sheeran’s eyes when a delivery man tells him,
“I supply steak… the best steak” ( The Irishman ). As if to mean something different, Skinny Razor looks directly into Sheeran’s eyes and says, “you do?” ( The Irishman ) and then looks at the others and laughs a little as if he is not interested in the business. Rather than discussing the business, Skinny Razor tells Sheeran that they will talk later. All these words and body language suggest that he is not interested in the meat business, but probably another different form of venture. Furthermore, there is a background piece of music that is playing during the meeting. When Sheeran is leaving the Friendly Lounge, some background music plays with the words, “you better go back to your used-to-be place” ( The Irishman ). These
words signify the possibility that the meeting will take Sheeran to another kind of life that is not good.In addition, in the same scene, a flashback shows Dutillio back in 1945. Here, the audience is introduced to the kind of violence that will probably follow and dominate the story. A sign of a razor blade used to mercilessly cut the neck of a chicken is quite frightening. Dutillio uses a straight razor to cut the chicken’s neck and immediately blood splashes into his face. The sadist Dutillio gives a satisfied look on his blood-spattered face, showing signs of ruthlessness. The blood also spatters into the walls and the workers continue their work as usual. These aspects are used as signs to signify the kind of people that Sheeran
will be dealing with and their characters. Dutillio is a sadist and violent individual who is ready to kill humans as a hitman on hire. The splattered blood on the wall signifies the meaning of the euphemism “painting houses”, which is used in the film to mean the work of hitmen killing people on hire.During the second meeting, again in the Friendly Lounge, the film director uses additional signs to show that the two men have met before and have even conducted some business together. Unlike the first meeting, the second meeting is relatively relaxed and both Sheeran and Dutillio demonstrate body languages that signify their friendship. Both men are seated at the table eating steaks, which signifies that they have even done some business together. It is
a sign that Sheeran has joined the group and is part of the dealings common with the Mafia in the black market. The audience comes to learn later that Sheeran was stealing meat from his employer to supply it to Dutillio and other members of the gang at a lower price, allowing them to increase their profitability.Apart from the use of signs, the film director also uses cinematic approaches to make meaning. Costumes, when used in films, are important ways of creating meanings and themes. In The Irishman , different costumes are used for different scenarios to create various meanings. In the introduction part of the film, Sheeran is wearing a leather jacket, jeans, and a loose hat. He appears casual, less presentable, and more of a low-class
individual. It also appears that he wears the same kind of clothes during the different appearances- first at the petrol station and later at the Friends Lounge. The director uses this approach to portray Sheeran as an old and poor person who is striving to meet his daily needs. It also suggests that he is ready to take additional jobs as long as he increases his income. He appears in white aprons only when he is transferring steaks of meat from his van to the customer’s premises.On the contrary, the members of the Mafia are well dressed, clean, and well-kept. Their leaders like Dutillio, Bufallio, Jimmy Hoffa, and Angelo Bruno are all in black, blue, or dark suits, with colored ties. In most scenarios, they are in these
costumes even when participating in parties in bars and lounges. This suggests that they are members of an organized group that has codes of conduct or specific behaviors that each must follow and which define the culture of the setting.It is also imperative to understand how the filmmakers used the costumes approach to portray the changing times in the story. As the film continues, the audience realizes that there are multiple scenarios spanning over decades, given that the story is told in a flashback. In this case, characters change with time, beginning in the late 1940s and ending in the late 20th century. In the 1940s and 1950s scenarios, the characters are wearing clothes that reflect their times. For example, most of the characters living in the 1940s
and 1950s, as well as early 1960s, are depicted with hats and coats. However, as time moves, the costumes change significantly to reflect the popular designs of their times. In the 1960s and 1970s, the characters wearing less formal clothing and hats are not common, as an example. Women are portrayed in long dresses during these periods but as time goes on, most women’s clothes change to shorter skirts that are tight to portray the dynamism in the clothing culture of the time.The use and manipulation of the camera is another important cinematic approach that filmmakers use to achieve meaning and convey themes. In this film, camera-specific aspects were applied in different scenarios to achieve the objective. Specifically, camera movement makes a large part of the film aesthetic.
In many scenarios, the cameras remain fixed to ensure that they focus on the object, person, or point of interest. The cameraman composes each shot for the most visual impact. It is worth noting that the entire story is told in flashbacks based on Sheeran’s memories. The stories revolve around the unknown, underworld figures that occurred in history, including pervasive crime, the union movement, and assassinations of people, including the president. Achieving this objective required the camera to be changed each time to ensure that the shot is finessed for maximum impact. In addition, the camera soars over the scenes, taking everything, before it sweeps down into a single shot of the person or aspect of interest. It appears that such technologies or utilities and techno cranes and
cranes were used to achieve this objective and add interest in some long scenes. The idea is to convey the message being explained while also taking in the lit period and luxuriously dressed locations.The film also makes use of set design as a cinematic approach to create meaning and convey important messages. In this case, the filmmaker creates specific physical spaces for certain actions to reflect the scene of interest. Sceneries, furniture, the overall look of the stage, props, and appearance are well designed to reflect the specific time in history. For example, during the initial meeting between Sheeran and Russel Bufalino, the film shows the typical petrol station scenes of the 1950s. The gas pumps are manual and do not have automatic meters. In addition, the vehicles
are the old models of the time. Sheeran’s truck is a small manual lorry that can be ignited by simply connecting wires on the plugs near the engine rather than using an ignition key. In the background, one can see old model saloon cars packed or passing, some bearing the manufacturer’s old logos such as that of Chevrolet. In the same way, the steak shop scenario is designed to reflect the common views of the time. For example, there is no electronic money and all transactions are in cash. In addition, papers are signed with seals as the official stamp, which reflects the common methods of conducting business in the 1940s.Based on this analysis, it is evident that the filmmakers in The Irishman used multiple cinematic approaches to
a story that spans decades. The filmmaker’s use of signs is evident throughout the story, given that some themes and meanings are hidden but clues are given through signs. In addition, the film makes use of cinematographic approaches to reflect the different times the story depicts. Scenes are designed to reflect the common things one would expect to find in a real-life scenario during a specific period. Achieving this objective required the film developers to design costumes common during each period. In addition, the scenes are designed in such a way that they make the viewer feel connected with the specific time in history. As time changes, the filmmaker changes the design for the scenes and costumes to reflect the common culture of each specific historical period.
IntroductionDeveloping leadership qualities is helpful for any person, but not everyone is successful in this matter. Most executives have achieved heights not only through luck, connections, or natural talent – most of their achievements are the result of hard work. I have to evaluate myself as a leader in this work, backing up my opinion with an outside perspective and well-known approaches. It is important to note how the leader approaches the issue of evaluating himself, with the same responsibility he will treat the evaluation of his employees. Self-awareness and critical thinking are essential skills of any leader, so how much my own assessment matches up with the feedback from other people is also an important indicator.EvaluationSelf-EvaluationFor self-assessment, I used questionnaires that have already proven themselves in this
area. These include the Emotional and Social Competence Questionnaire (ESCI), which reflects aspects of emotional intelligence and the ability to see your strengths (Park & Faerman, 2019). Before the test, I noted to myself my strengths in communicating with people: adaptability, critical thinking, self-control, and inspiration of the interlocutor. The difficulty confirmed my high achievement in communication skills. Flexibility, coupled with constant control, makes it easy to approach any person while keeping the main goals and objectives to yourself. This ability does not allow me to leave the intended topic in dialogue or negotiations until a compromise or consensus is reached. In addition, I always try to support the interlocutor, even if he comes to me with bad news. A person has the right to make mistakes, and
you need to be able to admit them. My strong point is that I can give a person a push at the moment when they are depressed.The second questionnaire with which I made a self-assessment is the assessment of personal value. If the first questionnaire showed my natural communication abilities, then the second questionnaire indicates what is behind my behavior (Smikle, 2019). There are three main styles of leadership: authoritarian, participatory, and delegative (Akpoviroro et al., 2018). My style, according to the test results, is focused on accessibility, which corresponds to participatory leadership. This style requires high levels of emotional intelligence, but it also guarantees the highest productivity among all types in the workplace (Akpoviroro et al., 2018). My power is not an obstacle or a source of
fear for employees – it is just a tool to reveal their strengths. The test results showed that flexibility is closely related to creative thinking and creativity. Finding opportunities for your development allows you to demonstrate a vitality that energizes other people.FeedbackI received feedback from two of my former colleagues and family members. Having brought the data to statistics, I got that people note sympathy and the ability to give strength even in the most challenging situation. This fact is a consequence of flexibility and adaptability against the background of high levels of emotional intelligence. However, some of those taking part in the survey fear that I am a talented manipulator. Empathy and inspiration can direct a person towards their own goals and desires. This fear is very
genuine, and thanks to this test, I understood in which direction I need to work on myself. The tendency to manipulate is a consequence of my commitment to control. Constantly keeping an eye on the pulse, as indicated in the test of the value questionnaire, means something not to trust or something to be afraid of.Growth OpportunitiesTo overcome this character trait, I also asked colleagues and family questions. I assumed that the openness and availability of my intentions and goals to other employees would remove suspicions of manipulation. However, the feedback showed that I should verbally voice my dreams and demonstrate fairness in my actions. This fact is consistent with the transformational leadership model, which partly contradicts individualism, flexibility, and empathy (Eliyana & Ma’arif, 2019). However, transformational leadership
The country under review is Mexico the way it was portrayed by its famous citizen – Mexican poet and writer Octavio Paz. The author presents his perspective on Mexican lifestyle and culture in his influential essay The Labyrinth of Solitude . This analysis would focus on the essay’s Chapter 3 dedicated to fiestas in general and the Day of the Dead in particular, which reflect many national traits of Mexicans.Fiesta or celebration is an extremely important cultural concept for Mexicans. According to Paz (1961), their “calendar is crowded with fiestas” (p.47). One may argue that every culture has holidays, and there is nothing special about Mexicans also having such. However, Paz identifies several peculiarities in how his compatriots celebrate and perceive their festivities compared to citizens of other
countries. The writer also comments on the specific reasons for Mexicans’ passion for exuberant ceremonies and festive occasions.Life experience often influences artists’ works, and Paz was not an exception. His family had suffered a lot during Mexican Civil War and was quite poor (Brittanica). However, Paz had access to his grandfather’s big library, where he learned a lot and later managed to get an education and started publishing his poems (Brittanica). What is important to note is that Paz visited and worked in several countries, including Spain, France, and the US. It allowed him to look at his homeland both from inside as its citizen and from outside as a person, who had contacts with foreigners, witnessed other lifestyles, and learned about different outlooks. One can learn more
about something when one has alternatives to compare it to. The same goes for the culture: one cannot fully appreciate the good things about one’s culture and be critical of bad ones if one knows nothing about others. Therefore, Paz’s view on Mexican culture is so precise and valuable.In Chapter 3 of The Labyrinth of Solitude , Paz explains Mexicans’ love for exuberant rituals, ceremonies, and festive activities. Moreover, he comments on several paradoxes related to Mexican attitudes towards holidays that often puzzle the foreigners. For instance, The Labyrinth of Solitude answers why Mexico wastes so much money on seemingly meaningless and useless celebrations. Another paradox explained by Paz is the weirdly festive and cheerful manner Mexicans celebrate the Day of the Dead.Paz explains the essence and the
peculiarities of Mexican fiestas through several cultural concepts. The first one is the appreciation of the present moment. Paz (1961) notes that during celebrations, “time comes to a full stop” and returns to its original form: “the present, in which past and future are reconciled” (pp. 47-48). Fiestas allow Mexicans to enjoy and appreciate what they already have instead of worrying about tomorrow beyond our reach (Paz, 1961). It might sound unpractical, as one should not completely abandon all thoughts and plans concerning the future or valuable memories from the past. However, what one can learn from such an attitude towards time is that excessive worries about the past or the future make people miss important life moments and forget about actually enjoying their life.Another important observation Paz
makes in this chapter is that fiestas might be the way for Mexicans to escape solitude. The author notes that Mexican celebrations always involve large masses of people. In Paris or New York, one may see big gatherings as well, but, as Paz (1961) points out, “the absence of people, in the sense of a people, is remarkable” there (p.48). Unlike such gatherings, where people would still stand in small groups and might be lonely even surrounded by a crowd, Mexican fiestas “form a living community” (Paz, 1961, p.48). Therefore, it is impossible to feel lonely on such occasions.Mexican fiestas are not only crowded but also full of noise, energy, and even violence. Paz (1961) explains it as a need for Mexicans to get free from pent-up emotions:
both positive and negative. Therefore, everything seems to be amplified during fiestas: “the silent Mexican whistles, shouts, sings, shoots off fireworks, discharges his pistol into the air” (Paz, 1961, p.49). Paz (1961) adds that by doing all of this, the Mexican “discharges his soul” (p.49). Although it is better to avoid the violent activities happening during fiestas, the overall way Mexicans release their pent-up feelings seems noteworthy.The amount of money Mexicans waste on celebration astonishes foreigners. Moreover, they are shocked when they witness the festive atmosphere during the holidays or rituals connected to death. Paz (1961) explains that both of these cultural patterns follow the same principle: “everything attracts its opposite” (p.50). Therefore, for Mexicans, squandering is a way of attracting money, and celebrating death is the way
A tort refers to omission or act that gives rise to harm/injury to another person and amounts to a wrong where a person who was wronged may recover damages (US Legal Inc., n.d.). In this case, the tort that Tom incurred was being hit by a baseball that knocked him out. He was then taken to the hospital as a result of the hit. Another tort was the fact that he lost his possessions when another fan stole his mobile phone and wallet. Finally, the last tort is food poising, but only if Tom can prove that it is because of the food poisoning that he had to stay home for two weeks without working.For the first injury the stadium is liable because we are not told that
Hansberry, Lorraine. A Raisin in the Sun. New York, Vintage, 2004.The Youngers, an African American family, living in Chicago in the 1950s, are the subject of A Raisin in the Sun. When the family is given $10,000 in life insurance money, each member of the family has different ideas about how to spend it. Beneatha wants to go to medical school with the money, but Walter’s older brother wants to build an alcohol store. After their mother, Lena, puts a down payment on a new home, the remaining funds are given to Walter, who is instructed to save up a considerable sum for his sister’s medical school tuition. Against his mother’s desires, he invests the entire sum in his liquor store. The family is looking forward to receiving
the insurance payout, which has the potential to turn their long-awaited hopes into reality. However, the Younger family members have opposing ideas and dreams about how best to spend the money, causing friction.Sexton, Anne. “Wanting to Die.” Poetry Foundation, 1981, Web.“Wanting to Die” is a free verse poem with thirty-three lines divided into eleven tercets (three-line stanzas). This poem has been referred to as one of Anne Sexton’s literary suicide notes since it is written in the first person and is presented in a conversational style. With a person who has asked her about suicide, the author addresses the reasons for suicide and the attraction with it in this poetry. The poem opens with a discussion between the author and an unknown interrogator. Sexton captures the spirit of
confessional poetry in this poem, as she honestly exposes her feelings about the connection with death and her ongoing fight with suicide. Though this poem appears to be about death and suicide at first glance, there are multiple examples in it that may be related to drug addiction and the objectives of the drug user. This poem’s tone is generally luridly sad since it creates meticulously black and morbid imagery. Through precise personifications of suicide and death, it immerses the reader in the psyche of the suicidal thought.Sexton, Anne. “Her Kind” Poetry Foundation, 1981, Web.The speaker of “Her Kind” takes on a number of identities that defy stereotypes of femininity, rejecting society’s expectations that women be attractive, nurturing, and obedient in the process. According to the author, being
a woman who chooses independence over dependency, self-reliance over familial connections, and death over acquiescence means being viewed as a dangerous outlier—a witch who must be excommunicated. Rather than isolating the woman, this independence provides her with a powerful sense of solidarity with other non-traditional women: she is not alone but one of a kind. The speaker analyzes the various ways patriarchy stuffs women into small boxes in each line of the poem—boxes that the speaker refuses to be bound in. The poem “Her Kind” by Anne Sexton has a calm tone, with no clear-cut scenes or conversation but a strong sense of story, emotion, and imagery. It seems to be a peculiar, wistful reminiscence of a lady who has long since died, bizarre as that may be.
Despite this, the narrator’s vibrancy, which directly contrasts the poem’s destiny, contributes to the work’s infusion of a weird appeal.Plath, Sylvia. “Daddy.” Poets.Org , Harper and Row, 1962, Web.With short allusions to Sylvia Plath’s marriage to British poet Ted Hughes, this poem reveals autobiographical parts of her connection with Professor Otto Plath, who died when she was just eight years old. Like the previous works, this poem deals with mental health, suicide, and the battle between life and death. This deeply complicated poem has allusions to Nazis and Jews, vampires, and the devil. It is worth mentioning that this poem is part break-up letter to her father, part confessional diary entry to herself. “Daddy” is an attempt to bring the intimate and mystical together. It is frightening, like
pain is explored throughout the poem, which continuously returns to the idea of death by fire and the speaker’s power to rise from her own ashes. The poem alludes to the tortured speaker’s many suicide attempts. It also emphasizes the role of tyranny and power in one’s life. The poem also conveys the concepts of perseverance and resurrection. The key themes of this poem are death, sadness, agony, and power. The speaker recounts her unsuccessful suicide attempts and explains why she is irritated.
Article SummaryThe article “ Anopheles stephensi Mosquitoes as Vectors of Plasmodium vivax and P. falciparum, Horn of Africa” by Chali et al. (2019) compared the susceptibility of Plasmodium falciparum and Vivax infection between the An. stephensi and An. arabiensis mosquitoes. The study was conducted in the Awash Sebat Kilo region found in Ethiopia because of its high perennial malaria transmission. An experiment was conducted to establish the difference in infection status between the two species of mosquitoes. Adult An. stephensi and An. arabiensis mosquitoes reared from immature mosquitoes were fed from membrane feeders with fresh blood from the patients attending the Adama clinic. The feeding was done with blood infected with P. vivax and P. falciparum for 7 to 12 days. The mosquitoes’ midgets and salivary glands were
dissected to examine the oocysts and sporozoites, respectively. A comparison of the infection status was done using logistic regression analysis. The differences in mosquito sources’ infectivity were examined using the Pitman test. Data analysis was done using the STATA version 13 and GraphPad Prism 5.3.From the 85 aquatic habitats surveyed in the study, 75.3% of the larvae detected were from An. stephensi mosquitoes. The general proportion of blood-fed mosquitoes was higher for An. arabiensis (median 80.5%) than An. stephensi (median 53.5%, p<0.001) (Chali et al., 2019). However, the latter species reported a significantly higher infection with P. vivax (median 75.1%) compared to the former species (median 58.4%, p<0.042). An. stephensi mosquitoes showed higher odds of infection for an individual mosquito (OR=1.99, p<0.001) and higher numbers of oocysts per
infected midgut (median 17) than the counterpart species (median 13, p<0.001). Also, a higher proportion of An. stephensi (51.8%) had a high sporozoite load and odds of detecting high sporozoite intensity from the salivary glands compared to An. arabiensis (31.1%). It was evident from the study that An. stephensi poses a higher risk for increased P. falciparum and P. vivax in Ethiopia compared to An. arabiensis .Article CritiqueStrengthsThe findings in this study contribute immensely to the control of malaria transmission in Ethiopia and Africa. The article has a brief abstract to provide a succinct summary of the content of the study. The introduction part of the article provides a firm sense of what the study is about and develops the background of the research. The study has a
clearly stated research design that explains the materials and procedure used. The analysis and results section contains enough details for readers to understand. The use of table and graphs provide a clear representation of the results. The implication of the research results is adequately evaluated, and interpretation is efficient o address the research problem. The concluding section highlights the main points and provides some recommendations based on the research. The study has a wide range of clearly cited works with fully provided bibliographic details.WeaknessesThe article’s title does not state all the variables examined and the relationships between them. The study establishes the difference in infection of Plasmodium falciparum and vivax between the An. stephensi and An. arabiensis . However, the title and abstract of the study do not
mention the Anopheles arabiensis . The article lacks keywords to help identify the main areas of the study. The study lacks a literature review to illustrate how the researchfits into the existing research framework. The study does not clearly state the aim and rationale of the research.Significance of the Findings to the General PopulationHealth research plays a crucial role in promoting the wellbeing of the general population and society. Malaria prevalence in Africa remains a huge health concern that has a significant medical, social, and economic impact. The findings in this study provide insight into the infection status of P. vivax and P. falciparum and the transmission rate between the An. stephensi and An. arabiensis mosquitoes. This study indicates the risk factors of malaria within the local population
to provide public health awareness to populations in these regions. Eliminating aquatic water sources that promote the breeding of Anopheles mosquitoes will help the larger population contribute towards fight again malaria transmission. The application of the findings in this research can provide a remarkable improvement in health care and public health. Consequently, the adoption of health measures and control programs to lower malaria transmission has an enormous impact on human health, resulting in increased productivity of the population.
Anorexia nervosa is a treatable eating disorder when people significantly limit the number of calories and types of foods they eat, which leads to excessive weight loss. Anyone may be affected by anorexia, and about 1-2% of the population suffers from the disorder (Cleveland Clinic Medical Staff, 2021). Key symptoms include:Emotional and mental signs: fear of gaining weight, obsession with counting calories or diets, irritability, self-criticism, and other characteristics. Behavioral signs: changes in eating habits, excessive exercise, and other features. Physical signs: weight loss, fatigue, weakness, and similar symptoms. Pay attention: Anorexia is possible even if there are no underweight signs, and one needs to pay attention to other symptoms.Genetics and family history: brain chemistry impacts appetite, mood, and self-control; therefore, people who have relatives suffering from eating
IntroductionWritten in the middle of the twentieth century, the novel A Confederacy of Dunces remains relevant these days. The book unveils some of the features of the people who cannot find their place in their communities or human society at large. Ignatius J. Reilly, the protagonist of the story, is one of such individuals incapable of fitting in. Some may note that the man is just one of the thousand inhabitants of New Orleans trying to live his life and become happy (“Literary Journeys”). At that, he is not an eccentric man with slightly standing out peculiarities but a person suffering from a mental health issue with vivid symptoms. Ignatius can hardly become a part of his community, although he has to try hard due to economic struggles
that started after his irresponsible behavior.It has been widely discussed that Ignatius shares many traits in common with the author of the book as John Kennedy Toole also failed to become a successful member of his community and American society (MacLauchlin). At that, while the writer committed suicide, unable to fit in, he gives Ignatius a chance to succeed (Henninger 782). Ignatius J. Reilly can be seen as a good illustration of the behaviors and choices of people with antisocial personality disorder who are doing their best to find a place in their communities.Ignatius and His Antisocial Personality at Home and in the CommunityIndulging Oneself as a Sign of the DisorderIndulging oneself is one of the most conspicuous traits of Ignatius, which is also one of the major
symptoms of antisocial personality disorder. Individuals diagnosed with this health condition tend to indulge themselves and try to have a hedonist way of life as they pay little attention to other people’s feelings or needs (Maass 9). Such persons try to ensure that they have everything they need (money, food, and other people’s attention), and they attain this goal even if it happens at the expense of others. People with this diagnosis believe their needs have to be satisfied while other things do not matter.This trait is displayed in Ignatius in many ways, including his eating disorder and unwillingness to earn his living. Ignatius compares the need to make money and get a job with being “thrown out again into the abyss” (Toole 86). He prefers reading his
medieval texts, writing letters and reflections, as well as daydreaming and watching movies (Leighton 211). He cares little about his mother’s struggles and the fact that she supports him financially, although he is already a middle-aged man. His attitude towards food and drinks also shows that he has few or no limits. The man believes that “the lack of food… channels all of one’s better impulses” (Toole 132). He pays no attention to other people’s needs but concentrates on his personal comfort, be it good food or proper clothes. Clearly, being such a self-centered person suggests that the man has symptoms of antisocial personality disorder.Arrogance and Deceit as Common SymptomsOther common symptoms of antisocial personality disorder are arrogance and deceitfulness. Being arrogant is closely related to indulging oneself
as arrogant people find themselves superior to others, which justifies, in their opinion, their focus on their needs. People with antisocial personality disorder are characterized by a high degree of arrogance, which is associated with antisocial behavior (Stanton and Zimmerman 439). Such people do not find it necessary to follow or even listen to other people’s recommendations or warnings. Individuals with this type of psychological issue do not follow any external norms and regulations, even if these are crimes that can lead to punishment (fine or even imprisonment).Ignatius has these traits and breaks several rules, norms, and laws throughout the story. Instead of selling products, he consumes them, which is, of course, an unexpected behavioral pattern (Toole 165). He does not even try to do his job well
as he is rude and insults potential customers. Instead of trying to make a good start and earn money, Ignatius has a daily plan to sell “five or six hot dogs quickly, park the wagon somewhere, and get to that theater” (Toole 164). He is not a diligent or responsible employee, so he can hardly have a decent or, eventually, any job. Moreover, he mocks other people’s desire to go up the professional ladders and become successful in this sphere (Slepov 14). This attitude is another illustration of Ignatius’s antisocial behavior. He believes he is too good to live the life of ordinary people who think about practical things. Ignatius dreams about the perfection of Medieval society and the corruption of the modern times, although he is completely
dependent on the fruit of the twentieth century with its hot dogs, bathtubs, and cinema.He is also ready to break laws and accuse others of the crime he commits. His fraudulent activity is a result of his arrogance and lack of attention to rules. He believes that “the world understood only strength and force” and copies his boss’s signature with no remorse (Toole 55). He is remorseless when accusing an innocent woman of his crime, which is also, from his standpoint, is a sign of strength and power. Clearly, he is disrespectful to older people and the representatives of the law. This trait is displayed on the very first pages of the book when Ignatius has a heated argument with a patrolman. All these attitudes and behaviors show
that the protagonist of the book in question is willing to act in an antisocial manner.Relationships with His MotherOne of the most illustrative aspects of Ignatius’s life in terms of his psychological issue is his relationship with his mother. Antisocial behavior is often violent, but it is always destructive (DeLamater et al. 345). It destroys people’s relationships, it deteriorates persons’ social status, and it also ruins one’s personality. Ignatius is far from being a loving or caring son who can be a mother’s pride. He is an abusive and manipulative middle-aged child who expects full financial and practical support from his mother. He is so selfish and arrogant that he sees his role as the one to “to keep her in her place” (Toole 5). He is verbally
abusive with his mother and does not truly appreciate anything she does for him. He is also manipulative as he tends to emphasize that it is her responsibility to address all the challenges the family has to face as she is his parent. Clearly, such a position is not appropriate for a responsible middle-aged man.Moreover, he often thinks his mother causes harm and distress while he is a loving and caring son. For instance, he stresses in his writings that “that people learn to hate those who help them,” which is “a truism of human nature” (Toole 135). The man truly believes that he keeps his mother safe while he is actually causing trouble and distress to the old woman who needs care, understanding, and support.Again, instead of
trying to build proper relationships with his mother, Ignatius prefers to pay no attention to the old woman. The inability and unwillingness to develop relationships with others, including family members, is another sign of antisocial personality disorder (Maass 9). Such people alienated themselves even from their closest relatives. Their brutality and arrogance make their close ones distance themselves from them as well.Romantic RelationshipsIgnatius’s relationships with women are quite illustrative as well because the man in his late thirties has had no proper romantic engagement with anyone. The most prominent sexual link to a female is his attachment to a woman in a picture. Importantly, the fact that she is holding a book with medieval texts seems the most attractive trait in the entire image for Ignatius (Toole 166).
The “brilliant” nude woman must have some “new and valuable insights,” which form the basis of Ignatius’s interest. In simple terms, instead of trying to develop relationships with a real person with all complexities and associated efforts, the protagonist chooses to chase after an image in a pornographic picture. No other woman deserves his attention, in his opinion, which is a sign of his arrogance and super ego.The only real woman Ignatius has at least some kind of relationship with romantic grounds is Myrna Minkoff. They tend to write letters to each other discussing political and social issues, and the man manages to seem a potent intellectual who is decisive and committed. However, the reason for being physically close with Myrna is Ignatius’s desire to escape from his
mother’s house or the mental health institution. Myrna, according to Ignatius’s plan, will be the source of his material wellbeing, which is put straightforwardly with a short phrase, “Do you have any money on you?” (Toole 221). Again, the protagonist chooses the easiest way and remains a manipulative man pursuing his hedonistic goals to indulge himself.Behavior in the CommunityIn addition to the professional life that illustrates Ignatius’s conduct in the community, it is necessary to consider the man’s involvement in the political life of New Orleans. This aspect is depicted in a satiric way, which sheds more light on the protagonist’s attitudes towards other people and society at large (Pugh 39). Ignatius makes an impression that he wants to lead a civil rights movement to make the life
of a vulnerable group better and restore justice in the corrupt United States. One of his writings is one of the brightest illustrations of his true intentions. For others, he wants to display that he has made the “decision which reveals a militancy, depth, and strength quite unexpected in so gentle a nature” (Toole 76). However, in reality, he is only concerned about one idea and writes to himself that “powerful civil rights organizations will no doubt cover me with laurels” (Toole 76). He wants to be glorified, and he finds quite an easy (as it seems to him) way to achieve his objectives.The central outcome of antisocial personality disorder tends to be the inability of the affected person to fit in, which is the case with Ignatius.
Toole depicted the protagonist of his story as a person somewhat torn between the world of the modern American and Medieval societies (Freese 358). Freese states that Ignatius is unable to adapt to the concepts of cause and effect as he often resorts to such factors as Fortuna (358). Ignatius exclaims such phrases as “vicious trick is Fortuna playing on me” many times throughout the book (and even within a day) (Toole 164). However, his being unfit is not caused by his inability but his unwillingness to adapt. Ignatius is too arrogant and selfish to even make an attempt to be a part of something bigger (for example, family, community, or society). He is the biggest and most important phenomenon in the world, in his opinion. Ignatius does
not want to fit in as he prefers to fit society into his picture of the world.Possible Causes of the Disorder Explaining Ignatius’s BehaviorsMultiple factors affect people’s mental health, including but not confined to genetics, family history, and environment. An antisocial personality disorder is also usually caused by a combination of factors with genetics and environment being critical aspects (Maass 6). As far as Ignatius’s case is concerned, it is difficult to estimate the extent to which his childhood experiences influenced his personality. However, hereditary characteristics of the protagonist’s mental health are rather apparent.His mother is also an indulgent and manipulative person, which suggests that she is affected by the same health issue. She drinks quite a lot, although her son’s arguments about her being an alcoholic are
too poorly grounded. At that, her alcohol consumption causes considerable difficulties as the huge fine they are to pay is a result of her careless behavior. The way she and her son went to their car and the ways she left the parking spot and wrecked the nearby building suggest that she was under the influence but still decided to drive (Toole 18). The old lady does not want to restrict herself in her consumption of something she finds delicious (such as alcohol), which is a symptom of antisocial personality disorder.Mrs. Reilly is also trying to manipulate other people, such as her potential partner, neighbors, police officers, and her son. In her relationships with her son, she is victimized, but she is also willing to make easy choices.
She wants Ignatius to be institutionalized, which would save her from his abusive behavior, but most importantly for her, from the disgrace he is causing. The woman is afraid of receiving negative publicity due to her son’s bizarre beliefs and “be all over the newspaper” (Toole 119). She is constantly complaining about her son and his rudeness and emphasizes that she has done a lot to make her son happy. She manages to create the corresponding image, and everyone tends to accuse Ignatius of all mishaps although some of them are a result of Mrs. Reilly’s irresponsible conduct.ConclusionIn conclusion, it is necessary to stress that Ignatius J. Reilly can be seen as a literary description of a person with an antisocial personality disorder. The protagonist is an arrogant,
abusive, manipulative, and indulgent person who cannot fit in with his community. Moreover, he invests quite a little effort in this endeavor as he is willing to alienate himself from the rest of the people as, in his opinion, they are dunces. Ignatius sees himself as a superior man who is misunderstood and being opposed consistently. He believes that people are not worth his effort, although he attempts to become a leader of a movement. Clearly, this movement is not about making some groups’ life better, but it is all about his desire to be famous and glorified. All these traits are signs of antisocial personality disorder that can be caused by different factors.Since the author does not describe or give any details regarding Ignatius’s childhood, his family
irresponsible behavior causes a lot of trouble for her and her son. Thus, it is possible to note that Ignatius’s antisocial personality disorder could be inherited.Irrespective of the nature of the disorder, Ignatius is an illustration of a person with a certain psychological issue. His mental health condition makes him develop inappropriate behavioral patterns that are ill-accepted in American society of the middle of the twentieth century. He sees himself as a genius that is misunderstood and opposed by the rest of the world that is completely damaged. Ignatius cannot find his place in his community, so he chooses to escape. Clearly, even the trip with Myrna can hardly help the man escape from himself and fit in.
IntroductionApple Inc. is a multinational tech company based in California, the US. In terms of revenue, Apple is the largest technology firm, with approximately $365.8 billion as of June 2022. The company has been known for its market capitalization, whereby it has sold many computers and mobile phones. The company was founded in 1976 by Steve Jobs and others such as Ronald Wayne and Wozniak Steve. The company’s success has been through digital innovation that matches modern customer trends in technology. The common products in the market include iPhone, Apple Watch, iPad, and AirTag, among others. Apple has endured global success due to the maximization of devices’ capability by adding value to the internal structure of any handset it makes. There have been key marketing plans, and the
quality of products makes consumers get interested in the products.Description of the OrganizationApple designs and manufactures smartphones, personal computers, tablets, and other products and services, as seen in Figure 1. The company operates on various platforms, such as App Store, which allows clients to discover and download applications, books, music, and other digital content. Through digital subscriptions, Apple has succeeded in offering digital content, such as through Apple Arcade, Apple Music, Apple TV, and Apple Fitness (Smith, 2020). Apple sells all these products to a range of markets whereby individual consumers, small-scale businesses, and government agencies have been key customers. It is important to note that Apple has been regarded as one of the companies that created a class regarding what is offered in the market. Many consumers
have raised the company’s reputation in social media, which has given a recommendable perception towards consumerism.The firm is known for marketing its products through commercial ads and print media. The company has an official store and website that assists in leveraging the marketing of its phone, laptops, and other products. The target audience for apple is high-end product users, and that is why the company has been associated with premium branding that matches high customer services. Apple delivers innovative, up-to-date items that fit the market (Hern, 2018). With the current metrics put in place, Apple is gaining a high volume of sales which gives the company stability in the market. Therefore, the company is one of the competing firms globally regarding digital products, and the management is doing
all it can to explore the market more.Figure 1: Apple’s products (Licsi, 2022).One of the major moves that helped Apple explore the market right is the foresight to beat the competition. The firm identifies customers’ needs before the customers discover what they require. For instance, the introduction of iTunes saw a major shift in keeping music organized in a given platform. Other key tools include a voice-activated assistant enabled through company research and development (R&D) (Hern, 2018). Simplicity is another way that Apple has maximized to ensure it penetrates and gains significant returns on revenue from its sales. In this case, the interface for most of its devices is easy to utilize, and users can access various programs through their handsets, where most of them require simple logic.The
Organization’s StructureApple’s organizational structure is hierarchical and functional, where the chief executive officer (CEO) is the overall manager of the business. As shown in Figure 2 below, Apple’s organizational structure shows Tim Cook, the CEO, working with the senior vice president, chief operating officer, and chief financial officer (Livesay, 2022). Apple is a public company that shareholders own where it has over 16 billion shares as of 2022, and interested people have taken the opportunity to own the shares (Livesay, 2022). The aspect of a hierarchically organized structure is seen through the CEO assuming the highest rank in the company. The company comprises more than 132,000 full-time employees who facilitate the delivery of duties and products (Livesay, 2022). The benefit of using this structure is that it enables
Apple to control all avenues of business through tight manning of operations, transactions, and interactions in and outside the company.Figure 2: Apple’s organizational structure (Dudovskiy, 2021).The other structure is seen in a product-based grouping that has contributed to the success of the organization’s business strategies. The multinational giant firm has divided its operations into subgroups such as services which include App Store, ApplePay, and Apple Music (Licsi, 2022). The other sets of grouping include Mac, iPhone, and iPad. This structuring of products is important because it enables empirical market segmentation, which means each item can be sold using a specific framework according to the customer’s desires. A product-based group is known as other products, which consists of Apple TV, iWatch, displays, storage handsets, and headphones (Livesay, 2022). These
are more connectivity than computing, and many users, more so the youth, have loved purchasing from the store.The company’s organizational structure gives its business model, which incorporates collaboration between various groups and divisions. Apple combines various business models such as direct sales, franchising, and advertised-based strategy (Zhang, 2022). Apple Inc. maintains that there should be an intensive and effective partnership with other groups within the company to create a unique portfolio that enables mass purchasing from different buyers. The firm’s board of directors (BODs) comprises eight members with distinct leadership roles within the company and helps interlink the divisions to maximize high sales volumes within a given market. Three members act as CEOs, while two are former personnel who occupy the chairman role (Pereira, 2022). Some key people
in Apple’s BOD include former US vice president Albert Gore, former Boeing Company James Bell president, and BlackRock cofounder, Susan Wagner.The other structure is evident in the functionality aspect of the company, which adds to its business model. The perspective allows the firm to neglect short-term financial targets when developing new items in the market that require significant investment (Zhang, 2022). Through functionality structure, Apple has been basing its bonuses and R&D on financial performance rather than funds from a specific product. Apple executives consider functionality moves a holistic approach that navigates deep into the market. In that way, the firm grows its reputation, hence its business’s success.Range of External Influences That Might Impact GrowthMany factors influence whether or not a company will grow in a competitive market.
The first matter determining Apple’s growth is a technology evident through microservices architecture and artificial intelligence. There have been highly innovative digital ideas that impact how business is done. For instance, Apple has developed Macs, iPods, and Apple Store applications due to the modern technology boost that is heavily employed to connect customers and the product (Lombardo, 2019). Adobe Systems has contributed to Apple’s growth due to the advanced software management metrics that it comes with.Additionally, access to the website revolutionized everything, including Apple. It boosted its revenue by 30% after many buyers’ adoption of the internet (Lombardo, 2019). Technological advancements are witnessed every day, and Apple stands on sustainable ground since users have turned to be digitally active, positively impacting its business. Apple incorporated AI features in
its phones through face-recognition elements, fingerprint sensors, and native sleep tracking. These ideas power the company to fit in modern business zones by utilizing technology (Gopani, 2022). With continued changes courtesy of tech, Apple can be assured of getting significant sales that will improve the company’s brands.The other external factor that influences Apple’s growth is sociocultural aspects. The rising use of mobile phones increased dependency on digital handsets and changed the perception of the use of computers (Lombardo, 2019). These opportunities grant Apple a chance to grow because product demand goes high, meaning the company will have a market to deliver the required items. For instance, it is common to find students using smartphones and laptops in colleges and universities globally, and in most cases, Apple’s products are
preferred (Smith, 2020). The other social factor that gives Apple a chance to grow is the status symbol. Many users have associated Apple products with class. As a result, people will maximize buying these products to satisfy the perceptional ideology of belonging to a particular click.Apple will benefit significantly from the stable political perspectives in many countries since there are free trading zones. In this case, they will establish many outlets for manufacturing, distributing, and marketing their product, ensuring business continuity. For instance, due to the growing positive relations between the US and other countries, Apple has opened stores in more than 25 countries on six continents (Zhang, 2022). Currently, there are more than 518 stores globally. With the forecasted projections, there is a high likelihood that Apple
Cook, who leads other executives in a hierarchical organizational structure. The company has a product-based structure where items are divided according to the type for easy market penetration. Various external factors, such as technology, shall impact Apple’s growth. Technology s advancing by the day, so the company will consider a wide array of functionality structures to produce desired products that fit modern consumerism trends. The other factor is sociocultural elements, which comprise increased smartphone and laptop usage and over-reliance on digital handsets. Political factors such as existing free trading allow the company to grow due to possible expansions in various parts of the world.
Cultural humility is a concept that needs to be implemented in human service organizations to improve the effectiveness, responsiveness, and accessibility of provided services. The concept of cultural humility emerged around 30 years ago, which was first introduced by Melanie Tervalon and Jane Murray-Garcia. Cultural humility was identified as “a lifelong commitment to self-evaluation and critique, to redressing power imbalances… and to developing mutually beneficial and non-paternalistic partnerships with communities on behalf of individuals and defined populations” (Greene-Moton & Minkler, 2020, p. 142). In other words, cultural humility increases care providers’ awareness about the culture of service receivers through self-reflection and introspection.Even though the majority of human service organizations understand the importance of cultural humility; however, not every organization has a statement of cultural humility/safety. Connecticut Coalition to
End Homelessness (CCEH, 2015) has such a statement which is called “Cultural Competency and Responsiveness.” The statement acknowledges that the organization provides services to increasingly diverse populations in terms of race, cultural background, language, age, gender, and sexual orientation (CCEH, 2015). The statement gives definitions to cultural competency, cultural humility, and cultural responsiveness. Additionally, the statement describes the population it serves, demonstrating awareness about the matter, which is crucial for providing top-quality services. Additionally, it provides a list of resources that were used to guide the practice of the organization in terms of cultural safety.While the statement is adequate, there are two considerable flaws. First, the organization does not describe how the principles of cultural safety were implemented in practice. Thus, it is recommended that CCEH demonstrates examples
I would try to find a medium for communicating with some of the groups of younger homeless people in Connecticut. For instance, the organization acknowledges that more than 30% of the population served are young Hispanics (CCEH, 2015). This population may have trouble communicating with service providers. However, if the organization asked a bilingual young adult to communicate with the population, it would have a greater effect on the outcomes. Such a practice would improve the organization’s cultural humility practices.
Social media has become an integral part of the modern world, considering that many people opt to use these platforms to interact with others. Personally, I prefer to use Facebook as it is not flooded with spam and advertisement as much as Instagram, Tik Tok, or similar apps. I use Facebook to interact with my old friends, who I can no longer see because they moved to other cities or even countries, so this social platform seems a perfect option to interact with them from time to time. However, mainstream social media applications appear to have influenced today’s society since people are constantly exposed to hate, negative comments or publications, and fake influencers.To elaborate, impression management theory has become real since people try to become their better selves
of social media platforms presents numerous options for users because every application is used for different purposes. For instance, Tik Tok is mainly used to exchange funny videos with friends, while Twitter is a public diary where one can present opinions on crucial topics or not so much to the followers. Consequently, it is clear that the communication style between users is dissimilar on different social media platforms. Overall, the application’s options can also limit the types of interaction as, for example, people can use some media only for texting and others to video call or record voice messages.
Interacting with patients is simultaneously an advantage and a challenge for nursing practitioners because the outcomes are difficult to predict. Indeed, problems with certain populations might occur in NPs practice if the beneficiaries of an organization have specific needs or socio-economic statuses (Curley, 2020). For instance, groups with low-income levels and difficulties affording primary health care require a unique communicational approach. The PICOT statement related to the issue in NPs practice involving specific beneficiaries can be connected to their tendency to skip the appointments. The question is: “In impoverished patients, what is the efficiency of treatment if they refuse to attend follow-ups, compared with ones who had a timely return visit?” This paper aims to describe the selected NPs practice issue, provide a literature review and recommend a
specific change to influence the problem.Patients skip appointments for multiple reasons, and practitioners can impact their decision-making to improve the situation. Furthermore, the practice problem is severe because missed follow-ups worsen the effectiveness of treatment, making additional financial burdens if the clients’ conditions worsen (Arpey et al., 2017). NPs must identify why the impoverished beneficiaries refuse to re-attend their physicians, retrieve the aspects they can influence, develop and implement solutions in their interaction with patients. Conducting research and literature review is a workable strategy to gather sufficient evidence necessary for decision-making.Modern scholarly articles reveal that the reasons for the impoverished populations to skip the follow-up appointment are specific and address their financial abilities and life priorities. The lack of attendance occurs due to clients’ forgetfulness, language barrier, insufficient
funds for transformation, lack of education, and understanding of follow-ups’ importance are the main reasons for skipping a visit (Arpey et al., 2017). Research conducted in 2018 emphasized the urgency of the practice issue as the results revealed that the average rate of missed return visits is 23%, and it is damaging the healthcare industry’s performance (Dantas et al., 2018). NPs can use these statistics as an argument to encourage their colleagues to implement the change and influence the problematic situation.The scope of literature about the selected issue also suggests that NPs can update their communicational approaches and visit protocols and include the relevant patient education. Shrestha et al. (2017) state that “missed clinic appointments reduce clinic efficiency, waste resources, and increase costs; limited data exist on subspecialty
The novel Atonement , written by Ian McEwan, touches upon the topic of the significance of writing. The author uses various literary devices to convey many themes within the novel. Using the omniscient narrator, the author strives to show a person’s emotions who tries to atone the sins through writing. The image of the main character of the novel, Briony, shows how the writing can help people to accept their own sins. The author uses the different types of irony and omniscient narrator mode to reflect the idea of alleviating grief and guilt through writing.The significance of writing and narrative to coping with guilt, loss, or trauma is expressed primarily through two literary devices. The first one is the irony: situational and verbal. The irony is a satirical
technique by which the writer evaluates the subject involving double meaning. The truth lies not in the statement but in its opposite meaning. The author uses verbal irony to convey the emotions of the characters in more detail. “Now you’re sticking to the salad while the rest of us are suffering” (121). This type of irony is used to condemn the narrator’s behavior. Such writing structure is a way to plead guilty in the actions causing the sufferings to others. “When the wounded were screaming, you dreamed of sharing a little house somewhere” (227). This quote also contains the narrator’s conviction to her actions against the loved ones.Creating a novel, the narrator wants to grant characters the opportunity to live lives they had no chance to live. The
narrator emphasizes that she has stolen the lives of the people she loved. People cannot be brought back to life, and the narrator has no chance to be forgiven. Thus, she creates a novel where she can atone her sins. The situational irony is used to depict the narrator’s remorse trying to use the writing to cope with the loss. At the end of the book, the narrator confesses that the reuniting of characters had never happened (310). The happy ending exists because she decides to atone for her own sins through the novel. Being unable to change their lives, the writer creates a new life for these people in the story.Another element helping to express the mentioned topic is the omniscient narrator mode. In such novels, the
devotes her life to the people whose lives she ruined. Even though Briony’s mental trauma cannot be potentially atoned, she alleviates her grief and guilty through writing.The discussed issue is vital for me personally and the whole society in terms of understanding the writer’s emotions. Life is uncontrollable, and many events that haunt people all their lives may occur. Everyone finds their own way to overcome the traumas. Writing is the perfect opportunity to stay faithful to loved ones and express one’s regrets. It is morally relieving when the audience reads and accepts the author’s confessions. For me, writing may help stay morally stable and remember losses and tragedies, which is vital for the ethical development and cultural heritage transferring of society.
In the craft beer industry, as in many others, there are strategically essential components of the macro environment. These valuable components include the degree of increase in total beer consumption, the growth rate of beer exports to various countries, and shifts in the propensity to drink. It is also important to note the importance of such indicators as expanded business management and its dissemination of the potential increase in business costs due to the establishment of the labor law. The broader use of Internet technologies and their implementation, demonstrating an increase in the free access of buyers, also have a significant role.Competition in the craft beer industry is relatively high due to its increased popularity. This is because an increasing number of craft breweries have begun to introduce
more business transactions into their practice (Garavaglia & Swinnen, 2017). The bargaining power and leverage of buyers and rivalry between sellers have the most potent force, and the competitive pressure from makers of substitute products is the weakest. Craft beer producers and customer demand have the most significant impact on the attractiveness of the industry and its potential profitability.The strategic map of the craft beer industry may be such that bottling plants have limited distribution. Global producers mostly have international distribution and a low or insignificant role in pricing. Moreover, I believe that this strategic group has the greatest advantage. Regional producers are located everywhere while offering prices within a small or high assortment.Key factors that may determine the success of a start-up craft brewery are access to
Medical institutions function to protect the interests of patients and meet their needs; they are now the object of attention of society as a whole. The population’s confidence in the activities of medical organizations is an essential indicator of their effectiveness. Bringing current terminology and the nature of the relationship between patients and physicians into a state of certainty will help to understand and delineate the nature of consumerism in health care (Calnal, 2010). The absence or lack of trust is of particular concern to patients. They feel vulnerable not only because they are sick but also because of the research and treatment they have to undergo. Improving the efficiency of the health care system is a policy priority for European countries.In today’s world, patients expect adequate professional
vulnerability of patients undergoing treatment can be reduced by restoring trust between them and the treating physician. Moreover, appropriate training and highly qualified doctors are factors that determine how friendly and relaxed the clinics’ clients will be about the manipulations they undergo. The destruction of the interpersonal relationship between doctors and patients due to the introduction of depersonalized procedures becomes the subject of research in the coming years.
When discussing Parkinson’s Disease (PD), the patient’s care, both from the community and healthcare professionals, is a concern. Therefore, my topic of interest is the care and treatment of people suffering from PD and how their lives could be improved. I chose this topic because it is empathetic seeing patients struggling independently without proper care from the community and the healthcare. The topic is a matter of concern because helping the vulnerable in the community creates an inclusive environment for all. Moreover, caring for PD patients is a health concern issue because, without proper intervention, patients suffering from this condition could develop worse conditions and adversely affect their lives. I believe that PD is treatable, and patients put under proper medication show minimal difficulties coping with their lives.
In researching the topic, the keywords to use are ‘appropriate caring for patients with Parkinson’s Disease, which yields a variety of nursing journals to choose from.  * P – Patients and people affected by Parkinson’s Disease (PD).  * I – How does collaborative care and disease education helps to improve care management among patients who have Parkinson’s Disease? Is it worth educating members of society about PD? And what effects could it bring to patients suffering from this condition?  * C – Compares to patients’ data with no collaborative care and victims surrounded by uninformed people about the disease.  * O – Improves PD patients’ care management and care in general.  * T – Over a 24-week time frame.For the sustainability of this
project, it is important to provide supporting evidence on the importance of collaborative and disease education among the community members. Therefore, I intend to exhaust several nursing journals concerning caring for people and patients with Parkinson’s Disease. The targeted nursing journals whose content presents the importance of PD education and studies promoting collaborative care for these victims. This project aims primarily to prove the importance of PD education and the need for awareness of this condition in the community. Finally, at the end of the specified period, the behaviors and the ease of coping with the condition among PD patients will be compared with stored data when the community was not informed of the PD. Therefore, there is a high expectation of a positive result regarding efficient care
and ease in managing PD patients.My research concerning PD patients’ care continues as I found this article as important as the two discussed articles. This article’s main point is shifting care of the PD patients from hospitals to community care. According to Aye et al. (2020), integrated multidisciplinary care in collaboration with other healthcare professionals is the key to managing PD patients and their conditions. Moreover, the article presents insufficient expertise, poor interdisciplinary collaboration, and communication to deliver care to PD patients as the core challenges facing the shifting process. Since full shifting to community patient-centric care would be difficult, the research proposes programs such as PD training and Telemedicine to make the dream true shortly (Aye et al., 2020). This article further narrows down and points out
the role of multidisciplinary care in PD and the limitations exhibited by PD patients in the community. This research was based on Singapore’s PD model of care. According to Aye et al. (2020), PD is the second most common neurodegenerative disease, as the research found that more than 6000 people are diagnosed with the disease. Hence over congestion of PD patients forced the birth of Patient-Centric Care outside the hospitals.In my opinion, I found this source biased as caring for persons suffering from PD is concerned. The article does not explain the programs that ensure that these patients receive the utmost care outside the hospitals. Moreover, without proper education and the provision of Telemedicine, many homes that care for PD patients would have a hard time as they
do not receive quality care. However, I agree with moving PD care from hospitals to the community because various hospitals do not have sufficient facilities to handle the figures quoted in the case of Singapore. In doing so, caregivers and other healthcare professionals find it easy to care for patients with adverse PD conditions. Reading the article gives insights and knowledge of PD and the reason for ultimate patient care. With the increased PD condition, this matter is a nursing situation and a global matter of concern to help reduce and care for these vulnerable.Therefore, it is important to note that all three discussed articles build on the consensus that persons diagnosed with PD deserve the utmost care to better their lives. The three articles agree that PD
is a chronic neurodegenerative disease with complex motor and non-motor symptoms. Moreover, the articles have stressed the importance of caring for caregivers and the community. The articles also give insights into how PD persons and their families could be supported to better their existence in the community. A good example is teaching programs in the community. This creates PD awareness in the community and enhances patients’ care knowledge. Although the articles agree on some aspects concerning PD patient care, the second article dwells on the relationship between educating the public on PD and the burden of caregiving. The finding showed that with education on the PD, patients receive quality care and reduce the burden on the caregivers’ side. All in all, the information gained from these articles teaches
the importance and the need for PD patients’ care.This article primarily presents the concept of personalized care management for persons affected by Parkinson’s Disease (PD). Furthermore, this article acknowledges PD as one of the rising neurodegenerative disorders in the world, affecting more than eight million people globally (Halteren, Munneke, Smit, Thomas, Bloem & Darweesh, 2020). Hence, collaborative care among families, health professionals, and healthcare services is necessary for providing care for these groups of people to make life easier for patients diagnosed with PD. The article has proposed a personalized care management model for these vulnerabilities in making this dream true. According to Hatteren et al. (2020), the model proposed has five elements for helping PD patients cope with their condition.The first is care coordination which could be
termed a team-based activity. The element allows sharing of health information among the caregivers hence facilitating a common understanding. The second element in this model is patient navigation, which involves integrated service delivery to guide and support both the caregivers and the patients. The research also found that fragmentation of care among these patients immensely affects the quality of service received. The third element as per the model is information provision data sharing concerning both physical and health details of the PD patients. Teaching PD patients about their condition creates self-awareness and, in turn, results in self-management and active self-decision-making. The fourth element of the model is the early detection of signs and symptoms through proactive monitoring. This involves thorough monitoring of patients suspected of developing PD conditions
so that timely intervention can prevent further worsening. Finally, the last element of the personalized care management model is process monitoring. The element mainly involves tracking, reviewing, and evaluating the care management process concerning set plans and goals. The process is essential because it assesses the quality-of-service deliveries and their impact on the PD’s patients.This is a useful source to start with as far as PD patients are concerned. Reading through this article provides important insights both for caregivers and the family living with persons diagnosed with PD. For instance, I personally, through reading the article, find it necessary to support families and patients struggling to handle these persons living with PD, and in the future, I am looking forward to helping families and individuals affected directly or
indirectly by PD. Moreover, I would support the reliability of this source because it still publishes articles today. The information contained in this article was objective and had a clear message concerning caring for the persons affected by PD and proved that caring for PD patients is a matter that deserves nursing attention.This is another article that I found interesting as PD is concerned. The article starts by appreciating the role of disease education in managing PD. This research aimed to bring up the link that exists between understanding disease and the burden of care. According to Lee et al. (2019), Parkinson’s Disease is a neurodegenerative disease that lowers the dopaminergic neurons in the substantia nigra. This research also says that patients on active medication do not find
that all caregivers, including family members, be informed about the condition to reduce their anxieties.Therefore, I support the research findings that education programs are necessary to provide a quality understanding of PD conditions. Moreover, I agree and support that caregiving among non-informed patients was met with difficulties instead of patients who were informed of their conditions. The research was carried out on 142 patients, of which both male and female patients were part. The findings could be used as a representative sample regardless of the geographical area. Thus, as the article presents, PD care is a challenge to caregivers and the whole community; as such, education on the disease must be a top priority to enhance the understanding of PD conditions.
The messages sent through verbal, nonverbal, and paraverbal means of communication informed the listeners about the speaker’s issues. Firstly, verbal statements informed about the problems at work and personal life, which were important to the speaker. The speaker expressed minor concern with the issues with colleagues at work using words to share his feelings. The paraverbal messages sent through the pitch and tone of the voice and the speed of speaking demonstrated more information about the emotional aspects of the discussed situations. When answering the additional questions about the speaker’s personal life, he spoke faster and in a higher pitch in comparison to the paraverbal characteristics of speaking about work. As for nonverbal messages, the speaker’s facial expressions throughout the communication process delivered the information about positive emotions
Religious exclusivism is the belief by members of a particular religion or a group that only believers of their faith will see heaven, and other people who believe in other faiths will be condemned to hell. A more moderate view of the religious exclusivism doctrine states that believers of a particular religion will only attain salvation while non-believers will not achieve such a status (Peterson et al., 2014). In contrast, universalism holds the view that all people will eventually receive the blessings of God no matter their faith. While religious exclusivism may demonstrate higher dedication and belief in one faith, it may bread dangerous religious extremism that could justify evil or genocidal acts against people of other faiths.Religious exclusivism manifests primarily in Abrahamic religions in various ways. For
instance, in Hebrew, at the core of the concept of “the chosen one” is a belief that anyone who does not subscribe to the Jewish faith will not see the promised “world to come.” In Christianity, religious exclusivism manifests in various ways. The Catholic Church and other denominations, for instance, teach that only those who follow true faith will enter the Kingdom of heaven while non-adherents of the faith will go to hell (Peterson et al., 2014). Religious exclusivism is also apparent in Islam. Accordingly, the Islam faith, “the people of the book” described in the Quran as sincere Jews and Christians, will see paradise while people of other faiths and the ungodly Jews and Christians will have nothing to see Allah nor enter paradise.Historically, kings, warriors, and
heads of state have used religious exclusivism to justify acts of cruelty and war, bans against marriages, and persecution for people who do not profess the same faith as them. However, while religious exclusivism may lead to negative consequences, people can practice religious exclusivism today without causing harm or infringing on the rights of other people of different faiths. Additionally, all religions on the planet encourage some level of religious exclusivism where other religions are recognized as legitimate but not true religions. Religious exclusivism did not emerge with the emergence of religion but was a carrying over of the tribalism and clan system entrenched in traditional communities that viewed other tribes and clans as inferior, enemies, or less human. In the traditional sense, the clan members that killed
rival clan members could justify their acts by claiming they killed their enemies. Until recently, religious killings of people from different religions could be justified. Despite the most extreme form of religious exclusivism dissipating, the implicit contempt of other religions remains today.One of the most apparent problems with religious exclusivism is the ignorance of other people’s religions and beliefs. People of exclusive faith show no interest in learning or understanding different faiths. For many, their God is the only true God, and anyone who practices another religion is doomed to hell if they do not convert. Today, many Christians would find it improper to study Islam, while many Muslims would also find it inappropriate to study Christianity. The mutual disdain for each other’s religion leads to mistrust and
the proliferation of stereotypes that divide people along religious lines. This status quo has informed public policy, foreign policy, and general national and international relations between nations. On the interpersonal level, religious indifference resulting from ignorance of other people’s religion has negative consequences. Such negative consequences include but are not limited to bans on inter-faith marriages and relationships.Religious exclusivism has robbed people of their humanism and replaced it with rules. People with exclusivist views on religion tend to worry more about what the law is than about the welfare of their neighbors. In the religious sense, a neighbor is anyone in need, no matter their religious inclination. The legal perspective on sin sees sin as an offense towards God, and the humanistic perspective sees sin as being harmful
to other people. In actuality, the human and legal perspectives are not that different because disobeying God in any way is similar to disobeying one’s parents. Thus, the harmful actions of religiously exclusive people towards people who do not subscribe to their religion offend God as much as any other sin would offend Him. The scriptures talk about God creating human beings and not God creating people of one faith. Thus, as God’s creations, all human beings deserve to be treated as people first because other titles are secondary.According to John Hick’s pluralistic hypothesis, the world is religiously ambiguous. Accordingly, one can experience it whether or not they believe in any religion because there is no compelling proof that one faith is greater than the other (Peterson et
al., 2014). Additionally, being atheistic or theistic does not matter because, according to John Hick, no one is greater than the other. In Hick’s pluralistic world, everyone has a right to worship and believe in any religion or not by following their conscience. The world described by John Hick is entirely possible. Notwithstanding the relative religious tolerance experienced today, religious supremacy has seen the slaughter of millions of people throughout history. At some point in history, the religious authority to influence the faithful was delegated to political leaders who ruthlessly imposed religious beliefs on unwilling people. In John Hick’s pluralistic world, there would be no need to coerce people to believe in any religion.Religious pluralism respects everyone with or without religious beliefs and believes there is value in
The tragic and regretful tone of the excerpt of O’Brien’s “Good Form” is set using specific word choices and stylistic devices. The author used emotionless, straightforward words to describe the scenes and let the reader draw the conclusion and resonate with the main character. For example, the dead young man was described as he looked, slim and almost dainty. In this excerpt, the author used anaphora several times to emphasize the importance of the image that he sees, for example, “real bodies with real faces” and “faceless responsibility and faceless grief.”Amy Tan wrote “Fish Cheeks” about a memorable Christmas Eve gathering and a cultural conflict. The main character of the excerpt is embarrassed by her family and her own culture in from of guests. Her embarrassment is displayed
Notably, ulcerative colitis is a chronic inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) in which the immune system’s abnormal reactions lead to inflammation and ulcers on the inner lining of the large intestine, which is the last part of the GI tract. Based on the National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases (n.d.), ulcerative colitis can happen at any age; nonetheless, it is more common in people between fifteen and thirty years old. Ulcerative colitis symptoms may differ from person to person, such as diarrhea, passing blood with stool, and abdominal pain. Experts are unsure what causes ulcerative colitis, but they assume genetic factors, abnormal immune responses, the microbiome, and the surroundings play a significant role.Generally, ulcerative colitis is treated with medications that reduce inflammation in the large intestine
and aid in the onset and maintenance of remission. Some people with ulcerative colitis may lose their appetite and eat less; they may not get enough nutrients (National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases, n.d.). Essentially, a healthy, well-balanced diet is recommended for people who have ulcerative colitis. I would suggest the perfect dinner plate to a client, which includes cooked vegetables, refined grains, lean protein sources, and omega-3 fatty acids (Santos-Longhurst & Watson, 2022). Therefore, I recommend eating asparagus, white rice, and chicken or better fish because it is full of Omega-3. Additionally, I will emphasize that the client should eat sugar-free or unsweetened applesauce for dessert. It is also vital to avoid alcohol and spicy food.If a patient has celiac disease, I agree that
the only treatment is a gluten-free diet. As a result, avoiding gluten for the rest of the patient’s life is critical. Individuals with celiac disease must take special precautions to avoid gluten because it can cause a detrimental response. I would also add that naturally gluten-free foods include beans, chia, millet, quinoa, rice, tapioca, and potato. Essentially, I like your choice of the perfect dinner plate for your patient with celiac disease, consisting of smoked salmon, a kale salad with a balsamic vinaigrette and chopped strawberries, and a side of quinoa. Balsamic vinegar can be used because it is gluten-free; it can also be replaced by grape vinegar. I would recommend adding fortified orange juice or dried figs because of calcium and cashews because they are rich in
The Relationship that Exists Between Kate Chopin’s At The Cadian Ball and The StormThe Storm appears to be a continuation of Kate Chopin’s At T he Cadian Ball . Both stories have the same main characters: Bobinot, Calixta, Alcee, and Clarisse. Alcee and Calixta hang out at Assumption, where the ball takes place. They flirt around until Clarisse comes and takes Alcee with him leaving Claxita on her own at the balcony. Then Bobinot finds her and later proposes to her on their way home, and she accepts. On the other hand, Clarisse accepts Alcee’s proposal, which she had earlier rejected.The Storm explains what happens after these two couples marry and what comes from their rushed decisions to marry each other. The two ladies accept their partner’s proposals
out of fear of losing them and jealousy of the other opponent. The main themes in The Storm are sex and broken marriages. The name The Storm symbolizes some of the characters’ lives, and Calixta and Alcee end up marrying other people. Therefore, the two storybooks are related in the sense that one is the continuation of the other.The Idea of Social Status in At The Cadian BallThe question of social class dictates the events in which the characters can partake. Clarisse does not go to the Cadian Ball, and she gets upset when Alcee does. Both Alcee and Clarisse are Creoles as they belong to the Spanish and French people who had settled in Louisiana. In many of Kate Chopin’s stories, Creoles are wealthy, most of them
owning a wide range of land and trade merchants. Bobino and Calixta are Acadian descendants of the Americans exiled French from Acadia. They are said to have been chased out of their homes by British colonizers during their reign in 1775. In most of her stories, the Acadians are relatively poor compared to the Creoles. They are primarily fishers and farmers living off the land and working as servants for the Creoles. Clarisse being a Creole means that she is of a higher social status, and that is why she does not go to the ball and wonders why Alcee does.How At The Cadian Ball Revolves Around Love and AttractionThe author attempts to differentiate and separate the two concepts: love, attraction, and lust. This short story portrays attraction
in the form of flirtation. At Assumption, where the Cadian ball is taking place, on finding Calixta, Alcee takes her with him to a more private area where they go on flirting until Clarisse comes and goes with Alcee. Additionally, Kate Chopin depicts love through devotion and loyalty. At the ball, Bobinot looks for Calixta, and on finding her all alone on the balcony, he offers to take her home. Bobinot’s feelings and actions towards Calixta show love. Even though she does not pay any attention to him, Bobinot remains irrationally enthusiastic and takes pleasure in any recognition and acknowledgment Calixta gives him. Ultimately, the author captures the issue of love and attraction through enthusiasm and flirtation that different characters portray.How the Author Uses This Short Story to
Highlight Issues Related to Feminism and ImproprietyThis story is set in 1892 at the end of the Victorian era, where people were expected to be highly mannered. Most people of higher social standing, especially women, were allowed to be a little improper in manners but polite. However, Calixta is none of these, as she is carefree and, on occasions, rather rude. Like most of Kate Chopin’s writings in the early 20th century, At The Cadian Ball is a work of feminism with Calixta as an icon of daring women at the time who went against the social order and standards set. She is outgoing and refuses to abide by the societal rules forced by men, and at the same time, she fits and is accepted by society. Thus,
Athens and Sparta were two critical poleis of the Archaic Age of Greece; they were inherently similar but different in many ways. They both shared representative forms of government through assemblies of members elected by the citizens of each respective polis, but Sparta was ruled by two kings in a strictly controlled military state, while Athens was ruled by archons elected annually in a democracy. Both city-states shared an extensive slave-owning culture, with Spartans enslaving the helots while Athens owned significant populations of slaves. It could be argued that both Sparta and Athens were militaristic. Sparta was the epitome of military culture, training males from a young age to fight and be independent. However, Athens also maintained a strong army and powerful navy as well; it was a
where the ruling elite controlled much of the power and wealth while the lower classes, despite being citizens, were given less. Women who had virtually no power, voice, or presence in Athens society were not allowed to own property or vote and were seen as the property of their husbands and fathers. Meanwhile, while some class division existed in Sparta, the militaristic nature bonded everyone together as both kings and regular Spartans respected each other. Women in Sparta were given the most rights, likely in the whole ancient world, being able to own property, could speak publicly, run households, and be relied upon by their husbands (Brooks, 2019).
OverviewBecause of its restricted comprehension and connection with other essential occupations in the professional industry, athletic training may be perplexing to many people, irrespective of the sector. The athletic trainer, like fitness and endurance instructors, efficiency experts, physiotherapists, and even occupational therapists, serves an important role in the development and upkeep of its players. Athletic training involves the management, assessment, and intervention of emergent, intermittent, and long-term medical disorders, including disability, occupational restrictions, and impairments. Fitness development, which is more prevalent in corporate gymnasium settings, is sometimes mistaken for strength and conditioning training. While athletic trainers possess many of the same talents as fitness experts, their roles and obligations are very diverse.For instance, as athletes develop bigger, subtler, and quicker bodies; athletic trainers have a greater obligation to
adjust to their unique demands. These requirements may encompass, but are not confined to, pain evaluation and diagnosis, recuperation, massage treatment, nutritional support, and accident prevention. According to Ford (2003), when a therapist and a patient are from different cultures, power equilibration becomes more difficult. Furthermore, the hegemonic contemporary cultural background and mindset have had a long-term influence on racial power dynamics, impacting everyday issues linked with prejudice and bigotry. When likened to prior years, the industry is generating more unsatisfied experts, and even more are wishing to quit totally because of racism and ethic disparity. In athletics, athletic trainers’ anxiety levels might rise due to a variety of factors, including the athlete’s desire to return to the field as soon as possible after facing such discriminating actions,
or the manager might decide to play someone despite the trainer’s advice.Because sporting organizations make so many choices, it may be challenging to assign responsibility when problems arise. In this case, the sports trainer is in a strange role since they are responsible for a wide range of concerns inside a single institution. When examining an athletic illness, for example, particularly one involving a star athlete, the trainer’s recommendations might have far-reaching consequences that influence not just the trainer and the player, but perhaps the whole program.Apart from physical and health-related issues, inclusivity and diversity in sports training is a contemporary and expanding issue in the field of kinesiology. Because of ethnic gaps, racism, and job complexity, there is increased stress within the profession, making it increasingly difficult
to perform at the training center. Every aspect of a curriculum might have an influence on how one makes a choice. For example, there is a considerable demand from sportsmen who want to participate and may be required to contest in order to get an education.The manager’s desire, the urge for an athlete to fight for wins, and lastly, the firm’s pressure to fill seats may generate money and pay checks, though at the cost of the trainer. The sports trainer may be faced with scenarios in which not just one, but all of these demands need attention and inclusion. Because the intrinsic unique connection between the two entities makes incompetent legislation so appealing for players to utilize against trainers, it is all too simple to over include
coaching staff and instructors. With the present chain of leadership and bureaucratic structure on college and professional sporting teams, it is unrealistic to hold the trainer liable for negligence allegations if the participant was fully informed of their situation and the hazards of participation.If injury prevention educators and instructors are not cautious of the significantly bigger cultural and academic roles associated with education, they may become accomplices in the research and manufacture of immensely experienced and talented technocratic experts who may not possess the critical threshold of abilities that epitomizes the institution’s romantic ideals and its broader academic intent. If this is permitted to continue, many future sports trainers may find themselves unable to contribute to the bigger, more vital tasks necessary for real democratic participation. To be
clear, the assertion made here does not assume that sports training should not be subjected to and held responsible for quantifiable outcomes that “characterize” the admittance level of athletic training consultants (Adams et al., 2021). Moreover, athletic training does not advocate for the marginalization of contemporary academic benchmarks based on insights that influence the athletic profession and training. Rather, all the institutions’ instructors have a goal that is simultaneous and as significant as the corresponding main program of athletic training.Maintaining awareness of and reverence for higher principles of personal learning and development is critical for all learners. Sports training instructors, as members of the institution, must also consider intellectual awareness as a necessary prerequisite for legally performing the leading professional tasks connected with academia. However, although instructors have
little power over the overall culture of sports, their individualized efforts in the sports training room may have a tremendous impact (Maurer-Starks et al., 2008). One strategy for sports training instructors to improve the minimum threshold of their curriculum and pedagogy is to aggressively incorporate inclusive practices and promote diversity into all elements of their training materials.Professional athletic trainers cannot be solely athletic trainers since athletic coaching is now legally recognized as an affiliated healthcare profession and its practitioners operate in diverse settings with a broad range of patients, trainees, and coworkers. Athletic trainers, on the other hand, must constantly aspire to become lifelong learners competent at connecting with and comprehending a wide range of perspectives, ideas, skills, and viewpoints. Irrespective of the specific corporate setting or work
requirements, most sports therapists are challenged on a constant basis with problems of racism, class, sexual orientation, and ethnic diversity (Day et al., 2021; Maurer-Starks et al., 2008). Because different sociocultural influences occur in both personal and intellectual athletic training environments, trainees must be adequately instructed to accept and handle crucial challenges.Now it is clear that all sports exercise physiology experts will require a substantial multicultural perspective that surpasses competent knowledge and expertise. One that allows for a vital and compassionate perspective on “others’” opinions, and one that empowers the sports training and athletics expert to optimize the landscape and access to care and outreach programs. As a result, sports training curriculums must officially, phenomenologically, and cognitively equip their learners for their upcoming relational, civic, and corporate duties.
The previous National Athletic Trainers’ Association (NATA) report emphasizes the importance of incorporating cultural competency and diversity training into education programs. For these and other reasons, current and future sports training experts, instructors, and learners must become more multiculturally knowledgeable, culturally competent, and socially experienced.Athletic trainers currently operate in a wide range of professional contexts, as seen by the demographic data. In the next few years, instructors and future sports trainers will face an exciting and demanding dynamic in the diversified professional context. Historically, the difficulties involved with racial desegregation among athletic trainers were likely similar to those experienced in wider society. There are concerns about how sports trainers function in various environments. For example, how athletic training students are equipped to deal with problems of racial, socioeconomic,
gender, cultural, and ideological variety may impact, if not determine, athletic trainers’ relative social and professional performance in these varied environments.Aside from technical proficiency, if sports trainers in varied contexts manage the complicated concerns of diversity relationships properly, their professional efficiency and societal approval may flourish. Conversely, if sports trainers struggle with the greater social, political, and interpersonal aspects of their work, their career possibilities may decline with time. As a result, as part of the pedagogical and curricular change underway in exercise science, an increasing number of schools are pursuing plans or designs in order to continue their sports training students. Therefore, more in-depth activities that enable students to identify and explain their own ethnocultural origins will help learners feel connected to the course’s wider learning goals,
incorporated into an academic curriculum to prepare a proficient sports training specialist in an ethnically varied society? Despite the ambiguity, data were gathered through critical examination of other papers, and the findings were organized into themes and subthemes. Ford (2003) conducted research that defined cultural competency in mental health services in order to satisfy the conflicting demands of highly skilled athletic trainers in NATA.
Why Austinville Community Health Centre Is a Good Place for Mrs.. Smith to Receive CareAustville Community Health Centre is an ideal place for Mrs.. Smith to access healthcare services because it is a short distance from where she lives. This means that it is convenient because she can easily access the health center with little or no transport cost. In addition, the small distance between Mrs.. Smith’s home and the Austville center can help her exercise through walking, which is very beneficial in managing her condition. According to research, regular exercise is essential in maintaining a healthy weight and also regulates blood sugar levels (Borse et al. 2021, p. 113). Likewise, the short distance to the facility will make it easy for Mrs.. Smith to get regular check-ups
to ensure her blood sugar remains within the target range.Austville is also a good place for Mrs.. Smith to obtain care because it has multidisciplinary healthcare personnel trained to offer high-quality services to the elderly. In this case, it has several specialists, such as a podiatrist and optometrist, who can detect and treat symptoms associated with type 2 diabetes. Therefore, Mrs.. Smith will be able to obtain appropriate medications for her condition. Likewise, the center has a diabetes educator and provides education programs on diabetes. This implies that Mrs.. Smith will get insightful training on managing her condition. This may include useful tips like how to maintain a healthy diet, test her blood sugar, and the appropriate exercises that aid in weight loss. Such education will help Mrs.
Smith to manage her condition and prevent further complications.The environment around Austville offers Mrs.. Smith an opportunity to establish positive social networks that may benefit her general well-being. Since the health center provides most of its health services to the elderly, Mrs.. Smith may establish friendships with other patients. She may also make friends with her peers during the group exercise programs offered by the center. Similarly, Austville has a community café where people living in the neighborhood can meet and talk. A study shows that stronger social networks and support among the elderly are linked with increased patient adherence to medical treatment and improved self-care (Li 2021, p. 1). In this case, social networks may help Mrs.. Smith maintains her happiness, reducing any incidences of stress that
are detrimental to her health. Equally important, Austville is located in a low socioeconomic community, which implies that it offers low-cost healthcare services. Thus, it is ideal for Mrs.. Smith because she solely relies on her pension.Five Health Professionals That Mrs.. Smith, Will Need to See at the Health Centre, and What Services Each of Them Could OfferSince Austville is a primary healthcare center, Mrs.. Smith can benefit from the services offered by several specialists. The five health professionals that Mrs. Smith would seek assistance from including the podiatrist, optometrist, diabetes educator, physiotherapist, and clinical exercise physiologist. In this case, a podiatrist is a valuable specialist in the diabetes care team. Patients with diabetes are highly predisposed to developing foot problems such as foot ulcers, nerve damage, Charcot
foot, and amputations. A podiatrist is adequately trained to assess any complications associated with a patient’s foot and prepare a treatment and prevention plan (Blanchette et al. 2020, p. 2).These specialists can identify foot health risks and effectively treat them to avoid further complications. In addition, an optometrist is critical in managing Mrs. Smith’s health condition. One of the common symptoms of type 2 diabetes is blurred vision. Thus eye care is essential for patients with diabetes (Ford et al. 2021, p. 1). In this case, an optometrist will check Mrs. Smith’s eyes regularly to detect and treat any injuries or abnormalities associated with her vision.A diabetes educator is crucial in offering valuable insights into the management of diabetes. In this context, a diabetes educator will work collaboratively
with Mrs. Smith to develop an effective treatment plan and educate her on proper nutrition and other positive lifestyle choices (King et al. 2017, p. 2). Patients with diabetes are advised to eat nuts and avocadoes as well as use beans and eggs as a healthy source of protein.They are also directed to consume a diet with fruits, vegetables, lean proteins, and whole grains (Borse et al. 2021, p. 113). The diabetes educator may also recommend regular exercise to help in reducing body weight. Similarly, these professionals also train families to assist patients with diabetes in managing the disease. Likewise, a physiotherapist may assist in alleviating the severity of diabetes through therapeutic exercise programs (Harris-Hayes et al. 2020, p. 12). In this case, a physiotherapist may recommend various
aerobic and resistance programs to Mrs. Smith to help her maintain healthy body weight. Aerobic exercise may include swimming and walking, while resistance activities may comprise yoga, weightlifting, and calisthenics.Finally, Mrs. Smith may require the services of a clinical exercise physiologist (CEP) who is integral personnel to patients with chronic illnesses, especially diabetes. A CEP assesses a patient to determine the most suitable exercise regimen (Pearce & Longhurst 2021, p. 2). They also monitor the exercises to ensure that the patients engage in safe practices. Through such patient-centered exercise programs, patients can maintain healthy body weight and regulate their blood glucose, protecting them against further complications.How Mrs. Smith’s Care Would Be Funded, and the Benefits Mrs. Smith Might Be Eligible forMrs. Smith is on an aged care pension,
one of the income support payments from the Federal Government for individuals who are 66 years and above. Therefore, her primary care may be funded through the aged care scheme. One of the benefits that Mrs. Smith is eligible for is a carer allowance. For people of her age to qualify for this type of government pension, they need to be frail, aged and have a severe illness or disability. If a community health center offers ongoing or continuous primary care services to an individual meeting these criteria, the institution may also qualify for a carer benefit (Payments, Concessions n.d.). This payment intends to help individuals who have assumed responsibilities to care for the geriatric population. This is because unique demands associated with caring for older adults usually
hinder or negatively impact caregivers’ ability to actively engage in formal employment. In this case, since the patient is frail, aged, and has recently been diagnosed with type 2 diabetes, Austville qualifies to receive a carer allowance after every two weeks.Under this national scheme, Mrs. Smith is also entitled to an extra supplement pension. This can help the patient with her bills and drug costs. In addition, since Mrs. Smith is a beneficiary of the Age Pension, this automatically qualifies her for the Pensioner Concession Card (Payments, Concessions n.d.). This means that she can receive healthcare services and utilities and use her Pensioner Card to access more discounted rates on medicines through the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme and other support services. Therefore, all these advantages could mean cheaper medication,
considerable refunds for medical costs, Mrs. Smith having her physician’s visits bulk billed, and reduced rates on household supplies. Others include lower water rates, property, motor vehicle registration, and public transport.The benefits a Primary Health Centre Such as Austville Would Offer for Others in the Local CommunityPrimary health centers have several benefits to people in the local community. Such facilities increase the access to care services for the community residents, especially people with low socioeconomic backgrounds and the elderly. Additionally, primary healthcare institutions provide a range of services to people in the neighborhood. The services may include health promotion, early intervention, preventive care, and screening, as well as treatment and management of acute and chronic health conditions like asthma, cancer, and hypertension. Likewise, primary health centers provide a
broad range of healthcare personnel, such as general practitioners, nurses, social workers, nutritionists, and other allied health professionals.This greatly improves the healthcare outcomes of the residents in the surrounding areas because they can receive high-quality and patient-centered care. According to research, a robust primary healthcare system is linked with low medical costs, improved efficiency, reduced hospitalization rates, increased patient satisfaction, and positive health outcomes (van Weel & Kidd 2018, p. 464). Therefore, the Austville center will provide comprehensive and tailored services to meet the health needs of the locals.Primary health facilities provide continuity of care to local residents. Having a specialist who is familiar with a patient’s medical history is essential. This is because they can adequately recommend an effective treatment method based on the patient’s records. In
addition, such healthcare personnel can efficiently detect a health abnormality in its initial stages due to frequent check-ups and contacts with the patient. It is also important to note that the familiarity between a patient and a physician builds trust and improves communication. Therefore, patients can easily talk about sensitive health issues and receive much-needed help.Not to mention, a primary care doctor may help patients avoid certain health complications that may affect them in the future. In this case, based on a patient’s health records, a physician may detect an increased risk of conditions such as cancer, diabetes, stroke, and obesity, among others. Such information may, in turn, assist a patient on what steps to take to avoid developing the ailments (Agarwal et al. 2017, p. 7). Therefore,
primary care centres offer continuity of care which substantially improves the local residents’ health outcomes.The Community NeedThe growth of the geriatric population has negatively impacted the provision of primary care. This is because older adults have more co-morbidities demanding higher levels of care than the younger generation (van Gaans & Dent 2018, p. 2). Another report shows that one in four senior Australians lives below the poverty line, and individuals aged 65 years and above equals 7 percent of those who are homeless (Face the Facts n.d.). In addition, instances of older adults living alone and away from family members have also been reported.The city’s population growth rate has increased significantly over the last few years, driven mainly by an increase in net overseas migration. The research indicates
that migrants currently represent about 28% of the country’s overall population (Raymer & Baffour 2018, p. 1055). Therefore, issues facing refugees and asylum seekers are also things that Austville endeavors to address. This often involves providing them with the most basic needs, such as food, education, and temporary housing. The implication here is that Austville must be adequately equipped to address the challenges of growing senior citizens and cultural diversity. The goal is also to assist informal caregivers like friends and neighbours who provide daily assistance to these groups.SolutionSince the community has continued to experience a high growth rate of the older population and an increasing number of migrants, inadequate clinical and social services have left these individuals in a dire situation. Austville sees the opportunity to continue
running primary care, community café, education group exercise, and English conversation programs to enhance these groups’ dependent functioning and social integration. A study shows that community-based support can help senior citizens live safely in their residences and delay institutionalization (Robinson et al. 202, p. 133). Austville provides older patients with various services, resources, and general assistance around their homes. These include fitness training, nutritional support, and consultation and coaching services about health and aging.The organization’s staff members also provide counseling services to older adults’ informal caregivers and general assistance with finances. Similarly, research indicates that language proficiency is crucial to social integration and increases their chances of securing employment and promoting social and political participation (Lundberg 2020, p. 4). For this reason, Austville also runs English language classes,
those living with chronic illnesses to enhance their recovery.Offering English language training can also improve social engagement and improve migrants’ opportunities and acceptance in the community. For these stated reasons, Austville wants to continue offering these services and get more professionals involved to ensure that these people receive the resources and services they need. Therefore, these are some reasons Austville is applying for a $2,000 grant to fund some of its operations.
Mission StatementThe organization’s main mission is anchored on improving the lives of many individuals in the world who are affected by Attention-Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD). Moreover, the organization values integrity and appreciates open communication. In addition, the organization observes service quality provision and nurtures flexibility of their teamwork in satisfying customers. Diversity is also another factor that the organization strives to incorporate into all of its systems.Summary of ServicesChildren and Adults with Attention-Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder (CHADD) is an organization that is determined to handle individuals affected by ADHD. The organization was founded in 1987 following the rampant frustration and isolation that parents experienced due to ADHD-affected children. There were no agencies and groups to intervene for families with children affected by ADHD during this time. Therefore, CHADD came into existence
IntroductionSignificantly, health care safety and well-being are key issues towards achieving a quality healthy population. The complexity of patient technology has been transforming. Before, nurses used to touch, smell, and hear about monitoring patients when caring for patients. With the current evolution of technology, various measures have been developed to enhance and improve health care services which have been of great success (Alotaibi and Federico, 2017). While technological changes elaborate both problems and solutions in enhancing patient safety, much must be done to overcome the issues. One of the devolved technological strategies involves Automated IV Pumps, a device used to administer medication. The introduction of Automated IV Pumps has led to both negative and positive impacts in the nursing profession based on the illustration.The necessity of providing quality
health care is the level to which health services to populations increases the probability of meeting desired health care outcomes. Automated IV Pumps are one of the key technological advancements in health care which is a device designed to help nurses give the right dosage. Using Automated IV Pumps has improved the efficiency of service care, reduced errors and flexibility, which is believed to improve general patient safety. To a greater extent, safety measures such as following instructions, monitoring and dosage must be considered.The problem of the statementDespite the technological advancements in health care, 100% attained of patient safety is still an issue. The rising number of patient issues are increasing hence calling for more attention to carry out more research (Wei et al.,2021). Patient safety and care
are the major concerns to all hence the study will evaluate the patient outcomes related to use of Automated IV Pumps to come up with the necessary measures. Alternatively, there is a little improvement of care services in nursing profession.However much the technological measures have improved the level of patient care, there are still issues about patient safety concerning the use of technological evolutions, such as they have Automated IV Pumps. Patient issues, such as medical errors, are one of the key obstacles which should be minimized to ensure safety and well being.Objectives of the studyThe study’s main objective will look at the major impacts of Automated IV Pumps in the nursing profession. Further, the study will achieve this by assessing the outcome of patients undergoing medications using
Automated IV Pumps.Research questionTo determine the impacts of Automated IV Pumps in nursing profession.Justification of the studyMy study will aim at finding out both positive and negative impacts of Automated IV Pumps on patient care and safety to give the necessary support to use Automated IV Pumps in the nursing profession or not.FindingsNurses involves in a lot of activities on delivering quality patient care. The evolution of technology such as use of Automated IV Pumps is of great achievement since it enhances accurate judgement of drug administration. Patient care should no longer be a guess work instead accuracy and consistency. On the other hand, the use of Automated IV Pumps lightens the work of nurses who are overworked. The impact of Automated IV Pumps has been felt in
reduction of medical errors, easy infusion capabilities, and simple usage,Reduction of errorsWrong dosage and medication to the human body can be hazardous. Nursing medication administration errors has been reduced since it gives the right dosage appropriately. The use of pumps offers the sure way to administer medications making safer environment for patients. In addition, it makes the work environment for nursing professionals who have to give medications using IV’s.Infusion capabilitiesAn infusion pump system is not a fixed piece of equipment, it can be tailored to various conditions. Having anything too large to move might waste time and energy. It has a simplified process of infusion that can save a patient’s life if triaging them in an unfavorable place. Also, hospitals frequently deal with crises, an infusion system that
can be moved across the building is beneficial. A smart infusion system allows to use it in non-traditional settings, therefore, to serve more patients.Simple user interfaceUsing a infusion pump does not require a technician. A person does not even need to know how to program it. It is simple and easy to read, which helps when providing IVs quickly. These IV pumps are fantastic choices for nearly any medical facility because of their accuracy and ease of usage.Pros of Automated IV PumpsAlternatively, Automated IV Pumps have less medical errors and have alerts to reduce the rate of errors. On the other hand, they are flexible and convenient to nurses as they can be easily carried around and used during emergencies. Above all, Automated IV Pumps simplify the treatment
Pumps are expensive to purchase hence limiting other health care organizations and nurses to provide safe care. In addition, programmed language of Automated IV Pumps may have an error which might lead to serious health effects to patients leading to low patient care and safety.ConclusionHaving reduced medication errors and flexibility of Automated IV Pumps, Nurses have lately achieved a lot in care and patient safety. On the other hand, the positive impacts of using Automated IV Pumps outweighs negative impacts of the device use. I would therefore recommend continuous use of the Automated IV Pumps in drug administration and medications. Further, there are improvements measures to out do negative impacts of using Automated IV Pumps.
The article by Vargas and Soriano is dedicated to an innovative solution in the educational field, namely the use of blockchain technology in Edublocs. In the introduction, scientists note the problems of the modern educational system that can be solved with the help of Edublocs (Vargas & Scott, 2019). The main feature of the blockchain is the impossibility of loss, damage, or forgery of an educational document. Since a block created once can no longer be changed, it cannot be deleted from the network (Fedorova & Skobleva, 2020). In this way, the reliability and integrity of the data are guaranteed, and the learning history can become completely transparent.This is followed by both a theoretical and a practical overview of the Edublocs platform. The first section of the main
SummaryNursing is an often-undervalued profession, which is essential to an efficiently functioning hospital environment. Nursing theory has a valuable and established input on the effectiveness of the nursing staff in real-life situations (Oducado et al., 2019). Nevertheless, nursing practices and customs are most effective and widely used in everyday scenarios. However, since the theory-practice gap remains significant (Greenway et al., 2019) it is often the case that the staff acts in established ways without understanding the underlying reasons for the customs. This can be problematic for several reasons, including motivation and credibility. Firstly, the students might think of theory as a waste of time and hence be less motivated to study. Secondly, it might decrease the trust between the patients and the nurses, as the credibility of the
nursing staff falters. Lastly, it might negatively affect patient care quality (Salifu et al., 2018) if the nurses are unable to act efficiently in unfamiliar situations. Therefore, it is vital to learn the background of the nursing practices in order to understand why they are the way that they are today, and how to amend them if the situation needs a novel solution.Describe the evolution of nursing practiceThe nursing profession as it is known today can be traced back to Florence Nightingale, a nurse in the mid-19 th century. During the numerous wars that were to follow in the 20 th century, the profession’s importance was amplified, aiding the soldiers significantly. Nightingale had to go against the societal norms of the time to follow her beliefs that she
should be able to aid who she wants (“How the Evolution of the Nursing Profession Benefits Nurses & Patients Alike,” 2019). During the Civil War and the two World Wars, the significance of the nursing profession became undeniable, raising the credibility of women willing to help.Over the years, the nursing profession has been shaped and reshaped many times. Firstly, there is now formal education available to those willing to become caretakers. Based on the theories and practices that have been established, this allows the knowledge to be passed on safely. Furthermore, as the nursing profession became more recognized, those affiliated with it also gained more duties and responsibilities. It is vital for nurses to remain sharp and efficient in their daily decisions, as some of them might be
life-saving. Lastly, there are now safety and quality procedures and standards that ensure that each and every patient receives the best quality of care.Identify and compare key players to the foundation of nursing practiceFlorence NightingaleAs mentioned in the previous section, one of the most famous nurses in history was the Mother of Modern Nursing. Florence Nightingale started her nursing career by training in Egypt and later went on to serve in the British military during the Crimean War. There, she began the practices that have shaped nursing as it is known today.Clara BartonClara Barton was a teacher before the American Civil War, a profession she later was forced to give up for the sake of delivering medical supplies to the troops. Although her name might not be as
familiar as some other ones, the organization she founded, the American Red Cross, remains active to this day. Barton herself worked closely with her creation through 1904.Mary BreckinridgeMary Breckinridge was a nurse-midwife who founded the New Model of Rural Health Care & Frontier Nursing Service, which aims at delivering health care to rural women and children. Since 1925, when the organization was founded, it has been an immense help to thousands of people nationwide. It has helped reduce maternal and infant mortality rates largely, and still operates today.Dorothea DixAlthough today mental health is getting a lot of spotlights, when Dorothea Dix founded the first mental asylum in the early 1800s it was still a completely unknown area. While today it is generally understood that there are certain people
that deserve to be treated for their mental issues rather than ostracized, this was not always the case. Dix advocated for mental health rights before the state and Congress and has shaped the current civil rights of the mentally ill.Margaret SangerMargaret Sanger was the founder of Planned Parenthood, which came to life after the untimely death of her mother from difficult pregnancies. While she was being treated in a hostile manner and was even forced to flee to Europe, she did not give up on her beliefs. On her eventual return to the United States, she opened the first birth control clinic.Mary MahoneyMary Mahoney was and is an inspiration to many as the first African-American nurse in the US. Following her example, many other women entered nursing schools
and believed in their ability to become nurses. Mahoney also founded the National Association of Colored Graduate Nurses in an attempt to promote the profession to Black women.Walt WhitmanWhile many might know Whitman for his beautiful poems and novels and generally as a literary icon, he is also notable for serving as a nurse during the Civil War. In a time when nursing was regarded largely as a female profession, this was an important step that inspired many. Furthermore, his experience influenced his writing and the readers of his works.Lillian WaldLillian Wald is the co-founder of the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People. After the illness of her sister, Wald became increasingly interested in the profession and went on to join the New York Hospital Training
is lower than it should be. Furthermore, it is vital to manage the expectations that patients have of the nursing staff in order to provide them with the best quality of care. According to Girmay et al. (2018), the poor perception of nurses from the patients is hindering the quality of care. Therefore, there is a need to address these issues by increasing the visibility of nursing practices and building patient-caregiver trust.
IntroductionResearchers worldwide have been studying the concept of backpacking tourism for a long period of time, expanding the existing knowledge about this sphere. Nevertheless, backpacking as a movement is constantly undergoing changes which lead to new iterations and trends. Essentially, the needs and desires of the modern backpacker are different from those which were relevant a decade ago. Therefore, there is a necessity to study the existing situation and to explore the new trends popular among the members of the backpacking community. Knowledge about the most topical trends in the realm of backpacking can be important for different industries, but especially the hospitality one. Thus, the current research focuses on determining the latest trends in the sphere of backpacking tourism and identifies ways how they can be adopted
by hospitality businesses. Yet, in order to conduct quality research, it is crucial to analyze the existing academic literature on the topic of backpacking and hospitality. The current literature review will focus on three main research objectives: establishing the attractiveness of backpacking for younger generations, identifying hostels’ methods of making travelers’ experiences special, and analyzing solutions for the long-term sustainability of backpacking trends.Objective 1: Backpacking and Younger GenerationsBackpacking is a relatively new phenomenon which emerged several decades ago, which explains the lack of academic research on the topic in the 20 th century. The concept of drifter-tourism introduced by Cohen (1973) in the 1970s was one of the first attempts of researchers to explore the topic of unconventional tourism. The idea of drifter-tourism referred to a least institutionalized
It is important to note that the decision-making process is a complex and highly intricate activity, which involves the accuracy of the information, a clear vision of objectives, and an understanding of the underlying issues. Errors in the decision-making process are common and can be done by any manager. However, there is a clear distinction between a bad decision and a wrong decision. In the case of the latter, the decision is the result of reliance on false or inaccurate information with the best intentions to make a correct choice. When it comes to a bad decision, a manager is aware of and has accurate information and a proper understanding of key factors but intentionally chooses the incorrect path. A bad decision might occur due to a wide
the integrity of processes of data acquisition and collection. It is stated that decisions can be “impaired by various inconsistencies and errors, which negatively affect the value of these data for any decision-making processes” (Schuh et al., 2017, p. 425). Therefore, proper automation of data collection methods on the basis of accuracy and integrity can greatly improve the overall knowledge available to a manager. By being able to see a wider and clearer picture of a situation, a manager will be capable of making correct decisions.

IntroductionBarclays bank is a UK-based Multinational Corporation headquartered in London and operates in the financial niche. The universal bank was established in 1860 in London as a goldsmith’s lending business offering people loans and saving options. The bank’s resilience in the corporate domain made it navigate all the challenges, and it still operates to date. Barclays bank remains relevant in the financial industry because it analyses societal trends and changes its operations to suit human needs. At the height of feminism in the 1950s, it became the first bank to appoint a female manager in 1958, Hilda Harding, who served the bank until her superannuation in 1970. The bank has more than 4750 branches located in different parts of the world in 55 countries. However, 1600 of the
branches are located in the UK. Barclays bank has thrived in finance because it leverages technology, social listening, and adopting an effective leadership structure.Description of the OrganizationThe bank operates in two distinct divisions for efficiency, Barclays UK and Barclays International, all of which are supported by the Barclays executive Services. The bank’s standard services include wealth management, investment, retail, and commercial banking. The bank boasts of having employed over 83,500 members of staff to ensure the smooth delivery of services to the organisation (Haralayya and Aithal, 2021).Although the business started as a partnership between James Barclays and other goldsmiths, the state of ownership has changed over the year to remain in tandem with the practices and regulations affecting the people. In 1981, it changed its entity and re-registered
as a public limited company (Vakhrusheva et al., 2021). The state of ownership allows members of the public to purchase shares. Some of the most significant shareholders in the company include Raymond James, Natixis advisors, and Cambiar Investors LLC. In 2021, the bank generated a total profit of 5.75 billion sterling pounds (Barnes and Newton, 2022). The bank uses strategic management options and cultural competence to thrive in different regions with different cultures.Description of the Organization’s StructureBarclays bank is a British universal bank owned by shareholders. Since it is a limited liability company, the shareholder’s property cannot be sold when the bank fails to pay its debts (Vakhrusheva et al., 2021). The principal shareholders of Barclays Bank include Qatar investment authority, Dodge and cox, BlackRock fund advisors, and
the Vanguard Group Inc. The organisational hierarchy is headed by the Barclays execution services (BX), which manages the two main groups, Barclays international and Barclays UK. The CEO further appoints directors to every functional area of the bank to make it work efficiently (Barnes and Newton, 2022). The bank’s primary business model is sales and trading, where the sales agents solicit ideas and opportunities from prospects. At the same time, traders advise clients and execute orders to ensure the client’s goals are attained (Schachter, 2018). It is imperative to note that the organisation’s leadership structure allows for a closed feedback loop.Figure 1: Barclays Business Structure (Ozili, 2022).The chief operations officer (COO) and execution services are virtual offices that coordinate and evaluate all operations. Mark Ashton is the current
position holder and coordinates Barclays UK and Barclays International (Schachter, 2018). The COO receives reports from the management committee, which comprises the CEO, Coimbatore Sundararajan, the chairman of the board and the different directors for crucial operations. Specialisation and division of labour are encouraged as each exceptional service, such as investment banking, wealth management, and compliance, requires a director who concentrates on the assignment.All the directors report to the executive committee to grant better services in the long run. Barclay’s organisational structure promotes specialisation and division of labour (Bari and Syazwani, 2018). Closed loop reporting and a feedback mechanism designed through the structure make the universal bank thrive despite the turbulence in the banking sector. Contemporary companies must learn from Barclay’s organisational structure for effective communication, feedback, and
decision-making.Barclay’s Key Management TheoryThe leadership style and organisational structure use Fredrick Taylor’s scientific theory. According to the scientific management theory, leaders must break down tasks and allocate them to specialised people other than relying on the employee’s decisions. The approach explains that everyone can be trained to deliver on their speciality. Barclays uses the top COO to supervise and receive information from directors specialising in their field (Schachter, 2018). Barclays benefits from the scientific leadership theory because it increases collaboration and enhances team efficiency and objectivity. When the correct extrinsic and intrinsic motivations are used, the employees are likely to be more creative, motivated, and result oriented to ensure that they deliver positive results (Tahir, 2018). Although the scientific theory of management by Fredrick Taylor is no longer
being applied in many businesses today, most of the application principles are evident in Barclay’s structure.External Influences That Might Impact Barclays GrowthA strategic SWOT analysis is conducted on a business to determine its strengths, weaknesses, opportunity and threats. The strengths and opportunities eliminate the organisation’s weaknesses and threats (Bari and Syazwani, 2018). Similarly, the PESTLE analysis determines the political, economic, social, technological, and legal factors likely to affect an organisation or determine whether the business would fail. The political environment is an external factor which can help favour the organization when the law supports profitability. Social factors include the demographics and characteristics which make people seek services from the organisation (Tahir, 2018). The three critical external areas that Barclays should focus on include social, political, and economic factors.
Although the factors are beyond the organisation’s sphere of influence, the management can take them into account and work with the relevant external stakeholders to improve its performance.Social FactorsThe social factors in an organisational analysis include society, culture, and how it affects people in the long run. The banking industry can only thrive when people in society are successful in their economic endeavours. For example, when the demographics have a small number of people with formal training, unemployment will be high, and the business will not have potential customers (Bari and Syazwani, 2018).Further, gender stereotyping and lack of entrepreneurial spirit may negatively affect the business as society members will lack economic empowerment. Barclays can leverage social factors to empower people to be financially independent in the community. Investing
in corporate social responsibility by offering entrepreneurial training, giving people loans to develop themselves, and increasing their saving capacity makes Barclays an economic jump starter in society. Consequently, the bank will get customers, and it may thrive in the long run. However, corporate social responsibility must be implemented strategically to add organisational value.Political FactorsPolitical factors play a significant role in the operations of banks. Political instability, unfavourable taxes, corruptions, and pricing regulations are part of the external environment that may hinder a company’s growth (Haralayya and Aithal, 2021). Although the factors are out of Barclay’s control, it can partner with other relevant organisations to lobby the government for changes in policies to make them favourable such as reducing the minimum wage and setting an interest rate that guarantees
profits (Ozili, 2022). Further, having new rules on mandatory employee savings will increase the revenue for the bank. The bank must therefore hire a legal director to monitor and evaluate political regulations and lobby for rates and regulations that favour the bank.Economic FactorsWhen conducting the PESTLE analysis, Barclay’s bank should consider the economic factors that may lead to poor organisational performance. The economic system in which a country operates must be considered to ensure the operations are in tandem with the economic system being operated in the country (Purshouse, 2020). For example, if a country it operates in has a socialist economic system, it should design its operations to meet the expectation of the people. Further, the level of government invention in strengthening the economy must be analysed
company. The ownership status in such an entity is through the shareholders, and public members are always welcome to buy shares. The company has numerous motivated workers who are willing to perform better. The organisational structure depicts bureaucratic relationships and division of labour as per Taylor’s theory. The PESTEL analysis is an essential tool used to determine whether or not an organisation can thrive. Barclays must consider the political, social, and economic factors to blossom.
I think that I could become an ally of the LGBT population. This group requires assistance because heterosexual couples have unearned entitlements and conferred dominance (Edwards, 2006). In particular, heterosexual individuals did not do anything specific to earn this dominance, while representatives of sexual minorities are deprived of this privilege because of their sexual orientation. From my point of view, this state of affairs is not appropriate and should be addressed, meaning that I could act as an ally for social justice. Edwards (2006) stipulates that members of dominant groups are also hurt, denoting that the efforts to impede, amend, redefine, and dismantle the existing systems are necessary to address the situation. This information reveals that allying with the LGBT population can be productive for the group and
The main difference with regard to various gender theories is how they explain the gendered differences in behaviors characteristic for both sexes. When applied to the issue of behavioral problems in males, different theories find their causes in different sources. Biological determinism would explain behavioral issues in male students through the concept of male nature as inherently and naturally competitive, aggressive, and even violent (Tilling, 2013). However, this essentialist theory is at odds with the now well-established understanding that, while some people are predisposed toward delinquency, social influences are a far more prominent cause thereof (Delcea et al., 2019). In contrast to biological determinism, the social construction of gender theory posits that people enact gendered behaviors as they learn them from others and internalize gender norms dominant in
As apparent from the title, the focus of the article “Positive leadership psychology: Authentic and servant leadership in higher education in Pakistan” is the Pakistani educational system, whose organization the authors analyze through the lens of leadership. Specifically, they examine the role of centralized guidance in the learning process and speculate on which style can influence its participants in the most favorable ways. In particular, the piece highlights the importance of relationships of trust in education. According to the authors, any suppressive hierarchy, strict subordination, or an atmosphere of complete obedience prevents people from openness, becoming a serious obstacle to social exchange. The latter is seen as the foundation of productive teamwork and presupposes an awareness of the other’s feelings as well as motives for searching for the
Love is not simply a feeling but a complex physiological process that occurs in the human body and involves different mechanisms. The chapter “Biochemistry of love” by Carter & Porges provides an insight into the biological basis of love and relationship. The key concepts explored in the chapter include the role of oxytocin and vasopressin in the creation of emotional bonds.Social behavior is part of the process of evolution, and it can be found among the most primitive species. At the same time, the social behaviors of humans are more diverse, and love is only one of the possible forms. Nevertheless, the feeling of love experienced by people still begins in the core part of the human brain, which encounters certain sensations transmitted by the vagus nerve. On
the biochemical level, neuropeptides oxytocin and vasopressin play major roles. For instance, oxytocin is a hormone responsible for strengthening a lasting bond between a mother and her child (Carter & Porges, 2022). Still, other adults also can experience an increase in oxytocin when they see a newborn, and this situation can contribute to their desire to engage in caretaking. Moreover, oxytocin facilitates eye contact and social cognition, which are essential elements of love.Research shows that oxytocin is not the only hormone contributing to a loving relationship since it usually works together with vasopressin. The latter is a neuropeptide that coordinates aggression and protective conduct; therefore, by working with oxytocin, they create a balance. For instance, oxytocin, which can decrease stress, helps children to undergo distress related to the
separation from their mothers, thus supporting their health.The other two notable concepts described in the chapter are the impact of love on the child’s development and the differences related to early-life experiences. Males are particularly sensitive to early traumatic experiences, which can lead to higher levels of vasopressin in the body which can make them more aggressive. Essentially, negative experiences, including the absence of love, can undermine the health of people on the level of genes. Moreover, men generally often tend to experience higher levels of vasopressin in situations involving a threat.At the same time, oxytocin exposure during early life stages promotes the ability of a person to love others and form social bonds. Additionally, social engagement is crucial for maintaining oxytocin on an appropriate level since isolation
believe it is essential that people continue studying the effects of oxytocin and vasopressin on the human body. Specifically, additional research on the impact of hormones on mental health would be beneficial for the creation of new medication for people subject to traumatic experiences.Carter & Porges, in the chapter “Biochemistry of love,” demonstrate how human interactions and love are intertwined with the oxytocin and vasopressin hormones. The former actively participates in the creation of social bonds and reduces the impact of stress, and contributes to the ability of people to experience love. The latter is responsible for protective aggression and is higher among men, which causes them to be more likely to be traumatized and have disruptions on the genetic level.
Selection: “To Be Free” (2017)  * Artist: Jamaal Barber  * Art Form: Carved Wood Block  * Time Period: 21st CenturyBiographical Profile of Jamaal BarberJamaal Barber is a modern African American artist specializing in printmaking and woodcuts. The artist was born in Virginia and raised in Littleton, North Carolina (“Jamaal Barber”). He showed interest in art from a young age, fascinated by images in children’s and comic books. Then, Barber started drawing in elementary school and would draw on anything he could find (“Jamaal Barber”). However, Barber’s early passion would not lead him to become a full-time artist.Barber’s major in college was business, but he switched it to art. Barber realized that he wanted “to make this art stuff work” when he had taken a “drawing
class as an elective” (Johnson). Barber won several ECU student art awards during his years at East Carolina University. Notably, he won the JOSA Award of Excellence in Drawing in 2002 and got first place in the graphic design competition of the Rebel Magazine (“Jamaal Barber”). In 2003, Barber graduated from ECU with a bachelor’s degree in Communication Arts and took a 15-year break from studying to foster his personal view of artistry (“Jamaal Barber”; Johnson). In 2004, Barber moved to Atlanta, Georgia, and resides there with his wife and kids (“About”). The artist was actively creating during the break while working as a graphic designer for Iota Phi Theta Fraternity, Inc. and Spoken Magazine. His works have been displayed at the Ao5 Gallery and the Mano A
Mano art show (“Jamaal Barber”).Furthermore, Barber’s works have been published by Penguin Random House, Black Art in America, and Emory University, as well as on social media platforms and in the New York Times (“About”). From 2018, Barber went for a master’s degree in Printmaking at Georgia State University. His focus on printmaking began when he saw a demonstration on making a screen print at a local art store in 2013 (“About”). The artist’s prints and woodcuts are displayed at ZuCot Gallery and have been part of various art shows such as the Decatur Arts Festival and the Atlanta Print Biennial exhibit (“About”). In his works, Barber explores Black identity and showcases aspects of African American life (Johnson). His pieces are dynamic, thought-provoking, and experimental, depicting the perception
of African Americans by themselves and society.Critical Analysis of “To Be Free”I selected one of Barber’s recent woodcuts because it showcases the social reality in which many African Americans live to date. The theme of the piece is the desire and struggle for freedom. The carving consists of a black man looking to his right and four white hands holding him by the shirt. The man’s expression is calm and thoughtful, indicating that he sees desired destination and is unconcerned with the impediment. He seems to be in motion: he starts moving towards the said destination. The hands are clenched and tense, stretching and nearly tearing the man’s clothing. It shows how they try to stop the man no matter what. The contrast between calmness and aggressiveness is
striking and indicates a contest of persistence with the sheer power of reality. The artist has used a contrasting black and white palette that enhances said competition. Barber’s art piece from the same exhibition says: “Black is never neutral.” Interestingly enough, black is defined as a neutral color, but the artist makes it non-neutral in his piece. ‘To Be Free’ implies that black is a resistance surrounded by heavy and oppressing whiteness.I think that Barber wants to show the hegemony of white America over the perception of black people. Tariq notes that Barber brings to light how “blackness is hyper-visible only when it is not seen as a threat to white wealth, power, privilege and safety.” The piece depicts how white society often attempts to dictate the freedom
of a black person, employing discriminating views, stereotypes, and boundaries. Another implication that can be made is that the hands pulling the clothes will only receive the clothes. Historically, clothes were symbolic of status and caste in society. The man is determined to escape, and his body will not be taken, but he may lose his clothing. Here, the clothes seem to be the man’s false skin, the symbol of perception of himself and his place in society imposed by said society.I would classify the piece as black art because it questions the harsh reality of African Americans in modern times. The exhibition is called Bright Black , and it revolves around what Barber sees as “the American Color Theory” and breaking “hegemonic modes of seeing” of black
people by society (Tariq). Barber propagate African Americans to be strong and unflappable like the man on the carving. The will of the individual, the man, overshadows society’s discriminating imposition, the hands. They have grabbed a strong individual by his imposed identity, and the man has complete control over the situation. To be free, he needs to let go of so-called ‘hegemonic modes of seeing’ and be true to himself.Selection: “Portrait of the Artist as a Shadow of His Former Self” (1980)  * Artist: Kerry James Marshall  * Art Form: Paper Painting  * Time Period: Postmodernism/New BlacknessBiographical Profile of Kerry James MarshallKerry James Marshall is an African American painter and printmaker. He was born in Birmingham, Alabama, in 1955 (Yood). The artist is known for
his unique style, representing ordinary people and questioning social dogmas. Marshall studied at the Otis Art Institute in Los Angeles and got his Bachelor of Fine Arts in 1978 (Yood). Marshall used a collage technique in his early works and was actively creating in the 1970s. However, the turning point for his career came in 1980 with the ‘Portrait of the Artist as a Shadow of His Former Self’ (Easter). It was the first of Marshall’s famous black figures that have become characteristic of his style.Marshall has been living in Chicago most of his life. He moved there with his future wife, Cheryl Lynn Bruce, in 1987 after he finished a residency for the Studio Museum in Harlem. In Chicago, he worked as a professor at the University
of Illinois from 1993 to 2006 (Yood). During this period, the artist made numerous paintings and series depicting the life and culture of African Americans and the social issues they face and received several awards. MacArthur Foundation gave Marshall’ Genius Grant’ in 1997, and Otis Art Institute awarded him with an honorary doctorate in 1999 (Yood). Other honors include a fellowship from the National Endowment for the Arts (1991), Wolfgang Hahn Prize (2014), Rosenberger Medal (2016), Chicago’s Fifth Star Award (2017) and WEB. Du Bois Medal (2019) (“Kerry James Marshall: Biography”). In 2013, Marshall was appointed to the President’s Committee on the Arts and the Humanities. The artist has been widely praised for his influence on US culture and art.Marshall’s works have been exhibited not only in the
US but in Europe too. Numerous museums and art centres in Chicago, Los Angeles, New York, Washington, San Francisco, Minneapolis, and Boston hold his paintings in their collections. For example, Chicago’s Museum of Contemporary Art or Washington’s National Gallery (“Kerry James Marshall: Biography”). Other well-known institutions throughout the US have been organizing solo shows since the late 1990s. Abroad exhibitions have been held in Vancouver, Vienna, London, Kassel, Venice, Antwerp, Copenhagen, Barcelona, and Madrid. The most prominent displays were Documenta in Kassel in 1997 and 2007, the Venice Biennale in 2003, and David Zwirner in London in 2014 and 2018 (Yood; “Kerry James Marshall: Biography”). Additionally, the artist was commissioned to create a grand mural for the High Line in 2015. Such presence in museums and galleries and
the number of awards and honors clearly show an immense contribution that Marshall has made to the art world and for the representation of African Americans worldwide.Critical Analysis of “Portrait of the Artist as a Shadow of His Former Self”I chose one of the most famous works by Marshall, ‘Portrait of the Artist , ’ because it is crucial for the development of the artist’s unique style and thematic focus on African American life and culture. The painting is a metaphorical depiction of white America’s unfair perception of black people. The artist painted the ‘self-portrait’ on a tiny piece of paper (8 by 6½ inches) using egg tempera (Easter). The painting depicts a black figure looking at the viewer with a big toothy smile. The figure wears a
black hat and coat and stands over a black background. The piece is predominantly black with some grey-white for shirt, teeth, eyes, and dark red for gums.The smallness of the piece creates an interesting illusion. First, while at some distance, the viewer sees only blackness with some white spots. The shirt, eyes, and devilish grin become visible, moving a little closer. Finally, shades of black emerge, and the shadow becomes a smiling person in dark clothing. Moreover, the smile no longer seems malevolent or mischievous; the person is cheerful, and the image is perceived as optimistic. Easter argues that some might see a connection between the piece and the racist practice of blackface, but Marshall, most probably, did not intend to make such connections. The artist painted a
‘Portrait of the Artist’ was Marshall’s experiment with black paint. White notes how black is “as chromatically rich as every other color on the spectrum” in Marshall’s works (as cited in Easter). The experiment’s success gave the world dozens of brilliant paintings that depict the richness of African American culture and raise awareness about issues that African Americans face daily. That is why I believe that ‘Portrait of the Artist’ is an important contribution to black art.
The spectrum of race weighs heavily on the history of the United States and Canada and keeps on shaping the life experiences of Black people living in both countries. According to Reynolds (2016), not only is race a central element of history and culture, but it also determines the writing and reading of history. That is why Canada’s policy of multiculturalism contributed to the adoption of Black History Month, which initially originated in the United States and took place every February. It is the time during which people are encouraged to participate in festivities and events honoring the legacy of Black folks and their communities.Black History Month in Canada has been conducive to schools teaching about diversity and the ancestry of African cultures. Prince (2009) states that it
is, indeed, extremely important – but a special month is not enough. She recalls coming to schools every February to read stories to kids, providing them with a Black perspective on their history. That, in Prince’s (2009) opinion, is simply a crumb that Blacks are offered to settle for and stop there. It contributes to the amplification of the compartmentalized version of Black people’s history, which only further perpetuates a hegemony that denies their existence. An example of that, at one time, was a librarian’s suggestion that Prince read from a collection of Anansi stories instead of something she picked from her children’s book. This was justified by the fact that none of the kids in the audience were Black, but all of them understood Anansi, as well
is not simply an option to consider – it is an absolute necessity. Instead of devoting twenty-eight days to the Black perspective and then ignoring it for the rest of the year, the government is to implement the exploration of the world’s history into the regular syllabus. Not only will it contribute to the destruction of harmful myths and to a fuller understanding of the cause-effect relationship between certain events – but it will also make Black children feel represented. For a country that prides itself on encouraging multicultural policies, all of these are equally important.
Maternal health refers to women’s wellbeing when pregnant, during childbirth, and postpartum. Black women in most parts of the world undergo unacceptable poor maternal health results, including disproportionately high death rates (Davis, 2020, p. 56). Health and societal system factors play a significant role in black women’s high maternal mortality rates and poor health outcomes. As a result, these women of color have barriers to receiving competent healthcare services and face racial discrimination. Davis (2020, p. 58) argues that factors such as sexism and racism adversely affect black women’s healthcare outcomes and medical care use. For instance, these women of color are likely to be uninsured, experience significant financial issues with healthcare, and are unlikely to access prenatal care compared to white women. At the same time, black
women have high chronic health issues and preventable illnesses such as cardiovascular diseases, hypertension, and diabetes. As a result, these health conditions adversely affect infant and maternal healthcare results when these women choose to become pregnant (Davis, 2020, p. 59). However, women of color deserve healthy and safe pregnancies and childbirth. Therefore, what factors affect black maternal health, and what systematic changes should be implemented to ensure it is improved globally?There is a significant connection between black maternal health and women in social topics. For instance, some communities discriminate against women because of gender, color, physical ability, class, and ethnicity. Davis (2020, p. 59) explains that other individuals believe that men should be more powerful than women; therefore, they disregard ideas such as women’s leadership. Some people believe
that women’s primary responsibility is taking care of the home and giving birth. These perceptions adversely affect women, leading to mental health illnesses (Davis, 2020, p. 60). Therefore, it is crucial to change people’s perspectives and views about women in society. This can be achieved by encouraging the community to view women positively and accommodate them in society.The black maternal topic has attracted many people’s attention globally. As a result, it is crucial to determine why the number of women of color in maternal and childbirth deaths is increasing in the world. It is also essential to discover the causes of more maternal complications in black women than in white individuals. This topic will help individuals identify why healthcare organizations serving women of color have lower-quality maternity care.
People should understand the challenges that black women experience to have reproductive care that meets their needs. This care is essential because it assists women in planning their families and enhances women’s and children’s healthcare outcomes.Intersectionality involves acknowledging and understanding that every person experiences oppression and discrimination differently. Intersectionality can be used in black maternal health topics to determine and identify its causes, such as race, physical ability, and sexual orientation. These factors have adversely affected women of color globally, leading to income inequality. For example, for every dollar paid to a non-Hispanic white man, a black woman gets sixty-three cents. Corresponding to Crear-Perry et al. (2021, p. 230), the lost wages push women of color to choose between necessities such as healthcare, food, and housing because they
have less money to support their livelihood. Additionally, most individuals believe that black women are strong and can handle strenuous activities than white women. Understanding the different factors contributing to black maternal health will enable individuals to develop strategies that tackle every issue for women of color.Healthcare professionals, policymakers, and the community have a vital role in enhancing black women’s maternal health. Expansion and maintenance of health care coverage throughout women of color’s lifespan, including preventive health care access, for instance, birth control, is crucial. Only 87% of reproductive-age black females have health insurance (Crear-Perry et al., 2021, p. 233). In addition, women of color should receive high-quality, safe, culturally competent, and respectful healthcare. Healthcare and public policies should prioritize offering patient-centered care to satisfy black women’s individualized
have reasonable accommodations for pregnant women.In summary, black women deserve healthy and safe pregnancies and childbirth. Systematic adjustments starting with the healthcare system, enhance healthcare access and provide healthier work and live places for women of color. Improving black maternal healthcare outcomes will enable women of color to achieve optimal wellbeing and health throughout their life. As a result, these individuals can have different choices, such as when and how to become parents.My proposed Boolean Search String in this topic might be “problems experienced by black women before, during and after childbirth” or “solutions to the challenges experienced by women of color when seeking for maternal health care.”
Executive SummaryBusiness Goals : to capitalize on a decentralized parking system, to introduce secure payments, to increase business transparency, and to establish a digital renting environment for all consumers.Management Plan : to identify contingencies, to win support from the city administration, to allocate responsibilities among essential employees.Market Research : there are two popular applications (Parkgene and Parkaide) that offer blockchain-based parking assistance. The proposal utilizes non-fungible tokens as the key source of competitive advantage.Marketing Plan : the buyer persona for the current proposal is a male or a female car driver aged from 18 to 40. New customers will be found on social media, via referrals, and with the support of social media influencers and native advertising.Operational Plan : sales (set monetary milestones), marketing (attract people to the
product), research and development (investigate the market), operations (connect with more stakeholders), people (motivate locals to engage in testing), financial and administration (scale the business and continue improving the blockchain system).Action Plan : to generate a decentralized platform for blockchain-based parking lots in order to avoid the issue of the application being disconnected; to implement real-time navigation to provide car users with relevant evidence regarding available parking spots nearby; to investigate the blockchain network to introduce new transactions based on non-fungible tokens.Bottom Line : the approximate budget for the proposal is around $200.000. The majority of financial resources are required to cover employees’ efforts and advertising.Business PlanFinding a parking spot is one of the hardest tasks that have to be completed by local citizens and visitors across busy
metropolitan cities. In addition to the time required to help a person find the best parking spot, they have to waste fuel to park their car and avoid tickets. With approximately 20 hours per annum spent by an average driver to find a parking spot, it can be safe to say that the issue has to be resolved as soon as possible (Yang et al., 2017). In addition, there are plenty of overpayments caused by unreasonably high prices for parking spaces that turn into an approximate income of $20 billion. The scarcity of parking places and their high cost could be the two intertwined reasons contributing to an increased number of road traffic accidents (Dzulkurnain et al., 2019). The inability to find a parking spot quickly could also
lead to massive traffic jams. From the existing evidence, it is also clear that most governments cannot resolve that problem by simply creating new parking lots and augmenting the number of parking spots across metropolitan areas.Business GoalsThe primary business goal of the current proposal is to promote the value of decentralized parking and introduce blockchain as one of the most efficient instruments intended to contribute to a transparent network. Blockchain could become a crucial contributor to car parking improvements, as there are virtually no limits to how it could be applied to the process of developing a car parking platform (see Figure 1). Blockchain-based data storage would contribute to a real-time connection between respective sensors across parking facilities and the application developed to support blockchain parking. With the
help of the Internet of Things, developers would have the opportunity to generate additional value by reading the data from the GPS signal and offering the optimal routes to the respective parking spots. With additional insights regarding the traffic situations, drivers using the system would have access to alternative routes. Blockchain technology would be the backbone of the project that ensures data credibility during the journey. Hong Kong does not invest too much resources in blockchain and cryptocurrency on a nationwide level, so it is reasonable to make the first move and attain the business goal of deploying decentralized, blockchain-based parking.Another business goal that is pursued by the author is to introduce secure payments and monetize parking lots in the most efficient ways. The growing influence of digital
would be required to confirm the payment only in the case the customer adheres to all the guidelines and does not represent a threat. As for the process of monetization, the author expects to expand the existing automotive solutions by providing consumers with access to a complex blockchain platform. At the same time, it would not be an application informing drivers of free parking spots but rather a distributed marketplace operating in real-time to bring together car users and parking providers. The fast pace of technology development could be the main reason why blockchain became the focus of this proposal.
Blockchain can be defined as a developing technology that is increasingly used in various fields of human activity. The report by Grech and Camilleri (2017) provides insight into applications of blockchain in education, which are “still in their infancy” (p. 8). The authors emphasize the numerous benefits and social advantages that this concept can bring into the academic setting. Grech and Camilleri (2017) state that “within education, activities likely to be disrupted by blockchain technology include the award of qualifications, licensing and accreditation, management of student records, intellectual property management and payments” (p. 8). Although the application of blockchain in the educational field is still underdeveloped, this technology can disrupt the student information systems market and offer numerous benefits for society.The open implementation of blockchain technology can enable
Leaders choose an appropriate organizational structure depending on various factors characterizing a company. However, the most prominent ones include the environment in which the company operates, its size, the technologies available to it, business strategy, as well as the stage in the organizational life cycle. Thus, Bombas has implemented a unique employee-oriented structure and culture because the company is relatively young and focused on innovation as a core of its strategy. The company has taken the route of giving back as an essential principle of its culture and mission, engaging in charity work and encouraging employees to be proactive in helping and supporting needy people. Through fostering a welcoming environment, a “Hive” in which workers feel safe and confident to be creative and innovative, Bombas has enabled high
IntroductionHaving adequate knowledge and information before making financial decisions such as investing in stocks, bonds or cryptocurrency is very important. Understanding the advantages and weaknesses can help one know where to invest their finances best. For instance, company stocks of firms such as Nestle and Volkswagen are very attractive and promise a great amount of profit for individuals looking for opportunities to invest. Despite this, some people who own stocks in such firms are looking for other opportunities to invest in cryptocurrency after trading in their holdings in stocks and bonds. Buying crypto, especially bitcoin, is now like a trend, and many individuals are entering the crypto space without assessing the trade’s pros and cons or weaknesses. This paper looks at the financial advantages of Russian bonds, Nestle,
and Volkswagen stocks while also looking at the weaknesses of cryptocurrency in an attempt to help reach a financial decision on investment.Financial Advantages of Nestle Stock, Russian Bonds, And Volkswagen StockFinancial Advantages of Nestle StockNestle, one of the largest food groups globally, raised a whole-year sales target after reaping the benefits of price increases on its products, that range from bottled water to pet food. According to Nestle S.A. ADR Stock Price & News (2022), the company whose shares saw an increase of more than three percent has eclipsed other companies by leveraging the strength of brands like Perrier water. According to (Affonso, Dias & Pinto, 2021), the firm further increased prices in the last quarter of 2021. The same is expected this year when input costs are
anticipated to rise even more than the four percent witnessed last year.Nestle, like its peers, is facing challenges with the supply chain as the global economy is still trying to fight against COVID-19. The hikes in prices should help ensure the margin’s steadiness at around seventeen percent, followed by an average margin boost in the midterm (Affonso et al., 2021). The company raised its annual organic growth guidance to between six and seven percent from five to six percent after the sales improved to about seven percent in the third quarter of 2021. The volume growth is anticipated to slow as the boost witnessed currently because of the pandemic wanes (Affonso et al., 2021). According to Nestle S.A. ADR Stock Price & News (2022), the benefits of greater
volumes and pricing would fully show this year.Financial Advantages of Volkswagen StocksThere is evidence that this stock should be a great choice for investors, for instance, a surge in recent price momentum shows an increasing interest of investors in the stock. According to Volkswagen AG Stock Price & News (2022), it is clearly well-positioned with a one-month price change of about four percent. Whereas all stocks have the potential of witnessing a hike in price for a small period, a real momentum player is needed to deliver positive returns for an extended period. Volkswagen stock is in that category as the stock witnessed a gain of seven percent over the last year (Affonso et al., 2021). Additionally, the momentum for this stock is fast-paced, as it has a
beta of around two (Affonso et al., 2021). This shows that it moves sixty percent higher than the market in any direction.Given the price performance, it is clear why the Volkswagen stock scores a B in momentum. This suggests that the best time to choose to purchase stocks from Volkswagen would be now if one desires to benefit from the momentum. Additionally, a rising trend in earnings estimate revisions has helped the stock earn a high ranking, ranked second by Zacks. Research reveals that the momentum influence is strong among the top stocks. The reason for this is that more investors have developed an interest in stocks that cover analysts and have raised the earnings estimates, which helps in keeping the prices up. The Volkswagen stock is trading
at a great valuation despite processing fast-paced momentum traits. Regarding the Price-to-Sales ratio, the stock currently appears cheap (Affonso et al., 2021). For every dollar of sales, an investor only needs fifty-eight cents.Financial Advantages of BondsInvesting in stocks, especially those belonging to companies such as Nestle, is great. It becomes even better when someone invests in bonds such as Russian bonds. The financial weaknesses that can be found in stocks are eliminated by choosing bonds (Isaac, 2020). For instance, the volatility in bonds is lower than in stocks which shows that even though it is safe to invest in stocks, it is safer to do so in bonds. Additionally, stocks suffer from more day-to-day volatility than bonds (Reboredo, Ugolini & Aiube, 2020). The interest payments are higher in
bonds than the general level of dividend payments. Bonds are also liquid, which means that it is easier for an organization to sell a significant amount of bonds without impacting the price. They are also attractive due to the comparative certainty of a fixed interest payment twice annually plus a fixed lump sum at maturity.Financial Weaknesses of CryptocurrencyDespite all the popularity of the idea that crypto is a great asset, buying one is similar to buying a share of stock in companies such as Nestle or Starbucks. With the two companies, one gets quarterly earnings releases, investment bank presentations, earnings calls, and media appearances. With trading in stocks, one has a general idea of how a company is doing financially and possibly in the future. Even with micro-cap
firms that are traded publicly, one can access financial statements.However, trading in crypto is entirely different, where there are extreme periods of volatility and zero fiscal statements. It just exists as well as thrives on speculation and hype, plus can crumble on fears that could appear out of nowhere. This means that one could lose everything while investing in the crypto business if they do not comprehend for what they are signing up. This continues to be seen as more prominent investors continue to be involved in the business and use different tactics.Trading in crypto is different from how someone can trade in a traditional market. For instance, it is still a challenge to access leverage. A trader particularly has to pay a funding raise to maintain their
stocks, and cryptocurrency by revealing the financial advantages of stocks and bonds while also showing the weaknesses of cryptocurrency. For instance, individuals who own stocks at Nestle will earn more profits this year than even last since it is expected that the company will raise the prices to more than four percent seen in 2021. Volkswagen stock is gaining interest from many investors as its earnings estimates are high. This means that the price, like that of Nestle, will also rise. The Crypto business, as popular as it is, continues to welcome sophisticated investors who are applying various tactics which can make others lose as they gain. Additionally, also paying a funding raise to maintain one’s options in crypto is more expensive than investing in bonds.
Since the business sphere is closely connected with human communications and relationships, the psychological aspects of people’s behavior play an important role in this field. Regarding customer relations, one of the most prominent business concepts in creating relationships with people is marketing and advertising. In turn, these aspects of operations are involved in developing important details of any company’s business, such as brand strategy and impact on consumption levels. Various companies, including established and new ones, explore ways of implementing the concept of stimulus generalization in brand strategy elaboration.To explain the aspects of brand strategy, it is essential first to discuss the theory of information processing and identify its relation to mental responses. The theory of information processing, which is a cognitive approach to explaining how the human
mind changes sensory data, is strongly related to brand strategy creation since individuals encounter visual information constantly. This paradigm proposes that information obtained from the environment is subjected to mental processes other than basic stimulus-response sequences. In terms of business activities, this theoretical aspect can be devoted to marketing, advertising, and public relations activities since these sectors are mostly concentrated on communicating with people, including potential customers.A brand strategy is considered to be a planned statement that outlines a set of long-term objectives that eventually lead to people recognizing and preferring a brand. The brand’s mission, its obligations to customers, and how these aspects are presented are part of an effective branding strategy. A branding strategy cannot be determined as the summation of a logo, color scheme, or
website; although these visual components are essential to a successful brand strategy, they can be potentially misinterpreted. All of the subjective components that create brand recognition, brand equity, and brand perception over time are fundamental to a branding strategy. An excellent brand strategy’s fundamental aim is to let the community know that a brand exists, what concepts and ideas it represents, and what characterizes it. Every business is possible select a distinctive and unique method to measure success, but all will incorporate the same theoretical aspects in their strategy.Referring to the various theoretical influences of the brand strategy, it is important to highlight the ideas of learning and memory that are connected to visual perception. Emphasizing the concepts of learning and memory, it is obligatory to examine behavioral
learning and the difference between classical and operant conditioning, including the comparison with discrimination of stimulus. Classical conditioning can be described as the process when one stimulus is combined with another that fails to generate a reaction. A second stimulation, referred to as the conditioned stimulus, triggers the response over some period. When an unconditioned stimulus is consistently coupled with a neuronal input to create a reaction, the unconditioned stimulus becomes a conditioned stimulus for that reaction. The approach of modifying behavior through reinforcement after the desired response is known as operant conditioning. Customers can be persuaded to engage in a certain behavior if they anticipate the behavior will result in a favorable consequence. Since the behavior is systematically maintained through positive or negative reinforcement and penalty when
the stimuli are accessible and not when they are missing, discriminative stimuli have influence over a specific behavior.In order to affect customer behavior, particular brands frequently utilize stimulus generalization concepts. The propensity to react to stimuli that are identical or similar to the initial conditioned stimulus is defined as stimulus generalization. To put it differently, it is determined as the capacity to act in a new circumstance in a manner that has been learned in previous comparable positions. With regard to the presence and use of stimulus generalization in the process of creating a brand strategy, it is possible to emphasize the implementation of this concept in both new and already established organizations. A renowned, well-known brand, for instance, generally has a trustworthy and instantly identifiable design. Customers
are mainly certain that the goods will be of excellent quality when they notice a conspicuous design. A newer or less popular business is feasible to attempt to profit from the reputation of a well-known label by using the same color palette, logo positioning, typography, and other design elements in its packaging. In this case, the competitor’s objective would be to elicit the same emotional response from customers as they do for the established brand. The newer firm has a better probability of effectively impacting customers’ purchasing behavior after this generalization has evolved.In addition, established companies can substantially benefit from the consequences of stimulus generalization. Such businesses will frequently use their prominent packaging design for a variety of their items. Customers may have had a favorable encounter with
only one of the brand’s numerous goods, for instance. When customers recognize the brand’s name, emblem, colors, and background design on another of the company’s products, they are more willing to transfer their pleasant thoughts to the new item and purchase it due to the bigger brand’s association. Consumers may assume that deceit is being used to influence them, while corporations may argue that they are merely employing attraction. Consumer buying behavior is impacted by the generalization of the stimulus, whether business management identifies it as a motivation to complain, generate a dispute, or as a benefit.Furthermore, it is essential to analyze how organizations can elaborate brand strategies from the perspective of stimulus discrimination, which is the opposite of stimulus generalization term. A discriminative stimulus is referred to
suppression. After that, discriminative stimulus control is applied to the response behavior. When a reaction is rewarded in its presence but not when it is missing, a discriminative stimulus is formed. Considering the aspect of stimulus discrimination in brand strategy, it is feasible to note that firms can apply it in order to generate immediate reactions where necessary. What concerns marketing and branding strategies, stimulus discrimination occurs when a company, for instance, uses package design to totally distinguish itself from competitors. In this case, the main objective is focused on underlining the substantial differences between brands that can directly influence customer behavior and increase the velocity of the response simultaneously.
Industrial authority and its improvement in Hong Kong on a review on relative industrial authority are the paper’s title to be critiqued in this critique. It is an article on corporate governance authored by Bryane Michael and S.H. Goo. The authors of the article have reviewed the developments in Hong Kong in company governance. As the discipline of corporate governance narrows, much empirical observation checks the very characteristics of company governance (Michael & Goo, 2015). Policy- and legal-related policies look at the normative corporate governance reform issues yet reasoning about corporate governance in itself as a matter involves having a look at the refinement at the country level. The stance here is true regarding thinking about corporate governance at the country level as this involves consideration of every
individual in that particular country. This paper and critique focus on the strengths and weaknesses of corporate governance concerning business ethics and Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR).The background of this article is all about corporate governance concerning the entire country. Its purpose is to find out to what degree the experience of Hong Kong proves or disapproves theories from company governance for various issues and concerns. These issues include; executive compensation, ownership of the family, self-dealing, and concentration in Hong Kong, among others. Corporate governance emerges to be the main idea of this article. Being the argument of the article, the authors review the corporate government on its recent developments in Hong Kong as a key place in the USA. They have viewed it on various dimensions like the
degree of family control, self-benefit harms, and feasible results of shareholder’s attentiveness on company authority execution.The authors have organized their study in some manner to enhance understandability and the information flow in some different sections. They have provided an outline of the company governance in Hong Kong, and also show how better corporate governance in Hong Kong at least correlates with higher share price premiere in one section (Michael & Goo, 2015). Another section shows an outline of crucial company governance from outside the United States and how to handle the socially disastrous household dominance of outlined corporations. Another segment is the third which deals with the self-advantage of an organizational position between connected parties. In this case, for instance, a late study of the economic wave has
considered the role of such self-benefit on share-holder values and the company performance, yet nobody has looked at the fit of such self-benefit to the picture of the wider company governance. The fourth section focus on the intensive shareholdings and their roles in decreasing the quality of industrial governance and the fifth provides an outline of two key matters in many authorities.The argument in the article is effective or convincing according to the author’s findings in this article. For instance, on contrasting two different corporate government measures looking at the perspective of the commerce system generally and the other at particular industrial governance practices, Hong Kong rates excellently or poorly according to the authors. This depends on which industrial government consideration is looked at. Hong Kong is rated
second just after Singapore by the statistics of the competitive forum of the world. This means that this region has much more to do in comparison to other countries to achieve maximum scores regarding these evaluations. Therefore, according to the authors, the accounting area seems to be best for Hong Kong companies regarding companies’ industrial governance practices in Hong Kong. The outcomes assigned to different features of industrial control in Hong Kong are in line with the CSLA analyst including compliance with general accounting principle regulations and policies and rules applicable to corporate governance culture. Therefore, this activity seems an important issue concerning the evaluation of Hong Kong companies as there is a clear indication of ethics in corporations’ evaluations.Families’ control in corporate lives is another important issue
detected by authors in this article in Hong Kong. Households have continuously managed and continue to control Hong Kong’s companies (Michael & Goo, 2015). This indicates that Hong Kong has relatively grown from family-controlled individualism. According to the authors, families in Hong Kong controls the subsequent highest share of the corporations within the neighborhood from Indonesia. Yet the Tai of the families of Tai-pan controls few of the industries than other authorities. The weakness associated with family-based corporate governance is that it risks crowding out the non-family-based interests hence family interest discriminates or crowds out productive investment. This issue, therefore, calls for a policy to seek to change the status quo hence enabling corporations to work towards enhancing positive business ethics and good corporate social responsibility to society.
Good companies’ CSR and business ethics are of great importance to society as they enhance the community’s welfare.Another important issue put into consideration in this article by the authors is the encouragement to engage in government-related activism of Hong Kong pensions. Pension investment leads concerning the historical evidence show domestic investments lead to a broad increase of corporations and better oversight over these corporations. In consideration of the given example, Sweden gives a useful and recent sample for Hong Kong. This is due to its size, that is, economic terms, population terms, and the fast development led by the government of a national pension company. Better corporate governance with a government relation, therefore, means good business ethics and proper CSR of the corporations working concerning the government. Companies’
positive relationship with the government ensures that the companies work toward the interest of the society, hence the importance to the community due to good business ethics and corporate social responsibility. The strength of this character of the companies and the government leads to a positive attribute towards working to the social interest and ensuring acceptable corporations’ behaviors towards society.Self-dealing reduction by connected individuals or parties is another important issue considered by the article’s authors. They suggest that connected parties often lead to more harm than good. Transactions of the associated parties in Hong Kong reduce shareholder value. According to the authors, measuring the expropriation extent by insiders measures the degree to which the scope of transactions of the connected parties affects the value of the firm in
Hong Kong. A company’s value decreases by about 30 percent when connected individuals take part in a takeover (Michael & Goo, 2015). In another case, connected party asset sales seem to reduce a firm’s value by about 20 percent as calculated by the market premium over its book value. The challenge associated with such a case is lacking information about the joined party transactions as this problem results in the firm’s value destruction in Hong Kong, which means bad business ethics and CSR. To curb this challenge, and enhance proper business ethics and CSR, involves strengthening derivative actions and oversight of the minority shareholder. This is an important approach to the community involved as the corporations’ shareholders due to good business ethics and CSR.The vetting regime is another
important issue in Hong Kong put into consideration. This region has one of the most limiting and connective regimes in the world of connected persons. However, this regime depends more on the executive’s goodwill in corporations to individually proclaim transactions of connected parties. Goodwill comprises a statement of listed companies in Hong Kong received by HKEx of the connected individual transactions (Michael & Goo, 2015). HKEx decides the suitability of the goodwill and later announcements are made to the companies’ stakeholders. Vetting, therefore, is of much importance to society as it enhances better business ethics, CSR, and corporate governance.Reducing shareholders’ concentration is another factor considered in Hong Kong. No doubt that there is much shareholders-concentration and hence reduction is necessary. According to the authors, custodians could hold shares
ethics and CSR in corporations. In another view to enhancing good corporate governance, executive remuneration is necessary. This remuneration represents an important issue in corporate governance hence it is of much importance to the companies. When corporate governance is sorted, it results in good business ethics from the executives toward shareholders and all the organizational stakeholders. It also enhances good CSR by ensuring companies work towards the interest of society. Conclusively, corporate governance, good business ethics, and CSR are necessary for the betterment of corporations and hence must be enhanced.
Various cultures around the world have unique creation myths and traditional methods of presenting them through art. The cosmology of the Aztec civilization was quite different from the Europeans that conquered them. Firstly, the Europeans’ Christian God “created mankind in his own image” and granted him dominion over a perfectly constructed world, the Garden of Eden (Holy Bible, New International Version, Genesis 1:27). In the Bible, he is described as a benevolent, if strict, father figure who can forgive humankind their sins and grant them eternal redemption. Consequently, God is depicted in art as a wise, older man with a beard and white hair. Christian art primarily praises the power of His forgiveness and the bountiful nature that He created.In contrast, Aztec creation stories are based on dismembered
gods are described as perfect and self-contained. However, in the Aztec mythos, gods are above the concepts of good and evil, while in the Christian order evil is considered the dominion of Satan and the opposite of God. Therefore, Aztecs have to appease a bloodthirsty, violent goddess to receive food and survive. On the other hand, Christians have to reject sin and submit their spirit to God to gain eternal salvation. Ultimately, the Christian creation story is based on forgiveness and love compared to the Aztecs’ survival through violence, and this difference is reflected in their opposing art styles.
IntroductionCalifornia has passed a bill to reduce the number of prisons. The state considers this a big step towards serious judicial reform, because the number of people in custody will decrease. My research question is to find out how this Realignment was a viable remedy to the California prison system overcrowding. We should care about the question because overcrowding in places of detention is a serious humanitarian problem. Such conditions restrict the rights and freedoms of prisoners. They increase the potential for conflict situations and circumstances that can lead to destabilization of the operational situation inside correctional institutions.It is important to know the answer to decide whether to apply prison reductions in regions where the problem of overcrowding is particularly sensitive. The confirmation or refutation of the effectiveness
of the mechanism used in California depends on its further application to solve an acute problem. When investigating the similar research question previous scholars have found that the reform used in California has serious drawbacks. In particular, when the area of detention was reduced, there was no significant reduction in crime.The basic themes I use as headings in my literature review area are the humanity of prison reductions, the consequences of reforming the penitentiary system and access to justice. The current research is missing research regarding the assessment of how the implementation of the prison system reform program takes into account the needs of society. In this paper, I will use empirical research methods, namely the study of scientific research and the analysis of the information received. This
proposed study will advance knowledge and fill holes in the current research record by focusing on the new aspect of the problem. Instead of using the number of prisoners per square meter as indicators of overpopulation, the conditions of detention will serve as a guideline in this work.Literature ReviewIntroThe independent variable in this research is the number of prisons. The two dependent variables are the number of prisoners and their conditions of detention. The existing research says that there are currently six prison facilities in California. Moreover, according to researchers, there are 9 prisoners per one employee of the penitentiary system in California (Bartos and Kubrin 2018). In addition, according to the report, California is among the five states with the highest proportion of female prisoners (Bird, Nguyen,
and Grattet 2021). Researchers claim that this is a special group of prisoners who need certain conditions.The existing experience of reducing the number of prisons in California is of some interest to researchers. The three trends in the research record are primarily a discussion of the humanity of keeping prisoners in new conditions. The articles attempt to study a number of humanitarian problems of the detention of citizens of California (Bird, Nguyen, and Grattet 2021). Also, existing studies discuss the consequences of reforming the penitentiary system both for the prisoners themselves and for society (Lin 2018). The third trend that can be noticed in research is the raising of the issue of methods for reducing prisoners (Grattet, Bird, and Nguyen 2017). The authors are concerned about the associated
reduction in access to justice.Humanity of Prison ReductionsThe gaps in the current state of knowledge related to this research question are connected with the fact that numerical values are usually provided in research. For example, overcrowding in California prisons is proved by calculating the population density or the number of employees per inmate (Bartos and Kubrin 2018). However, the studies do not use comparisons of the compliance of the content of the execution of punishment with international standards in this area. The deterioration of the order of serving sentences for California convicts is not determined by the conditions of their imprisonment. The worsening of the medical and sanitary and material support of convicts mentioned in the studies is brief and insignificant (Bartos and Kubrin 2018). They are not
described in sufficient detail and are mainly presented in the form of numerical values.The sources of uncertainty are the criteria by which it is necessary to determine the humanitarian well-being of prisoners. With the reduction in the number of prisons in California, the number of people per institution has increased (Bird, Nguyen, and Grattet 2021). However, scientists cannot come to a consensus on how much should be spent on food and personal belongings of prisoners per month (Welsh 2019). There are also disagreements about the area of the cell and the location of the beds (Bird, Nguyen, and Grattet 2021). In addition, there are different points of view regarding the need to take into account the psychological state of prisoners (Grattet, Bird, and Nguyen 2017). Any discrimination can
become one of the criteria for increased density.Consequences of Reforming the Penitentiary SystemIt is known that reducing the number of prison buildings is not equivalent to reducing the number of persons serving a criminal sentence. However, it has not yet been fully investigated how the reform affected prisoners. The opinions of scientists were divided as to how the changes affected compliance with international penitentiary standards (Welsh 2019). The list of problems faced by the California penitentiary system is not fully defined (Bartos and Kubrin 2018). There is a normative consolidation of the rights of prisoners, but the possibility of practical implementation and protection of the rights and legitimate interests of convicts remains unclear.The sources of disagreement are the assessment of the problems of ensuring the conditions of serving
sentences in California correctional institutions and ways to solve them. Some scientists are not sure that the problems that have arisen in the execution of custodial sentences face the same problems (Grattet, Bird, and Nguyen 2017). Some researchers believe that as a result of the reform, the conditions of detention have ceased to comply with the normative ones (Lin 2018). Other scientists tend to think that California prisons have strict conditions of detention, but do not violate international norms (Bird, Nguyen, and Grattet 2021). Therefore, there is a certain interest in the organization of ensuring the regime and safety of prisoners in California prisons from the point of view of the prisoners themselves.Access to JusticeScientists agree that it is possible to avoid overcrowding in prisons in conditions of
a reduction in their number only with a decrease in the crime rate. However, it is not known which mechanisms to achieve this goal will be really effective. Some researchers advocate the humanization and improvement of criminal legislation (Bartos and Kubrin 2018). Other scientists see the threat that the introduction of forced labor instead of imprisonment will lead to the opposite effect (Welsh 2019). Mitigation of punishment may cause an increase in motivation to commit criminally punishable crimes. Eventually, this will lead to overcrowding of prisons.Experts disagreed: some believe that the decrease in the number of people in prison is not due to a decrease in the growth of crime. They support the policy of consistent humanization of criminal penalties implemented in California (Bartos and Kubrin 2018). Other
researchers fear an increase in violent crimes associated with mitigation of punishment (Bird, Nguyen, and Grattet 2021). They claim that there are no fewer offenders, punishments have become less severe. The number of convicts in the colonies is getting smaller, but the number of persons registered with the criminal executive inspections is increasing. Thus, it is not fully understood how the liberalization of penal enforcement policy affects the number of prisoners in California.SummaryThe research proposal of this paper aims to study the conditions of detention of prisoners in California prisons in order to compare them with established international standards. The data specified in the official documentation will be taken as the criterion of the prison overcrowding. Crime statistics will also be compared before and after the implementation of
the reform in California. Based on statistics, a potential increase in the level of crimes in the future will be predicted using a special computer program.MethodologyIndependent data – the number of prisons – will be needed after calculating the further increase in crimes according to statistics. Dividing them by the number of prisons, it will be possible to predict the possibility of overpopulation of California prisons in the near future. Dependent variables – the conditions of detention of prisoners and their number – will be used to determine the compliance of imprisonment in California with international standards. Indicators such as the area of residential premises, as well as the presence of conditions of detention that may cause discrimination, will be considered.To collect data, I plan to use various
international documents containing standards for the detention of prisoners. I will also use crime data published on the official websites of California and state executive agencies. In order to collect information about the conditions of detention, it seems to me important to pay attention to the testimony of the prisoners themselves, so I will use interviews with them. I will mainly turn to video interviews to pay attention not only to verbal, but also to non-verbal signals. In addition, in this way I will be able to give an approximate external description of the prisoner’s condition. Accordingly, if there are signs of obvious physical and mental distress, it will be possible to assert non-compliance with the standards of detention, which in most cases arise as a result of
overcrowding in prisons.I have a research hypothesis about the nature and direction of the relationship between my independent and dependent variables. I think that by dividing the number of criminals by the number of prisons in California, I can calculate their occupancy. Further, to obtain the value of another variable – the conditions of detention – it is necessary to use numerical values of the area of premises in the building, the number of employees, funding per prisoner.I do not have sufficient psychological knowledge to conduct a survey with prisoners. Some of them may intentionally describe the conditions of detention as unbearable in order to shorten their time in places of restriction of freedom. Therefore, it seems to me more appropriate to analyze existing interviews with California prisoners
recorded on video. Thus, it will be possible, based on the behavior of the convict, to determine whether he is experiencing psychological or physical discomfort, indicating violations of the conditions of detention and overpopulation. This study is a trend, since the signs of improper conditions of detention appear quite quickly and persist for a long time.FindingsOfficial statistics show that the number of prisoners in California colonies has significantly decreased and has become minimal. However, crime rates have not decreased: they continue to grow. Many crimes have been decriminalized, which has caused an increase in their commission. Instead of imprisonment, criminals are punished with compulsory, correctional and forced labor. The area of the prison divided by the number of prisoners obtained according to statistics is less than the values
prescribed by international standards. Prisoners in interviews have signs of uncomfortable confinement, such as excessive thinness, dark circles under the eyes, strangled speech and monosyllabic answers.DiscussionThe findings obtained confirm the hypothesis that the unsatisfactory physical and mental condition of prisoners indicates a violation of conditions of detention and overpopulation. Statistics show that, indeed, the replacement of imprisonment with more lenient punishments has not solved the problem of overcrowding in prisons. On the contrary, the system proved to be ineffective, as the number of more serious crimes increased. The appearance of the prisoners showed that they lacked the allocated funding, and the conditions of detention did not correspond to satisfactory. Thus, the reform of the prison system in California has shown itself to be an ineffective way to combat
Being a well-developed market with a high purchasing power of the population, Canada presents an array an opportunities for foreign exports, namely the U.S. Within this framework, agricultural exports reflect a considerable part of the overall trade. Canada remains the U.S.’s second-largest partner in this regard, and the relations are supported by favorable agreements between the nations. This report evaluates Canada as an agricultural export destination with an emphasis on nuts and pistachios, in particular.The process of agricultural export into Canada is well-regulated, which promotes the safety and transparency of trade relations. According to the U.S. International Trade Administration, Canada accounts for 15% of the country’s total agricultural exports with $22 billion, most of which are consumer-oriented. Through this exchange, Canada receives high-value products for its population, whereas
the U.S. support over 130,000 jobs. Since 1989, most American agricultural products have entered Canada duty-free under the NAFTA and U.S.-Canada Free Trade Agreement, currently replaced by the USMCA. Supply-managed products, such as dairy and eggs, are not covered by the agreement, which still implies that pistachio export will benefit from duty-free relations. As per the agreement, all shipments are required to have a USMCA Certification of Origin in addition to the standard export documentation package (Government of Canada). For the consumer’s safety, Canada requests all exporters to provide a Phytosanitary Certificate for plant products. They officially confirmed that they are pest-free, conforming with the importer’s sanitary requirements, and have been inspected by the authorized agency of the United States (Government of Canada). This way, the overall safety
of agricultural exports is ensured.Because of the favorable trade environment, the export turnover between the United States and Canada has been considerable. Within it, nuts trade has been important, as conditioned by the climatic differences. Table 1 reflects the dynamics of the agricultural product and nut export to Canada. Table 2 contains the history of pistachio import in Canada.Table 1. U.S.-Canada Exports History (Statista Research Department)                                                            2020  
Article Counterpoint: Cultural Protectionism Is Necessary in Canada is written by Jeff Klassen and is published in Canadian Points of View: Cultural Protectionisms, which is the property of Great Neck Publishing. The principal thesis of the paper states that cultural protectionism is especially important for Canada in cultural, economic, and political aspects. Canada is actively working in this direction, but the growing pace of globalization and, in particular, American influence require a decent resolution to the concern of preserving cultural heritage and self-identification. The central purpose of this article is to draw attention to the current state of affairs on the world stage and emphasize the essential for cultural protectionism.Arguments of the WorkThe author emphasizes the importance of his judgments mainly with economic arguments, relegating the cultural aspect
and ConclusionIn Klassen’s work, one can see an active call for the separation of Canadian culture from an American one without turning into anti-Americanism. To argue his position, the author gives examples and brief comments on much evidence taken by Canada concerning cultural protectionism. For example, active support for the UNESCO Diversity Convention, the creation of the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation to increase Canadian content on radio, the organizing of the Canadian Heritage Department to protect cultural heritage. Everything is particularly compared with the American influence and position. The final thought of the article suggests that cultural protection is necessary for Canada’s economy and culture. However, this approach is not supposed to be overly confrontational.

IntroductionThis final project requires that I develop a Training and Organizational Development (OD) proposal aimed at improving diversity training at Cape Coral Hospital. It is important to note that many organizations see the management of diversity programs as not being limited to HRD programs and processes, but expanded to include special needs of the new employees. Therefore as the HRD manager for Cape Coral Hospital, my task is to propose new training programs and processes to senior management, and explain how HRD methods can help manage a culturally diverse workforce.Benefits of Cultural DiversityEmbracing and supporting cultural diversity comes with a lot of benefits. First, having a diverse workforce is critical for any company that is focused on reaching its true potential. Cultural diversity helps organizations experience strong appeal
on the global canvas as well as improved innovation (Kamales & Knorr, 2019). As for Cape Coral Hospital, cultural diversity mean more engaged workers coupled with high retention and quality patient care. Other benefits of diversity in workplace include promotion of varied perspectives, improvement of profits and revenue, attraction of best talent, boosting of global reputation and easy troubleshooting. An organization that ignores cultural diversity may end up encountering a lot of problems such as employment discrimination lawsuits. In a nutshell, by supporting a more diverse workforce, Cape Coral Hospital will support variety of perspective.As the HRD manager for Cape Coral Hospital, recognizing and valuing employees is of great benefit, especially when they come from diverse cultures. This is the case because it leads to high innovation—when different
cultures work together, there are more opportunities for increased creativity (Kamales & Knorr, 2019). Similarly, valuing workers makes them feel appreciated and empowered to work. Based on these issues, the recruitment process of new employees for Cape Coral Hospital should be approached in a holistic manner to ensure the minority employees do not feel left out.Some Key DemographicsCurrently women account for approximately 47 percent of the overall workface. This number is projected to remain constant until the end of 2022. While the projections do not give the exact percentage, it is expected that the number will rise due to sudden increase in single-parent families. Additionally, about 20 percent of those living with disability according to ADA are in the workforce (Sprong et al., 2019). This number is expected
to increase in a few years to come. Lastly, the average age of workforce is increasing every day.New Training ProgramsFor the senior management at Cape Coral Hospital, there are important new training programs that I would propose in an effort to develop effective recruitment and selection methods to attract more minorities. The new training programs for consideration will start at the top of the organization. The success of the programs will require the organization to have a chief diversity officer to steer the training in the direction it needs to go. Most importantly, Cape Coral Hospital should put in place a diversity leadership council to help identify areas that require more attention.Ethnicity and Race Identity ProgramThis training program will be aimed at helping the senior management differentiate between
ethnicity and race. They need to understand that ethnicity is a learned behavior while race is biologically determined. The aim of this training program is to help identify the different categories of people that are known to face discrimination. This program will guide the development of effective recruitment and selection method because it comes with unconscious bias course. This course will help employees understand their own biases and, in return, reducing the gap and encourage diversity in workplace.Disabilities and Physical Abilities ProgramThis training program aims at helping senior management to train employees the importance of working together—it improves employee engagement. Therefore, the program is important as it instructs senior management on why and how to ensure the workplace environment is ADA compliant (Stevens et al., 2018). As indicated
earlier, about 20 percent of those living with disability according to ADA are working. This means that Cape Coral Hospital should support their needs. The program also strives to remind the senior managers the benefits of hiring people with diverse disabilities.Gender-based Training ProgramThis program is intended at reminding senior management that gender is an internal diversity—a characteristic that people are born with. The training program also strives to show them how discrimination among sexes occurs in different workplaces. Therefore, gender-based training program will train senior management how to remove biases linked to gender, thus making workplace more diverse and inclusive. If followed through, the program will help the organization keep the employees at work while, at the same, attract more minorities and women. The advantage of this program
is that it removes discrimination.Age-related Training ProgramThis program is intended at informing the management the fact that the hospital, regardless of time and period, will have a composition of workers from different generations. These groups have their own ideals and belief which can lead to biases, ageism. According to Zaniboni et al. (2019) ageism “is a tendency to harbor negative feelings against employees of different age” (p. 453). This training is necessary because age discrimination can occur at any age. This program will encourage inclusion within the workforce, thus making the company attractive to employees of all ages.Citizen Status ProgramThis training is necessary because there are high chances of finding immigrants at any place of work. The problem these individuals face is that despite having their citizenship, there
is always a rift with those who grew up in the area. Therefore, it is imperative for senior management to implement this training program because it helps remove unconscious biases in the workplace. In essence, citizen status training program will improve the organization’s overall diversity. This, in turn, will bring diverse ideas on the table thus attracting more workers, especially the minority groups.The role of senior managementCape Coral Hospital’s senior management has the authority to implement the aforementioned new training programs alongside other advantages such as flexible work schedules, onsite daycare and childcare subsides. This will attract new hires and, at the same time, make them feel at ease working for the organization. The senior management should specify how they value cultural and religious traditions including holidays. The
new programs should motivate the management to focus more on forming affinity groups that will empower staff on how to work in teams in order to meet patients’ needs.New Training ProcessesThe new training processes that I propose to senior management include: making their commitment clear, encouraging objectivity, screening and interviewing and inclusive interviewing. With regard to making their commitment clear, the senior management will receive training on how to ensure the images on career pages represent their commitment to diversity. Similarly, they will be trained on how to communicate their values and dedication to diversity and inclusion. It is important to note that potential recruits are interested in knowing where the organization stands on some issues before opting to work for it.Encouraging ObjectivityAnother new training process the senior
management will be educated on is on how to encourage objectivity. Here, Cape Coral Hospital’s management will receive training on how to make a multi-tier approach part of the organization’s recruitment policy. For example, senior managers should prioritize reviewing every candidate’s resume and preliminary Q&A before the interview process starts (Epstein, 2019). The training will guide them on how and why they should make the first tier of screening mandatory. The aim is to ensure the organization is able to monitor consistent assessment.Screening and interviewingThis training aims at ensuring the organization has an effective screening process in place to evaluate the potential new hires. This program is necessary as it strives to address the biases, either conscious or unconscious, that interfere with decision making process. In other words,
the training aims at ensuring all the resources put in place to attract new hires do not go to waste. The senior management will trained on the need to make the members of the hiring team more diverse—this allows them challenge issues related to affinity bias.Inclusive InterviewingThe last training process is on how the senior management should conduct inclusive interviewing. The senior management should understand that job interviews come with a lot of anxiety. Therefore, this program aims at training the management on how best to ensure the potential recruits feel they are welcomed and on the same level. For instance, the team will be trained on how to utilize a two-stage interview process to address the issue. Some organizations start their process with a blind phone interview
before conducting in-person meeting.Additional Information  * The management should implement policies and guidelines that support equal employment opportunities: the policies should focus on employment criterion that extends beyond gender, race and age.  * The management should make the candidates’ positions more compelling to potential applicants: consider providing some key details that will attract a diverse range of recruits  * The senior management should ensure the employees understand the decisions for hiring are best on merits: hiring is not based on quotas.HRD MethodsThe HRD methods such as job rotation, assistant to position, committee assignment, and outdoor training can be utilized to manage a culturally diverse workforce. Firstly, the management should ensure job rotation involves all the employees regardless of gender, age and race (Diego-Mas, 2020). This
rotation aims at increasing employees’ knowledge, and skills. Secondly, assistant to position method should put into consideration efficiency levels—only efficient workers should be allowed to work under the supervision of a highly qualified manager. The focus is to groom the skills and abilities of employees without favor.Lectures and Seminars method can be used to manage a culturally diverse workforce. Although it is an old method, it is highly effective when it comes to providing diverse training to employees (Anderson, 2020). Cape Coral Hospital’s employees will be trained on the need to continue working in teams towards meeting the objective of the organization. Outdoor training is regarded as the most effective method of human resource development. The method encourages employees to collaborate in form of teams.Overcoming Language Barrier and
DiscriminationOvercoming language and discrimination issues is never an easy task, especially when it involves employees from diverse cultures. In the effort to ensure complete involvement of employees in the hospital, the management can adopt several measures that prevent issues related to language and discrimination. First, senior management should use a mediator to provide directions or guidance to the staff. The management can opt to work with a staff in hospital who fluidly communicates in both languages: the mediator’s role will be to pass the message to the rest of the staff.Another measure that can be utilized to overcome language and discrimination issues is by making an interpretation of all documents into the primary language used by the facility. For instance, medical diagrams, charts and graphs should be interpreted
words or esoteric vocabulary: this may lead to miscommunication.Introduction of Language ClassesThe last measure for consideration is making language classes available to all staff: should comply with the basic requirements of the organization’s language. The management should ensure the employees understand the words, expressions, and signs that allow them perform to the set standards. Therefore, the classes are necessary to ensure employees from different cultures are able to work together towards a common goal: providing high quality and safe patient care. The only time the staff could communicate in their native language is when dealing with patients from their cultural background.
The article comprehensively describes the definition of an introvert, the features of his behavior, and personal attitudes in the modern model of society. This category of people often remains misinterpreted in a world focused on predominantly extroverted and energetically intense people. The purpose of the author is in the clearly expressed desire to convey to society the goals and wishes of introverts, whose thoughts and feelings often go unrecognized or neglected. A superficial analysis of the text captures a vivid personal appeal of the author and intensely expresses subjective sentiments due to individual experience. A large number of rhetorical questions at the beginning of the message immediately attract the reader’s attention. The article is written in a journalistic style and has a bright emotional coloring with a hint
of a pronounced rejection of the global focus on extraversion.The observant text analysis allows the reader to better understand the personal message of the author. The article is well structured and includes general questions regarding the life and worldview of introverts. The text is characterized by a high degree of subjectivism and a pronounced bias towards the category of extrovert readers. The author compares extroverts with “puppy dogs” who can listen to a person for a minute and then start “barking” again. Such a comparison is pejorative and may cause an ambiguous reaction in the reader (Rauch 133). In addition, the author directly states that introverts are a more intelligent, reflective, and sensitive category of people. Every conclusion has the right to be presented for acceptance; however, a
from its reading is rather ambiguous and makes one think about the excessive tendentiousness of the writer. The text does not compare two different categories of people but vigorously downplays the principal personality traits of extroverts. The author says that the world would be much calmer and saner under the guidance of introverts. This theory may well be valid; however, perhaps the world should not be so sharply divided into “white” and “black,” “extroverts,” and “introverts.” This article does a good job of its central purpose: to illustrate an alternative radical vision of the modern model of society separated mainly between extroverts and introverts.
I would like to thank my descendants that my work is not forgotten. This story of eternal love is probably relevant in your days, so there are many film adaptations and versions of ‘Romeo and Juliet’. The new adaptation of my play generally made a controversial impression: the actors look suitable for their roles, but the internal theme of the play seems to be not so profoundly got.Carlo Carlea’s ‘Romeo and Juliet’ (2013) was filmed on medieval sites and villas in various Italian cities with a minimum of historical inaccuracies. The play of some characters is good: Hayley Steinfeld reminds us that Juliet was a child by modern standards, not yet a woman. Some of the scenes have been reworked to understand the story by the younger public
incarnations. I wonder if the director and producers understood the play’s timeless themes.They made a film that, I think, includes humanity’s greatest weaknesses and strengths when it comes to both love and lust. However, once the characters begin to behave radically differently, with dialogue thoughtlessly thrown in and topics ignored or trampled upon, it ceases to be an adaptation and instead becomes a parody. The adaptation seems to fall short of the problems posed in the original play.
The narrative structure in the movie Carol is distinct due to the focus on intricate elements of storytelling. The main reason for deviation from the traditional forms of the narrative approach is rooted in the fact that Carol provides a multitude of perspectives. The film does not solely revolve around Carol or Therese but rather smoothly transitions from one subplot to another. Both perspectives naturally merge into one cohesive and compelling story rich in information, emotion, and story elements.Firstly, it is important to note that the given film’s setting takes place in the 1950s, when the world was significantly more conservative and restrictive, especially in regard to the members of the LGBTQ+ community. However, “it’s the way the decidedly modern sensibility of the narrative meets classic style that
is the point” (Turan par. 4). In other words, the modern approach of utilizing several viewpoints on the story combined with classical stylistics makes the narrative structure unique and intricate. The film is shot in such a way that viewers regularly become mere observers of the characters, who convey their emotional states not through words but rather through facial expressions, settings, postures, and musical backgrounds. Another review states that viewers watch “the characters through the windows of a car or house and left them in a hazy focus” (Raynes par. 8). At various points in the film, viewers can observe the protagonists sitting or standing behind windows, resembling the realistic experience since it is usually how people see strangers rather than being part of private conversations.Secondly, the narrative
structure differentiates itself from the traditional techniques due to attentive and up-close gamesmanship. A film reviewer cleverly points out one of Haynes’s statements, where he wanted to have a unique narrative structure, and thus stated: “I felt like if we followed a genre very closely, but did it with dolls, and did it very carefully and very lovingly and attentively, it could stimulate emotions in a viewer the way it would if it was actors” (Barr par. 2). In other words, there is an intentional effort to follow the story, gradually spiraling from one character to another without any rigid transitions. Therefore, the film’s narrative puts a great deal of emphasis on non-verbal communication because it wants to keep conversations and interactions as realistic as possible.However, the emotional
captivating followership of the protagonists.In conclusion, the selected movie’s narrative differs from the traditional forms due to the use of several perspectives from which protagonists can be met and observed. The transitions between one subplot to another are intricately smooth, which ensures the cohesiveness of one singular story. The film does not try to explain but rather shows in its natural setting without excessive invasiveness from a viewer’s perspective.
A caster can be described as a simple wheel mechanism usually attached to the bottom of a particular object to simplify its movement and reduce the effort needed to change its position. Such details can be used in shopping carts, office chairs, beds, or furniture. The presented caster consists of six parts needed to guarantee its stable functioning, attaching to the demanded object, and rolling. These details are the metal base, two vertical supports, four screws, bushing, axle, and a wheel. Being assembled, they ensure the proper work of the detail and its attachment.The base is made of malleable cast iron and weighs 1083,5 grams. It is the basis to fix all other objects and assemble the caster mechanism. It should also be attached to a particular surface
to enable it can be moved. The vertical supports are placed on the base by using available SHCS screws. The choice of steel as the material is explained by the high pressure caused by objects on the base.The caster mechanism also has two vertical supports made of malleable cast iron. Their primary function is to hold the wheel and guarantee its rolling without friction on the base. The mass of every vertical support is 437.6 grams. They are placed on two sides of the base using SHCS crews and should also resist a significant load, which explains the choice of the material to manufacture them.The mechanism has four socket head cap screws (SCHS) needed to fix vertical supports and ensure their stable position on the base. Each SCHS
weighs 20.3 grams, and the screws are made of plain carbon steel, ensuring their reliability and resistance.There are also two bushings needed for the stable work of the caster mechanism. They are made of tin bearing bronze and weigh 58.9 grams each. They are attached to the vertical supports to hold the axle and reduce the friction between two surfaces, and resist abrasion.The mechanism has the axle needed to guarantee that the wheel will spin and simplify the object’s movement. It is made of AISI 1020 carbon steel and weighs 182.2 grams. The choice of this material ensures that the axle will resist the pressure caused by the wheel and the mass of an item that should be moved.Finally, the wheel is the last detail of the caster
the size of the axle to ensure it is possible to assemble the mechanism and attain its stable work.Altogether, being assembled, all details enable that the item or object can be moved. Being placed at a stationary fork formed by two vertical supports, the wheel reduces the effort needed to change the position of an item. The orientation of the two vertical supports is selected when a caster is mounted to the necessary surface. The axle with two bushings on sides allows the wheel to roll without friction and ensures the stable work of the mechanism. The use of metal and carbon steel guarantees the demanded strengths and the ability to resist pressure during the service.
Any abundant biological species have significant effects on the planet by consuming natural resources. Being rather popular as pets, dogs and cats are often explored with attention to their psychological impacts on humans, but their negative environmental influences require consideration as well. The essay aims to summarize these animals’ key environmental impacts with an emphasis on food consumption, infectious disease, species’ survival, and global warming.As domesticated animals, cats and dogs fit into the environment in peculiar ways. Animals living with pet owners in urban areas constitute a new category of consumers that require alimentary products in diverse price categories, animal toys, grooming products, and other pet products (Ferguson, 2020). With no need to hunt for smaller animals to survive, domestic dogs and cats that can go outside still
need their predatory impulses to be satisfied (Ferguson, 2020). One option is that it results in the purposeless killings of small birds and rodents, and the abandoned prey can attract dangerous disease-transmitting animals, such as city-dwelling rats. The situation might be different for stray cats and dogs as they are urged to eat from garbage bins and protect their territory, which involves the spread of infection and aggression towards animals and humans. Even domestic and healthy dogs’ feces contain viruses and parasites that can enter water supply systems, thus causing harm to humans and water life (Ferguson, 2020). Therefore, dogs’ and cats’ presence cannot be unnoticed when it comes to the global environment.Dogs’ and cats’ influence on the ecosystem as a whole is rather negative. Firstly, free-ranging domestic
pets’ presence is widely acknowledged as a mechanism of “human disturbance to native animal populations” (Morin et al., 2018, p. 2). Domestic cats actively engage in hunting and can even contribute to rare species’ extinction (Ferguson, 2020). If quantified, the hunting-related damage from cats is seven times larger than from dogs (Morin et al., 2018). Nevertheless, dogs are less tied to human habitats, which could make their ecological impacts more pervasive yet less noticeable (Morin et al., 2018). The role of cats in disseminating protozoan parasites, causing toxoplasmosis in humans, and even contaminating drinking water with the oocysts of Toxoplasma gondii is highlighted in modern studies (Morin et al., 2018). Thus, infection transmission presents another challenging effect for the ecosystem.In determining cats’ and dogs’ overall influences on the
Numerous issues concerning the recent amendments to the bail program have become the topic of heated debates. The original claims implied that the new attitude would allow for more humane and just techniques. Nevertheless, releasing various types of defendants without any bail has led to an increased number of participants who are rearrested on felony charges while still on release. Therefore, a dedicated analysis is needed in order to realize all the factors that stand behind such dramatic outcomes. Moreover, it is crucial to develop and establish the most efficient framework for releasing people without bail.The bail reform is a part of a series of criminal justice reforms that have gone into effect in recent years. According to new rules, judges are not allowed to impose monetary bail.
Moreover, judges were not granted an opportunity to evaluate the potential threat that a defendant could pose to a community. At the same time, according to Gold and Wright (2020), pretrial detention has huge repercussions and can jeopardize employment and housing. Thus, the original motivation behind the introduction of the bail reform was centered around the inequality issues and disparities that allowed the rich to buy their freedom and return home.Right now, thousands of people who have not yet been convicted of a crime are incarcerated and awaiting trial. The vast majority of them belong to low-income communities and cannot afford to pay the needed sum to spend time with their family, earn money and prepare for a trial properly. The vicious cycle created by such an attitude
allowed numerous activists and politicians to propose a reform that was intended to improve the situation and fight discrimination. Koepke and Robinson (2018) claim that the current pretrial risk assessment instruments do not truly support reformist goals of reducing incarceration. Thus, the data points to the fact that the new approach, despite positive effects, allowed criminals to escape punishment and continue to disrupt the normal pace of life in their communities.It is hard to find the appropriate decision concerning the issue of bail, as there are few other means that can ensure that a defendant returns to court to face charges against him/her. Nevertheless, it has become clear that the bail reform should definitely be revised. According to Baughman (2019), done right, bail keeps dangerous individuals off the
essential steps forward would be the introduction of a uniform set of criteria that takes into consideration a person’s previous record. Moreover, it is vital to distinguish between first conviction and recidivism. Thus, I would like to stay optimistic about the future of bail reform. I hope that during this decade, the entire system will ensure that more humane conditions and approaches will help free innocent defendants and change criminals without the necessity to release the majority of defendants.
Change champions are vital for healthcare organizations as they help integrate novelties necessary for improving the quality of services and patient outcomes. Furthermore, such employees advocate for the continuing education and practice scope expanse among their colleagues, enabling them to evolve and become better specialists (Miech et al., 2018). You also mentioned the crucial aspect of change leaders’ activities — the engagement of nurses to meet the healthcare system’s goals and address the inevitable challenges. Indeed, implementing strategic initiatives that encourage the organization to update its practices continuously is a mission of change champions in facilities of all types. You also identified the role of opinion leaders in achieving goals oriented on better quality and patient outcomes. I agree with your statement that such individuals are “respected sources
of information connected to novel ideas and possess sufficient interpersonal skills to influence others’ decision-making.” Human resources of any organization must integrate change champions and opinion leaders to the collectives where the practice updates are urgent.The alternative perspective to assess the importance of change champions and opinion leaders in a healthcare organization is to view how their administration and team-building improve the workplace environment and services’ quality. Human resources must consider that individuals at the executive positions might not be the actual authorities for other employees. Moreover, opinion leaders are frequently the most experienced or proven reliable team members, who have the decision-making and recommendation power regardless of their post (Spoon et al., 2020). Valuable insight from your post is that change champions can develop and advocate for
unique solutions for organizations’ issues and achieve the goals efficiently with qualified managers. Indeed, the leaders can select the most appropriate strategy to adopt a novel project or significantly improve the practice by influencing, encouraging, and motivating the team.Progress cannot be achieved without updating old operations and integrating novel practices, and, in a healthcare organization setting, change champions are vital for successful development. Furthermore, massive challenges frequently occur and damage the team members’ motivation, and a person who advocates and supports the culture of novelties integration can help maintain the selected direction (Cullen et al., 2020). You correctly pointed out that “champions have long been regarded as key facilitators for successful change efforts in healthcare.” Another type of employee crucial for an organization’s services improvement is the opinion
change. However, the COVID-19 pandemic revealed that adaptive teams and healthcare organizations are in advantageous positions and can address the severe challenge without significantly losing quality and worsening patient outcomes (Daly et al., 2020). Change champions and opinion leaders are highly valuable for any team, and their willingness to improve the practice is necessary for assisting employees and organizations in adapting to unstable working conditions.
The rapidly changing situation in the market of goods and services forces organizations to adapt efficiently and quickly. It results in overly rapid changes within the enterprise without a smooth transition. The fast pace is becoming a problem for both the company and employees. Team members are forced to quickly adapt to new work formats, promptly learn new skills, and take on additional roles. In such conditions, competent and high-quality change management and decision-making are essential.In an age of global transformation, change management has become one of the principal success factors for most companies. The surrounding reality is in a state of constant shift: the demands of internal and external customers are changing, new market barriers and opportunities are emerging, unforeseen risks are occurring. Companies that cannot withstand
The evolving technologies have impacted various sectors including health among many others. Eventually, this has prompted to the development of various technologies that enhance patient care. Automated IV Pumps, one of my identified technology developed to improve patient care, executes many advantages. Notably, they are used in hospitals, nursing homes, and home-based care to provide quality patient care. However, with the elevating number of patients in hospitals, there is a need to develop better technologies to improve patients’ health care or to improve on the available technologies. They improve the Automated IV Pumps involves instructions, maintenance, alert, delayed therapy and missed treatment various changes have,e to be enhanced. One of the significant changes to be implemented to improve use of Automated IV Pumps in improving the patient’s health
Chapter IThe first chapter describes the position of women in Neo-Confucian regimes in China and Japan. When comparing the attitude of the society towards women in these two countries, it is possible to see that Chinese society was more strict with them (Hughes, S.S. & Hughes, B., 1997). However, women’s position in both societies was quite low because China and Japan were patriarchal countries dominated by males, though Japan once was a matrilocal system.Chinese government adopted several laws that were meant to protect women’s dignity and chastity, but in practice, they served as severe restrictions on their freedom and violation of their rights. Thus, the Quing rape laws adopted in the middle of the XVII century made it hard for women to achieve justice since they needed to
provide evidence of being raped. Apart from that, the definition of rape was officially established, and it was hard to classify an assault as rape if it did not match the definition (Hughes, S. S. & Hughes, B., 1997). In addition, the Chinese government restricted the position of widows since they were forced either to live in the household of their late husband and take care of the family or to remarry, leaving all the property and children in the family of the first husband. Thus, many widows were remarried against their will and left without property and reputation.Hence, women in China were forced to protect their chastity by themselves, sometimes even with their own lives. However, despite significant law positions and almost no social status, some Chinese
women were prolific painters. Thus, Chen Shu is among the famous artists of this time, and the emperor himself valued her works. Women in Japan were raised with more freedom than in China, though they still were expected to obey men. They started working at the age of twelve or earlier and, after marriage, were expected to not only run the household but work alongside the husband (Hughes, S.S. & Hughes, B., 1997). Wealthy peasants, however, could afford their daughters to get an education to become servants in the houses of the nobility.Chapter IIThe book’s second chapter is devoted to women’s position in the Ottoman Empire in the XVII century. To begin with, men could officially marry more than one woman, and a lot of noblemen, including the
sultan, had harems where their concubines lived (Hughes, S. S. & Hughes, B., 1997). Thus, during the reign of Suleman I, one of his former concubines, Hurrem, became one of the most powerful women in the Empire and influenced the politics of the country. Despite all the privileges they had, including getting the education and opportunity to marry a nobleman, all women in the sultan’s harem, apart from his mother and sisters, were slaves. Despite being slaves, the sultan’s favorite concubines could build social interactions with the nobility and gain their support or even friendship.Apart from that, dynastic marriages were quite popular in the Ottoman Empire during the XVII century. It is interesting that Turkish princesses could marry several times in life since their first marriage usually happened
women who did not live in harems, it is necessary to mention that they could go to court to protect their rights or solve problems with the estate, marriage, divorce, and other issues. The sources of that time say that Turkish women applied to court almost as frequently as men did (Hughes, S. S. & Hughes, B., 1997). Despite the fact that a woman could divorce her husband, she was required to obey him during their matrimony. Though men could have more than one wife and several concubines, women were free to choose their husbands, and marriage against the woman’s will was almost impossible.
The chapter primarily focuses on the ethical evaluation of BP’s decisions in regards to spill management through the lens of utilitarianism. The latter considers an action ethical or unethical depending on the overall outcome and benefits (Halbert and Ingulli 1). When analyzing BP’s decisions and actions, it is important to include all stakeholders. Firstly, the cost-benefit analysis shows that BP incurred heavy losses due to fines, penalties, lawsuits, and damaged business. However, both long-term and short-term effects need to be considered. Secondly, shareholders of the company also incurred major losses.Thirdly, the workers, who suffered from the spill, and other professionals were involved in the cleanup were killed, severely injured, or suffered other health effects. Fourthly, the Gulf area is a highly valuable ecosystem for fishing and other marine
Communication and collaboration are crucial elements for the success of any individual and team effort. The first chapter of the book Technical Communication provides insight into the aspects of technical communication and its importance.I discovered that technical communication addresses two main tasks: assisting people in learning about certain phenomena or how to do a certain task. Additionally, technical communication can make others strengthen their attitudes, change them, or even take particular actions. I also found that technical documents reflect organizational culture, are made in collaboration and have distinctive elements, including a particular reader, clear instructions on resolving an issue, design, images, and words. Finally, I discovered that technical communication was a valuable skill in the workplace since it allows people to read and produce technical documents.When collaborating with
Although crime in Reading, Pennsylvania, remained high despite the city’s budget constraints, police chief William Heim invested significantly in crime prediction software in 2013. Predictive Policing is the name of this Big Data start-program up’s dubbed PredPol (short for predictive policing). As promised, the program would analyze past crime data to identify where and when cries most likely occur hourly. The number of burglaries in high-crime neighborhoods dropped by nearly 20% when police started paying more attention to these hotspots. Predictive policing software is similar to a lot of baseball statistical modeling. It is presumably devoid of the racism and prejudices incorporated in the recidivism models that the court system utilizes. For this program to work, it has to have much data about the region to justify the
presence of police there.It has been established that human initiatives generate tension and danger in vulnerable populations. Mathematical models currently dominate law enforcement. Because of ideas that relate nonviolent crimes to a rise in violent crimes, police chiefs feel that even “nuisance data” may be utilized to create “better data” that can concentrate more intensely on violent crimes. Police departments throughout the nation are bolstering zero-tolerance rules for both violent and nonviolent offenses by relying on data from predictive policing methods. One of the most hazardous aspects of this system is that its inner workings are kept secret from the general people.At a “hackathon” in the spring of 2011, O’Neil and the New York Civil Liberties Union worked together to uncover crucial information on the NYPD’s controversial and
destructive stop-and-frisk program. Many Black and Latino teenagers were being frisked because of data, even though just 0.1% of those frisked were in any way connected to a serious crime. “Stop and Frisk,” O’Neil argues in his book, is not a WMD, but it utilizes mathematics to justify thousands of intrusive stops in vulnerable communities. Even though humans administered it, stop and frisk resulted in horrendous feedback loops that disproportionately penalized Black and Latino males for minor infractions seldom enforced against whites.Police are likely to target non-whites in low-income areas that lack access to excellent schools and jobs. As a result, sentencing recommendations based on WMDs, like predictive policing and recidivism models, are both racially discriminatory and logically faulty. There is no consideration for human nature in these
of a 22-year-old male who resided in a high-crime, low-income area in 2013. They warned him that the police were keeping an eye on him because he was linked to persons who had been arrested. By focusing on persons not involved in criminal activity, police were stoking racial tensions in the communities where crime was a problem. According to O’Neil, building models that presume everyone is the same is more accessible than developing policies that make the justice system more equitable (though perhaps less efficient).
During the past century, scientific findings have significantly changed the way humans live in all spheres of life. Scientific methods have also been transferred to psychology to understand human behavior. Science uses systematic observation as a medium of obtaining knowledge. It is an empirical method that helps scientists learn more about our biological and physical world. Science has been used to save humanity from various catastrophes and diseases by discoveries of vaccines and the green revolution. These discoveries saved millions of people from eventual death caused by diseases that were untreatable.Science has four vital elements, which include: 1. Systematic observation. Scientists make observations in a very organized manner. The observed phenomenon is customarily measured and recorded to reduce memory bias, affecting scientific conclusions. Most observations are done in
controlled conditions, which are systematically varied to understand the phenomenon comprehensively. 2. Hypothesis testing. Hypotheses and theories are developed in a manner that can be tested. Testing hypotheses requires that experiments be conducted to either prove or refute the hypothesis. It is an empirical way of confirming the validity of such hypotheses. 3. Democratic. Scientists usually engage in debates and discussions concerning their theories and observations. The free expression of scientific ideas helps bring out the best in science. Scientists do not disregard the works of others but engage in critiques and support of scientific works aimed at bettering the quality of knowledge acquired. 4. Cumulative. The scientist also uses facts presented by earlier scientists to build on their works. Science provides a straight path of development where
earlier advances build up better and more enriching facts and knowledge.Some people still doubt psychology is a science because many psychological phenomena like intelligence, depression, and prejudice are seemingly unobservable. However, psychological researchers mainly focus on behavior because individual feelings and thoughts are invisible. Scientists can also observe the behaviors of identical and fraternal twins to know the extent to which social and genetic factors contribute to personality. In recent times, psychology has become a complex discipline because of better study designs, measures, and statistical analyses in exploring human nature (Diener). For instance, when studying the emotion of happiness, the psychologist can ask participants about their happiness and request them to indicate where their feelings lie on a numbered scale. Scientists can also use memory measures based on
the idea that optimistic people have no problems recalling pleasant memories while negative people easily recall unpleasant events.Moreover, psychologists also use biological measures, including saliva cortisol samples or fMRI images of brain activation. Therefore, psychological science is essential for creating interventions that enhance people’s lives. Many research studies are concerned with ascertaining which therapies are the least and most effective for treating psychological disorders. Several studies have indicated that cognitive-behavioral therapy is effective in helping people suffering from anxiety and depression disorders (Diener). Some other research findings have shown that some therapies are harmful and should be avoided. Therefore, it is important to evaluate the various interventions used to treat patients and eliminate those that are deemed as harmful.In recent times, the easy way people access information and
explanations makes us live in the “Information Age.” It is essential to consider the quality of information instead of quantity because not all information is to be trusted. Trustworthy information is hard to come by in an era full of fake news and misleading information. In this respect, science’s main task is to determine what type of information to consider as being well-informed. It uses observable data to help understand and explain the world in a trustworthy manner. Scientists conclude by using less certain words that are related to probabilities. Such a manner of explaining situations is what separates scientific from non-scientific statements.Both methods make use of induction which concludes based on specific observations. However, the induction process is considered an untrustworthy way of providing information due to
its contradictory results. Scientific thinking is distinguished from everyday thinking by certain prescribed features. These features found in scientific theories and data include consistency, scope, simplicity, fruitfulness. There is also another additional feature that is prevalent in scientific theorizing and thinking, known as falsification. Karl Popper dismisses statements that did not pass the falsification test. He viewed such statements as hindrances to scientific progress. Popper claimed that there was no way of refuting, refining, or advancing knowledge using such statements. He offered a solution that argued that there would be only one actual possibility if science proved that all others were not true (Erin). It means that scientists need to articulate all evidence to disapprove their hypotheses.However, today’s scientists are more interested in providing explanations and descriptions for
the way things are and not how they are not. There is a need to describe different causes and situations under which they happen. In this regard, it can be said that proof is associated with deductive reasoning. Deductive reasoning makes use of general principles which are applied to specific situations. If the principles are accurate and the argument structure is valid, it automatically means that the conclusion is proven. A deductive truth is applicable in all situations with no exceptions. It is among the many differences between conclusions drawn from scientific observations and those drawn from personal anecdotes. Well-designed research depends on systematically-recorded observations that represent the population and are of high quality.The Null Hypothesis Significance Testing is used to assess the probability that the data collected
researcher needs to gather data and compares what she expects to find to what she finds. The aim of collecting data and making comparisons is to determine whether to reject or falsify the null hypothesis in favor of the alternative hypothesis. However, the research conclusions can be wrong due to errors. There are the type1 error and type11 errors (Erin). The type 1 error is when the research concludes that there is a relationship between the variables while there is not in reality. On the other hand, the type II error occurs when the collected data does not show a relationship between two variables while there exists one. However, researchers can set a threshold for type I and type II errors using probability values.
Chapter 3. India. Women of Mughal EmpireIn this chapter of the book Women in World History , the Mughal rule and its consequences for women in conquered lands are discussed. The first concept presented in this book is the aspect of slavery. Non-Muslims were allowed to be enslaved according to Islamic laws, so for women, slavery was a greater threat than being forced to conform to a foreign religion and ways of living. Due to famines, many women were sold into slavery or seized to be sold at auctions away from their homes.At that time, bhakti, an art movement of female poet-saint, began. Bhakti means “devotion”, so this genre concerns religious matters such as denial of pedantry, rejection of asceticism, and depths of personal devotion. This way of
self-expression had no boundaries, and its followers (many of whom were women) could present it anywhere. However, this does not mean that women did not struggle with acceptance in those realms. Another critical aspect of women’s lives was the production of cloth. The cloth had become a big part of Indian export, and every woman in a castle was capable of spinning thread (Hughes, & Hughes, 1997). Weaving had become a family production, and many of them settled near cities where silk, cotton, and wool were in great demand.For royal women of Mughal, a great responsibility was to ensure the health and success of younger generations that were to take power. They educated and advised princes in their coming-of-age and wars for the throne and subsequently influenced politics.
Empress Nur Jahan could exceed the power limitations set for women at the time by commending channels of power to herself. She enjoyed displaying her superiority, but she could keep in the background and manipulate others.Chapter 4. Europe. Witches, Workers, and QueensReligious cataclysms have colored women’s lives in Europe in the 16th and 18th centuries. On the one hand, due to Protestant ideas of a personal approach to salvation, women were able to access education. On the other, beliefs that women were affiliated with the devil have plagued the minds of authorities. Witchcrazes have been caused by patriarchy and misogyny, and their effects crippled females’ trust and confidence for ages to come. Public executions for witchcraft were ways for men to dominate women through pain, humiliation, and fear.A
and some of them governed as regents for male heirs (Hughes, & Hughes, 1997). As opposed to the ideas of men, those women were as competent in managing kingdoms as men could be. An excellent example of that is the Maria Theresa of Austria. She exuded courage, ambition, and common sense when ruling. In addition, she valued education for herself and the authorities. Her life story and actions serve as a rebuttal to misogynistic ideas within authority structures.
Robotics is a discipline of engineering and computer science that deals with robots’ design, manufacture, maintenance, and utilization. Robotics strives to create devices that can support and benefit people. Mechanical engineering, mechatronics, information engineering, electronics, biotechnology, computer programming, software development, and mathematics are included in robotics. In designing a robot, it is necessary to highlight the stage of testing and simulations, which, combined into separate courses, can identify possible drawbacks and errors. What concerns the elaboration of an obstacle course in a “real-world” simulation, it is essential to ensure the presence of several procedure testing steps that will determine the functionality of a robot.A robot is considered a machine capable of automatically performing a complicated set of activities, particularly one that a computer can program. Advanced cyber-physical technologies,
including robotics systems, are often associated with the physical and software components that are supposed to alter over time (Jamshidi et al., 2019). A remote control system can direct a robot, or the control can be included inside the machine itself. Although some robots are meant to resemble humans, most are task-oriented technologies focusing on basic utility rather than expressive aesthetics. Humanoids, industrial machines, medical operational robots, patient aid robotic systems, cooperatively programmed robots, and minuscule nanorobots are examples of autonomous and semi-autonomous robots. A robot may obtain a sense of consciousness or think of its own by replicating a realistic look or automating motions, and autonomous devices are likely to transmit in the future.Considering the process of constructing a robot, it is important to highlight several specific
building stages that can be universal. Establishing a purpose for the robot is the first phase, which allows determining its specific capabilities, which, as a result, will help the creators set the necessary tasks. Secondly, select whether the robot will operate on a manufacturing or intelligent operating system, depending on whether constructors are developing an industrial or conceptual computer. Thirdly, designing the machine’s central command module, which will be in charge of decision-making, and constructing a shell will provide physical characteristics and functionality.The purpose of the course is defined by the need to ensure the robot can navigate in space, detect barriers and effectively abolish them. In order to elaborate an obstacle course that can test the autonomy of simple robots, it is possible to select a “real-world”
simulation as a course general design approach. What concerns a “real-world” simulation, this testing concept is based on the assessment of how efficiently a robot is able to avoid obstacles and solve issues in practical and real circumstances, as in Figure 1 (Pandey et al., 2019). Moreover, in this simulation, a robot’s performance is scored and analyzed in a scoring system, which collects and sorts data. Firstly, to create a specific course, it is obligatory to identify the design concept and the key features and components of the robot that has to be tested.Figure 1. Testing autonomy: ideal trajectory of robot navigation between obstaclesReferring to the technical characteristics and components, the robot will include chassis, wheels, motors, motherboards, a proportional integrative derivative controller, and a microprocessor that will
allow the robot to execute a program. Since the course design is dedicated to the ability of a robot to avoid real obstacles in a condition of a simulation, it is important to emphasize the presence of sensor component options. The robot should possess a metal detector that can identify objects on the ground, ultrasonic sensors that determine proximity to objects, and a compass that uses the Earth’s magnetic field to select directions. In addition, it is essential to apply LED flasher technology since it emits flashing lights at variable frequencies.What concerns the map of the proposed course, it can be stated that it should be compiled of conditions and challenges for the moving process of a robot. Furthermore, it should include a function that will enable a
sufficient level of communication with the receivers. Regarding certain steps and procedural descriptions of the course implementation, it is possible to identify a simulation where a robot is required to navigate around inconsistently located objects, for instance, a remote control machine. With the help of this procedure step, it is feasible to evaluate the degree of the robot’s successful decision-making in a situation that demands rapid adjustments. Moreover, the second step is devoted to changing the robot’s initial position in the space before testing. In this case, the robot is proposed to start moving from different points selected randomly. Therefore, this process excludes pattern behavior and ensures effective orientation in varying settings. Finally, the third step describes the measurement of the robot’s velocity and analysis what speed level
as a basic design strategy for creating an obstacle course that can test the autonomy of simple robots. The robot will have chassis, wheels, motors, motherboards, a proportional integrative derivative controller, and a processor that will allow the robot to conduct a program, among other technological characteristics and components. What concerns the recommended course map is that it should be composed of circumstances and problems for a robot’s movement.
The concept of nursing is closely associated with the idea of continuous improvement, as the trends of health care need to mirror the existing social trends to provide the best care possible. One way to secure such care is to refer to the latest scholarly findings to modify the approaches to care provision in the workplace. This process of implementing research-based findings in daily patient care is known as evidence-based practice (EBP) (Wilson & Austria, 2021). Currently, EBP is not used actively by nurses for several reasons.First, the workload of most nurses discourages their desire to learn and embrace EBP. According to McArthur et al. (2021), a physical opportunity is a construct that contributes to the nurses’ ability to resort to EBM. Physical opportunity includes such barriers as
facilitate EBP is evident.The first commonly mentioned approach to facilitate the use of EBP is to establish a leadership that would encourage the practice by both setting an example and conducting training and workshops. Another crucial facilitator is to secure nurses’ access to relevant sources in the workplace, including relevant databases, steady Internet connection, and subscription to peer-reviewed publications. In such a way, the use of scholarly research will become more time-efficient and less stressful for nurses.
IntroductionAntibiotics work against bacteria in numerous ways by either inhibiting metabolic pathways, nucleic acid synthesis, protein synthesis, depolarizing cell membrane, or inhibiting the cell wall synthesis. By employing these methods, antibiotics can inhibit bacterial growth or kill it. However, as antibiotics work against bacteria, they have been depicted to leave behind resistant strains that multiply naturally (Reygaert, 2018). Antibiotic resistance occurs when germs such as bacteria and fungi continue to grow by developing the ability to defeat drugs designed to kill them (Singer et al., 2003; Toerien, 1967). Sometimes it is impossible and difficult to treat infections that are caused by antibiotic-resistant germs (Foti et al., 2011; Fair & Tor, 2014). Patients who have these infections require extended medical stays, follow-ups, and costly alternatives before realizing positive results.Microorganisms
from the unknown samples are essential to identify to prevent harmful and beneficial bacteria in this society. The problem of antibiotic resistance has spread worldwide and has a more significant impact on poor and developing nations than developed nations (Ventola, 2015; Waxman, & Strominger, 1983). Because of the ease with which antibiotics can be purchased in many of these countries without a prescription, the developed world primarily relies on prescriptions (Alanis, 2005). According to Falagas and Bliziotis (2007), polymyxins were the antibiotics that retained the highest activity against the three examined species of Gram-negative bacteria. Citrobacter freundii (C. freundii ) is often resilient to numerous groups of antibiotics, signifying that both scientific and ecological strains may harbor antimicrobial resistance elements (Liu et al., 2018). Over the past years,
there has been increased awareness of family Enterobacteriaceae due to its association with causing animal and human diseases (Stanic et al., 2015). Genus Hafnia has been linked to emerging antimicrobial resistance patterns and infections related to presenting unusual diseases and stem cells.The lab techniques and procedures covered during this course were used to test each student’s practical understanding of microbiology. The purpose of this lab report is to identify unknown organisms using genetic sequencing and traditional biochemical testing techniques on each isolated unknown that led to the identification of each unknown. It is also predicted that C. freundii will have a more excellent antibiotic resistance to each of the four tested antibiotics, including penicillin, doxycycline, polymyxin B, and rifampicin, than Hafnia alvei .MethodsTwo unknown organisms labelled as #15
and #43 were provided on agar plates. Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR) was done to identify the genus for both unknown organisms (#15 and #43). PCR entails a biochemical process that amplifies a single DNA molecule (BIOS 3120, 2021). It was used to find specific 16s rRNA genes present in unknown organisms by cross-referencing them with databases for known bacteria sequencing. PCR test involved materials such as Taq polymerase, a DNA template, PCR primers, nucleotides, inoculation loop, a flame, a micropipette, sterile water, and a PCR tube. A mix for loading in the PCR was made by adding 0.5µL of forward primer 8F, 0.5 µL of reverse primer 1492R, 1µL of the DNA template, 10.5 µL of sterile water, and 12.5 µL of master mix to a PCR tube.
The tubes were then loaded in an Eppendorf Mastercycler Nexus Thermal Cycler Gradient programmed to start with 95 0 C for 10 minutes, 95 0 C for 1.5 minutes, 55 0 C for 1 minute, 72 0 C for 2 minutes, 72 0 C for 10 minutes, and a 10 0 C hold (Lab Manual, 2021).The unknown organisms were streaked on the TSA broth and TSA plate by inoculating the loop over the flame and then transferring a loop bacterium into the slant on a zig-zag motion. The streaked organism was then incubated at 37 0 C until the next lap period to prepare the bacteria for biochemical tests. An analysis was made, and the samples were used to carry out six biochemical tests on each unknown bacterial
culture. For unknown #43, the following tests were performed: gram stain, thioglycolate, oxidase, catalase, citrate, indole production, and ornithine-decarboxylase test. For unknown #15, the tests performed were gram stain, thioglycolate, oxidase, catalase, ONPG (B-galactosidase), and indole production.Gram StainGram stain is a laboratory technique used for determining the thickness of bacteria’s peptidoglycan layer by labeling it either as thick peptidoglycan layer (gram-positive) or thin peptidoglycan layer (gram-negative). To perform gram staining, the material needed included clean microscope slides, staining trays, gram stain reagents, a water bottle for rinsing, and bacterial cultures. Gram stain test began with the bacterial smear at fixed heating on an inoculated slide containing a colony of bacteria culture in a small volume of water. The bacterial specimen was then air-dried followed by fixed heating underside
for a few seconds. After completing heat-fixing, gram straining was performed on the bacterial smear.The procedure for this biochemical test entailed, firstly, addition of crystal violate drops to the smear and then allowing it to settle for sixty seconds. The slide was then rinsed off; after this step, all the cells were purple. Secondly, a few drops of gram’s iodine were added to the bacterial smear and then allowed to sit for sixty seconds before rinsing with water. Alcohol was added as a decolorizer and left to run over the slide surface for 7 seconds until no more crystal color came out of the bacterial smear. The slide was then rinsed with water to stop the decolorization process. It was noted that Gram-positive cells retain crystal violet and
remain purple after adding decolorizer while gram-negative cells lose crystal violet and become colorless. Finally, a few drops of safranin were added on the slide as a counterstain then allowed to sit for one minute before rinsing off. The results were then analyzed by putting and observing the slide color under a microscope. Bacterial growth at 45 0 C was done by incubating the culture for 48 hours, and then observation was done on its growth.Thioglycolate TestIn a bacterial experiment, a thioglycolate test was chiefly performed to ascertain bacterial oxygen requirement using thioglycolate broth that contained an oxygen gradient with higher levels at the top and no oxygen at the bottom. When conducting this test, the material required included a thioglycolate tube with resazurin indicator and bacterial cultures
#43 and #15 (Beaman et al., 2007). A thioglycolate tube was inoculated with the organism to be tested for oxygen relationship and then allowed to grow at the optimal growth temperature. Growth patterns were then observed for the test on thioglycolate broth.Oxidase TestOxidase test was done to ascertain if bacteria under test produced the enzyme cytochrome oxidase. The presence of this enzyme is an indication of aerobic bacteria, which can utilize oxygen in the respiration process as a terminal electron acceptor (Beaman et al., 2007). Oxidase test was performed by inoculating bacteria culture onto an oxidase disc upon which Kovac’s reagent was added on top, and then observation made on the color changes.Catalase TestA catalase test is done to establish if bacteria produce enzyme catalase understudy in a
bacterial test. Catalase enzyme is used for breaking down hydrogen peroxide, which is a harmful chemical (Beaman et al., 2007). The test was conducted by streaking bacteria onto the TSA slant and growing it at 37 0 C for 48 hours, after which hydrogen peroxide was added. The observation was done on the reaction of the bacteria with hydrogen peroxide.Citrate TestA citrate test is done to determine if bacteria can use sodium citrate as the only carbon source and inorganic ammonium hydrogen phosphate as a nitrogen source. Citrate test was done by streaking the slant back and forth with a light inoculum containing bacterial colony and then incubated aerobically at 37 0 C for 96 hours (Beaman et al., 2007). The observation was made on color changes from
green to blue or no color change along the slant.Indole ProductionMost proteins contain tryptophan amino acid, and some bacteria can produce enzyme tryptophanase that breaks down this type of amino acid into indole, pyruvate and ammonia. The indole production test was performed by first growing the organism using a tryptophan medium (Beaman et al., 2007). Tryptophan broth was then inoculated aseptically to allow culture growth for 24 hours at 37 0 C. 0.5 ml of Kovac’s reagent was added to the broth culture, and the tube was observed for absence or presence of the ring.Ornithine-Decarboxylase TestOrnithine-decarboxylase test is primarily done to establish if a microbe has the ability to use ornithine as the sole carbon source and energy for growth. Ornithine decarboxylase accomplishes the utilization of ornithine. The
test was conducted by putting the inoculum of culture #43 aseptically into ornithine decarboxylase broth and then incubated for 48 hours at 37 0 C and an observation made on color changes.ONPG (B-Galactosidase) TestONPG test is perform to differentiate members belonging to Enterobacteriaceae family and other microbes depending on activities of beta-D-galactosidase. The test differentiates late lactose fermenters from non-lactose fermenters of Enterobacteriaceae . The test was conducted with test medium at room temperature of 37 0 C, and then inoculum incubated aerobically with loose caps for 24 hours and observation made on color changes.Kirby-Bauer (Antibiotic Sensitivity) TestKirby-Bauer test is used for ascertaining the choice of antibiotics to be used when treating an infection. The test used penicillin, doxycycline, polymyxin B, and rifampicin on the culture colony. The
observation was then done on the zone sizes, and results were interpreted (Bhargav et al., 2016). Upon completing all the experimental tests, unknown organisms were identified following PCR/BLAST, dichotomous keys using the Bergey’s (Whitman et al., 2016), streak plate isolation, and biochemical tests.ResultsAn organism of genus Citrobacter was characterized by straight rods, about 1µm in diameter and 2 – 6µm in length and occurring in pairs and singly. Both #15 and #43 were first identified using DNA sequence analysis that involved performing genetic comparisons of the organisms. During initial identification of these organisms, genetic analyses workflow was performed that included identifying genus via PCR/BLAST, dichotomous keys, streak plate isolation, and analyzing isolated biochemical tests using the Bergey’s Manual. For unknown organism #15, a gram stain, thioglycolate test, oxidase
test, and indole production were all negative, and positive for catalase test and ONPG (B-galactosidase) test. To identify the identity of the unknown organism, the test results were followed using a dichotomous key, which identified unknown organism #15 to be C. fundii.Test Result for Organism #15Name of Test                  Observation                                     Interpretation

          The organism did not react with Kovac’s reagent.                                               The result for unknown organism #43 was negative for gram stain, thioglycolate test, and oxidase test, while a positive result was observed in the catalase test. Citrate test was negative, while the indole production test using SIM and ornithine-decarboxylase test were positive. Hafnia is characterized by straight rods of about 1µm in diameter and 2-5 µm in length, it was first identified based on
its PCR/BLAST, biochemical test results, and dichotomous key. Therefore, the unknown organism #43 was identified as H. alvei based on the tabulated results below.Test Result for Organism #43Name of Test                  Observation                                      Interpretation

The organism caused activation of ornithine-decarboxylase enzyme.     Discussion and ConclusionGram stain test was done to determine the thickness of the organism under study. Both unknown organisms #15 and #43, C. fundii and H. alvei , respectively showed negative results for the gram stain test as expected. A thioglycolate test was done to determine bacterial
oxygen requirement, and in the experiment, the test was negative for both cultures of bacteria colonies. There were negative oxidase test results, and this test was conducted to identify if the organism under study used oxygen. It was also essential to perform a catalase test to determine if the bacteria contained catalase enzyme. The catalase test was positive for both organisms because the reaction with hydrogen peroxide was effervescence, producing bubbles. A citrate test was performed to establish if the H. alvei could use compound citrate as the only source for carbon. There was no color change in the medium during the citrate test, showing the inoculum did not contain enzyme citrate permease. The predicted results of H. alvei , conformed with biochemical test for genus Hafnia except
for indole production which was positive.It is possible to detect indole in a media because it accumulates in the body, unlike ammonia and pyruvate, which are converted into other molecules. The existence of indole in the biochemical test exhibited the release of tryptophanase enzyme by the bacteria, and it was showed by the pink color that settled when the medium was added Kovac’s reagent in #43. During ornithine decarboxylase test on #43, it was observed that the color changed from yellow to purple showing that glucose present was used by the microbe to cause pH drop thereby activating ornithine decarboxylase enzyme. After 48 hours the yellow color changed back to purple showing positive test results for ornithine decarboxylase enzyme. ONPG (B-galactosidase) was performed to differentiate members of Enterobacteriaceae
Influence on Jazz HistoryCharles Bolden was born in New Orleans and is recognized as the first person to perform and play what could thereafter be considered jazz music. Many early jazz musicians credited Charles as the founder of jazz. Louis Armstrong and Jelly Roll Morton attested that Bolden was among the most influential musicians who played jazz. Many aspects of Bolden traditions, such as syncopation, polyrhythm, and improvision, linger today and are considered significant to jazz music (Nmaam, 2019). Since Buddy Bolden’s band did not know how to read music, most of their compositions were either copied or generated on the spot. That is how the art of improvising became the hallmark of jazz. This style had an impact on young jazz musicians. Musicians today draw inspiration from
the first king of jazz, and his influence on music culture and ingenuity touches them fundamentally.Bolden was known for his loud sound. People who sang about the prowess of his music career emphasized his loudness. He cemented his reputation by using the knowledge of his cornet to put fans into a trance and get them dancing into a frenzy (Micucci, 2019). Bolden had the ability to sink himself into a trance where nothing mattered but music. He played blues at medium tempos sprinkled with racy lyrics. By mixing gospel and blues inflections, he made a rhythmic feel that resulted in a unique sound that spread throughout New Orleans. His talent for altering rhythm, performance, and melody elements appealed to his fans and forever changed the music course.Events and
People That Shaped His Life and CareerBolden began playing the cornet in his teenage years. Manuel Hall, a neighbor, taught him how to play the cornet. He also took lessons on the cornet and played at parades in parks, picnics, and union halls that dotted the neighborhood. Bolden later joined a New Orleans band led by Charles Galloway, where he displayed his musical talent and skills. Later, the young musician created his band that consisted of five members – the guitar, cornet, two clarinets, bass, trombone, and drums. They played a wide range of genres, including ragtime, blues, and waltzes. Although the band was musically untrained and short on techniques, he improvised embellishments.Bolden was also motivated by the music that was performed in his hometown. Some of the
The adjustment process of new children and their parents can be challenging for them and the teacher. An educator can implement many educational and communicational techniques to ease the process and support the children and parents. I believe that maintaining constant communication with parents through conferences or phone calls, with the consideration of their time and privacy, is one of the most important elements. Encouraging home learning activities and welcoming parents into the classroom is also crucial.Most parents would like to be involved in or informed about their children’s adjustment in a new classroom. Gaining parents’ trust by properly communicating with them and engaging them in collaborative problem-solving and planning would ease their and their children’s adjustment process (Kuhn et al., 2017). Being mindful of their time and
is challenging; however, there are ways to make it easier for all the parties. I think that being respectful and maintaining educator-parent communication is the most important factor in adapting to a new schooling environment. Inviting the parents to the classroom can help with the separation anxiety in both children and their parents. Additionally, encouraging home learning activities would solve the involvement issue of the children.
Counselling parents on children’s sexuality is a challenging task because parents often realize how fast their children are growing and that sexual development starts from birth. Thus, I would counsel parents about childhood sexuality based on evidence about what is considered normal sexual behavior what is considered abnormal sexual behavior at a certain age. I would also try to be sensitive to the culture of the parents, as some parents may still consider some behavior inappropriate despite evidence due to cultural peculiarities. I would also teach about how to respond to sexual behavior appropriately. The National Center on the Sexual Behavior of Youth (NCSBY, n.d.) states that there are two strategies for responding to the behavior: “in the moment” and “after the fact.” At the moment, the parents
should pause to collect their thoughts and avoid emotional responses, redirect the behavior, listen to what the child has to say, and teach about appropriate behavior. After the fact, parents need to reflect on all the information and knowledge they have, prepare for the dialogue, and communicate with the child.In order to identify if sexual behavior is normal, one needs to understand that appropriate behavior differs depending on the children’s age. For instance, children aged 0-6 may touch their private parts in public, while at the age of five, some children start to feel shy about doing so and explore themselves in private (NCSBY, n.d.). Thus, in order to identify if the behavior is normal, it is crucial to have adequate knowledge about what is appropriate at a
certain age and see if the child progresses on the path rather than regresses.Discussion: The Introduction of the HPV VaccineHuman papillomavirus (HPV) is one of the most common sexually transferred diseases that can cause different types of cancer (CDC, 2021). Thus, preventing HPV is crucial for reducing the chance of acquiring these cancers. Currently, vaccination for HPV is optional; however, it has been offered several times to make it mandatory (Ferris et al., 2010). The study by Ferris et al. (2010) appears to be based upon several cultural and sexual assumptions. First, the promotion of mandatory HPV vaccination implies that the researchers assumed that people are sexually active and far from being monogamous (Best et al., 2019). Research demonstrates that people who are not sexually active think negatively
about mandatory HPV vaccination, as it is unneeded (Best et al., 2019). Similarly, people in long-term romantic relationships or married also think negatively of vaccination for the same reason (Best et al., 2019).Second, Ferris et al. (2010) do not have strong religious beliefs. Research shows that people with strong religious beliefs think negatively of immunization against HPV (Best et al., 2019). The primary reason for that may be that religious people think that the idea of vaccination against STDs promotes the assumption of being sexually active with numerous partners (Best et al., 2019). Religious people are mostly monogamous (Best et al., 2019). Thus, I believe that making HPV immunization mandatory on the school level is inappropriate, as it does not consider the cultural beliefs of patients.Discussion 3: Personal
When teaching students with peculiar language-related needs, for instance, dual-language learners (DLLs), it is pivotal to organize one’s use of talking to encourage children’s active participation in conversations. DLLs demonstrate a steady advantage over other students when performing tasks requiring switching from one set of rules to another (Sandhofer & Uchikoshi, 2013). With that in mind, to maximize children’s participation and language use, I can incorporate classroom activities and games requiring switching a language quickly, translating notions expressed in images in another language, and so on.Another approach to balancing the amount of teacher’s talking involves restricting verbal hints and suggestive interrogation in discussion activities in the classroom. Practices linked with encouraging DLLs to answer and ask questions during reading activities facilitate oral language development (Halgunseth et al., 2013). Nevertheless, to maximize children’s motivation to participate and express their thoughts, I can keep track of my questioning habits and replace the unnecessary remarks with non-verbal clues. For example, instead of answering my own questions when children cannot figure out the correct answer, I can implement visual clues, pantomime, and gestures to provide hints and direct their thinking. This will encourage them to engage in group discussions and express their guesses verbally, thus practicing speaking.
Patient education is a crucial step toward addressing public health issues, particularly, the threat of colorectal cancer and the effects that the chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) may have on the outcomes of a bowel resection surgery, including the complications that it may entail. Specifically, as a nurse, one must introduce a teaching plan that will be used as the guide for a patient to follow when learning about the side effects caused by COPD in patients requiring bowel resection. By incorporating the elements of verbal and nonverbal communication strategies, a nurse will be able to introduce a patient to the key COPD-related management of bowel resection in a patient with COPD.In a nursing context, a teaching plan represents a fairly simple idea. Suggesting a series of steps
to be taken in order to educate a patient about the disease and the means of recognizing and addressing the symptoms, a teaching plan implies building readiness and awareness in a vulnerable person (Potter et al., 2019). Remarkably, a teaching plan benefits not only a patient, but also a nurse. Specifically, a teaching plan allows a nurse to ensure that a patient complies with the proposed treatment strategies and can access the required services in case bowel resection is needed. In order words, a teaching plan increases patient autonomy and awareness, reducing the extent of health risk.To develop the teaching plan for educating a COPD patient about bowel resection and implement it accordingly, a nurse will need to embrace the opportunities that verbal and nonverbal communication strategies provide.
Specifically, in nursing verbal communication can be defined as the communication method involving the use of words to convey essential information to the patient (Potter et al., 2019). In turn, nonverbal communication suggests using any other tool, including gestures, facial expressions, movements, and other devices that may potentially substitute the use of the spoken language to transfer data. For a nurse as an educator, the application of nonverbal communication is vital dude to the presence of patients from diverse ethnic, racial, and cultural backgrounds (Potter et al., 2019). Therefore, learning to use visual cues as the means of introducing a patient to a specific piece of information should be regarded as one of the primary ways of promoting awareness and risk management.There are two primary non-verbal communication factors
to be borne in mind when developing an education program regarding the impact of COPD on the outcomes of bowel resection. First, it is vital to ensure that the nonverbal communication elements used in the process cannot be misinterpreted by the patient. Second, the nonverbal elements must be complementary to the verbal content and serve to reinforce its understanding as opposed to introducing new data, which means that instances of misunderstanding will be avoided. Moreover, since the patient does not have any background in health management or understanding of his issue, concise and simplified instructions must be provided. The table below outlines the essential elements of the teaching plan.Table 1.

                                           The key objectives of the learning process include educating the patient about the essential symptoms indicating the need for bowel resection, training the required health management skills (particularly, the use of the colostomy bag), and teaching the patient to access the necessary resources.   3. Available Resources                                     
 Lectures and simulations using specific scenarios will be used as the primary method of educating the patient.  2 weeks        The essential information will be provided to the patient using digital resources, particularly, digital repositories of information. Additionally, essential information concerning the process of bowel resection and its likely outcomes will be described, and methods of contacting a nurse will be provided.  The patient’s understanding of the subject matter will be tested with the help of short quizzes, as well as personal discussions with a nurse. The latter method will be particularly useful in identifying gaps in knowledge and any misconceptions that the patient might have about the subject matter.

                 As a nurse educator, one must also keep in mind that the patient education process is dynamic. In the case under analysis, the specified idea suggests that the learning process must be reciprocal, with the nurse learning about the patient’s learning abilities and characteristics, while the patient learns critical information about the surgery. Furthermore, being dynamic, patient education suggests that the choice of the strategies must be informed by the presence of cognitive and emotional stimuli.The dynamics of the teaching and learning process will also have to be primarily reciprocal for the key goals to be accomplished. Namely, the patient must be motivated to learn about the signs of bowel inflammation
and other symptoms indicative of cancer requiring further bowel resection. Thus, the patient will be introduced to the notion of self-directed learning, where he will be able to use the provided autonomy and independence to gain the relevant skills and the ability to assess the key risk. Thus, the patient will be prepared to function in a complex environment with multiple threat factors, selecting the settings that provide the most favorable conditions, managing the emergent issues, and seeking the support of healthcare experts whenever needed.However, building the described abilities in a patient will require a major teaching effort from a nurse, as well as a number of relevant teaching skills. Specifically, as a nurse educator, particularly, on the issue of bowel resection surgery in COPD patients, a nurse
must have several vital competencies. Firstly, a nurse must be able to introduce complex COPD- and colorectal-cancer-related information to the patient in an easily digestible way. Thus, the patient will memorize critical strategies for identifying the risks of colorectal cancer and identifying health risk. Secondly, a nurse must have the skills of organizing information and structuring it in the way that contributes to effective learning. Namely, since a patient cannot embrace the full extent of knowledge about his condition in a single session, the knowledge in question must be split into sections that will be introduced to the patient gradually.To determine the effectiveness of the program, a nurse will need to make several important observations. Specifically, the patient’s ability to identify health risks independently and be fully prepared
The patient, G. B., is a 50-year-old female who was diagnosed with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) for the first time. She addressed the clinic with frequent coughing, shortness of breath, fatigue, and excess sputum. She reported her history of smoking for the last 20 years and an insignificant increase in heart rate from time to time. She is hypertensive, but she controlled her blood pressure with Lisinopril. However, G. B. does not like to go to hospitals and thinks that medications are not necessary all the time. She came alone as she is a widow, and her children live far away in another country, so she did not want to bother them but check her condition independently. She defined herself as an isolated person after her husband’s
death in an accident. She has a close circle of friends who visit her sometimes, but there is no regular person to discuss her problems or concerns.PathophysiologyCOPD is a common diagnosis in many adults who have a history of smoking. Besides, this disease is one of the leading causes of morbidity and mortality today (Yawn et al., 2021). Thus, much attention is paid to its management and prevention through education and early detection. In addition to prolonged coughing, COPD patients experience fatigue, and the quality of life is significantly decreased (Early et al., 2019). In most cases, people who smoke suffer from dyspnea or shortness of breath, and clinicians ask to inhale and exhale a portion of volume to check their ability to get air in (Yawn et
al., 2021). When the mucosal surface is exposed to microbial pathogens, the lungs’ airways get inflamed and narrowed (Restrepo et al., 2018). Being untreated for some period, bronchial tubes may collapse because of formations clogged with mucus. The airflow is reduced, and airway obstruction occurs, making it problematic and painful to breathe in and out.With time, COPD patients observe new symptoms like swelling and wheezing. They cannot eat well and report a loss of appetite, which results in fatigue and dizziness. In older patients, COPD may provoke heart problems and increase the risks for pneumonia and the development of other infectious diseases. Therefore, nursing preventing and therapeutic interventions are critical for all people who smoke and put themselves at risk for COPD.AssessmentWhen G. B. addressed the clinic, a
general therapist made a decision to ask several questions in-person to gather enough facts about the disease history. The duration and severity of symptoms should be estimated to learn the patient’s condition. The next stage of the assessment was her physical examination and her vital signs (blood pressure – 145/90, pulse – 100, respiration rate – 20, body mass index – 28, and O2 saturation 90%). Her HEENT assessment was within the normal limits, except for her mouth and throat that had moist mucous membranes. When the doctor listened to her heart and lungs, some sounds were revealed to order chest X-rays and define emphysema or other formations that provoked COPD. It was also important to take the pulmonary function test and check to inhale and exhale qualities.
fatigue. The patient was educated about the importance of changing her lifestyle, keeping a balance between rest and activity, and using professional support in household initiatives (Hashem & Merritt, 2018). Antibiotics were prescribed to minimize the growth of infection in the body. At the end of the interventions, positive results were observed. G.B.’s breath sounds were not as severe as they were during the first visit, no infection that could affect her heart was in the body, and she began wondering about her further options with a support group. It was obligatory to continue education about COPD and smoking cessation in the future to predict pulmonary and cardiovascular problems.
The initial stage in the development of nursing research is considered to be the study conducted by Florence Nightingale. Methodically applying her deep and comprehensive knowledge of human nature in nursing, she improved the traditional female housework of caring for sick family members and elevated it to the rank of professional activities. Recently, in the United States, research in nursing has been increasingly recognized at the national level. The National Institute for Nursing Research has been established, and financial support for nursing research is being strengthened. In medical institutions, permanent positions of nurses have been introduced – scientific workers are involved in the conducting of clinical nursing research.In countries such as Great Britain, Germany, France, Switzerland, there are tendencies for recognizing nursing as an independent profession, the practical

Such misconduct should be avoided in scientific research, especially in healthcare field. To do so, the researchers should ensure the reliability and validity of the study by getting approval from the institutional review board. If I were to conduct the research, I would use the participants’ rights protection principle and seek the governmental healthcare association’s approval of chosen methods.
In Mesopotamia and Egypt, the first kings similarly worked alongside priests and depended on their support. However, Egyptian kings, specifically called pharaohs, were considered kings of the whole region and clearly stood above priests, while Mesopotamian kings worked closely with them (Brooks, 2019). Another important difference is the origin of the state’s rulers, as Mesopotamian kings were also warriors who led their people in battles with their neighbors, while Egyptian pharaohs were thought to be god-kings (Brooks, 2019). Egypt was a centralized unit, unlike Mesopotamia, which presented itself as several separate states.Furthermore, differences in religious outlooks arose from alternate views on why the gods created humans. Mesopotamians considered gods to be cruel and believed that humans were not to enjoy life and could risk offending the gods (Brooks,
This is why the afterlife was such an essential part of their beliefs – it was a process that evaluated their goodness throughout life.The religious and agricultural development inevitably led to the intellectual and cultural progress of the countries. The Middle Kingdom of Egypt is famous for its papyrus use, along with ink and cosmetics (Brooks, 2019). Mummification was an essential process related to their general religious beliefs. On the contrary, the warfare and trade typical for Mesopotamia explain their creation of the wheel and significant improvement of architecture and the sciences (Brooks, 2019). It can be suggested that religion played a major role in the groundbreaking inventions of Egypt (Kreis, 2006). Generally, the key differences between the regions arose from contrasting religious and political systems.
The term “confession” has several meanings, such as admitting one’s sins and being ready to repent. Augustine began working on the C onfessions when he was probably 43 years old (Teubner 1). There is no precise, clear motivation to write his own, but there may be at least two possible factors. First, his people were suspicious of his ideal standards, his career as a bright teacher of rhetoric, pagan-influenced education, his known reputation as an ex-Manichee (Teubner 57). By writing the confession, he would defend himself from this kind of criticism and demonstrate that his faith and beliefs were pure Christians. Another possible motivational possibility may have been brought up by his close friendship with Alypius, Christian converts such as Paulinus Nola, who renounced the world and his
immense family fortune after his conversion to Christianity.The C onfession comprises 13 Books; books 1 to 9 recount Augustine’s life and spiritual journey, while book 10 shows the temptations, he was still facing. Books 11 to 13 are the extensions of the first chapter of Genesis. The first ten books were about Agustine, while the last three were about the scripture. All the Confessions had many themes such as nature of evil, sin, time, sufferings, lust, truth, wisdom and knowledge, weakness, pride, internal peace. According to Augustine, God cannot be the cause of evil. For Augustine says, “evil does not exist”(Teubner 78). Evil lacks good, and evil exists as long as good is absent.Saint Augustine’s Confessions have a unified theme of inner peace. His reflections on it seem
to bring his deliberate state of spiritual and psychological calmness, despite the burdens and stressors in his journey. He believes that human beings cannot find inner peace without involving God; he believes human beings were made to seek peace in God. There is excellent echoing of the solid ethical foundation portrayed by ancient philosophers as Neoplatonic and the Pythagoras vis a vis beauty; these are Augustine’s favorite themes.Augustine was a student at Carthage, and he was troubled by troublers who interrupted his classes there, rendering him among the critical students who refused to pay their fees. In addition to that, he was financially inconvenienced (Teubner 157). Notwithstanding his disconcertment, he wishes and reassured that such students would be preferred to learn to money. He furthermore says, “You, O
God, the truth and fullness of our sure good, and our purest peace” (Augustine 126). Despite being stressed, Augustine remains psychologically calm, thus concluding that inner peace is achievable whatever the situation.At the time, Saint Augustine was describing the decision to resign his professorship after an upcoming vacation in the autumn holidays, with his chest problems giving him a further excuse to resign. He mentions to his students “who did not meditate on Your law or Your peace, but on foolish lies and legal battles” (Augustine 79). He continues by giving an extended analysis of the scripture in Psalms 4. Music was Augustine’s interest; he introduced the idea of singing psalms during the time of distress via the story of Ambrose’s Basilica. Shifting gears, love, according to Augustine,
is not limited to human beings alone. But Love expands to God’s love for human beings, the love that the inanimate beings have for their natural lives. When it comes to humans, their love is multidimensional; it grows from one stage to another: love at infancy; love at adolescence; love for interests and desires.From his infancy, Augustine indicates that he could not speak and yet he could sense bitterness and jealous in others. From the above statement, we can understand that Augustine never is fond of infants. Throughout infancy, infants would take everything selfishly for themselves only, constantly crying to be given attention and not to be ignored, to be loved only (Teubner 57). Infant’s love can only be described as love for hunger which demands to be
filled, or love for pleasure that requires to be filled with comfort. That is why Augustine claims that love is one of the origins of sin; even at birth, everyone is got sin in them.Next, the author analyzes the stages of love in adolescence. At this stage, humans start to experience different types of love. Here they will begin having desires to love, be loved, pleasures, love for earthly materials. Augustine says in his second book, “The single desire that dominated my search for delight was simply to love and be loved” (Augustine 144). He claims that humans’ thoughts of erotic desires of wanting to love or be loved could be the way that can lead to God or lead them astray from God.Augustine attends a theatre show
to understand human emotions and existence in another instance to feel the pleasure and love; desires of crying, weeping, laughing, and passion. It is clear that he wished to enjoy these desires and likes but realized gradually that as he enjoys giving into his desires, it led him astray from God’s path into alienation. Confessions has a central topic of sin, mercy, and fleeing. For the most of his life, Saint Augustine looked to be avoiding Christianity by engaging in practices and cults such as Manichaeism. Also, he is entombed in a sea of passion. He is avoiding confession because he does not believe he has what it takes to live a life consistent with the teachings of the Bible. Through the audience of sinners, this book had
an impact on the Middle East. This book teaches the reader exactly what sin and confession look like in real life.A topological understanding of how to confess and become a Christian is also imparted to the audience. In Augustine’s stories, the audience connects with them because they are relatable. Preachers who seek to reach out to the lost can find inspiration in this memoir. Inquiring minds who doubt their own misdeeds and God. This personal book shows those who have committed grave crimes that God is able to pardon them all. Many big crimes were committed by Saint Augustine, and he even challenges the Lord, “Why do you demand me to love you?” (Augustine 24). Augustine was saved by God’s grace despite his many transgressions.Augustine introduces freedom as
another set of theme that is evident in Confession. He says freedom is a man’s ability to freely have the presence of ‘evil will’ within the man’s soul. “They say this is the soul, enslaved, contaminated and corrupt…” (Augustine, 79). Free will is human desire that comes from the perfection of God’s steadfast love; this gives humans the ability to do anything freely. This proves that humans were made of God’s likeness and image.However, freedom is not to be mistakenly used as an excuse for breaking the rules and guidelines to do anything illegal from someone’s locale. There are consequences to be met; thus, we are not free to perform actions without them being checked into balance. Augustine says, “I directed my mind to understand what I was
being told, namely that the free choice of the will is the reason why we do wrong and suffer your just judgment” (Augustine 256). From his statement, we can note that freedom is the beginning of evil; as stated earlier that ‘evil will’ stay within humans’ souls. Therefore, it can be said that it is in humans’ nature that when they get any freedom, they will commit evil.Augustine was faced with other challenges that later affected his general growth, especially while at school. In Carthage, Augustine came across a quote in the book Hortensias by Cicero, which says, “It is the pursuit of truth through a philosophy that leads a person to a thoroughly happy life” (Augustine 122). This line of quote impacted Augustine’s life and affected his
growth. Still, in Carthage, he came across the Bible. Still, he had a negative attitude at first sight on the Bible since he thought the Bible was not as much comprehensive and philosophical as he wanted. But when his friend Alypius hinted about the monks that he had come across on his tour from Egypt, seeking the spiritual truth. Augustine felt humiliated and started seeking the truth about faith, and thus it led him to give up all the earthly things and started concentrating on the Godly ways.In the City of God, Augustine considers fall of Adam as both a secret and an open sin. Its secrecy is brought about by how Adam was perceived as being superior over Eve but was easily convinced to eating the fruit
There are always multiple obstacles that can significantly diminish the overall efficiency of any project plan. Therefore, it is crucial to analyze all the factors that may stay behind potential barriers to its successful implementation. Given the complexity of the project plan and the holistic approach expected to prevail in all stages of its fulfillment, there are numerous spheres that may be exposed to certain risks. Significant changes that affect the organizational structure of an institution always lead to various issues ranging from increased expenditures to employees’ diminished motivation and resistance to changes. A dedicated analysis is needed in order to find the most appropriate solutions to problems that may arise.One of the essential issues that should be addressed while implementing the plan is centered around the employees’
perception of the efficiency and urgent nature of the changes that the project plan implies. Therefore, it is of significant importance to provide all employees that may be affected with a substantial body of evidence proving the benefits to a hospital in general. It is crucial to underpin the strong correlation between a hospital’s performance and employees’ salaries.Given the importance of measures listed in the project plan, the only issue that might make employees anxious is their pay. Factors such as lack of cooperation among the medical team, lack of motivation in nurses, lack of a holistic approach, and lack of support organizations could be barriers to holistic care (Babaei & Taleghani, 2019). Therefore, employees that are most likely to be exposed to increased amounts of stress should
be comforted with the available data on the ultimately positive outcomes of the changes.The next barrier that can significantly undermine the way the desired changes are implemented is related to deadlines. Although the project plan contains estimates of the time that is necessary for each step, it is clear that numerous unforeseen factors may result in delays. Therefore, it is crucial to provide extra guidelines that will explain to employees all the details of combining old and new methods. Sipes (2020) claims that nursing education did not have informatics competencies; thus, current managers, administrators, or NEs may not be fully prepared to lead or use change in the use of health information technology. Therefore, encouraging employees to actively participate in the implementation of different stages of the plan
In general, numerous types of reasoning exist and find implementation, but not all of them bear special significance for decisions affecting patient care. Approaches to reasoning can be classified into types based on the inductive or deductive direction of inquiry, the use of analogy or abduction, the utilization of decomposition and evidence synthesis, and so on. In the healthcare field, reliance on credible evidence is what informs the professional community’s approach to clinical reasoning, given that mere suggestions and excessive experimentation and creativity involve extra risks for healthcare consumers. Particularly, the so-called frequency-based reasoning dominates the field, especially when it comes to guideline development, and it requires practitioners to rely on statistics in making clinical decisions (Wieringa et al., 2018). This way of thinking has diverse benefits, including
One of the pillars of efficient and meaningful clinical practice is ensuring that every professional is engaged in continuous education and growth. The implementation of evidence-based practice is a direct way to provide such an opportunity to nurses, allowing them to use relevant research to implement better, modernized, and patient-oriented interventions. According to Koota et al. (2021), “the EBP educational intervention implemented in this study had a positive effect on emergency nurses’ EBP attitudes, knowledge, self-efficacy, skills, and behavior” (p. 23). Hence, the introduction of EBP, by all means, is a positive change for the clinical setting.However, it has been established in terms of the practicum that the implementation of EBP is currently limited in eh Memorial Regional Hospital in Hollywood, Florida. The issue is mostly related to
less effective interventions.The two major implications of this issue for nursing include the inability to access quality education and increased chances of emotional and physical burnout. Indeed, when nurses have no access to relevant scholarly research, they are less likely to secure positive patient outcomes and acquire knowledge. With the inability to implement more time-efficient and innovative practices, nurses are also at risk of struggling with a heavy workload. Moreover, according to Sultana et al. (2020), EBP can present evidence-based approaches to reduce burnout rates among nurses. For this reason, this issue needs more attention in clinical settings nationwide.
Emily Dickinson’s 1865 poem A narrow Fellow in the Grass conforms to the fear of deceit. The imagery is used to introduce fear or anxiety through a snake. It starts with a skinny man that travels through the Grass. The author takes the readers into the poetic lifeline of exploration of fearing the unknown. Whenever an individual fears the unknown, they are prone to fall victim to deception. The encounter with a snake describes the orientation of deception because they are unpredictable. In the poem, the snake appears and disappears without rooting any warning. The author uses this nature of environmental changes to bring the nature of anxiety and fear. The poem analytically revolves around the realism of fear versus the idealism of deceit, which symbolizes nature and
humanity.The author personifies the snake by calling it a fellow , which gives the snake a weird humanistic quality. When it is called a fellow, it means that the snake has thoughts that can materialize into intentions (line 1). The sense of menace seems archetypical. It sums up the presumed encounter that the author supports the idea that there is a bigger problem than the basic analogy of snakes being scary. The symbolic nature of the serpent is fear and deceit, which many people can use in their contexts. Ancient snake symbolism, such as in the Garden of Eden, is trickery or deceiver.The speaker uses flashbacks to relate to his childhood encounter with the snake. According to the speaker, he was fooled into touching a snake (line 12).
The snake’s power to disguise itself frightens everyone into conforming to its deceits. For instance, the author flashbacks into his childhood memory when he believed the snake was a Whip Lash , He bent to pick, but the snake wrinkled and disappeared (line 13). The aspect of fear comes when the snake does not bite the speaker, but it disguises and vanishes. Fear puts uneasy anticipation that makes an individual unsure about what is about to happen.The poem revolves around welcoming and violent, friendly and menacing, strange and familiar. The speaker’s reaction toward the snake shows that it is a normal reaction in the natural world. Humans are part of the world as animals, and the poem’s subject conforms to the reality of life and death. For instance,
used juxtaposes the snake’s treacherous image, showing harmony within the Garden of Eden. There is a friendly stance with the snake, and the menace relationship showed by the fact that a snake has bodily power over the author. The idealism of animal relationship with the realism of nature insinuates that humans can separate from the animal world, but they are not immune to the perils of ecology.
Reading Emily Dickinson’s poems is one of the most captivating and challenging tasks for many students. On the one hand, she raises a variety of interesting themes that fulfill human life and motivate in her short poems. On the other hand, the combination of oddness and restraint confuses. There are twelve lines in her “I Died for Beauty,” but each sentence delivers a message about the poet’s interests and literary contributions. Inevitability, life-long goals, and conflict are the three themes in Dickinson’s poem that are properly conveyed through the imagery of truth and beauty.Death is the only thing that remains inevitable in human life despite multiple intentions to avoid or postpone it by a variety of means. Dickinson introduces two speakers who died because of different reasons but
similarly “adjusted in the tomb… in an adjoining room” (lines 2, 4). The poet uses such a terrible but expected end when a person leaves this world to underline humans’ equality before nature and the fact that death ends most people’s capacities to speak, wish, or act (Dahami 256). There is no need to consider achievement, knowledge, or wealth because the outcome, an empty grave, is the same for everyone.Another significant aspect of the poem is the identification of life-long goals and possibilities. According to Dickinson, people may die with two thoughts in mind, either for beauty or truth (lines 6-7). These two concepts are so different and similar at the same time, proving her constant struggle for spiritual victory (Sharma 103). The conversation between the supporters of
truth and beauty is not a debate but a contribution to Dickinson’s maturity in understanding the essence of life and the correctness of death. These two metaphors divide society into two groups who may strive for something realistic and cherished, like beauty, or search for something incomprehensible but vital, like truth. The poem shows that people are free to set and choose different goals during their lives, focusing on their interests and wants.Finally, in her simple and unobtrusive dialogue, Dickinson seems to be bothered with the conditions that cause conflict in interpersonal relationships. There is no need to have a real opponent to be in conflict. However, the controversy between the existing forms and substance is evident in her poem (Sharma 103). Human life needs conflicts to be
With exponential growth in smart device users, there is an increase in the volume of data generated from various smart devices, which differs according to all the fundamental V’s used to classify it as big data. In general, most service providers, such as Microsoft, Amazon, and Yahoo, have established a significant number of geographically scattered data centers to process the massive quantity of data generated by various smart devices to give consumers speedy response times. These service providers commonly employ Hadoop and SPARK for processing massive datasets for this reason (Chaudhary et al., 2018). However, there has been less attention placed on the underlying infrastructure, which is one of the most crucial aspects for the effective completion of any specified solution in this context.I believe that cloud technology
Technology can be utilized in diverse ways to facilitate collaboration, co-teaching, and recordkeeping between special and general education teachers. Such tools as audiobooks, the alternative mouse, and speech-to-text features can be implemented to provide a better understanding of the given material by students with disabilities. For example, children with bad eyesight or retina stratification, who may be considered disabled, should be provided with audiobooks or transcripts of the lecture instead of making notes. This feature could be supported in recordkeeping through the creation of informative versions of apps for people with bad eyesight. Additionally, collaboration and co-teaching require a profound examination of students’ cases; therefore, the personalization of tasks and the division into working groups based on certain criteria can be implemented.Moreover, co-teaching and collaboration require sharing of
The Coca-Cola Company is a transnational worldwide-known corporation founded in the United States. This company produces and distributes various beverage drinks worldwide; it has been estimated that the mentioned corporation sold its products in more than 200 countries. The Coca-Cola Company uses an image of the ‘one and only’ original beverage drinks manufacturer; the corporation’s positioning is focused on the jovial inspiration of the customer (Brennan, Crawford, and Khamis, 2020). It can be assumed that nowadays, Coca-Cola can be considered as a part of popular culture. Moreover, the company takes an active part in the process of globalisation. In addition, The Cola-Cola Company has a long history of successful advertising Christmas campaigns.Description and the Analysis of the AdvertisementThe given advertisement (see Exhibit A) is a Coca-Cola video ad
dedicated to the Christmas of 2021. This advertising video demonstrates the story of a boy who is deeply touched by his senior neighbour’s loneliness during Christmas Eve. While watching a cartoon about Santa Claus, a boy decides to create a personal miracle for his neighbour. The following part of the plot depicts the collective efforts of the house residents to build an improvised chimney, through which a gift will be delivered. Finally, at the end of the advertisement, the classic bottle of Coca-Cola is being introduced to a viewer by native integration into a video. Undoubtedly, the main idea that this ad attempts to deliver is the importance of a strong community and of family or friendly bonds. The main objective of this advertisement is to promote the
brand’s values, sustain the corporate image of The Coca- Company, and advertise the drink’s integrity in modern life.The Ad’s Stopping PowerOne of the main aims of the given ad is to make an average customer think that this particular product is unique, original, and irreplaceable. The Coca-Cola Company is a major corporation with a big name and credible reputation, and their main product is one of the most recognisable beverage drinks in the world. Due to that fact, the main task of the Coca-Cola advertising campaign is to sustain its reputation as one of the most popular brands in the soda industry (Guo and Wen, 2021). Since the brand occupies a top position in that particular part of the market, the main threat that may negatively impact the
company’s profits is the risk of various substitutions; for example, the corporation’s main opponent – PepsiCo and its products (Guo and Wen, 2021). What may seem like a simple reminder of a company’s existence, in reality, plays a crucial competitive role. Therefore, one of the inherent parts of Coca-Cola’s advertising and the message that is present in the reviewed ad is the idea that Coca-Cola is an original beverage drink that cannot be replaced.Another crucial aspect of this ad is its central message that goes in the subtext of the given plot – an idea that Coca-Cola is an integral part of the Christmas celebration. The conditions of modern era advertising force the companies to justify an average customer’s need to buy a particular product (Polesana, 2019). It
can be noted that this brand’s advertising campaigns have been focused on this event for a continuous period. The company implied Christmas advertising for more than 100 years (Jones, 2019). As a result, a bottle of Coca-Cola has become a natural Christmas attribute, at least in Western countries (Ireland and Ashton, 2017). Moreover, the style of storytelling and the presentation of the product itself implies that the customer is already familiar with the advertised product. Thus, one of the advertisement’s goals is to remind a consumer that Coca-Cola plays a key role in creating the Christmas atmosphere.In addition, the entertaining aspect of the ad must be considered as well. Although the plot of the video has been discussed, its effect has yet to be determined. It is important
to understand that the reason why the advertisement introduces the product itself only at the end of the video is to keep the viewer intrigued (Sharma and Bumb, 2020). Since the viewer cannot predict what product is being advertised, he or she will most likely continue watching the video until the very end (Sharma and Bumb, 2020). The slice of life, in combination with a small fantasy, appears to be quite appealing to an average consumer, who seeks to tighten the family and community bonds during the Christmas holidays. Therefore, a minimal product placement in the ad, coupled with a somewhat complex and relatable plot, attract the consumer’s attention.Although the ad does obtain a unique selling product, it may be noted that it successfully bonds the product with
the customer’s joy and happiness. Undoubtedly, not every company has a need to use a particular USP in order to successfully advertise a product; such is the case of Coca-Cola (Presman, 2017). Instead of focusing on a particular benefit that a customer may obtain, the ad promotes the well-established idea that a company is a manufacturer and distributor of pure happiness (Presman, 2017). As a result, this ad holds on to the main marketing strategy of a company and continues to mark the extent of joy that this particular product may bring into a customer’s life.Finally, the specificities of the ad’s visual part are focused on giving a viewer nostalgic and heartwarming feelings rather than exciting and impressing them. Due to a brand’s continuous history, one of Coca-Cola’s
goals is to remind some consumers about the taste of their youth (Aytekin and Ayaz, 2018). Since the image of the brand forms various customer’s expectations, the fulfilment of these expectations directly affects the company’s profit levels (Anisimova, Weiss and Mavondo, 2021). In addition, The Coca-Cola company sustains a trusting relationship (as an additional factor of retention) with its customers (Mahmoud, 2018). Thus, while promoting a drink as a part of the tradition, the company attempts to proclaim that the customer always gets what he expects, that Coca-Cola is a part of his family.The red colour, which is unmistakably associated with Coca-Cola, is used to depict the product as a tasteful and desired drink (Mochama, 2020). In addition, in the case of this particular advertisement, the red colour
is associated with Christmas, which may be a part of the aspect discussed earlier (Mochama, 2020). It can be stated that the visual part of this ad prevails over the textual elements; the viewer’s attention is captivated by a wordless touching story. Overall, this ad may be characterised as highly persuasive; moreover, it avoids annoying the consumer by using a minimal amount of Coca-Cola’s brand logos.On the other hand, the ad has a minor weak side; although being reviewed separately, this video can be assessed as a high-quality one, the repetitiveness of the foremost thought may be considered annoying. If to consider The Coca-Cola company’s long history of Christmas advertising, it can be noted that the main delivered idea is being constantly repeated. Even though the video has
no aim to excite or surprise the viewer, the repeated narrative may appear irritating for some of them.The Ad’s Call To ActionThe ad attempts to sustain the popularity of various concepts among the customers; due to these concepts, which will be discussed below, the company focuses its advertising on a middle-class customer with a family. One of the corporation’s focus points is the family bonds and family itself (Yadav, 2019). Considering the fact that in its advertising campaigns, Coca-Cola considers the family as a whole, a middle-class male or female; for example, the family’s father is the one who is willing to spend money on the given product. Due to the strong interlink between various family holidays and the brand, it is an older member of the family
who will provide them with the drink.At the same time, the intending meaning of an ad is global unity, the sense of community, and the importance of being together during the holidays. The long-established celebrations, such as Christmas, usually imply family reunions; thereby, the Coca-Cola ad tries to promote the idea that the company’s beverage drinks are part of this household spirit. In other words, Coke is what unites people and brings them together, at the same time comforting them and making their ties even more substantial.Judging by the company’s popularity scale, reputation, and market image, it is possible to assume that the advertisement is intended to raise brand awareness instead of promoting a product. Undoubtedly, Coca-Cola is a part of popular and the product itself no longer
requires advertising and promotion. However, the corporate image is what retains a company’s target customers and increases the company’s profit (Alkitbi et al., 2021). Thus, a company needs to conduct constant advertising campaigns in order to sustain a customer’s brand awareness. In the case of Coca-Cola, most of the corporations advertising attempts are focused on the consumers’ level of awareness and on sustaining the corporate image (excluding the cases when a company presents a new product).Although the necessary means to convince a viewer may be characterised as the most fitting, and the message itself may seem reasonable, some individuals, including me, are likely to question the ad’s idea. If to consider various ethnicities and cultural traditions’ facts of existence, it seems doubtful that the drink is a part
of every family’s tradition. Moreover, for some individuals, the advertised idea may seem too bold and aggressive since not everyone likes the presence of major corporations in his or her private life. On the other hand, the company’s principle of bringing joy and happiness into its customers’ life is the key point of advertising; thus, this aspect of the ad seems quite convincing.The Ad’s Value propositionThe ad’s value proposition may be characterised as social; the main benefits the company promises to deliver are strong family bonds and happiness. Although the ad does not promote the idea that Coca-Cola will undoubtedly make a customer happy, the message is focused on “being happy together with Coca-Cola” (Susanthi and Pramita, 2019, p.5). The implicit value of happiness fits the holiday atmosphere
happiness. A continuous history of the brand allows its advertising specialists to position Coca-Cola as a part of the traditions set. This strategy allows retaining the existing adult and senior customers. In addition, the advertisement’s focus on the family as a whole makes it possible to promote the product to adolescents as well. The mostly textless and speechless advertisement focuses its attention on the tradition and unity, but not on the product itself, only slightly introducing it at the end of the video. This approach allows the ad to avoid annoying the viewers and to entertain them with a touching plot.
Social behavior is a complex of behavioral patterns typical for most of society at a particular time. There are several types of them, but they all are characterized by a lack of specific structure, even in the case of deliberately organized movements. It is due to many different influences between all social movement’s members. If they are not directed by some external or internal motivational force, such as political will or money, which organizes them, they are easy to dissolve eventually. The spread of the Internet and social media leads to massive changes in social movements’ creation, organization, and dissolving, allowing much quicker information exchange.Social movements are various, and social media influence them all directly. Uncontrolled movements are initiated by some changes in the world, which are influential
to quick spreading.Thus, one can see that social media made social movements much easier to create and much easier to dissolve. They facilitate information exchange, and therefore, all events may become known to many people rapidly via social media posts, online news, and blogs. The consequence is that the social movement, created in response to a stimulus, such as rumors about a large company, will be formed instantly, and its consequences will reveal very quickly, too.
The tremendously harmful effect that colonialism has caused indigenous people that have suffered oppression and the invasion of White colonists cannot possibly be embraced. In Chinua Achebe’s “Things Fall Apart,” the decomposition of the local community as a direct effect of the colonialist power is demonstrated uninhibitedly and powerfully. By imposing their beliefs, values, perceptions, and other elements of the white culture onto local residents, colonists have nearly annihilated the Ibo culture, causing its members to suffer significant cultural trauma.In fact, the nature of the colonialists’ influence on the Ibo people and their culture is pinpointed in the very title of the book. By creating a mental image of the entire environment falling apart and eventually collapsing, the writer demonstrates the destructive nature of the colonialist power. Specifically,
In the modern world, diverse communities exist that support families in situations of emergency or need. Such support should be granted as sometimes families cannot manage their problems alone. Many communities provide families with support in diverse areas such as foster care, early childhood care, education, and homeless services (Fuss et al., 2021). For example, during the pandemics of COVID-19 many families experienced financial problems due to the ubiquitous job loss. Many such families could not cover their medical costs or even afford to buy normal food. Several organizations help families by caring about their young children or teenagers, providing them with psychological and economic help (Liebenberg et al., 2020). In such situations, to heighten or support the living standard and living conditions, communities can help families by
There are extremely few films that explore not only female friendships but also delve into the interpersonal connection of women, seeking to escape the restrictions of gender, class, time, and place. In turn, Scott’s road movie reveals the female nature from the inside. Thelma, married at 18 and tolerating her tyrannical husband, is not as downtrodden and tame as many would like to see. Thelma does not agree to condone, so she packs her things, throws suitcases into her friend’s car, leaves a note for her husband, and goes off with Louise for the whole weekend. If Thelma is an amateur adventurer, then Louise is a serious rebel. Her boyfriend Jimmy has no power over her, but rather she dictates the rules to him, although she is forced
to endure his constant adventures while she works as a waitress. Louise does not hesitate to shoot the man who tried to rape her girlfriend.Seeing the world through the eyes of liberated women driving merrily into the unknown was an innovation that boldly granted a woman the right to be human. Cooper notes that this is a movie about women who defy eternity and openly neglect social conditions. It has a philosophical background in the immortality of the soul and the lofty value of freedom, which despises even death. The film’s finale proves that suicide is preferable to prison, just as lethal injection is better than life imprisonment.It is a pity that they do not make strong films about women’s struggles in Hollywood anymore; that is why it
remains to revise Thelma and Louise from year to year. The current films about women ending with a wedding, and receiving a ring from a man are equated to the moment of personal transformation and self-identification of a woman who is looking for only worldly peace in life. These stereotypical films are forgotten and will never become a symbol of the female spirit, which Thelma and Louise became precisely because it reflects the true woman’s need for freedom.Smith, in her speech, focuses on gender inequality in cinema. As confirmation, the speaker presents depressing statistics. First, according to Smith, less than a third of all speaking characters are women (2:39). The most unexpected thing is that the situation has not changed for 70 years. As my example, I can
cite the world-famous film The Lord of the Rings, where all ten central roles are male. Thus, the woman is still noticeably absent from the screen.Second, Smith asserts that in addition to gender inequality, Hollywood films are characterized by racial and ethnic discrimination. It is noteworthy that it is possible to expect changes in this direction. In 2020, the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences announced the introduction of special rules that should eliminate inequalities within the organization itself and the film industry. Rottenberg affirms that starting in 2024, films that qualify for the Best Film award must meet at least two of the four criteria. Among them is the presence of actors from an ethnic or racial minority, 30% of the composition of a woman, representatives
of the LGBTQ+ community, a racial or ethnic minority, and people with disabilities. Moreover, there must be the same diversity in the production and marketing teams that work on the film, and the film must represent one of the listed minorities. Nevertheless, women remain in the minority since the requirement is 30%, but women are about half of society.Third, Smith notes that only 4.1% of directors are women (6:00). Moreover, only three of the 886 directors are African American or black, and only one woman is Asian (Smith 6:13). At the same time, there is a pattern between the gender of the director and the peculiarity of the roles in this movie. Thus, the more women participate in creating a movie, the more women appear on the screen,
a narrative device to illustrate the sexism inherent in the male gaze. Three narrative devices are explicated that structure the mockery in the film: stereotypes about depraved and testosterone-obsessed men; portray men as a spectacle for female attention; and the celebration of women’s friendships. The result of the tongue-in-cheek techniques is a strong female gaze that resists and defies patriarchy and opens the film’s text to a feminist reading. As for the TED talk by Stacy Smith, indeed, the situation regarding the role of women in the film industry is disastrous. Thus, nowadays, most films are shot by men and many films still represent the male gaze.
The barriers that firms may face on their way to internal logistical integration are possible to group into five categories by their origin and nature. The first derives from an insufficiently coherent structure of a business that results in poor communication among its departments. According to Bowersox (2019), this is the consequence of the “traditional practice” of uniting the employees who are responsible for certain activities into clusters to enable excellent performance though functional perfection (p. 332). In practice, meanwhile, such an approach can result in an insufficiently effective corporate culture, in other words, a lack of unity, morale, and dedication, frequently from top management as well (Naseem et al., 2021). My professional experience illustrates this; I have worked for a firm where the boss showed little to
no interest in organizational routine. Furthermore, some of my coworkers from different departments considered their function the most important, offending each other.The traditional systems of management and reward, which actually result from the above functional structure, also can be an obstacle to internal integration. Notably, they “mirror” that structure, focusing on employees’ achievements in the area of their activity rather than their involvement in corporate culture and contribution to the performance of the entire company (Bowersox, 2019, p. 332). In fact, this begins ever before employment; many educational institutions stick to the classical assessment system that uses grades as the only measurement. Consequently, school leavers as well as graduates, including myself, have to acquire knowledge about other reward systems intentionally, and it remains theoretical in most cases.Considering the
above, information flows in companies of traditional structure normally lack integrity as well. Specifically, the data such businesses operate should be possible to organize by functionality and accountability, which automatically limits their scope and area of use (Bowersox, 2019). This can result not only in poor integration of departments, but also in insufficient communication with customers and inappropriate quality of service; therefore, Naseem et al. (2021) prefer to label this category coordination barriers. In fact, the company I mention in the first paragraph also can serve as an example in the given case. The lack of unity, notably, led to that of awareness and dedication; consequently, few employees were able to provide high quality services.It is worth noting that such obstructed circulation of data interferes with knowledge exchange,
IntroductionComparative politics is a scientific concept that is widely applied in the study of political science. This concept and ideology are used to study different political units of countries, pointing out how different they run their political affairs while at the same time noting differences. According to Caramani (2020), comparative politics rely on comparative methods that benchmark one country’s political system to another to understand the failure or success of various countries’ political systems. There are several mythological approaches to studying political science, including statistical, case study, and experimental methods (Chilcote 2018). In simpler terms, comparative politics applies comparative approaches in examining two or more countries to assess various political functions. The two countries chosen for this research paper are Canada and the United States. Therefore, the concept
of comparative politics will be applied to the two selected counties’ political unit systems to point out both similarities and differences.Canadian and American GovernmentCountries and states have specific rules and statutes that have different contents. This implies that the laws apply differently in states or countries. Therefore, Canada and Unites States are different countries; the two have political systems and units that differ in operation and how the vital process occurs. According to John Wesley Dafoe (2022), the political systems of the United States and Canada exhibit some similarities and differences. Despite the numerous changes that have occurred in both countries’ systems, they are still a replica of one another with slight variations. John Wesley Dafoe (2022) educates that the Canadian Dominion and the American Commonwealth explain the
two countries’ political system development. However, John Wesley Dafoe (2022) noticed that Canada has stayed under the umbrella of Great Britain and therefore is practicing parent-state laws.On the other hand, the United States is a sovereign state and drives its principles from the European constitution (Floridi 2020, p. 371). Therefore, from the country’s profiles, it is clear that the two have different government operations with some similarities.Canada and the American government have similarities and differences worth discussing in this paper. Floridi (2020, p. 372) reports that the two countries’ governments have central authority with many supporting local administrations literary, known as states in the United states and provinces in Canada. In both countries, the central government or authority has enormous power and is entitled to national issues, including
the local administration’s security and integrity (Palsson et al. 2020, p. 1269). Other studies, however, report that Canada is not yet an independent state and thus depends on the imperial power of England (Gilmore, Kousky and St.Clair 2022, p. 216).This means that the laws governing Canada are from England’s laws. From this claim, Canada, therefore, has no power or voice to proclaim war or do its affairs independently without involving the great power of England (Gilmore, Kousky and St.Clair 2022, p. 218). As such, it can be noted that the great power of England is the parent rock of the Canadian constitution.The two countries’ governments also differ remarkably when the power assumed by the respective central governments is compared. According to Dauvergne (2018, p. 579), the Dominion government’s
powers include all that federal laws grant. On the other hand, the opposite is true because the central government seems to have equal powers with the federal government. Coming to the judicial systems of the two countries, it is crucial to report that there are also some similarities and differences in how court proceedings are carried out in each country. The judicial systems are similar in that the Canadian system consists of many federal courts at the province level, equivalent to the United States federal courts in different states (Dauvergne 2018, p. 581). However, Canada is reported to have one federal court compared to the United Supreme Court because these two courts presume enormous power. One noticeable difference in the judicial system of the two countries is that
there is no federal court in each province as there are courts in each state.Political PartiesDemocracy in any country is nurtured when citizens can express their voices and interests by choosing the leaders they want. A group of federal representatives defines the United States democratic system voted for by the United States citizens. The modern politics witnessed in the United States is a result of two major parties, the Democrats and the Republicans, which have been the dominating parties since the dawn of Unites States politics (Dippel 2022, p. 33).Ethnicity, race, originality, religion, and money are the major factors that impact United States political party system. In their research, Hess and Renner (2019, p. 420) found that the United States Federal government consists of three legislative, executive, and
judicial branches. About democracy the United States practices representative democracy, where leaders are elected to represent other citizens in the national senate, congress, and local governments (Hess & Renner 2019, p. 423). Although there are some minority parties in the United States political system, the state could be referred to as a two-party political system because the country only has two dominant parties with high odds of winning an election.Canada exhibits a different political system from that of the United States. According to Tanguay (2021, p. 741), the Canadian political system is based on the context of parliamentary egalitarianism. Canada is a constitutional country, unlike the United States, and thus enjoys a multiparty system of state and legislative practices. Even though Tanguay (2021, p. 742) identifies the Liberty
Party of Canada and the Conservative Party of Canada as the major parties, other research has also pointed out minority parties in Canada. These include New Democratic Party, Green Party, and the Quebec nationalist Bloc (Tanguay 2021, p. 742). Just like the other two dominating parties in Canada, these minority parties have found relevance in Canada which brings a different picture when compared to other parties in the united stated, a part from the discussed major parties.Political CultureCulturally, the two countries under investigation show different political orientations from one another. The critical literature search found that Canada has adopted an egalitarian type of leader for decades (Budd 2019, p. 138). This leadership model benefits citizens greatly because it supports social amenities and steers economic freedom and multiculturalism. Thus,
Canada emphasizes social equality, which entails individual rights and inclusivity (Budd 2019, p. 143). The Canadian political system is democratic, resulting in universal healthcare, gun control, and social and foreign aid programs. On the other hand, American political culture could be well explained based on Elazar’s theory. Elazar’s theory holds that American political culture is divided into distinct cultures, including moralistic, individualist, and traditionalistic (López 2022, p. 100367). Elazar’s theory portrays American political culture as moralistic in that the government is seen as a means that caters to society by ensuring citizens’ welfare (López 2022, p. 100367). Moralistic political culture enhances transparency and honesty, which are the key pillars of democracy.Elazar’s theory also states that the United States system could also be experiencing an individualist political culture. This
culture is the type in which the government is portrayed as a tool that solves and addresses citizens’ issues. The government must provide vulnerable citizens with healthcare services and feeding programs in an individualist culture. According to Elazar et al. (2022), the individualist political culture is practised in states such as New Jersey, New York, and Pennsylvania (Elazar et al. 2022). Finally, some states in America also exhibit a traditionalist type of political culture that enhances prejudice against other ethnic groups while perpetrating white dominance (Elazar et al. 2022).This is true because, in the recent past, the United States has witnessed mass demonstrations criticizing how black police officers treat Americans (Updegrove et al. 2018, p. 3). A good example is the demonstrations about black lives matter. This was
a result of the death of George Floyd, who died after police brutality and excessive use of force (Updegrove et al. 2018, p. 6). As such, the traditionalist political culture tends to uphold white supremacy while discriminating against black AmericansElection Laws and ProcessComparing election laws and electoral processes between the two countries is another crucial area to cover as comparative politics is concerned. According to Howard, Woolley and Calo (2018, p. 81), Canada and the United States present diverse differences in election laws and how the process is conducted. One similarity that can be pointed out is that independent bodies conduct elections in both countries (Howard, Woolley and Calo 2018, p. 82). Another similarity in the election process is that the winning presidential candidates usually form the major
borders. From this research paper, it has been noted that comparing political systems worldwide is important. This is because it allows one country to learn each other political systems to improve what they are not doing well to boost or nurture a democratic system. Comparative politics can be done through various statistical and empirical analyses. In this paper, comparative politics has been applied to Canadian and United States political systems and has pointed out the similarities and differences that exist as the political system units are concerned. The systems that have been compared are the government functionalities, political parties, political cultures, and election laws and electoral processes.
Achieving core and specialty competencies is of significance for DNP learners since it ensures that they gain knowledge and skills that are essential for their future professional activity. That is why it is reasonable to involve in evaluating whether the scientific activity and practice immersion hours contribute to reaching this result. Thus, the given paper will comment on how I have achieved five course outcomes and present my self-reflection regarding the work made.Nursing and science-based theories play a significant role in my professional area. That is why I invested many efforts to ensure that I used and integrated them during my coursework. For example, these approaches helped me identify that creating interdisciplinary research and practice themes is a valuable activity. The rationale behind this claim refers to the
fact that multiple course assignments revealed the significance of collaboration. In particular, I found that there should be a direct connection between researchers and decision-makers because scholarly evidence should guide healthcare delivery models to address many issues, and pressure injuries are among them.Furthermore, working with my DPI project demonstrates that theories are of significance when it comes to addressing specific health problems. That is why the theory of planned behavior is considered a practical approach to minimize the prevalence of pressure injuries in the health care industry. On the one hand, scientific evidence offers some arguments in favor of the given idea. On the other hand, practice immersion hours demonstrated that the theory of planned behavior is an effective tool. The rationale behind this claim relates to the
fact that patients’ health tends to improve when they are told what and when to do. That is why the given theory is an adequate theoretical base to combat pressure injuries.It is also worth admitting that the employment of science-based theories and concepts was an effective approach to enhance health care delivery. In particular, it relates to the fact that numerous factors, including injuries, infections, and others, can affect patient safety. That is why it was found that beneficial outcomes can be obtained from using “a customized set of Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality (AHRQ) patient fall reduction guidelines” (William, 2020, p. 210). This information reveals that the literature review activities have led to implementing new practice approaches that have the potential to follow high healthcare delivery
standards.Simultaneously, achieving the course competencies has provided me with solid theoretical information on my DPI Project. It relates to the fact that I enriched my knowledge of epidemiology, research practice, and statistical methods regarding pressure injuries. I have managed to absorb this information by investing in literature review activities. The rationale behind this strategy refers to the fact that scholarly sources can provide all the required information concerning a specific health issue and its place in the medical industry.Finally, it is reasonable to comment on how I will apply the information above to my DPI Project. On the one hand, I will use the theory of planned behavior as a basis of the practice improvement interventions. This approach is considered adequate because credible data have revealed that patients
need specific recommendations and directions that will guide their behavior and help them achieve better health outcomes. On the other hand, the course activities have helped me understand that the application of science-based theories is possible if it is supported by sufficient evidence. That is why I will do my best to enrich the DPI Project with credible, relevant, and timely literature findings.Since DNPs should do their best to promote the principles of business, finance, and economics, I also invested in this sphere. I developed a budget for my DPI Project and provided the rationale for it. It refers to course DNP-840 that included comments on direct and indirect, fixed and variable, as well as other costs to reduce the prevalence of pressure injuries among older people in
a medical unit. That activity resulted in the fact that I now understand that a DNP should invest sufficient time and effort in ensuring that medical interventions should stay within stipulated budgets (Nolin, 2017). This competency will inevitably bring a few advantages to my professional practice.Furthermore, the course assignments helped me develop and improve my leadership, influence, and advocacy skills in implementing healthcare policies. In particular, it relates to a case study analysis that I performed. The assignment focuses on breast cancer since it is a widespread condition affecting multiple patients. I identified that this health problem implies ethical and cultural implications of care because a specific population, older women, are more subject to the condition. That is why the course assignments allowed me to make sure that
early screening is an essential approach to minimize the prevalence of breast cancer.In the healthcare industry, one should draw sufficient attention to employing consultative and leadership skills. I invested in developing this competency during my practice immersion hours. It refers to the fact that I worked in collaboration with professionals from dietary, respiratory, and physician groups. In that case, it was required to rely on effective leadership practices to promote the work of such professionally diverse groups. That is why I applied concepts of a few leadership styles, including servant, transformation, and authoritative ones, to motivate and guide these professionals. There is no doubt that effective leadership is of significance when it comes to teamwork in the healthcare sphere.In addition to that, course 815 was productive because it
revealed that my professional practice should aim at meeting health policy standards. This claim relates to the fact that policy governs all life spheres, and the healthcare industry is not an exception. That is why I learned how to find political standards and contribute to their implementation. Furthermore, the course activities allowed me to identify that a few ethical issues related to hospital-acquired pressure ulcers. Thus, I comprehended that my task would be to ensure that patients would not suffer from these problems.This paragraph will explain how I will use the competencies of this outcome in my DPI Project. Firstly, the principles of finance, business, and economics are essential for the Project because it is necessary to understand whether the proposed interventions will be reasonable from a financial
point of view. An attentively developed budget can demonstrate whether it is rational to implement a particular intervention. Secondly, leadership-related competencies are also essential since the DPI Project implies cooperation with many patients, healthcare professionals, and authorities. That is why developed leadership skills will help me motivate and organize individuals to ensure that they approve the Project and actively participate in it.The work with practice information systems and databases is of significance for DNP nurses. That is why I invested sufficient effort to gain the given competency. It refers to the fact that I completed the assignment from course DNP-815 about the conceptual-theoretical-empirical (CTE) structure. The phenomenon under consideration offers theoretical background for developing a middle-range theory (Garvey et al., 2019). The assignment focused on a theory of
nursing in hypertension care. That activity allowed me to understand that the structure could be considered a practical approach to evaluate a middle-range approach and identify its strengths and weaknesses. The literature review played an essential role in my gaining this competency because scholarly evidence was necessary to locate the theory and apply the CTE structure to its analysis.Furthermore, I dealt with the evaluation of consumer health information sources. I drew specific attention to ensure that they meet the requirements regarding timeliness, accuracy, and appropriateness. This competency was achieved since I relied on financial data and various technical tools to calculate the costs of healthcare and proposed interventions. In this case, the literature review also contributed to essential advantages. It refers to the fact that reliable and timely
studies can be a valuable source of information to find and evaluate the required data. Furthermore, analyzing the scientific evidence helped me improve my knowledge of healthcare-related practices and tools.Simultaneously, I reviewed and evaluated Internet-based cognitive-behavioral therapy (iCBT). This approach was practical since it helped select and use health information systems and patient care technology. In particular, this competency refers to an assignment on technology interface evaluation. That activity allowed me to become familiar with such concepts as usability, functionality, and user experience. I identified that all information systems should meet multiple requirements to ensure that both patients and healthcare professionals can benefit from them.In addition to that, DNP-835 was productive for me since I completed a case report for the application of quality and safety concepts. It
refers to the fact that I identified that a few measures could directly influence patient safety. According to Ismail (2017), they are “state policy, diagnosis, medications, surgical operations, infections, and injuries” (p. 592). It denotes that any of these spheres can create barriers and threats to the concept of patient safety within a healthcare setting. Simultaneously, it indicates that it is possible to affect any of the areas to provide patients with safer and more qualitative care.Finally, it is rational to state what information will be used in my DPI Project. Firstly, the information regarding a middle-range theory and its advantages and disadvantages can be of significance to guide my intervention. Secondly, I will use the skills in calculating the budgets of healthcare and proposed interventions to ensure
that my Project will not be a significant financial burden for an organization. Thirdly, I will do my best to make the intervention meet the usability, functionality, and user experience requirements. Fourthly, an insight into the patient safety areas above will lead to the fact that my intervention will provide individuals with adequate care, at least within one of these spheres.The first segment of this outcome relates to analyzing epidemiological, biostatistical, environmental, and other appropriate scientific data regarding multiple case issues. The epidemiology paper from DNP-825 has helped me meet this objective. It occurred because the case with breast cancer was used to identify the concepts above. Thus, the Center for Disease Control and Prevention (2020) demonstrates that “early menstrual periods before age 12 and starting menopause after
age 55 expose women to hormones longer” (para. 5). This finding explains what factors and why they contribute to the fact that breast cancer is considered a widespread disease among women worldwide.It is worth admitting that the literature review activity played an essential role in mastering this outcome. The rationale behind this claim refers to the fact that working with scientific data is a productive strategy to find the required information. The same epidemiology paper involved working with multiple scientific and governmental sources to identify epidemiological, biostatistical, environmental, and other data. I drew sufficient attention to ensure that I worked with credible and reliable articles and studies. That activity allowed me to understand how to dissect a research article and find the data that were relevant to my
research.Simultaneously, I actively engaged in advocating for social justice, equity, and ethical policies within all healthcare spheres. This claim refers to the fact that I participated in five scholarly activities to identify how COVID-19 affects healthcare staff’s needs. In particular, I focused on the necessity to standardize the use of personal protective equipment (PPE) since this strategy could directly affect medical professionals’ response to the pandemic. Those assignments helped me understand that medical facilities should offer sufficient safety conditions to all healthcare providers and patients irrespective of their race, ethnicity, gender, socio-economic status, and others. This approach can ensure that social justice and equity are promoted in the medical industry.In addition to that, the scholarly activities above demonstrated that specific equipment could be considered an effective tool to
achieve better health outcomes. That is why the conducted research allowed me to discover that appropriate equipment pieces can reduce the prevalence of pressure injuries among hospitalized patients. Since I have arrived at such a viewpoint, it was necessary to check whether it was valid. Thus, I conducted a literature search to locate timely and empirical studies that would either support or deny the advantages of relying on equipment to combat pressure ulcers.There is no doubt that I will effectively apply the skills and knowledge above to my DPI Project. The competency in identifying epidemiological data is essential since it helps identify a widespread health issue and at-risk population to consider in the Project. Since I understand the necessity to promote social justice and equality in healthcare delivery,
I will ensure that my proposed interventions will not discriminate against any group of people based on their characteristic features. Furthermore, my DPI Project will try to focus on using specific equipment to reduce pressure injuries because sufficient evidence reveals the benefits of using this method.The DPI draft prospectus contributed to evaluating outcomes of practice, practice patterns, and systems of care for public health. This claim relates to the fact that this activity helped me advance theory by highlighting whether it was possible to reduce the prevalence of pressure ulcers in the healthcare industry. This outcome was achieved because I focused on the existing national benchmarks regarding the health issue under analysis. Thus, the given approach demonstrated that pressure injuries were a significant problem for the whole medical
industry. That is why it is necessary to develop specific interventions to address the situation at a local level.Furthermore, many activities have contributed to the fact that I became familiar with improvement methodologies to promote safe, patient-centered, and timely care. Firstly, I engaged in multiple peer discussions on patient-centered approaches to care delivery. Those activities were productive since I expressed my own thoughts about the topic and listened to my peers’ opinions. The interaction of this kind helped me gain sufficient knowledge on the subject to evaluate the existing approaches and choose the most optimal one. Furthermore, I discovered that there should be a solid partnership between a patient and a clinician. In this case, the probability of achieving the desired health outcomes increases because all stakeholders actively
participate in the process.Secondly, it is necessary to admit that my DPI Project can be considered a quality improvement program. The reasoning behind this claim is that it promotes a prevention program to drive good outcomes. Simultaneously, a specific methodology can provide patients with multiple advantages if it is used correctly and safely. The literature research activities help me identify the existing methodologies, compare them, and choose the most suitable one. There is no doubt that this approach ensures that I provide patient-centered care and lead to achieving improved health outcomes.Thirdly, it is impossible to ignore the three-part assignment on quality and sustainability from DNP-835. That assignment allowed me to understand that there is a solid connection between a safety theory and health issues. In particular, it was
identified that “Watson’s Human Caring Theory is widely used to guide nursing education, practice, and research internationally” (Wei & Watson, 2019, p. 17). Since I discovered that patient falls occur because patients are not provided with sufficient safety, the identified theory demonstrates that this situation can be addressed by improving nursing education and practice. It means that healthcare professionals are primarily responsible for achieving the best health outcomes.In conclusion, I can firmly admit that the competencies of this outcome will be beneficial for my DPI Project. National benchmarks in the sphere of healthcare quality can be a clear goal that my activity will try to achieve. The acquaintance with multiple improvement methodologies will ensure that my Project will use the most effective option. Finally, the quality and sustainability
discussed competencies will be beneficial for my future work.It is also reasonable to mention that the 10 Strategic Points document and the Draft Prospectus require minor changes to ensure that they efficiently guide the DPI Project implementation. Prior to submitting my DPI Project Proposal to the Institutional Review Board (IRB), I should ensure that it meets all the requirements. It implies reading the document several times to identify any existing discrepancies and eliminating them. Possible issues can affect the content, intervention applicability, format, grammar, spelling, and others. Thus, I will do my best to ensure that my DPI Project Proposal meets the highest quality standards.
IntroductionLeadership is an important concept because it affects operations such as safety in a healthcare system. It can be defined as the ability of an individual to inspire others to attain set goals (Keats, 2019). In addition, leaders help ensure that activities run effectively during care. For instance, nurse leaders can handle workplace incivility and conflict among staff. Workplace incivility is among the challenges that affect the provision of quality care to patients. However, safety is a situation where one is free from harm. Therefore, it enables nurses to apply safety initiatives to achieve safety standards required during care.Identification of LeadershipLeadership plays an integral role in the performance of an organization. It is defined as leading a group of people towards achieving a given objective (Keats, 2019). For
example, leaders help solve disputes among health professionals or between patients and providers. They also assist in eliminating instances of workplace incivility such as bullying, biases, and other negative emotional responses (Keats, 2019). In addition, leaders ensure that followers can work in teams and acquire appropriate communication skills. As a result, leaders ensure that an organization runs effectively.Appraisal of LeadershipLeadership appraisal is an evaluation that consists of capabilities and traits. Firstly, leaders should be role models or an example to their followers. The followers should learn through them (Becker et al., 2019). For instance, leaders should effectively solve disputes professionally. Secondly, they should guide the followers on the right path, especially in teamwork. Thirdly, leaders should communicate effectively and make sure they listen and respond appropriately. Thus, a
high score in the evaluation is determined by the leadership capabilities a leader displays.Identification of SafetySafety is an important aspect of healthcare because it affects care outcomes. By definition, safety is a state of being free from any harm or danger. It can be the safety of patients or healthcare providers in a setting (Trinchero et al., 2019). It makes sure that providers’ actions, such as diagnosis and treatment, are free from errors. Safety also assists in the creation of a conducive working environment for providers. For instance, working in a clean environment ensures that nurses are free from harm that could be caused when they stay in unclean surroundings. Thus, the overall outcome of safety in a healthcare setting is providers delivering quality healthcare services to patients.Appraisal
of SafetySafety appraisal involves aspects used to evaluate safety in a healthcare setting. Firstly, safety is characterized by healthcare services such as diagnostic care being free from mistakes. Secondly, healthcare settings should have minimal patient readmission due to treatment going wrong (Trinchero et al., 2019). Thirdly, healthcare providers should also be free from any danger and should access protective equipment and operate in an environment free from stress. Finally, safety rules are adhered to by both providers and patients.Impact on the Nurses’ Need to Use High-Level Clinical JudgmentThe concept of leadership and safety influence nurses’ need to use high-level clinical judgment in a healthcare setting. First, nurses are mandated to ensure that patients get quality care. To achieve this, the nurses must use their clinical judgment. They are
also required to know when and where to ask for opinions during care. Second, in safety, nurses should adhere to rigorous standards of care (Keats, 2019). Third, they are supposed to use evidence to provide care to patients. Finally, nurses should use the concepts learned in school and the resources available at the facility to ensure quality care. For instance, nurses should collaborate with other healthcare providers to make informed decisions during care.Emerging Health Initiatives – LeadershipThere are emerging health initiatives on the aspect of leadership. Firstly, there is a need to create a conducive working environment where nurses can work effectively and provide quality care. Secondly, adequate nurse staffing to eradicate stress levels that adversely impact care. Third, nurses should have conflict resolution skills to address problems
that arise in healthcare (Keats, 2019). Finally, nurses should be educated to help eradicate workplace incivility. For instance, they should understand the effects of incivility on the performance of an organization. Nurses should know the role of technology in providing quality healthcare to patients by improving the efficiency of operations. Thus, the emerging initiatives that leaders should consider are fostering an enabling environment to provide quality healthcare services to the people.Emerging Health Initiatives – SafetyThere are various emerging health initiatives as far as safety in healthcare is concerned. The first initiative is to ensure that nurses work in a safe environment and that patients are free from medical errors (Keats, 2019). The second initiative is conducting rigorous training on safety issues in healthcare. This involves making sure nurses
understand the practices that promote safety. Finally, the third initiative is the creation of policies and safety standards to guide operations within healthcare. Safety standards help in directing and maintaining safe and clinically competent nursing operations. Therefore, safety will be attained in healthcare if nurses understand safety issues and appropriate safety standards guiding operations.Ways to Advance Communication Related to Leadership and SafetyCommunication is integral in the effective management of operations in a workplace. To advance communication, there is a need to cultivate trust between relevant stakeholders in healthcare, such as nurse leaders, nurses, and patients and their families (Daft & Marcic, 2019). Trust ensures that stakeholders are open and transparent during communication. The other way is to adopt appropriate infrastructure such as communication apps or use the latest
plays an integral role in motivating followers to achieve the set objectives. For instance, a nurse leader ensures that nurses are encouraged to achieve healthcare goals. Nurse leaders also help solve issues such as conflict and eliminate instances of workplace incivility like discrimination. On the other hand, safety is being free from any harm. Therefore, it also plays an important role in ensuring that health providers and patients operate and stay in a safe environment.
In Plato’s literary work, there are three answers to what piety is. Euthyphro begins with a lesser sense of righteousness. However, Socrates, following his general point of view, generally insists on a broader sense of the word. This is because he is less inspired by correct customs than by ethical life. Thus, the first answer to the question of piety shows that Euthyphro’s piety is what he is doing at the moment, that is, accusing his father of murder. Euthyphro offers such a definition of piety and impiety as what pleases divine beings.On the other hand, what they hate and do not accept as pious is impious. Further, Socrates rejects the activity of Euthyphro, since it is just an illustration of piety and does not give a fundamental
earlier. He said that the gods love something because it is pious, which means that their love flows from something inherent in the pious. Socrates claims that the approval of the gods is just an attribute of a given feeling and that divine approval is not a defining characteristic. Thus, Euthyphro is the kind of minister who wants to know the answer to the main question. However, Socrates rejects every definition of piety that he offers. After all the failed attempts, Euthyphro hurries away and leaves the question unanswered.
Power may corrupt those who wield it, and the pursuit of power is frequently harmful. People whose life objective is to obtain power over others are condemned to fail since human ambition frequently leads to sinful behaviors, which are inevitably punished. While The government is the system that makes laws and ensures that they are followed, it is the person who wields power who is responsible for the equality and impartiality of its enforcement.Tragedies lie at the heart of Shakespeare’s creative legacy. They represent the strength of his brilliant mind as well as the essence of his period, which is why, if following epochs looked to Shakespeare for comparison, they first understood their struggles via him. Shakespeare’s tragedies have been influenced by a growing number of fresh interpretations.
Macbeth, one of Shakespeare’s most renowned tragedies, depicts characters who have been damaged by their ambition and reveals the devastating nature of the desire for power for the sake of authority. Shakespeare’s Macbeth is the most comprehensive portrayal of the individualist as a person who actively and consistently prioritizes what reflects her interests over the interests of others. Macbeth, driven by ambition, is eager to liberate his mind from moral ideals and domestic norms, seeing them as stumbling blocks and meaningless preconceptions.People, like the play’s major protagonists, who are consumed by the concept of obtaining the throne, are frequently corrupted by power and eventually wreck their own lives and the lives of others. Macbeth is a tragedy of overwhelming ambition; therefore, it’s no surprise that its leitmotif is
the hero’s words: “I dare everything a man dares,” which are addressed to death itself in the finale: “I wish to experience the last. Macbeth is a tragedy about a colossal personality who had the same chances for victory as death, but valor without wisdom drove it to full isolation from humanity and its soul.Macbeth is willing to kill and betray even close friends to gain the crown and the kingdom. With a dagger, the hero assassinates the sleeping monarch. He also orders the Banquo and Macduff families to be killed. Macbeth does not see individuals; rather, he sees impediments on his route to the throne. After realizing that he might inherit the throne, Macbeth, a brave and powerful warrior and dedicated servant of the king, transforms into
a greedy and vicious killer.Lady Macbeth seems to be a more ambitious woman than her husband Macbeth., so Macbeth is far from the only person whose life has been tainted by power. This woman persuades her husband that Duncan should be murdered if he visits their home. “Look like an innocent flower, but be a serpent behind it,” she says to her husband. Lady Macbeth, who aspires to be queen, encourages her husband to commit crimes, therefore defining their fate. Without his wife’s convictions, Macbeth would not have committed all of these heinous acts.The play’s conclusion, which discusses Lady Macbeth’s lunacy and Macbeth’s death, is the primary revelation demonstrating the corrupting nature of power. When Lady Macbeth notices blood on her hands, Macbeth, who thought he was unstoppable,
is murdered. This couple loses something more important: intelligence and humanity because of their ambition for the throne. As a result, the government frequently not only discloses a person’s underlying undesirable tendencies but also leads to a fatal ending.On the other hand, power does not always lead to corruption for individuals who strive to improve the lives of others. It also leaves behind those who are uninterested in receiving it. However, there are few such people: power is typically given to those who seek it. The throne, for example, was meant to belong to Duncan in Macbeth and later to his son, who may also be a fabulous king. Macbeth, on the other hand, receives the power because he went to such lengths to obtain it. Although power
key revelation that demonstrates how power corrupts. In Macbeth, the author demonstrates the corrupting influence of power: the protagonist’s and his wife’s life spent pursuing the throne ended tragically. Macbeth kills innocent people, including children, in his quest for power. The wife’s desire becomes the driving force behind everything that occurs: the image of the crown becomes more essential than anything else in her life. The play’s conclusion suggests that individuals should not seek power only for the sake of power. This performance teaches individuals that power and those in positions of authority are not essential aspects of their life.
Scott Kiesling focuses on the address term dude in the article Dude (2004), whereby the term’s pattern of use, meanings, and functions are highlighted. The author is an American sociolinguist prompted to research dude’s functions and implications in the American culture by his undying interests in gender and language. Dude portrays a specific pattern of use influenced by its societal functions and meanings, thus explaining its high usage and enhanced popularity.Dude is mostly used by the younger generation of European American men when addressing one another and partly by women. Kiesling (2004) reports that “… dude is used primarily by men speaking to other men, but not exclusively so… young women also used the term a significant amount…” (p. 287, p. 284). Moreover, contextual and grammatical relevance determines
the pattern of the usage of dude , including its intonation. Therefore, factors such as gender and location influence the degree of the use of dude .Dude has five interactional functions that overlap and illustrate how the term engulfs masculine homo-sociality. These functions are gesturing agreements, marking attachment and connection, marking the discourse structure, mitigating stances of confrontations, and exclamation (Kiesling, 2004). Dude can either be applied to more than a single function or be ambiguous; hence the functions are not entirely exclusive. The word is an interactive resource that creates several stances, as illustrated by the uses listed above.The term dude rose to popularity in the 1980s because the youths used it as an exclamation to illustrate affection and delight. Therefore, dude was used as an in-group
stances highlighted upon the word’s usage. The rapid rise and popularity of dude is arguably an attribute of the reinstatement of new puritanism that emphasizes family values and hard work supported by solidarity.Dude’s use pattern is determined by its functions and discourse relevance and influenced its encroachment in Anglo-American society. Male youths of European American descent use the term more than their female counterparts. Additionally, the term satisfies five overlapping functions and meanings in interaction. Dude encodes a principal masculinity stance that enhanced the term’s rise and popularity. The dude is a shadow of the 1980s and 1990s constantly gathered over generations.
When managing the lifetime of material, reliability design is a sub-discipline of process engineering that emphasizes the importance of dependability. Therefore, reliability defines the ability of a system or component to work properly under specified circumstances over a certain amount of time. Reliability is closely connected to dependability, which is often described as a component or process’s capacity to perform at a certain time or time interval throughout a period. The probability of performance is the abstract notion behind Reliability concept’s abstract idea (Slivinski et al., 2019). Quality, testability, repairability, and advancement are all often referred to as reliability technology. The reliability of components greatly influences the cost-effectiveness of a system. For instance, when vehicles break less often, their resale value is greater. At the highest levels of
“lifetime” systems, reliability technology has difficulty anticipating, preventing, and managing the complexity and danger of failure that might occur.“Margin” reliability is characterized by developing highly particular strength margins (force, chemical, and electrical) and then designing to those margins. The product’s toughness must be reduced if it is lightweight, inexpensive to make, and effective. There is little room for error in the manufacturing process. The consumer has to know exactly how the product will be used and how it will benefit them. In addition to defining particular environmental variables, life expectancy forecasts must be based on specified instances. The focus on quantification and the selection of objectives indicates a limitation to good performance; nevertheless, there is no intrinsic limit. The development of better value does not have to be
more expensive than the creation of lower quality. On the other hand, they assert that predicting performance using past data may be quite wrong, with only acceptable correlations between identical models, items, manufacturing processes, and maintenance under equal operating loads and circumstances of usage being discovered (Slivinski et al., 2019). Furthermore, even modest adjustments to any of these variables might have a major influence on performance. Consequently, as historical information is collected, the most erroneous and substantial things are quite highly probable to be modified and re-engineered, making the conventional statistical procedures and strategies used in, for example, the healthcare or insurance markets less effective.The chance failure phase is primarily concerned with the occurrence of random failures in the product. The most common cause for this type of
consequence of the overworked situation, the gadget fails as a result of its overworked state. Consequently, the following are some of the most typical causes for the possible failure of a product: 1. Overusing the product: when a product is overused, there are high chances of running into a failure. This may be a result of poor handling or lack of proper maintenance. 2. Using the product for wrong purposes: manufacturers usually indicate what a product can do and how it should be used (Zidi, Moulahi & Alaya, 2017. However, some individuals may use it for the wrong purposes. It was not meant to, therefore, force it into a failure.
Confidence limits and hypothesis testing are some of the key components of statistical testing that are used in healthcare administration for different purposes. Both of them are interconnected, as it is impossible to establish a hypothesis without knowing the confidence limits. The numbers indicate the lower and the upper ends of the confidence interval (Kros & Rosenthal, 2016). For instance, if a man is six and the confidence limits are 4 and 7, the confidence interval will be 4 to 7. They indicate how accurate an estimate of the mean will be for a particular statistical category of objects or characteristics. Confidence limits enable medical personnel or healthcare administrators to establish how close the estimate they have is likely to be to the one that exists. In order
to count the confidence limits for a particular object, one needs to calculate a confidence interval.Hypothesis testing helps establish whether a particular statement or hypothesis is true and determines how plausible it is. In order to find it out, the statists usually use sample data from a particular population, relying on the characteristics they need. The hypothesis is divided into two large groups. The first one is called the null hypothesis, and it is a statement that indicates that there is no statistical difference between two or more variables (Kros & Rosenthal, 2016). The second type is the alternative hypothesis, and which is opposed to the null hypothesis and is what statists usually check.When speaking about hypothesis testing, it is necessary to mention the two types of errors
healthcare assistants may face while trying to establish the validity and relevance of a particular statement. The error of the first type is also called a False Negative. It may appear when a statistical analysis concludes that the null hypothesis is false and irrelevant when, in fact, it is true (Kros & Rosenthal, 2016). The second type of error is called False Positive, and, unlike in the case of the errors of the first type, they conclude that the null hypothesis is true when in reality, it is false.Hypothesis testing alongside the confidence intervals is the two most important constituents of the research methodology in all types of research, including medical ones. They serve as guidelines in planning, realizing, and establishing the final results during the process of
that hypothesis testing and confidence intervals are connected with each other. Both of them belong to the category of inferential techniques, and they use samples in order to either estimate a characteristic of a particular population or check the validity of a statement. Hence, confidence intervals and confidence limits, in particular, are used to estimate sampling parameters, while hypothesis testing is a method that shows whether the hypothesis is reliable or not. Both these methods can be used either in tandem or separately in order to help healthcare assistants support their conclusions or establish the relevance of particular suppositions.
Several methodologies are put into place to compare the role of intervention with other professions. The techniques include the interest-based methods, based on the profession of mediation, generalist intervention model utilized in the social work profession, and traditional adversarial model, employed in the law profession. Therefore, the paper will profoundly detail the change of roles based on this professional based on skills, techniques, and strategies when changing from one career to another in the intervention as a conflict ensues between different parties at large.Three professions are compared, including mediation, social work, and law. To demonstrate these parallels, I utilize an interest-based model of mediation, a generalist model of social work, and a traditional adversarial law model. Noteworthy, other laws and social work professionals see mediation as a possible
role for them to play. Significant differences appear when the three models’ orientations, values, and techniques comparison as defined by (Barsky 2017). A lawyer’s conventional role is that of an advocate who fights for the rights and interests of one party in a dispute. Most social workers are accustomed to campaigning for specific clients or causes. Lawyers or social professionals who want to play the position of a mediator must put their advocacy aside and become neutral facilitators. Clients can use mediators to negotiate on their behalf.Furthermore, mediators support each party’s ability to negotiate, they do not support a particular situation or the solution. When advocacy-oriented helping professionals become mediators, one of the most challenging adjustments is to become neutral. Each of the three professions emphasizes the right
of customers to make their own decisions in terms of values. They value individualism and everyone’s sense of self-worth. Because courts impose solutions on parties, some people believe that the law is anti-self-determination. Even for lawyers, though, the courtroom is the last resort. Disputes are best settled through party-to-party or lawyer-led talks (Barsky, 2017). Only when the parties cannot reach an agreement independently, do they turn to the courts for help.However, for instance, when a conflict arises between two parties, for example, the employer and employee, based on the interest-based method based on mediation, as a mediator, the role would be listening to the information shared by both parties fully. In contrast, as a mediator, I would listen to both parties with sides, therefore, maintaining neutrality to maintain
Rucol General Merchandise is opting to implement an enterprise resources planning (ERP) system that requires a superb storage solution. The organization has several branches with employees allowed to work from home two days a week. An effective storage solution for Rucol General Merchandise must meet some credentials. Such qualifications include access from multiple points, top-notch data security, affordability, and stability. As noted earlier, Rucol’s employees work from home at least two days a week. The organization operates six days a week and has over fifty functional branches.Possible storage solutions for Rucol include cloud storage, solid-state drives (SSD), and hard disk drives (HDD). Each of these options has advantages and demerits in the organization’s case. SSDs and HDDs, for example, provide cheaper storage alternatives for Rucol. The two options
sensitive data. The argument makes SSDs and HDDs appropriate for the organization.HDDs come with large space at a relatively lower cost than SSDs, making the former option more appropriate for Rucol’s case. The company will thus utilize HDDs for data backup in a high-efficiency computer without internet connections. Nonetheless, the best data storage alternative for Rucol is the cloud storage system. Choosing Google Drive will allow the organization to acquire about thirty terabytes for $300 a month. The choice will offer data security, increased accessibility, and reliability (Weiland et al., 2019). Coupling the cloud option for data management during normal operations and an HDD system for backups promises the entity a better solution for the data management problem.
IntroductionThe biographical film ‘ Before Night Falls’ touches the most delicate strings of its viewers’ soul, describing the tragic and hardship-filled life of the famous Cuban poet Reinaldo Arenas. The man was raised in a low-income family and decided to support the Cuban revolutionaries who appreciated his talent as a writer. At the same time, he suddenly resolved to issue a national appeal about his non-traditional orientation. However, his former friends and comrades-in-arms, with the famous Fidel Castro at the head, managed to declare a law banning homosexuality and together jailed the young man. For two whole years, he served his sentence in a Cuban prison and developed plans for a new brighter future. After his liberation, Reinaldo Arenas radically changes his plans and escapes to America. Although
he found true love there, but the idyll ended with a disease. Thus, it is essential to establish if Reinaldo himself chose his sexual orientation or if it was influenced by various factors.Social and Cultural Factors that Influenced the Sexual OrientationAlthough evidence of homosexuality existed in ancient Greece, humanity has long considered it immoral. Freud’s writings in this area explain the main character’s sexual attraction to his own gender (Gibson et al. 37). In this way, the philosopher wrote that obstacles or the inability to pass a particular stage in life contribute to the development of homosexuality (Gibson et al. 37). The film’s hero suffered from living in poverty and without a father since his childhood. Even when a teacher visited the house to praise the boy’s literary
abilities, his grandfather became highly annoyed (Schnabel). At the same time, viewers may notice that Reinaldo Arenas watched men bathe naked for the first time. The main protagonist smiled and looked at the men’s bodies with curiosity. Therefore, it is possible to draw a connection between the problems in the family and Reinaldo’s yet undiscovered desires. At the same time, Freud believed that innate sexual deviations could not affect a person independently (Gibson et al. 38). They were stimulated by social factors, of which there were also plenty in the central character’s life.The prohibition and persecution of homosexuals and arrests also strengthen Reynaldo Arenas’ sexual instinct. Significantly, even in prison, he believed that he could emerge free and defend gay rights (Schnabel). Carpenter remarked that members of the
culture, such as writers, actively advocated for homosexual rights (Gibson et al. 39). He argued that rights and freedoms are valuable for such people, and they are willing to fight for them. Reinaldo Arenas also felt oppression and tried to restore justice in his books. He wrote about the government’s fighting against gay people, although Reinaldo could only publish abroad. As a consequence, the protagonist’s heightened sense of justice and equality, attracted by cultural figures, negatively affected his life. He was persecuted because of the written books banned by the censorship and held in custody as a particularly dangerous criminal (Schnabel). Thus, the concepts cited indicate that Reinaldo Arenas was prone to homosexuality due to the social conditions of his life, and his literary talent contributed to the
expression of dissent and the desire to live freely.The Main Character’s Conscious ChoiceIt is interesting that the protagonist assessed the consequences of his actions and understood that he would receive punishment. He did not stop writing and did not hide his homosexuality, even when the authorities intensively persecuted gay people. Reinaldo Arenas participated in homosexual parties and frequented public places with gay friends (Schnabel). It seems inappropriate behavior, considering that the protagonist was afraid of being punished and wanted to save his own life. Accordingly, it could argue that he deliberately chose this behavior and its aftereffects. According to religious cultures, sexual relations between people of the same sex need punishment. For example, Leviticus notes that committing such adultery involves mortal punishment (Gibson et al. 7). Hence, religious
concepts do not accept homosexuality as a natural phenomenon or caused by social factors. Instead, they consider it a manifestation of sexual promiscuity and a particular individual choice.From this point of view, Reinaldo Arenas chose a problematic fate for himself when the hero confessed his involvement in homosexuality. Moreover, he had many sexual relationships with different partners, which indicated an amoral lifestyle that stimulated the emergence of AIDS (Schnabel). Therefore, religious doctrines are skeptical of the protagonist’s behavior and confirm that he made a conscious selection. Although the Bible describes a close relationship between David and Jonathan, some scholars interpret this as a manifestation of homosexuality (Gibson et al. 7). Accordingly, the argument that people are automatically born with a traditional orientation and that homosexuality is a personal
abilities inspired him to resist the authorities and society. That is why he did not stop writing books and openly declared his gay identity. It was these various reasons why the main character died at a young age after experiencing a great deal of suffering. The biblical argument that sexual orientation is his own decision can people refute because some scholars believe that scripture demonstrates gay relationships. Therefore, the protagonist’s non-traditional orientation resulted from a combination of reasons that subsequently led to his death as a young man.
The “Eye of the Storm” video is a fascinating example of how race can be socially constructed in the classroom. Jane Elliott created a distinction between blue-eyed and brown-eyed children, teaching the young participants that their peers with brown eyes were superior (Bloom). Although this contrast does not possess any inherent meaning and is merely a representation of one’s amount of melanin in the body, it became significant for the children. Thus, Elliott socially constructed race by suggesting that one group of children is better than the other, with the eye colors serving as symbols to emphasize race and group belonging.As a result of such distinction, differences in the students’ activities and performance became evident. Elliott observed that the children who were in the brown-eyed group grew more
It isn’t easy to single out the central directions and build a particular hierarchy in the modern art world, including music. Some of the performers influence the minds of young people, and political strategists can use some compositions during elections. The current state of the art is too vague to make clear statements on this subject. Hip-hop performers expose many of the problems of megacities and young people: drugs, cruelty, violence, and lack of life guidelines (Rabinowitch, 2020). The social movement for women’s rights is significant for the modern generation, and female performers are becoming iconic people in music. One such person is Lady Gaga, who began her career as a freak with a sensual mezzo-soprano. Performers like her describe the issues of discrimination and harassment emotionally. Some
The contract is an agreement between two or more persons to establish, change or terminate civil rights and obligations. A contract is the most common type of transaction. The content of the contract includes the rights and obligations of the parties concluding the contract and the conditions under which the contract enters into force or loses it. The concept of the contract is used in three meanings, the contract as: 1. Legal fact, the basis for the emergence, change, or termination of a civil legal relationship; 2. Agreement of the parties, providing for the rights, obligations, and the procedure for their implementation; 3. A document that contains a specific message and the content of the contract is its conditions, which are divided into essential, ordinary, and accidental (Hutchison
& Myburgh, 2020).Ordinary conditions – conditions provided for by law and come into effect automatically, regardless of their indication in the contract. Random conditions supplement or change the usual conditions. Such conditions are included in the text of the contract at the discretion of the parties, but their absence does not affect the validity of the contract. All contracts can be classified into several types, differing from each other according to some criteria (Hutchison & Myburgh, 2020). Unilateral – in one party, the contract gives rise to rights; in the other – obligations; and bilateral – at the conclusion of the contract, each party acquires both rights and obligations. In addition, there is a division into paid, implying the property representation of one party due to the counter-property
representation of the other party (Stewart, Swain, and Fairweather, 2019). Also gratuitous – property representation is made by only one party (Hutchison & Myburgh, 2020). It is important to emphasize that the contract of donation, that is, a free gift, belongs to the second type. However, the promise is not a contract since the basic conditions are not met, allowing to assert the legal conclusion of the transaction.Separately, it is worth considering an option contract as a separate aspect of making and concluding transactions. The fact is that an option agreement differs from other demand agreements in that the will of a person is a condition for both parties. The counter-obligation also depends on the actions of the party that has the right to demand. The counterparties have
I, Tituba is a book centered around the strives and inequality of a wrongfully convicted black slave woman who was a victim of brutality and prejudice throughout her life. The story depicts the Salem witch trials from the perspective of Tituba, a black woman. Her life is characterized by various injustices and misfortunes, which led to her early death. Condé introduces her readers by declaring her goal to present Tituba’s side of the tale. The declaration suggests that Condé believed the story of Tituba’s maltreatment needed to be told to expose the truth she had been denied due to her skin color and gender. Her husband, John Indian, a black slave, shares some maltreatment exerted on Tituba despite having individual shortcomings. The novel I, Tituba, brings out the
effects of patriarchy and racism on people of color and, majorly, on women. The book exposes John Indian’s cowardliness and selfishness towards Tituba and further highlights her frantic attempts to deal with life predicaments.In the seventeenth century, females were denied equal treatment to men. Racism led to portraying black women as lesser than their white counterparts. Condé included Tituba’s side of the tale to assert the patriarchy exerted by males and its implication on women of color. Tituba embodies a kind, powerful woman who cannot resent her adversaries. Although black males were racially oppressed, gender benefitted them as they were secluded from the Salem witch trials. Individually, the white men of Salem, especially Samuel Parris, had authority over their whole neighborhood.Tituba’s life was centered on male dominance, illustrated
by being born of rape, wrongly accused, and killed. From the novel’s inception, foreshadowing depicts a man’s power over a woman. The author employs this literary style when he states, “Abena, my mother was raped on the deck of the Christ the King by an English sailor one day in the year 16**. I was conceived as a result of this act of assault” (Condé 3). The introductory chapter foreshadows Tituba’s horrific rape at the moment of her accusation by four men. Her mother subsequently defends herself against another attempted rape, hurting the white male sex offender, but she is hanged later. Her mother clearly warns her about the safeguards she should take while developing a connection with a man—Tituba’s downfalls in the story result from her entanglement
with men. As a black woman, Tituba is denied protection and dignity in every situation she encounters.Men had a significant influence on Tituba’s life. Condé’s argument underlines the importance of sex and ethnicity in Tituba’s existence. Her existence revolves around the actions of the males in her vicinity. She is exploited and sometimes chooses such routes due to the men she accompanies. Her husband, John Indian, urges her to confess to practicing witchcraft instead of standing by her in fighting the false accusations (Condé 5). The men in her life fail to regard her as an equal human being due to her gender manifested by John’s decision to sacrifice herself to end the witch case. Tituba’s selflessness contrasts with John’s Indian selfishness when she devotes not mention other
women who allegedly helped her in witchcraft. As a result, Tituba was sexually abused and assaulted by four men, including Parris. Her strong-willed mentality aids her in overcoming the horrific things she endures throughout the years.Being feminine is a significant deciding element throughout Tituba’s existence. In actuality, her world was ruled by males. Tituba finally realizes that she cannot trust anybody, particularly males. In prison, an inmate named Hester offers the remarks that daily resonate inside her, becoming repetitious throughout her life: “Life is too nice to men, regardless of their hue.” Condé uses this precise word to emphasize the injustice in Tituba’s and the other black girls’ lives (Bilal and Ashfaq 782). Black men experience an edge as they are required to work only as slaves, but
women of color are forced to work as slaves while sexually and socially abused.Women’s reliance on men is among Tituba’s flaws throughout her existence. She yields to men, valuing their freedom above her own. Condé’s fictional portrayal of Tituba includes biblical allusions to the instruction she had imparted to her by deceased loved ones. The usage of a biblical analogy makes an indirect connection to the bible. While God directed individuals in the bible, Tituba is guided by influential ladies in her life. Although she heeds their counsel, she often chooses to follow the men in her life, resulting in her death. In the biblical setup, Eve defies God by eating the fruit. Tituba disregards the counsel of previous ladies throughout her life, leading to several catastrophes. “I
was the last to be led to the gallows; surrounding me were odd trees brimming with unusual fruit.” Tituba died with the knowledge of what her life has been, a life spent entirely under the influence of men.In the 1600s, the white man had a significant impact on Tituba’s life. The white man’s hegemony over all spheres of existence unfairly treated women without consideration or care for them as human beings (Bilal and Ashfaq 780). The author’s argument indicates that males ruled Tituba’s life from birth to maturity. Condé says, “A white guy had raped my mother. She had been executed due to an encounter with a white man. My adopted father committed suicide as a result of an encounter with a white man.” Her skin color is
a significant factor in the disparity between her and a white woman. Because she is dark-skinned, life is more difficult for her, and as a result, she is forced to live under the direction and control of a man. John Indian, however, experiences a less harsh life which pioneers his disregard to fight for the less fortunate, especially women.Though sexuality played a significant role in Tituba’s life, her skin color set her apart from other Salem women. Being a black woman entailed a great deal of scrutiny. And not only from males but also from white females (Bilal and Ashfaq 778). “They were erasing me from the human grid. I was an amorphous entity. Invisible. More imperceptible than the invisible, who at the very minimum had abilities that
IntroductionGlobalization has had a huge impact on the world economy, and on the growth of geographical mobility of the workforce in particular. Huge masses of people change their habitat, type of settlements and sphere of activity in relatively short time intervals. At the same time, they find themselves in a new, unusual environment for themselves, among people. It has a different way of life, a different system of secular and religious values and speakers of a different language. The growth of the absolute and relative share of diasporas leads, respectively, to an increase in their absolute and relative contribution to the economy. This work considers the diaspora as one of the most important subjects of the economic processes of our time. All economic processes related to the diaspora
are developing in line with broader ethnic, social and economic trends of modernity.As a combination of all the new processes of globalization, a major trend is developing: diasporas are playing an increasingly important role in the economic sphere. At the same time, their economic potential becomes commensurate with the economic potential of the States on the main territory. In some situations, it may even exceed the potential of the ethnic groups forming the environment. Today, many members of diasporas, while retaining their ethnic and religious affiliation, change their citizenship, and as a result become associated parts of other nations. In the era of globalization, such a previously private pattern becomes one of the universal ones. The number of people with dual citizenship who simultaneously participate in the economic
life of two or more states, nations and ethnic groups is growing. For example, investing in the economy of some states, they direct the earned funds to their historical homeland, pay double taxes, etc. Thus, diasporas contribute to the economic development of local communities to a much greater extent.BackgroundDiasporas as subjects of the cultural and historical process are as ancient as ethnic groups and confessional communities themselves. This can be judged based on the oldest written sources and ethnographic materials about ethnic groups that have pre-state forms of social organization. The socio-demographic structure of diasporas can act as a prerequisite for leadership in the economy (Welde et al., 2020). The most famous of all the variants of the genesis of diasporas is their appearance as a result of
resettlement from their historical homeland. The flow of migrants is dominated by men of working age, with a level of education and vocational training above average, as a rule, energetic and enterprising (Stone & Scott, 2018). Thus, migrants are more economically active in comparison with the average characteristics of the initial community.This phenomenon is partly spontaneous, partly purposefully controlled by states interested in the influx or restriction of any categories of migrants. Many states practiced recruitment or, conversely, introduced restrictive quotas in accordance with the age, professional, property, etc. level of migrants (Koinova, 2018a). As a consequence of these spontaneous or purposeful selection, the economic role of the diaspora may be higher than the average in the surrounding society (Seraphin et al., 2019). This is manifested, in particular,
in the standard of living, which can be significantly higher than in the historical homeland.Key Scholars and Theoretical FrameworksThe degree of influence of diasporas on the economic development of the receiving and sending countries is an urgent topic for the work of many researchers. The theoretical frameworks regarding this topic touches on such different aspects of the problem. These are employment and solidarity of migrant workers, as well as the impact of migration on the socio-economic development of countries (Carment & Calleja, 2018). In their works, scientists address various, sometimes opposite aspects of the role of participation of diasporas, migrant workers, remittances and human capital in economic development.The theoretical framework is interconnected with the processes of globalization of the world, the contact of local cultures, and the formation
of new socio-cultural identities. In the 1990s, a new direction for research appeared in it — the transnational approach. It should be noted the developments of the American sociologist Peggy Levitt, who has repeatedly been published in collaboration with Glick-Schiller on the problems of the theory and methodology of the transnational approach (Levitt & Schiller, 2004). She is a major representative of the sociological direction in the study of the phenomenon of transnational. In addition, Levit is credited with introducing the topic of transnational diasporal corporations into scientific discourse.The concept of “transnational social space”, introduced by the aforementioned scientists, caused a flurry of criticism from sociologists. Waldinger (2017) developed the theory by writing a paper about the limits of transnationalism. He considers it methodologically erroneous to consider a
national state without connection with a specific territory (Waldinger, 2017). At the same time, Waldinger is impressed by the very idea of social interactions over diasporas and territorial borders. However, he still suggests replacing the concept of “transnational social space” with the concept of “deterritorialized national state”(Waldinger, 2017). An important factor for him was the involvement of diasporas in the state market, which led to the formation of stable international economic interactions.One of the aspects of studying the diaspora is its elements. The concept proposed focuses on the elements in which, according to the author, the essence of the phenomenon of the diaspora is reflected. Diasporas are mostly formed as a result of forced eviction. As a result, large groups of people or even entire communities find themselves
outside the country of origin (Guo, 2021). At the same time, voluntary emigration of individuals and small groups may take place, which also leads to the emergence of enclaves in host countries. The basis of the diaspora is a community that already has a clearly defined identity formed in the country of exodus.It can be seen that some characteristics in all concepts are consistent and complement each other. For example, in the concept of Hannaford, the provision on the violent nature of resettlement is highlighted (Hannaford, 2018). The position of concept Hannaford about collective memory as a fundamental element of the identity of the diaspora group is important (Hannaford, 2018). The same opinion is shared by Lapshyna, stating that self-awareness and self-determination as a diaspora is largely connected
with the collective memory connecting local communities (Lapshyna, 2019). Collective experience and collective memories prevent cultural forgetting and preserve the diaspora as a whole.The thesis about maintaining links between communities in concept Hannaford partially coincides with the idea of Han about the communication networks of the diaspora. As opposed to Lapshyna, Han highlights the ability of the Jewish diaspora to intensive communication (Han, 2018). This point determines the transnational nature of the diaspora. The very fact of the presence of parts of a particular ethnic group in at least two countries allows us to conclude that there is a transnational network of relations (Meillassoux, 2018). Undoubtedly, at present this is a characteristic feature, if not of all, then of the vast majority of both classical and modern diasporas.The
above approaches take into account various aspects that determine the phenomenon of diaspora. It is important that the organization of the diaspora itself can extend far beyond the borders of one country. In this case, scientists are talking about creating a network of social institutions of the diaspora in various countries and transnational spaces (Lacroix et al., 2016). Most scientists agree that it is possible to talk about the diaspora space. It covers not only sociological aspects of the diaspora community, but also representatives of the economical incentives.Nigerian Diasporic NetworksCase Study from NigeriaThe African continent (including Nigeria) makes a significant contribution to the growth of the number of migrants in the EU. In comparison with the other two vast areas of migration from South to North – Asia
and Latin America – Africa occupies a middle position (Grunsven, 2019). The relative level of migration (average annual immigration minus emigration) from Africa exceeds the Asian level and is inferior to Latin American.Diasporas alleviate the livelihoods of their relatives and their own communities through the diaspora association. The peculiarities of the development of new conditions and forms of adaptation, new socio-economic realities show that national non-profit organizations acquire additional meanings, goals and functions (Hack-Polay & Siwale, 2018). Diasporas become producers of migrants’ social capital capable of qualitatively transforming their socio-economic and political position in the host society. Similar mechanisms have been noted in relation to Nigerian migrants in the formation of the territorial identity of migrants (Zapata-Barrero & Rezaei, 2019). They also influenced adaptation to a new place
through socio-environmental, economic, cultural and other strategies.The diaspora association enables diasporas to access a wider range of political connections and government sponsors to enhance the economic development of their relatives and their communities. This is due to the fact that the resources of the diaspora (in fact, their elite) are based on the solidarity of community members (Prinz & Siegel, 2019). Solidarity forms a wide range of mechanisms for strengthening the entire community – from political mobilization to the concentration of material resources in lobbying (Levitt, 1998). Diasporas can use their own culture (literature, religious organization, cuisine features) to form an image that will determine the actions of political actors. These resources relate to socio-political and economic, and improve the quality of life of all members of the
community.Diasporas would not have as much influence on their communities’ economic development without the base the diaspora association provides. The interaction of representatives of diasporas within a single society is a cost-effective tool (Waldinger, 2001). International cooperation is conducted through diasporas in the implementation of the economic policy of states (Koinova, 2018b). They act as an instrument for the realization of the economic interests of their homeland. Diasporas are also useful to the host country in establishing and maintaining economic contacts with their ethnic homeland.Nigerian diasporas are quite successful in mobilizing diasporas globally to form various associations. For example, the Nigerian Seafarers’ Union has serious economic influence and has weight for shipping companies (Alonso & Mylonas, 2019). After several major strikes, the sailors recognized this union as an
equal party in negotiations and discussion of the situation on the labor market. The Remember Saro-Wiwa group is engaged in a wide variety of activities, ranging from art and culture, ending with the protection of human rights and environmental projects (Triandafyllidou, 2018). The Nigerian Youth League, which has a representative office in Nigeria, and the XN Foundation, which also pays attention to the problems of people with disabilities, are strong in youth topics (Levitt, 2005). They can finance local infrastructure development projects and influence government policies.Tensions Between DiasporasThe tension between Nigerian diasporas and their local communities is most often associated with the professed religion. In the future, further aggravation of the conflict between Muslims and Christians in Nigerian diasporas may lead to the division of communities along confessional
lines. Inter-communal relations in the Nigerian diasporas are characterized by an extreme degree of tension. It has especially intensified since the late 80s of the last century (Inouye et al., 2019). It is associated with the growing influence of fundamentalist religious movements (especially Islamic ones) around the world.Not all development plans made by diasporas necessarily benefit the local communities. For example, in the Nigerian diasporas, great importance is paid to the preservation of the cultural system, which negatively affects the economic one. There is a strict gender roles division in Nigerian households, in which women play a leading role in raising children and running the household (Krasniqi & Williams, 2018). Men are assigned an exclusive duty to provide for the family, which leads to significant economic losses (Smith
& Guarnizo, 1998). The authority of parents and the older generation is high, which often takes responsibility for the younger generation as a whole. Thus, conservative sentiments prevail in the Nigerian diasporas, which hinder economic progress.Moreover, the power relations between diasporas and those who were ‘left behind’ are often ambiguous. For example, many diasporas have an opaque economic structure: an account is open, and the purpose of mandatory donations is not always known (Fossati, 2018). Large diasporas are able to form a national niche in the country’s economy. For example, they can organize national enterprises consisting of representatives of a particular ethnic group (Fiddian-Qasmiyeh & Daley, 2018). Periodically, for the purpose of rapid economic integration, diasporas aggressively occupy entire business sectors, turning them into oligopolies.Nigerian diasporas are not
homogenous that leads to tensions within the association as diasporas have different political and economic desires. For example, Nigerians from the hinterland are actively promoting the idea of primary patriotism. All their activities are aimed at helping and supporting, first of all, the place of their birth – the village, the city, the district (Carling, 2008). The political and economic desires of this group of migrants are aimed at the subsequent return to their native lands with the capital already accumulated for the purchase of housing, business, trade (Elo et al., 2019). In these diasporas, the attitude towards whole groups of people whose migration from Nigeria is permanent and irrevocable is negative.Disagreements also arise in male and female diasporas: they have different views on how their influence should
be used. The differentiation of the population inevitably hinders the construction of a unified system within the entire diaspora. For example, in some regions, families headed by women are considered normal (De Haas, 2005). However, due to the predominance of patriarchal foundations, men often hinder the influence of women in political or economic spheres (Basch et al., 1993). They try to limit the activities of their wives to raising children and running a household, which is negatively perceived by the female diaspora.Lesser Economical ContributionsDiasporas did not play a significant role in the rapid growth of the country as a whole. The Chand’s study, when comparing data at the international level, showed that in developed European countries, its positive impact is close to zero, or 0.5% of GDP (Chand,
2018). The study analyzed the migration of the last 50 years (Chand, 2018). The study concludes that migrants from Nigeria do not make a significant contribution to the country’s budget. The age and qualifications of Nigerian migrants have a significant impact on whether they invest in the host country’s economy or deplete it.Nigeria’s growth has been facilitated by a fast-growing manufacturing industry built on Nigeria’s financial, and service industry. In addition, a significant role in this process was played by abundant oil supply which is approximately 2.7% of global supply (Adamson, 2019). Moreover, the Nigerian diaspora carries out the largest sub-Saharan inflow of funds to Africa. The dynamics of the growth of transfers is indicative: at least once every few months, approximately one in ten Nigerians sends funds
to Nigeria (Xaynazarov & Pardaev, 2020). The transferred funds are used to finance political parties, education, and business development. Thus, the money earned by members of the Nigerian diaspora goes to the development of the host country only to a small extent.These require large-scale and long-term investments in infrastructure which can be difficult to achieve by diasporas alone. Hence, diasporas can be seen as contributing to a lesser extent to the national economy when compared to that of their communities. The growth in the Nigerian economy is mainly driven by the growth of the industrial and service sectors. In addition, banking and telecommunications services have grown significantly. Despite the growth of the economy, Nigeria has a rather backward infrastructure (Ojong, 2016). The country is not an attractor for
business, and the level of international investment is at a fairly low level. This is proved by the fact that the Nigerian diasporas have little influence on the change in the economic situation.Diasporas did play a role in the development of Nigeria as a whole to some extent. However, their effects were not significant compared to large-scale state-led projects which were often supported by FDIs. The Government of Nigeria is implementing new legislative measures aimed at encouraging FDI in the traditional form (Levitt, 2005). Thus, restrictions on investment activities leading to the creation of enterprises that are fully owned by foreign companies have been lifted. These enterprises, as a rule, are technologically better equipped and able to work more efficiently than local firms. It is this fact that
leads to an increase in national capital at the expense of foreign capital, the contributions of members of the diaspora are insignificant. Although the diaspora community may have pushed for these state-led infrastructure projects, these projects would have gone forward with or without diaspora support (Koinova & Tsourapas, 2018). This conclusion can be based on the increase in interest from international investors in Nigeria as a destination for investment. Moreover, the government’s willingness to invest heavily in infrastructure also contributes to this inference.ConclusionIn this paper, the trends and features of the development of the largest diasporas from Nigeria were identified. It was found that diasporas are heterogeneous and very difficult to study, especially in modern conditions. This paper also assessed the influence of the Nigerian diaspora on the
of representatives of the Nigerian diaspora have not become the largest component of the economies of these countries.Remittances to the homeland, which have a very high relevance in the global economy, occupy an insignificant segment of the Nigerian economy. The country’s economic growth is achieved to a much greater extent with the help of such instruments of influence as foreign direct investment. The mobilization of the diaspora for the purpose of financial assistance to the motherland has a rather low efficiency compared to other methods. In addition, the export of labor capital to other countries causes wariness among indigenous ethnic groups.
The US is considered a staunch supporter and promoter of democracy. However, some ethnic minorities, including Chinese and Native Americans, had suffered a lot from discrimination and had to fight for equal rights with white Americans. Despite all the oppression, they did not abandon their country during World War II and significantly contributed to the victory making the government and society see the need for collaboration.The major contribution of Chinese Americans to WWII was their active enlisting in the US army. According to Takaki (2020), their zealous support destroyed Japanese propaganda, which portrayed Chinese Americans as victims, and made China side with the US. Despite the dire conditions many of them lived in and white Americans’ discrimination against them, they used the war as the opportunity to prove
themselves as loyal patriots.As for the Navajo tribe, they also had reasons for being hostile towards white Americans. However, they agreed to fight as allies to protect their country and people. Their main contribution was participation in coded interaction: Americans utilized Navajo’s native language as a base for it (Takaki, 2020). Thus, a minor language, which once was forbidden and was considered inferior, became a valuable instrument of victory.It amazes me how much Chinese and Navajo Americans had suffered from discrimination, yet they fought together with white Americans for their country when the external enemy appeared. Moreover, the use of Navajo’s native language during the war is truly inspirational, as it turned the US cultural diversity into a weapon. We should not forget about this valuable experience and
such movements as Black Lives Matter shows that some non-white ethnic groups still face discrimination (Garret, 2018). Therefore, new immigrants often suffer from ethnic intolerance like their predecessors did, as their languages and cultural values are considered inferior, or they do not get the same vocational and educational opportunities.To sum up, Chinese and Navajo Americans have greatly contributed to protecting their country during WWII and proved their loyalty. Despite discrimination and oppression they had experienced from white Americans, they offered help and demonstrated the power of collaboration. The use of the native Navajo language also showed the significance of cultural diversity. These historical events gave us valuable lessons, which we should not forget.
Cardona-Hernandez, R., Schwandt, A., Alkandari, H., Bratke, H., Chobot, A., Coles, N., Corathers, S., Goksen, D., Goss, P., Imane, Z., Nagl, K., O’Riordan, S.M.P., & Jefferies, C. (2021). Glycemic outcome associated with insulin pump and glucose sensor use in children and adolescents with type 1 diabetes. Data from the international pediatric registry SWEET. Diabetes Care , 44 (5), 1176-1184. Web.The advantage of this research was that it was a large international retrospective cohort study that retrieved data from the diabetes SWEET registry. The sample size was 25,654 participants diagnosed with type 1 diabetes mellitus (T1DM) more than one year ago and used technology to control their blood glucose (Cardona-Hernandez et al., 2021). Furthermore, the settings mainly were home-based in which the participants reported to the registry; hence, the
results can be applied in a broader sense. However, the limitation of this study was the absence of time-in-range data (Cardona-Hernandez et al., 2021). Unfortunately, there were not enough people with this information to include this data into statistical analysis in the latter. The environment was controlled with the comparison group, but the authors missed randomization and blinding. Since this was an international study, the main barrier was the difference in GDP, which is a potential confounding factor. The researchers addressed this issue by implementing linear regression analysis to reveal the actual association between the parameters. Finally, the findings of this study could be implemented to reduce high HbA1c levels and DKA rates among children with T1DM by introducing wearable technology.McGill, D. E., Volkening, L. K., Butler, D.
A., Wasserman, R. M., Anderson, B. J., & Laffel, L. M. (2019). Text‐message responsiveness to blood glucose monitoring reminders is associated with HbA1c benefit in teenagers with Type 1 diabetes. Diabetic Medicine , 36 (5), 600-605. Web.This study’s strength was that it demonstrated a clear benefit of sending messages to T1DM adolescent patients to encourage glycemic control. Although the sample size was 147, which is not large, it can be easily expanded since the participants were followed not in the clinical setting (McGill et al., 2019). Two primary limitations in this research were indicated by the authors. Firstly, some patients were not followed up for the entire length of the study (McGill et al., 2019). Secondly, the authors did not include the mean number of responses (McGill et
al., 2019). It meant that this study could not provide the optimal frequency of sending reminders. Another limitation was that no control group was included, and the researchers did not mention this problem. The potential barrier was that teenagers might not have the balance to report their glucose levels, but the authors addressed this issue by supplying a $5 monthly fee for unlimited messaging (McGill et al., 2019). Notably, these payments were made during the entire length of the study to all participants. Overall, the finding of this study can be implemented to maintain normoglycemia in diabetic adolescents.Tauschmann, M., & Hovorka, R. (2018). Technology in the management of type 1 diabetes mellitus – Current status and future prospects. Nature Reviews Endocrinology , 14 (8), 464-475. Web.The most significant
paper was that it was written only by two authors, subjecting it to potential bias. Moreover, the article did not mention any conflicts of interest, which was crucial to indicate here since specific companies that produce devices for diabetic patients were mentioned. It appeared that there were no barriers in this case; thus, the authors did not address them. Finally, this comprehensive review on current and prospective technology that can improve the quality of life of patients with T1DM can be used as guidance for clinicians and researchers.
Ethnicity, culture, and religion are essential elements which to a considerable extent, shape every individual’s personality. At the same time, these elements often become a topic of difficult conversations and even sources of conflict. As a person who has faced discrimination on numerous occasions, I believe that holding conversations with people about race and cultural identity is important, and I am always willing to participate in them.I have experienced racism ever since I was about seven years old. My parents are from different cities in Yemen, and both sides of the family would sometimes have conversations with me on how their culture is better than the other. After migrating to Qatar, I encountered negative comments and assumptions about my nationality and poverty in my home country. In the United States, I faced new racist interactions, this time concerning my religion. Still, these experiences have made me grow as a person, learn, and appreciate my culture, religion, and ethnicity.Moreover, every time I am targeted by people holding negative views about me, I attempt to have a conversation with them. I do not get offended by their words because I understand that their perspectives stem from their ignorance. Therefore, I always strive to educate people and tell them about my beliefs and cultural background. As a result, I am highly skilled in such conversations and always willing to engage in them since, in the majority of cases, people actually change their attitudes, recognize their mistakes, and even apologize.
Serotonin is synthesized from the amino acid tryptophan using two processes similar to converting tyrosine to dopamine. The very first process, which generates 5-hydroxytryptophan, is mediated by tryptophan hydroxylase, which is located exclusively in serotonin-generating cells and is the rate-limiting phase (Hernández-Hernández et al., 2019). Aromatic l-amino acid decarboxylase and 5-hydroxytryptophan decarboxylase accelerate the transformation to serotonin. Serotonin synthesis starts with modifying L-tryptophan to 5-hydroxytryptophan by the enzyme L-tryptophan hydroxylase, which is identified in cytoplasmic and granular brain cell components. This enzyme is required for serotonin production in the same way as norepinephrine and dopamine production. Adrenergic and dopaminergic synapses are regulated by the activity of a comparable enzyme, L-tyrosine hydroxylase, to change L-tyrosine to L-dihydroxyphenylalanine (Hernández-Hernández et al., 2019). Certain TPH regulators, including α-propyldopacetamide, are also suppressors
Life tragedies can lead an individual to different kinds of choices. Some individuals may perceive these tragedies as warnings, while some may think of them as second chances. The difference between these two individuals is how they emerge from a tragedy. Authors, playwrights, and novelists have attempted to display this notion in different literary works, documenting how different characters cope with tragedies. Tragedies in “Hamlet” and “A Good Man Is Hard to Find” lead characters to rely on the change as a coping mechanism.“Hamlet” narrates the story of an individual dealing with a loss which leads him into a roundabout of emotions. For instance, he becomes lazy due to the grief of losing his father. Such a tragedy is enough to lead an individual to misery as they
try to make sense of life without their loved ones. In the play, Hamlet is depicted to have given up all hope in life and would not let anyone comfort him.“O, that this too, too sullied flesh would melt,Thaw, and resolve itself into a dew,Or that the Everlasting had not fixedHis canon ‘gainst self-slaughter! O God, God,How weary, stale, flat, and unprofitableSeem to me all the uses of this world!” (Shakespeare, 1599).This passage illustrates Hamlet’s state of desperation, which is attributed to his previous loss. His coping mechanism is evident in his continued mourning months after the death, which he is keen to admit that he has on him is enough to pass the show (Shakespeare, 1599). This means that he is aware of how he looks but
would not stop him from mourning. According to him, his grief is much deeper than what people might think of him. This illustrates how different people may react to a tragedy and not consider what others might think. It also shows that a tragedy might be very personal for some people than others. For instance, Hamlet’s mother has remarried, showing that the death was not that impactful for her to stop enjoying life.“A Good Man Is Hard to Find” also presents the narrative of an individual trying to cope with a tragedy. However, this tragedy is different from Hamlet’s since the character is faced with the tragedy of existence. The author says that “The gods show us how there is a need for a whole world of torment
In persons diagnosed with Parkinson’s Disease (PD) (P), how effective is bicycle exercise as physical activity (I) compared to usual care (C) help to improve the stableness or physical health of PD patients (O) when applied to a specific period (T)? The chosen article for the analysis is ‘Parkinson’s disease patients benefit from bicycling’ by Tiihonen et al. 2021.The article’s abstract starts by acknowledging PD patients’ difficulties in containing their conditions. According to Tiihonen et al. (2021), identify and mention that PD patients are adversely compromised and can hardly have stable movement on their own. Hence, the article strives to find out which bicycle exercise would best benefit persons diagnosed with PD. Moreover, the research would also determine which PD-related symptoms or conditions would improve the anticipated bicycle
exercise.The abstract introduces the reader to a systematic database literature search, both randomized control trials (RCT) and non-randomized control trials (NRCT), which are the tools used for assessing the effect of bicycle riding on PD patients. Furthermore, the abstract quantifies several sources that were analyzed to arrive at the conclusions that were made after the cohort study. It is presented that out of 202 articles researched, about 22 were found eligible studies with approximately 505 patients suffering from PD condition. Therefore, I think the information contained in this article abstract is adequate to give an overview of the research to its readers.The key issue in this article’s introduction is the goal-directed physical exercise and general physical activities that are in practice to alleviate the challenges faced by PD
patients. According to Tiihonen et al. (2021), physical and general activities have been experimentally and scientifically proven to lessen both motor and cognitive symptoms among persons diagnosed with PD. As such, exercise is a complement to standard pharmaceutical and surgical treatment of PD patients. The article further reinstated the need for diversified physical exercise forms for patients suffering from PD conditions to help improve their condition and better their lives.As presented in this article’s introduction, little or resources have been allocated to identifying noble physical activities paramount to improving patients’ needs and well-being. Bicycle riding is, therefore, one such activity that has been proposed by Tiihonen et al. (2021) to help improve PD patients’ conditions as more new forms and technologies are underway concerning therapies for persons struggling
with PD conditions.The article states that exercise-based training could enhance functional mobility by utilizing enhanced strength, endurance, balance, and flexibility that support the efficient performance of these groups. Tiihonen et al. (2021), acknowledge that there is no conclusive research that proves exercise as a full remedy for the condition but could be considered as a disease-modifying element that helps in patients’ improvements. In addition, physical activities have been found to have neuroprotective effects on the brain. This research reports that in 2010, some individuals had severe gait freezing as a result of riding bicycles (Tiihonen et al., 2021). Therefore, physical activities have potential benefits for persons diagnosed with PD conditions.According to Tiihonen et al. (2021), the research adopted a criterion for judging the eligibility of the sources they
ought to use to investigate the matter under question. First, the review was pre-registered in the International Prospective Register of Systematic Reviews. According to this study, only original reports applying quantitative measures in understanding the effects of an intervention on PD patients were rendered valid. Studies with recumbent, tandem, motorized, non-motorized, and stationary bicycle ergometers in defining bicycle exercise were also included in this research. Furthermore, studies that involve hand pedaling instead of foot pedaling were also included in this research.Studies that were unaccepted, for instance, were those in which their primary outcome had no link to the effect of bicycling on the physical health of PD patients. To gather the appropriate data, PubMed databases for biomedical literature were visited for studies from 2010 up to 2020 using
keywords such as ‘Parkinson bicycle cycling.’ Which studies were settled depending on the publishing year and author, study design and design size, quantitative measures on both pre and post-treatment, demographic characteristics of the study size, and intervention characteristics?All the studies were grouped and tested upon verifying the quality of the selected sources and validating the effect of the size of the treatment. In cases where multiple primary measures were involved, a suitable measure for analysis was chosen that best aligned the rest of the outcome true. The measure was termed functional if it enabled general movement and body mobility. Afterward, secondary measures were examined and their relationship to how bicycle cycling would influence the lives of PD patients was determined. The variables that were of interest were gait,
walking capacity, speeds, tremors, and balance.Some of the testing tools that were used in this research were the 6-minutes walking test, Parkinson’s Diseases Questionnaire 39, MDS-Unified Parkinson’s Diseases rating scale (MDS-UPDRS) II and III, and Quality-of-life. This is a quantitative research method because it involves the measurement of several variables that must be systematically analyzed to arrive at an informed conclusion regarding the matter of question.According to Tiihonen et al. (2021), the treatment period varied between 1-12 weeks. Out of the 22 used studies, a few PD patients did not report bicycle cadence. On the other hand, the majority of the studies reported cadence. The data collected and presented from this research ultimately showed that bicycle exercise is beneficial as PD patients are concerned. The study proved motor
Counseling patients with HIV/AIDS is associated with significant psychological issues. One of the primary concerns is the reaction to the diagnosis. According to Chippindale and French (2001), there is a wide range of reactions to diagnosis considered normal, as some clients may take the matter very calmly, while others will react to the diagnosis with a prolonged period of distress, anger, and anxiety. Thus, the central recommendation for human service professionals counseling clients with HIV/AIDS is to allow time for the shock of the news to sink (Chippindale & French, 2001). The period of shock may be followed by a period of emotional ventilation, which may include overt stress (Chippindale & French, 2001). Thus, the central recommendation for counselors that inform clients about their diagnosis is to stay
the time; however, the friends and family may be there just in time with the client needs psychological help the most. This will help the client to maintain an active lifestyle with minimal effect on everyday activities. It is crucial to help the client acknowledge all the stereotypes associated with the disease and understand that life goes on even after the diagnosis (Chippindale & French, 2001). Such strategies will allow stabilization of the emotional state of the client.
In the modern world, terrorism is one of the pressing threats to human health and life. Considering the events of the past century, including the first and 9/11 bombing of the World Trade Center in 1993 and 2001, United States Embassy in Beirut and Kuwait bombing, and many other attacks, the terror threat to the United States is high (Corbett et al., 2017). Therefore, it is important to apply comprehensive measures to combat terrorism.To counter terrorism, the preventive activities of state authorities and local self-government bodies must be in place. The measures should include practices to identify and subsequently avoid the causes and conditions conducive to the commission of terrorist acts (Freilich et al., 2019). Moreover, identification, disclosure, and investigation of the causes of such acts with the
Creationism is a religious dogma about the creation of the world based on the Bible. This movement is often described as an offshoot of science, and articles are passed off as scientific and peer-reviewed. However, creationism does not meet the criteria of the scientific method of knowledge – basing conclusions on facts rather than faith. A scientist can only hypothesize about some new entity if there is sufficient reason to do so that cannot be explained by the existing theory and not because of religious faith. Nevertheless, creationists are not bothered by their lack of a scientific method. In this paper, I would like to review one such article. Although it has its share of factual information, most of its arguments do not stand up to criticism. The
article “The image of God” by Genesis File seeks to disprove Darwin’s theory of evolution and prove that life on earth was created by external intelligence (2021). The author’s main arguments against evolution are the growth of molecular chaos and the scarcity of transitional forms in the annals of fossils, which supposedly contradict Darwin’s theory of evolution. In my article I will examine these arguments in sequence and highlight their main point. Then, I will use evidence-based science to refute these contentions. In conclusion, I will summarize all the deficiencies in the evidence and make recommendations on how to improve them.The first flaw in the article’s argument is that throughout the entire existence of the species homo sapiens, not a single mutation into other species has been observed.
This argument cannot be accepted as valid because it manipulates the facts. The fact is that this argument is cited as proof that an organism cannot change its form and evolve into other species on its own. It argues in favor of the fact that early organisms could not evolve from natives into amphibians and then into mammalian creatures (Genesis File, 2021). However, the author of the article does not consider that at the time of life of the first organisms, the conditions on our planet were dramatically different from those of today. Floods, droughts, and ice ages occurred. To survive, organisms had to go through massive changes. Nor should we forget that these changes took place over millions of years. However, the article’s author argues that since
none of them evolved further over the last few hundred thousand years of modern homo sapiens existence, the whole theory of evolution is flawed (Genesis File, 2021). Changes in the species occurred and are still happening, just quite slowly. For example, primitive humans had a different physique; they had a more powerful, broader, and shorter chest than modern humans (Jantsch, 2019). These changes were due to the optimization of the respiratory system, which gave humans the ability to run long distances and other types of endurance. Another argument to refute the article argues that our species has been around for a relatively short time relative to those that have undergone more striking evolution. This means that we may not yet have achieved a notable change due to lack
of time and may well be transformed into another form in the course of unceasing evolution.The second flaw in the article’s argument is that primitive organisms could never have evolved into humans. The paper justifies this by saying that a cell contains a specific genetic code and can only be subject to small adaptive changes (Genesis File, 2021). Thus, the author argues that a unicellular organism cannot evolve into a multicellular organism. Furthermore, a unicellular organism cannot develop into a multicellular organism on its own. According to the author, for more striking evolution, the intervention of an intelligent being is necessary. The example of human birth can refute this argument. Man, a complex multicellular organism with consciousness, is born from the fusion of two unicellular organisms, the male
sperm and the female testicle (Jantsch, 2019). This is an irrefutable experimental fact. As one can see, the process of human birth from unicellular microorganisms exists in nature and in no way needs divine intervention. Thus, a multicellular organism can emerge from a single-celled organism. Furthermore, when a new human being is born, evolution repeats the entire path from unicellulars to humans. Development is essentially chemically the same as the birth of a human being; the process is just greatly extended in time. This is precisely how it happened – from unicellular emerged multicellular. Another example can also illustrate this. Speciation due to acts of natural selection takes place today in a completely natural way without the slightest divine intervention. Sometimes even despite human intervention – for example,
many species of pathogenic bacteria are regularly poisoned with antibiotics. Many bacteria die, but new antibiotic-resistant bacteria emerge because of the pressure of natural selection, and not even hundreds of years have passed.Another flaw in the article’s argument is the citation of the lack of transitional forms in the annals of the fossil record as a fact in favor of the absence of evolution. Creationists believe that development has always proceeded simultaneously and assumed many transitional forms must have been (Genesis File, 2021). If there were no transitional forms, there was no evolution. To refute this argument is worth highlighting how evolution proceeded. The evolutionary transition from one species to another occurs only when natural selection is under pressure. The factor causing the stress of natural selection is
not constant, so evolutionary transitions are also discontinuous (Jantsch, 2019). As an example, consider the transition between fish and amphibians. As long as fish lived in the water and had enough food to survive there, there was no pressure of natural selection to bring them onto land in search of food. However, this selection pressure arose from the depletion of food and increased competition in the water on the one hand and the abundance of food and lack of competition on land on the other (Dror, 2020).Those fish with slightly larger fins could occasionally feed near the ground and lay eggs there. Therefore, after one generation, the descendants of this population in these conditions had slightly longer fins. In the next generation, there were even longer fins. So,
in flora and fauna. This explains the scarcity of transitional forms in the fossil record.In conclusion, while many creationist articles are considered scientific, they contain many flaws in their reasoning. The main weaknesses were manipulating facts, dismissing a critical treatment of arguments, and the lack of a theoretical basis. Consequently, the author erroneously argued that the species homo sapiens is incapable of evolution and that a single-celled organism cannot transform into a multicellular organism on its own. To improve the argument, I advise the author to read scientific articles presenting an alternative view. This will help make the ideas more comprehensive and align with current scientific evidence.
The crime of extortion requires a criminal act element and a criminal intent element. The criminal act element characteristically implies obtaining property of another by using a threat to cause harm to the victim (Nikolić et al., 2017). The threat may be related to the victim’s health (to cause bodily injury), to property (to cause some damage on the victim’s property), to the victim’s reputation (to reveal some personal information). An example is a criminal demanding a victim to pay them twenty thousand dollars, or they will spread the victim’s private photos. However, some acts including threat, may not be considered the crime of extortion if they are not accompanied with the intent to thieve.Usually, the criminal intent element required for extortion is the purpose of obtaining money
for example, as compensation. Thus, if an employee does not get the money earned and threatens the employer to cause harm in order to receive a salary, technically, it is not considered an offense of extortion. To protect oneself from being a victim of such crimes, “educational programs that address related aspects, such as cyberviolence risks, personal data protection, preservation of digital evidence, appropriate reactions to cyber threats, and incident reporting” may be helpful (Vasiu & Vasiu, 2020, p. 24). Such strategies are highlighted since, nowadays, extortion has become a widespread crime in cyberspace due to the availability of mass digital technologies.
Any change in social life patterns has the potential to impact criminal patterns. With Covid-19, while shoplifting rates have declined by 75 percent in some places throughout America, the surge of the virus has resulted in Coronavirus-related scum (Deloitte, 2020). A significant number of criminal activities has shifted, and as technology advances, some of the potential future crimes will entail surveillance. Law enforcement agencies will have challenges with legal requirements and privacy issues in operating vehicles that demand law enforcement agency compliance (Fortenbery, 2016). Law enforcement agencies will be forced to regulate surveillance when conducting data collection and item transportation operations. Another potential criminal analysis issue will be DNA testing (Fortenbery, 2016). Technology advancements have combined several existing approaches in massively parallel sequencing (MPS). With the procedure, the
Everyone has read detective stories at least once in their life or watched detective programs on TV. Sometimes it could be seen that the heroes of the works use so-called indented writings. These writings can be on the second, third, and so on pages, depending on the pressure on the writing subject, that is, a pen or pencil. Even though such records are difficult to see, the examiners still have the experience and specialized equipment to ensure that this concealment was revealed.Indented writing is invisible indentations in the sheets of paper located under the page on which the information was initially written. Indented writing can help solve a case, as it often has the information necessary for the investigation (Girard, 2017). In order to see the inscriptions, one
Fatigue is a common and debilitating symptom linked to a number of acute and chronic conditions such as chronic heart failure and acute myocardial infarction. Fatigue has not been analyzed in regards to patients with stable coronary heart disease (CHD), despite the fact that it might factor into new onsets or progression of CHD. Therefore, Eckhardt et al. (2014) decided that it was important to establish the severity of fatigue and its characteristics in a stable CHD population. There were three main purposes of the study conducted by these researchers, one of which was to describe fatigue in stable CHD patients. Moreover, Eckhardt et al. (2014) intended to determine whether certain demographic, physiological, or psychological variables were in correlation with fatigue. Finally, they aimed at identifying whether fatigue
was related to health-related quality of life.Five people are cited as the authors of the research: Ann L. Eckhardt, Holli A. DeVon, Mariann R. Piano, Catherine J. Ryan, and Julie J. Zerwic. All of them have the credentials of PhD and RN. Ann L. Eckhardt is affiliated with School of Nursing at Illinois Wesleyan University in Bloomington where she holds the position of Assistant Professor. The other four researchers are affiliated with Department of Biobehavioral Health Science, College of Nursing at University of Illinois in Chicago. Holli A. DeVon is Associate Professor, Mariann R. Piano is Professor and Department Head, Catherine J. Ryan is Clinical Assistant Professor, and Julie J. Zerwic is Professor and Executive Associate Dean there.When it comes to the operational definition of fatigue, it was
described by the researchers as the subjective feeling of extreme and constant exhaustion, weariness, and energy deprivation. Conceptually, fatigue was compared to pain on the grounds of its multidimensionality, exposure to physical and psychosocial factors, and presence of common characteristics with some mood and anxiety disorders. Moreover, it was noted that in CHD patients, fatigue is a prevalent symptom associated with weakness, reduced physical activity, and poor life quality.The study utilized a partially mixed sequential dominant status research design. According to Eckhardt et al. (2014), in their work, the main design of the study was quantitative, followed by a qualitative element. This mixed-method structure was chosen to ensure complementarity, which aims at achieving convergence of quantitative and qualitative results and providing descriptive depth with the help of qualitative
interviews. First occurred the collection of the cross-sectional quantitative data, after which participants were selected from this sample for the qualitative element. Qualitative and quantitative data were integrated at the stages of data analysis and discussion.Statistical analysis of data occurred with quantitative components; the Statistical Package for the Social Sciences was used for it. Eckhardt et al. (2014) report that a nominal alpha level of <.05 was selected for the outcomes to be statistically significant. For the analysis of demographic data and fatigue distinguished by gender, Chi-squared independence tests and independent samples t tests were utilized. The identification of factors connected to fatigue was conducted with the employment of Pearson’s correlation and Spearman’s rank correlation coefficient. Predictors of fatigue were determined with the use of multiple regression.One hundred
and two patients with stable CHD were the participants of this study. Eckhardt et al. (2014) recruited them during routine medical appointments from two cardiology clinics. One clinic mainly served urban minority patients (n = 51), and the other mainly served Caucasian patients from a small rural town (n = 51). Eligibility was decided on by the examination of medical records. Inclusion criteria involved a stable CHD diagnosis, the ability to speak and read English, and independent living. Exclusion criteria involved heart failure with reduced ejection fraction, coronary artery bypass grafting or myocardial infarction in the previous 2 months, and incurable disease with prediction to live for less than 6 months. In addition to that, patients with symptoms related to worsened or exacerbated cardiac disease, unstable angina, and
hemodialysis were excluded from participation. Such exclusion criteria were due to the elimination of patients with a recent acute episode, new or worsening CHD symptoms, and co-occurring conditions known to be related to significant fatigue. The institutional review boards of both unspecified sites approved the study, and all participants gave their written informed consent.In terms of variables, the independent ones were various demographic (gender, age, race, employment), physiological (myocardial infarction, hypertension, diabetes), and psychological (depressive symptoms) factors. The dependent variable was the correlation of fatigue interference and intensity with the independent variables. Eckhardt et al. (2014) used the term ‘variables’ in regards to the independent ones; however, there was no mention of variables being independent or dependent. One specific relationship that was being investigated by the authors of
the study was this between fatigue and depressive symptoms. Eckhardt et al. (2014) found that the occurrence of depressive symptoms was the only predictor of interference and intensity of fatigue among the potential fatigue contributors. This was a non-experimental study because it took place in real-life settings, and the researchers controlled neither the environment nor the variables. Finally, there were no interventions, which means that no changes were made in a study in order to study the outcomes.This study is relevant to the actual practice of nursing due to it providing data about fatigue in stable CHD patients, which has not been done before. Therefore, specialists are able to learn more about this phenomenon and start developing strategies to facilitate the lives of people with stable CHD struggling
In the present day, cryptocurrency attracts more and more attention of people all over the world. Regardless of not being widespread yet among community members, cryptocurrency is used by a considerable number of financial institutions and companies for its potential to influence the financial market in the future. In general, it may be defined as a virtual of digital currency secured by cryptography – that is why it cannot be double-spent or counterfeited. There are currently several cryptocurrencies, and the majority of them are decentralized networks on the basis of blockchain technologies enforced by computer networks. Cryptocurrency cannot be affected by government manipulation or interference as it is not issued by it or any central authority.The significance of this study is determined by an unknown and controversial effect
of cryptocurrency. While it is frequently regarded as a more convenient and stable alternative to traditional money, some experts state that the instability of cryptocurrency will have a devastating impact on many industries in the future (Nova, 2021). That is why the investigation and evaluation of its potential influence will be beneficial for the development of accurate strategies and preventative measures. The purpose of this paper is to examine the nature of cryptocurrency, its characteristics, and impact on the basis of literature review to answer the research question: Is cryptocurrency unstable? The answer will help to approve or reject a hypothesis that lies in the paper’s thesis statement – being a long-lasting uncontrolled bubble, cryptocurrency contributes to financial and monetary instability, a lack of investor protection, the global
The purpose of cultural criminology is to examine and describe crime and forms of crime control as cultural products. Criminality and actors in crime control are seen as creative notions that can be expressed in symbolically mediated cultural practices. Thus, subculture members, politicians, media producers, commercial organizations, and other relevant actors provide meaningful explanations for their actions. Cultural criminology considers its task the analysis of the ongoing process of interpretation, reinterpretation, and deconstruction (Wickert, 2019). The theory does not see itself as a theory of crime in a narrow sense; instead, it is a paradigm or perspective approach of crime as a phenomenon, placing significant emphasis on the importance of images, symbols, and representations of self-staging. Cultural criminology qualitative relies on the social sense drawing meanings and methods
of ethnography as well as textual and content analysis.Thus, the main point of difference between cultural criminology and other theories of crime is that it places criminality and control over it in a specific context that can be interpreted differently when viewed from varied perspectives. That is, the theory views crime and the relevant agencies and institutions of crime control as cultural products or as creative constructs. As such, corruption must be approached from the standpoint of the meanings that it carries. To facilitate an understanding of cultural criminology, it is essential to consider such ideas as crime as culture, culture as crime, the media constructions of crime control and corruption, and political dimensions of culture, crime, and cultural criminology.Crime as culture entails the characterization of deviant subcultures
as systems of symbols, which may include the style and appearance of their members, slang expressions, as well as any signs, slogans, and other methods of differentiation. In this sense, crime as culture means that individuals belong to a subculture that requires one’s capacity to construct and deconstruct the system of collective codes and practices. Besides, within the subculture that considers crime among its defining culture, symbolic communication may also often occur besides face-to-face interactions.Culture as crime is a thematic area of cultural criminology that entails the criminalization of cultural products and players. The analysis of the area depends, on the one hand, on the differentiation between the so-called high culture and, on the other hand, popular culture. Criminalizing cultural products and the various forms that it takes
mainly influences popular culture. Although, it is necessary to note several isolated examples in which criminalization also influences the products of the so-called high culture. For instance, the photographs taken by Jock Sturges and Robert Mapplethorpe were deemed pornographic despite the fact that their intention was artistic expression. On the downside, the stigmatization and criminalization predominantly affect artists that belong to social minorities and subcultures, such as black rap musicians, punk musicians, LGBTQ artists, and others.The third thematic focus area, media constructions of crime control and crime, is focused on the analysis of reciprocal action mechanisms of the judicial system and the media. Drawing from the works of Cohen and Becker, such constructs as moral panics and folk devils have been heavily covered in media. An example of
the media construction of crime and crime control pertains to the Satanic panic, a national hysteria episode that dominated the media in the 1980s (Hughes, 2016). The event involved the severe moral panic associated with more than twelve thousand unsubstantiated satanic ritual abuse cases in the 1980s in the United States (Hughes, 2016). The issue with satanic panic relates to the extreme media coverage of the alleged abuse of satanic rituals, with the information not being verified or taken from unreliable sources. Therefore, due to the relationship of dependence between media coverage and crime, especially when it comes to the determination of which crime phenomena should be covered and which should not get any attention. In the thematic area of media constructions of crime control and crime, it
is essential to consider media’s construction of crime as a product of entertainment.The thematic area of focus, which entails the political dimension of culture, crime, and cultural criminology, is concerned with the analysis of power relations in which social control, media, and crime stand. Specifically, deviant subcultures become targets of stately surveillance and control or are subject to a process of commodification. In the sense of “cultural wars,” the art establishment that includes alternative artists argues about the aesthetic value of works. However, the opponents of such art declare this alternative art a crime and take criminal justice actions against artists. The censorship that affects artists that are politically motivated provides an extreme case of the arguments regarding artistic interpretation from the hegemonic perspective. Mass media has succeeded
in focusing on the crime and social control by focusing on or ignoring specific themes. For example, there is currently a large number of a large number of TV shows (e.g., Making a Murderer, the Night Stalker, Tiger King, The Jinx, and others) in which crime is viewed from a cultural perspective. In Making a Murderer, for example, life in rural Manitowoc is depicted as full of crime due to the low quality of life and poor education levels of the population. In The Jinx, a commentary on the norm of the rich and powerful being able to get away with murder for a long time is made.Cultural criminology is distinct from the general theory of crime due to its key terms. For example, the theory gives attention
significance as appropriate to the theoretical tradition of symbolic interactionism. According to the theory, interactions are characterized by specific symbols used for expressing themselves, mainly in relationships, social objects, and situations.While cultural criminology does not claim that it is an independent and self-contained approach to exploring crime, it has been subjected to some criticism. For example, it is considered too general while the methodological approach is too arbitrary, with crimes supposedly being played down. Despite the criticism, in the current climate, especially with the increased interest of media in crime, cultural criminology provides an interface for exploring the interplay between crime and culture in modern society.
For decades, people’s perception of social equality has been intertwined with the phenomenon of paying no attention to ethnic affiliation. However, instead of embracing the idea of universal equity, this concept resulted in the explicit enablement of white supremacy. For example, celebrating equality in the US essentially meant being generalized and assimilated into the image of a Caucasian white male. Hence, while at some point, society wanted to eliminate discrimination through everyone being “the same underneath,” only ethnic, gender, and sexual minorities were forced to sacrifice their identity. The result of such assimilation is especially vivid in the case of Japanese Americans and their mass assimilation aimed at creating the model minority (Shih et al., 2019). In order to be accepted in the community, minority populations were threatened
It goes without saying that Beowulf may be regarded as one of the most prominent ancient European poems. Although its origin remains the subject of multiple discussions, the common version describes it as “a Danish poem in the Anglo-Saxon dialect” (Neidorf 847). The poem describes the glorious life and deeds of a hero, Beowulf, who was regarded as a person sent by heaven for people (Gummere line 13). Helping Hrothgar, king of the Danes, he kills the monster Grendel and his mother. Later, when he becomes the king of Danes by himself, he has to fight a dragon that terrorizes his lands. Although he follows the beast and finally slays it, Beowulf dies, being mortally wounded.From a personal perspective, this poem reflects several essential aspects of human life.
In my African-American community, caregiver roles are usually assumed by women – daughters, wives, or daughters-in-law. Women are usually responsible for helping the diseased with their daily living activities, such as dressing, washing, and cooking, while men’s duty is financial support. However, the burden of caregiving generally does not fall on a single person; rather, many members of the family may coordinate with each other in providing assistance to the sick relative.Overall, different identity characteristics determine who assumes caregiving roles. Gender is an important factor since research shows that, although men can be engaged in caregiving, women act as caregivers much more often (Bertogg & Strauss, 2020). In addition, men are more likely to remain in employment, which is why they often take up financial support, while women
assist in daily living activities (Bertogg & Strauss, 2020). Further, marital status also determines whether a person will become a caregiver. Among married individuals, caregiving is common, and when both spouses have certain health problems, the caregiving burden falls on the one who is functionally less limited (Bertogg & Strauss, 2020). Age may also affect caregiving roles as younger individuals are more likely to become caregivers for their older relatives.In the African American community, two major factors may alleviate the caregiver burden. The first factor is the high value of the family and cultural expectations about women’s roles as carers for the family. Because of culturally embedded female duties and more value placed on family needs rather than individual ones, African Americans are less burdened by caregiving (McLennon
IntroductionMost religious people often tend to display prejudice at extremely high levels. There is a significant relationship between religion and prejudice that must consider the multifaceted religion nature and the prejudice target. Religion encompasses a multifaceted moral, social, emotional, and cognitive construct (Rowatt & Al-Kire, 2021). However, cognitive and social aspects are significant dimensions that determine in-group members and the constituents of a threat in a global religious view hence the relationship between religion and prejudices. Catholicism and Islam are outlined to play a vital role in religious prejudices.CatholicismDiscrimination and racism constitute the effective forms of prejudice that the Catholic Church opposes. However, research reports that other Catholics have worked tirelessly to promote racist practices in the recent past. Following this situation, the Catholic Church has taken the
chance to acknowledge its complicity and moral shortcomings regarding such pressing issues. Since 1958, Rowatt & Al-Kire, (2021) the church has made enhanced and consistent efforts to resolve the unbecoming situation. Additionally, the church’s responses and the present mood regarding racism and discrimination, which comprise objectives of several catholic groups, were established to promote an inclusive culture and combat the ideology of racism. Pope John XXIII is renowned for affecting the Catholic Church’s changes since his induction.MuslimAccording to Rowatt & Al-Kire, (2021), there have been detectable higher levels of prejudice constantly accelerating among and within Muslims in the recent past. The Muslim community, particularly the Arabian and American Muslims, is often subjected to discrimination by their fellow Muslims, hence facing a lot of tension. These groups have constantly
been facing rejection by their religious community. Even worse, their entry to other countries has caused them much trouble and difficulties. All this results from discrimination tied to people’s attitudes towards others in the Muslim community. Several attempts to stop or reduce prejudice have not brought significant changes in this situation. Therefore, the Muslims are to blame for the increasing discrimination rate among their groups.Media’s Role in PrejudicesMedia has the power and potential to alter individual attitudes, beliefs, behaviors, and other social aspects. For some time, policy interventions have targeted and used media communications to influence and promote sexism, such as gender-based violence (Anwar et al., 2020). Media influences social norms through two effects, namely, social and individual effects. The information conveyed on media platforms creates a mutual
knowledge of a norm regarding the social effect. Further, it augments social coordination as more individuals believe in the shared information, hoping that others have accepted similar information (Anwar et al., 2020). Consequently, media information concerning norms may tend to individuals to consent with them according to the individual effect. Therefore, the social and mechanisms of the media have on changing attitudes of violence against women, although the former mechanism holds more weight.Social Identity TheoryA person’s sense of self-identification based on their membership in a group is referred to as social identity. By belonging to groups, people can develop a sense of pride and self-esteem (McLeod, 2019). Racism can stem from prejudiced perceptions amongst civilizations, and it can even lead to genocide in its most extreme forms. The
group that we belong to is called the in-group, and that we do not belong to is called the out-group (McLeod, 2019). To better understand and recognize objects, we categorize them. To comprehend the social context, we similarly categorize people. We employ social categories like black, white, Australian, Christian, Muslim, student, and bus driver because they are helpful. We can learn a lot about people by classifying them into a category, as we saw with the bus driver.In and out-groupsAppropriate behavior is defined in-group norms, but this is only achievable if you know who belongs to your group. A person can be a member of several separate groups. In the second step, social identification, we adopt the group’s identity to which we have assigned ourselves. As a result
of your affiliation with a group, your self-esteem will become entwined with group membership (Scheepers & Ellemers, 2019). Once we have classified ourselves as members of a group and established a relationship with it, we prefer to compare it to other groups. This is critical to comprehend because once two groups identify as rivals, they are forced to compete for members to retain their self-esteem. Competitiveness and hostility between groups occur due to clashing identities and resource competition.Effects of prejudiceWhen others underestimate people, their personality decreases, and they stop developing themselves; prejudice helps them feel less than entirely human. It frequently leads to bullying and other forms of prejudice because it fosters a dread of what could transpire at any time and of what the future may contain.
This can lead to an individual taking their personal life in difficult situations, in worst scenarios, murder. Individuals and entire groups might feel very vulnerable, afraid, and unworthy due to racism and discrimination.How Stereotype Threat is CriticalWhen people are aware of a negative stereotype about their group, they are often concerned that their performance on a task would confirm other people’s perceptions of their group. The phrase “stereotype danger” is used by psychologists to describe the state in which people are concerned about confirming a group stereotype (Meuleman et al., 2019). For those subjected to stereotype threat, it can be uncomfortable and distracting. This phenomenon is assumed to be situation-specific, with people only experiencing it when exposed to a negative stereotype about their group. Stereotype research supports research
on microaggressions and bias in higher education, and it aids in better understanding underrepresented groups’ experiences (Liu et al., 2021). In other words, women may prefer to take classes in other fields to escape the stereotype threat they face in math classes.Real-World Problem and the Impact It Has on SocietyClimate change will get a significant impact on our student’s lives, and there will not be a single issue that has a more significant influence on them than this one. They understand that this is a serious issue that will affect nearly everything, including weather, rising seas, food and nutrition security, water quality, air quality, environmental sustainability, and much more (Gougis, 2020). Food insecurity is exacerbated by differences in socioeconomic factors, growth opportunities, housing, security, support services, and other
variables. And, with 13 million young people living in food-insecure households, practically everyone knows someone hungry regularly (Gougis, 2020). Given the current events sweeping the country, violence is unavoidable; granted, they are politically motivated, but young people are disproportionately affected. People can learn how to promote, coordinate, advertise, and ask for help. They can also learn that this is a complicated problem with many possible causes and, perhaps most importantly, there is hope for progress (Meuleman et al., 2019). Sustainability is a global issue that encompasses it all from energy to nourishment to resources, commerce, health, and so well.Strategies on How we can Decrease Prejudice Level in AmericaLearn about your neighborhood, including what groups live there, what their interactions are like, and what occurrences have occurred in the
IntroductionThere has been significant evolution in the advertising industry from traditional advertising methods such as newspapers, print media, and television to digital advertising based on the internet.Therefore, advertising research has moved from considering consumers as passive to interact-ability, where consumers are active. This has been caused by a shift in the consumption habits of consumers. There has been a massive advertisement transfer from offline to online sources in the last few decades. With the new advancements in the advertising industry, innovations are occurring each year. It has created a large pool of advertising strategies leaving marketers with many challenges, including choosing the most effective method to reach their target audience. This study aims to highlight the problems of advertising by identifying the causes, finding solutions, and evaluating the
effectiveness of the solutions.The Main Problems of AdvertisingBudget LimitsOne of the advertising problems is the budget limits of various companies and businesses.Unless for multinationals and other high-revenue businesses that have big budgets, smaller-entities have limited advertising budgets restricting their advertisements. Most businesses ensure they give the most amounts possible, hoping their consumers will notice their efforts (Moorman, Soli, and Cardoso, 2022). However, to achieve this effectively, one must find the correct audience, strategies, and platform in order to make the most of your limited resources. (Reinartz and Saffert, 2013). When businesses begin with a too-limited budget, they risk ending their advertising efforts without being noticed, while those who risk too much may lose their money (Moorman, Soli, and Cardoso, 2022). Therefore, not having the right budget is one
of the most common problems facing companies, especially in their early development stages.Choosing the Right MethodAnother problem of advertisement that has come up is choosing the right method.For a marketer to choose the right method, they must consider the target audience and how they can easily reach them. This process may involve having to do a trial test until the right advertising method is found. In some cases, they may be forced to combine two or more methods, which may involve both digital and traditional channels, making it even harder. This shows that choosing the right method of advertising is a major problem.Compelling ContentThe other problem that is facing advertising has compelling content.The challenge for marketers is to create a message and transform it into something that either
sounds or appears different (Koob, 2021, p. 7). Sometimes the consumers may be interested in the characters of the advert and not see the main message; therefore, it is important to ensure that the message is directly linked to the characters, color, voice, and sometimes even the advertising channel (Sinclair, 2019). Thus, creating a compelling advertising message has become a significant challenge for marketers.Measuring EffectivenessThe next problem with advertising is measuring the effectiveness of the adverts.Nevertheless, determining the success of a marketing campaign is one of the most difficult aspects of advertising (Mafael et al., 2021, p. 5). This problem worsens when a company has different adverts; therefore not easy to determine the effectiveness of each method. Running advertisements that do not have much returns for a business
is expensive since advertising is quite expensive (Mafael et al., 2021, p. 7). For instance, a company could waste much money running YouTube ads for its audience only to find out a simple outdoor poster was enough to achieve its marketing purposes. This shows that measuring an advert’s effectiveness is a real problem; if not well done, a company may lose money in irrelevant adverts.Rising through the CompetitionThe final problem of advertising is making it through stiff competition. It is very challenging for companies with limited resources to keep up with competition levels (Akbar et al., 2021).These big companies have well-thought marketing strategies, but that does not mean that smaller businesses cannot beat them in the competition (Akbar et al., 2021). Advertising is a competitive business; thus, businesses
and entrepreneurs should find out how to ensure they are competitive in the market (Akbar et al., 2021). Thus, beating the competition implies that the advertisement will get a good amount of attention; hence positive returns in terms of sending the message out.Solutions and Evaluation of EffectivenessIn solving the problem of a limited budget, businesses or entrepreneurs need to ensure that they keep their marketing goals clear and concise.A business entity should enlist all the costs required to carry out the business and prioritize the most impactful ones (Eyada and Milla, 2020, p. 67). In addition, they should divide the budget into weekly, monthly, semi-annually, or annually to ensure that they keep track of the advertisements and their returns. To measure the effectiveness of this strategy, the business
should conduct tests and tweak the campaigns. This will help them to identify if the allocated budget is enough for the advertisement and if it is effective in reaching the goals. If the budget is not enough for the ad, the business can change some strategies to make it more practical such as eliminating unbeneficial channels (Moorman, Ryan, and Tavassoli, 2022). In addition, the tweaks on the advertisement will help ensure that it aligns with the primary goals set for the business. If the budget is still too high or too low, the company can re-evaluate the set priorities to determine which are best aligned with the company goals.Solution to Compelling ContentCompelling content is essential in ensuring that an advertisement meets its objectives. Therefore, an ad needs to
craft the right message for its audience.This process begins with identifying the target audience, the most effective channel to reach them, what they want to hear and what they need to know about the advertisement (Hsu, 2019). Marketers must create new sales pitches because the target audience is already used to the commonly used pitches, such as “limited products for a limited time.” In addition, consumers have increased their research capabilities and researched different adverts before purchasing (Eyada and Milla, 2020, p. 70). Therefore, the advertisement should ensure that it earns the audience’s trust by aligning its content with its core values (Eyada and Milla, 2020, p. 71). When creating digital advertisements, it is essential to ensure that the person used in the advert represents the culture and
values of the brand (Eyada and Milla, 2020, p. 71). This step is essential in enhancing trust and creating compelling content for the audience.A well adversed content implies that consumers will likely invest in the advertised product, even if it is just for trial purposes (Hsu, 2019). Secondly, the advert should connect with the target audience (Eyada and Milla, 2020, p. 73). An advert is not made for everyone but only the target audience; therefore, a good, compelling advert should connect well with the target audience by using suitable language, colors, sound pitch, and influencers. When an advert is compelling to the target audience, it plays a key role in ensuring that the message that is being passed to the consumer is received positively.How to Choose the Right
MethodChoosing the right method to advertise a business entity plays a significant role in determining the people who will receive the message.The first step in selecting the correct method is checking where its competitors advertise (Moorman, Ryan, and Tavassoli, 2022). Although not much information can be gained from this, it is important to note that many consumers like to go where they can find a lot of adverts. For example, if a customer is looking for a job, they are likely to visit websites that offer job opportunities, such as Indeed.com (Pavlovskaya et al., 2021). The next step would be identifying prospective consumers and conducting pinpoint advertising. This is whereby the business identifies its products’ specific consumers and the most effective channel based on their gender, age, size,
should ensure that they set a tracking system for their advertising methods and determine if they are working towards their goals (Danaher et al., 2020, p. 4). Effective tracking makes it easier to see the methods that are doing good and those that are doing badly in terms of advertisements.ConclusionAdvertising is essential; for attracting and retaining customers in a business. This is why many companies spend billions on advertising so that they can ensure they update their consumers about their products.This study has identified problems associated with advertising which include budget limits, compelling content, choosing the right method, measuring effectiveness, and rising through the competition.

IntroductionThis paper is based on “Case study Ista: Digging deep into CVC’s long-term investment.” The case notes that with roots dating back to 1902, the Ista group (Ista) has grown to become one of the world’s top producers of energy management services (Schaab & Frère, 2019). The company operates in 24 countries, employs around 5,500 people, and produced €881.1 million in sales in 2017, with 43 percent earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization (EBITDA) margin (Schaab & Frère, 2019). This discussion critically evaluates the benefits of the long-term investment to CVC Capital Partners (CVC) and Ista based on the case study. This paper also analyzes the changes in CVC’s revenues and EBITDA during the investment phase, examining the impact of the level of liabilities and interest payment
obligations during each new transaction financing. The discussion concludes by proposing relevant recommendations to ensure a better financial position for the company.Benefits of the Long-Term InvestmentOffers Opportunity for Structured NegotiationsThe long-term investment seems to have allowed CVC and Ista to develop structured negotiations to benefit the companies. For instance, the case notes that in 2004, the corporation experienced further strategic readjustments reverted to its original name of Ista, and various responsibilities were transferred to the direct holding company for efficiency (Schaab & Frère, 2019). In the new structure, Ista International GmbH assumed responsibility for the group’s human resources and corporate finance functions, allowing Ista Deutschland GmbH to concentrate on sales and service. Meter Holding Corporation S.A. and Meter Service Corporation S.à r.l. were disengaged entirely from operating, significantly
improving overall efficiencies (Schaab & Frère, 2019). Such inter-organizational negations are critical in diversifying a company’s relationships in the market.Fostering Functional Business RelationshipProlonged exposure to specific business environments also helped establish the most effective coordination within a company. In the case study, CVC and ista seem to have benefited from the long-term investments initiatives through the informed organizational structure and company procedures (Schaab & Frère, 2019). The case study notes that CVC held shares in ista for 14 years. CVC’s long-term involvement seems to have achieved deal values and ideas that influenced Ista’s financials, strategy, and competitive positioning.The case study’s examination of the total transaction contract conditions also reveals a functional relationship between CVC and administration. For instance, Meter Holding Corporation S.A. issued common stock and approved the
issuance of convertible redeemable preferred equity securities transferable into common stock (Schaab & Frère, 2019). Ordinary shareholders were allowed to contribute proportionately to the permitted capital, minimizing diluting impacts on management (Surasmi et al., 2019). CVC obtained pre-emptive privileges to manage shares, a threshold of one out of every three executive positions, and a baseline of three out of every five seats on the shareholders’ council, along with the nomination of the committee’s president. Such opportunities ensure established structures in the interest of the business.Low-Cost Trading Fees and CommissionsSome of the apparent needs for CVC and Ista seem to be the continuation of operations at optimum EBITDA. The long-term investment directly impacted the value in business negotiations that could have been influenced by the access to decision-making privileges.
For instance, Ista Luxemburg GmbH was valued at around €6.2 billion (Schaab & Frère, 2019). The venture capitalist paid €3.7 billion for the company’s share capital and granted preferred ownership certifications, the latter of which is worth around €748 million, including delayed interest charges (Schaab & Frère, 2019). The transaction is relatively fair considering the states at the company (Surasmi et al., 2019). In the case study, the debt capital is estimated to be valued at about €2.5 billion. The group repaid all outstanding debt funds contracts and entered into new senior financings totaling €1.950 million at borrowing costs ranging from 0.85 percent to 1.10 percent plus the Euro Interbank Offered Rate (EURIBOR) (Schaab & Frère, 2019). There is a clear cost-benefit in such negotiation on cost commitments.Better
Long-Term ReturnsThe long-term investments may have also influenced the overall returns positively. The positive correlation is illustrated in the case, noting that CVC used the same share class structure as in the second transaction, as revealed by examining the official documentation. The negotiations seem to have ensured that share classes A to E got preferential dividends and buyback or cancellation proceeds. In contrast, classes F to J earned the profitability allocation’s remaining values (Schaab & Frère, 2019). The balance ensures distributed investment and security for both the stakeholders and the management.The connection between shareholders was more equitable in the share balance transaction. The case highlights that while CVC and Canada Pension Plan invested over 98 percent of their capital in preferential share classes, managers could devote approximately 92
percent of their capital to preferred investment options, compared to 40.2 percent in the prior transaction (Schaab & Frère, 2019). Such flexibility seems to have been established with prolonged exposure to the negotiation environment. The timeframe also influenced CVC’s action of shortening the contractual terms, mainly for the advantage of management, except for a strengthened share transfer provision. Consequently, any share transfer required CVC’s prior authorization guaranteeing control and relevance with prospects of a better return on investment.Gives Money More Growth TimeframeThe prolonged timeframe also allowed for the desired non-public sale of the company. The case study points out that Charterhouse began the tender process for Ista in December 2012, after over six years of project lifetime (Schaab & Frère, 2019). The reduced time constraints typically influence the
sales approach (Dyahrini et al., 2021). The case study notes that although an initial public offering was a viable exit strategy, the shareholders chose a private sale. Since the company’s liabilities increased again, the equity worth stood at around €830 million, excluding the approximately €770 million convertible preferred stock securities and investor loans (Schaab & Frère, 2019). The comparative revenue shifts seem to contribute to CVC’s revenues and EBITDA and imply growth in quality of negotiations over time as one of the benefits of the long-term investment strategy.Changes in CVC’s Revenues and EBITDAThe opportunities that came with the long-term investment improved the revenue prospects and EBITDA of the company. The case study demonstrates how CVCs maintained constant revenue and EBITDA growth, increased employment, and created a corporate governance
structure throughout the investment period. Additionally, it made reasonable globalization efforts and industry sector expansion choices based on evolving laws and solid top-level management support (Prasanna et al., 2019). The use of Luxembourgian corporations to structure transactions is standard procedure in the sector. The contractual arrangements between the investors showed that CVC sought a more functional relationship with minority owners than Charterhouse’s principal business is the sub-metering of tenants’ thermal energy and water use in multi-tenant properties. Such technical readjustment in service delivery seems to have contributed to CVC’s revenue and EBITDA growth.CVC’s Diversification of ServiceSimilarly, the innovation around service delivery and merger with other institutions improved the stability in revenue streams contributing to a jump in revenue prospects. The case study recognizes that the solution facilitated building
owners and operators to distribute resulting energy and water bills based on individual use during the investment phase. Additionally, the firm offers additional services such as hardware distribution, assembly, commissioning, and refinancing. The relatively broad scope of service contributed to the improved revenue and EBITDA necessary for growth.Productive Investment PhaseCVC’s strategic investment also emerges as a booster in the revenue status and profitability prospects. For instance, Exhibit 6 illustrates the revenue growth throughout the investment period in the case study. Ista’s overall business performance is strong, with a compound annual growth rate CAGR of 4.80 percent and moderate growth volatility (Schaab & Frère, 2019). The case study notes that the firm’s EBITDA is growing at an even faster rate of 7.94 percent (Schaab & Frère, 2019). Additionally, the
EBITDA margin was around 43% of sales in 2017, which is certainly a compelling case for an investment (Schaab & Frère, 2019). The changes in CVC’s Revenues and EBITDA tend to depend on the nature of investments and acquisitions directly.Access to Reliable Human ResourceThe quality of staff within the company also emerges as an important area of focus for the company’s revenue and EBITDA growth prospects. In the case study, Exhibit 8 illustrates that the organization hired over 1,700 more employees between the beginning and the conclusion of the investment periods (Schaab & Frère, 2019). Such improvement in access to human resource signal growth. The improvements are also evident, considering that several functional groups in companies with subsidiary relations and special interests were maintained practically unchanged. Referencing these
advancements to the more than doubling sales and considerably expanded EBITDA margins indicates the efficiency advantages throughout the investment period. From an organizational labor perspective, the efficiency improvements might also be regarded adversely, depending upon the prospective rise in workload for the organization’s workers (Yusoff et al., 2020). Despite the potential concerns over workload, the demand for more resources signifies that the revenue could sustain the operations.Impact of the Level of Liabilities and Interest Payment ObligationsThe constraints in CVC’s attempt to optimize revenues and EBITDA could also be linked to the slow market growth for the company’s offers. One potential reason for the limited development of client base, household, and meter numbers is Ista’s international market penetration strategy that is complicated by the liabilities within the company. For
instance, the case study notes that in 2003, the company operated in 23 markets, but in 2017, it operated in 24 markets (Schaab & Frère, 2019). This perspective, nevertheless, does not take into account the significant changes that have occurred in the interim.Limitation in Demand and Revenue DiversificationIn 2010, the company established new affiliates in China, Turkey, and the United Arab Emirates, but market penetration has several limitations. The case study notes that Ista has re-entered the Croatian and Swedish markets following temporary withdrawals. In improving the cost and investment benefits, the management ended business operations in Bulgaria in 2014, Finland in 2009, and the United States of America in 2014 (Schaab & Frère, 2019). The case study highlights that after entering the Brazilian market in 2006, the
company chose to cease operations entirely in 2016, effectively ending the company’s operations in the Americas (Schaab & Frère, 2019). Such dynamics seem to limit the company’s effort towards profitability.Relevant RecommendationsTo ensure a better financial position, it is recommended that insta continues with formulating appropriate internal and external regulations that would position the company for better revenue opportunities. The case study demonstrates how the firm has previously implemented voluntary corporate governance mechanisms during the establishment stage. For instance, in 2009, the administration decided to form a sustainable development council to oversee the development and implementation of the group’s guidelines (Schaab & Frère, 2019). In 2010, the committee established a foundation for sustainable business practices for suppliers and staff and began producing an annual sustainability strategy. At the very
Supply chains can be highly vulnerable to hacking and malware attacks and, depending on the attacker’s motivation, are susceptible to actions aimed at stealing large amounts of money and disrupting business. Yeniyurt and Carnovale (2021) note that cybercriminals are unwilling to slow down the growth of cyber threats and invent new ways to steal information from individuals and organizations of all sizes. The most common cyber risks in supply chain management include data breaches, supply chain disruption, and malware attacks. Data breaches can occur through external and internal intruders. Employees, hackers, malicious competitors, and managers can leak sensitive data and personal information outside the business. Supply chain disruption occurs when a hacker or attacker breaks into an operating system or network without permission. The goal of penetration is
to create havoc on the system by deleting, replicating, and corrupting data. Malware attacks can occur with the help of ransomware that blocks the computer until the company pays a certain amount of money.One of the cyberattack tools is sending a phishing email in order to obtain information. Ghadge et al. (2020) assert that clicking on a link in an email may result in data corruption and loss. If the phishing email is successful, the company can find the username and password used externally to collect information on the system. It can lead to unforeseen competition and serious leaks that could harm the entire corporation.The sophistication of attacks and the complexity of modern IT, using such technologies as virtualization, mobile, and cloud computing, are forcing companies to improve
the protection of their information and apply defense-in-depth technologies. According to Gaudenzi and Siciliano (2018), to successfully address cyber risks, a serious cyber and IT risk management strategy is needed that considers various corporate functions. High IT security standards for networks, software, and mobile devices, staff awareness training, ongoing process optimization, and strict access rights management and guidelines help to combat the above cyber risks. In turn, cyber risk insurance is becoming a major factor in IT risk management for many companies to manage residual risks.A cyber-attack on a company’s supply chain is not only a short-term problem, but it also has medium and long-term consequences. First, cyber-attacks lead to the loss of external information. Cybercriminals obtain information belonging to the platform’s users, which is supposed to be
Cystic Fibrosis Pathophysiology and EtiologyCystic Fibrosis (CF) is a genetic disorder that causes various digestion and breathing issues. Precisely, CF occurs due to a metamorphosis in the CF transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) gene. The gene produces the CFTR protein, which regulates the sodium and chloride ions movement across the epithelial cell membranes (Bowden & Greenberg, 2014). The mutations in a single or both replicas of the genetic factor make the ion conveyance unreliable and form a buildup of dense mucus in the whole body. The deformities serve as the basis of respiratory deficiency and other systemic anomalies and obstructions (Brown et al., 2017). Hence, people with CF have thick and sticky mucus that clocks their airways and causes lung damage, traps germs, increases the prevalence of infections, and
prevents the entry of vital proteins into the intestines.CF Clinical Manifestations 1. Decreased appetite 2. Fatigue 3. Increased cough 4. Reduced spirometry values 5. Poor response to outpatient treatment measures 6. Hemoptysis (Bowden & Greenberg, 2014). 7. Recurrent wheezing 8. Infertility 9. Biliary cirrhosis10. Abdominal distension (Brown et al., 2017).Interdisciplinary Approach to CF TreatmentThe care of CF patients requires the coordination of different treatment measures and the integration of psychosocial counseling and management in medical treatment. Bowden and Greenberg (2014) describe CF as a complex disease that requires specialized care and treatment. Hence, although pediatric pulmonologists remain the prominent directors of CF centers, the institutions need other specialists like endocrinologists, specialists of infectious diseases, gastroenterologists, and geneticists (Bowden & Greenberg, 2014). Besides, additional team members like medical social
workers, physical therapists, advanced practice nurses, dieticians, genetic counselors, child life specialists, and physical therapists. Integration of interdisciplinary interventions is a sure way to treat CF effectively.Nursing Care Responsibilities in Cystic Fibrosis TreatmentNurses mainly assume major roles of stressing the importance of adequate dietary and fluid intake, maintaining adequate oxygenation, encouraging measures to remove pulmonary secretions, preventing complications, and ensuring good nutrition. Besides, the nurses also engage in the monitoring of essential changes in respiratory status and heart rate. According to Bowden and Greenberg (2014), nurses help offer follow-up services, emotional care, and response coordination to therapies. These services intend to support the CF patients to manage the disease effectively.Response to First PostThe student does an incredible job addressing all the relevant questions. I agree with the post’s
IntroductionThe author addresses the evolution of filmmaking from the early years to the 21st century. The argument is on how information technology has transformed the way viewers experience narratives and images while watching different movies. Advancement in technology gives the spectators powers to control both the image and storylines with an unexpected pleasures such that the viewers are lost in the film and experience the episodes as their own (Sobchack). The author postulates that with the integration of technology into filmmaking, viewers have new ways of experiencing the images of the cinema. Additionally, the hidden stillness of the movies comes to light making it visible and accessible. The computer system has made it possible for anyone to understand the individual frame and the film’s kept secrets easily, accurately,
and effectively.The angle of approachThis book is a historical exploration of the role new media technology is giving to old cinemas by re-evaluating the history of films and their usefulness. New technologies give the viewers the ability to control both the image and story (Sobchack). Viewers are capable of repeating the episodes, they can do slow motions on sections of the film, and even free-frame the film (Mulvey, 147). This adventure makes spectators have an excessive and irrational devotion or commitment to continue watching. Further, the capacity of the viewers to manipulate the film images gives the cinema materials some aesthetic traits.Evaluating the breadth or scope of the argumentAlthough this book is talking about the film industry, the author’s narration of cinema’s psychic and social aspects of life
covers the events and discoveries prominent with the twentieth all through to the twenty-first century. During this period of time, several ways of doing things or systems changed into new ways because of computer technology (Grant). Many fields, disciplines, socialization, and human interactions started embracing information technology. The film industry was not left behind and the cinemas began integrating new technology. The book covers the aspects of classic visual pleasure and narrative film enabled by the digital spectrum which opens up other viewing positions of cinemas. The narrative captures the history of cinema indicating the “death” of traditional movies onto the birth of digital age films.There are case studies that have reinforced the argument that technology has revolutionized the film industry. For instance, about fifty years back, filmmakers
had to assemble a full crew to be able to record movies; in cases where they needed aerial shots, they had to use aircraft mounted with cameras that were even heavier. Once the filming was over, editing was done physically by cutting and pasting the film together (“The Impact of Technology in the Film Industry”). The process was long and difficult and the quality of work was very poor. Technology took over in the late 20th century with the introduction of lighter cameras which capture clear and quality images. The synchronization of clouds has made editing of films much easier to an extent that filmmakers can work in collaboration from any part of the world. For the viewers it’s no longer a must they go to the theatre
to watch movies because on-demand, streaming services, computers, tablets, and smartphones have allowed them to watch the movies whenever and wherever they wish.Technology is used effectively in filmmaking through computer-generated graphics to produce special effects in the cinema business. This method is cheaper than the physical techniques because it employs computer software instead of creating physical settings to generate images. For example, in 1973, ‘Westworld’ film was created using computer-generated pictures (Sharma). This fictional movie included both robots and real people; other cases are like the iconic film ‘Star Wars’ and ‘Star Trek II’ which had effects such as laser weapons and robotic motions. Then there is also the use of animation and three-dimensional (3D).The connections the author draws across ideas and evidence presentedIn this book, the author
draws several ideas linking the past and the present to demonstrate changes over time. In the introduction the book explains the technological advances between the 1970s all through to early 2000s; that in the 70s the films were always seen in rooms and were projected on frames. Then to the current changes dark spaces to self-directed viewing on DVDs or videos. Further, in old days the films were characterized by delays which technology has replaced with aspects like creating slow motions, editing, and freeze-frame which gives the viewer an excellent experience (Mulvey, 144). In chapter 1 of the book, “Passing Time,” there is a clear explanation about the relationship between past or early cinema and the new technological age films. It comes out that technology makes it possible
for the 21st-century viewer to be able to use imitation of an indexical image. To get the feeling of a similar stake of wonders like those who viewed the same cinema before technology integration.Strengths of the argumentComparing the stillness and technology in relation to the evolution of cinemas, the modern concept of films transformed the movie adventure by creating delays which makes it easy for spectators to evaluate the film. Now the digital mechanisms work on the films by delaying the movements, it is also capable of fragmenting the movie and even rewinding the film (Thompson). Meaning technology has total a new paradigm in the film industry by a new way to pause, initiate delays, and repetitions that were not applicable to projectors. In addition, the ability to
pause the film can span the viewers into a position from which they can distinguish the indexicality of the image and its historical nature (Thompson). This mechanism is very important for analyzing politics and using the film to help close the gap especially in the modern-day world which tends to focus on things happening at present.Weaknesses of the argumentThe aspect of stillness and the moving image places the film actors within a context of unnatural fusion between the human body and the machine. The power to control the flow of the cinema through constants stops in between, creating delays and replaying the movie several times, could lead to spectators being too possessive. Technology has given the viewers’ power to dominant the film actors (Thompson). They develop an excessive
attachment to the image that was once only possible with the help of external assistance such as production stills or calendar images. Another weakness of the technological argument is a case example of television programs, which enhances the stillness of films by fragmenting the whole film into several episodes which can be viewed over several periods of months.ConclusionsThis book is a historical exploration of the role new media technology is giving to old cinemas as it re-evaluates the history of films and their usefulness. The author’s narration of cinema’s psychic and social aspects of life covers the events and discoveries prominent with the twentieth all through to the twenty-first century.

the image and its historical nature. However, the power to control the flow of the cinema through constants stops in between, creating delays and replaying the movie several times, could lead to spectators being too possessive. Additionally, technology has given the viewers’ power to dominate the film actors. Lastly, technology makes the audience develop an excessive attachment to the image that was once only possible with the help of external assistance such as production stills or calendar images.
In Looking for Alaska, John Green presents one of the most outstanding coming-of-age novels that explore profound existential questions about life, death, and the meaning of life. Green creates witty, well-drawn characters, full of individual quirks — to whom he affords the privilege of finding closure on their terms instead of resorting to the rather elusive happily ever after. In the book, the theme of death features prominently, and much of the plot is based on its events. Death shapes the lives of various characters, such as the protagonists, Miles, and Alaska. Alaska embodies the very nature through which death can change an individual’s life trajectory, as illustrated by her encounter with her mother’s death, and in more literal terms, by her death.Popular critique of the novel emphasizes
the inevitability of death, and how despite the starkness of this reality, people can never really come to terms with death. However, in this essay, a different contention is taken. While the importance of death in the book is fully appreciated, this essay argues for Green using death as a means rather than an end. Death is used as a sort of midpoint, a signaler towards more urgent thematic preoccupations of this text: how to live and die. In addition, it shall be argued that the mediating process between how to live and how to die is another process in itself of finding the meaning of life.Death plays an instrumental role in this story, not only as a philosophical musing by the author and the characters but also
as a midpoint that effectively separates the story into before and after. Death moves the story as much as it moves the readers in the way it propels the characters’ actions. The first death in the story, and arguably one from which much of the action is premised or proceeds, is Alaska’s mother’s death. Alaska witnessed this death and failed to act at that critical moment, something she eternally felt guilty about throughout the rest of the story. Thoyyibah asserts that through this encounter, Alaska was burdened with self-blame, as she watched her mother dying on the floor, yet did not attempt to help her in any way, and instead resorts to screaming and crying (34). This self-blame was exacerbated by the fact that her father seemed to
blame her for her mother’s death, and she thought he was justified so, “…so I just sat there on the floor with her until my dad came home an hour later and he’s screaming ‘Why didn’t you call 911?’” (Green 120). Alaska’s disposition throughout the story can be attributed to this feeling of guilt.The death of Alaska’s mother and the circumstances of her death changes Alaska completely, not only just her but the discourse of the life of those close to her. Thoyiba cites this event as the significant childhood trauma that shaped Alaska’s characterization as a coping mechanism (1). It influences her worldview, especially on the process of living. Alaska takes on a nihilistic approach to life as evidenced by her interpretation of the metaphor of labyrinth
“… It’s not life or death, the labyrinth. /Um, okay. So what is it? /Suffering,” she said. “Doing wrong and having wrong things happen to you. That’s the problem…” (Green 52). Her death, whether it was suicide or an accident, resulted from this impulsive worldview.The death of Alaska was the midpoint of the stories of various characters in the book and both literal and metaphorical senses of the word. In the literal sense, since Alaska’s death reinforces the storyline, the first part of the book traces the events of her life, and the second, the aftermath of her death. In the metaphorical sense, death serves to cause a remarked change in the other characters and fuels the processes of living and finding the meaning of life. In addition,
the reader benefits from this event’s lessons on the continuation of life after grief and the hope of overcoming sorrow (Logara 12). One of the most immediate changes in Alaska’s death effects is in leading other characters to introspect about the nature of death. Takumi and Miles have a candid discussion in which they seem to concur on death being natural, despite a certain sense of dread permeating their conversation. Takumi contends, “It’s natural. I mean, it must be natural” (Green 253). To this, Miles expresses to have given it earlier thought, asserting that despite its goriness, death was universal.Apart from introspection on life and death, another effect that strongly comes out is the unbridled guilt that grasps those near Alaska. For one reason or the other, many
characters felt they could have somehow prevented this death. In particular, the feeling of guilt drives Miles to investigate whether the death was a suicide—a process through which Miles ends up discovering a lot about himself. A new part of him filled with love, grief, regret, sadness, and bitterness gets revealed, and by this Miles gains a more profound understanding of himself by experiencing all these thoughts and feelings.Despite death occupying a central role as a dominant theme in the book, it is inextricably tied to life and hope on the one hand and how to die on the other one. In the frequently asked questions page of his website, Green tackles this concern by properly contextualizing the role of death in this story. Green asserts that characters
conventionally die in literature at the beginning or end. However, the book’s major death (that of Alaska) happens in the middle as he intended the readers to meet and get attached to Alaska and then lose her (“Looking For Alaska FAQ — John Green”). This, he says, would enable them to follow Pudge and Colonel make and the rest of the characters make in finding healing. Through journey would allow the readers to fight off nihilism that could accompany such loss and feelings of pointlessness and find hope amidst unresolved and unresolvable grief. Although an author’s interpretation of their text is in no way superior to a reader’s, a fact Green accedes to, these remarks by the author go a long way in supporting this essay’s thesis.This essay
contends that despite the instrumental role death plays in the text, it is merely meditating. The profoundness of death provides appropriate fodder for dialogue about other life’s phenomena. This is precisely how Green uses death in the novel. For instance, readers are opened to a discussion over profound societal concerns through the death of Alaska’s mother and the subsequent procession of Alaska. For example, Dunder subjects the book to postfeminist theory analysis and feminist criticism in her study. She posits that Alaska is a “Manic Pixie Dream Girls” character that perpetuates stereotypical gender roles and, in effect helps to preserve a glorified image of the muse (1). For example, Dunder cites Green’s representation of Alaska’s body through Miles’s distraction by her “sizeable cleavage” (p 53). This, she says,
was Green choosing a stereotypical representation of female traits in conformity with the patriarchy and society by depicting Alaska as hot or pretty in the eyes of Miles.Such analysis as Dunder’s became so rampant, creating a dialogue among the readers and the general public that the novel remains the most challenging novel of 2015 under the young adult category. The main concerns that occasioned a ban on the book include issues on sex and language, especially a description of oral sex performed on Miles (Coles). However, the contention surrounding the scene is not this essay’s preoccupation. Instead, such conversations that arose from the culmination of the death of a character underscore the relevance of the role death played in the text.In addition, the ephemerality of the role of
death in the text is epitomized by the renewed vigor Alaska’s death sparked in the several characters towards defining how to live or die. Alaska’s death stops time, especially for Miles, who splits events into a before and after Alaska’s death timeline. For Miles, reality only exists within two-time intervals, and the death demonstrates his love for Alaska, a girl he could never be with (Hatmoko 2). Alaska’s death Miles and his best friends are on a whole new mission, to investigate what happened if the death was Alaska’s final step towards escaping the labyrinth.The novel is set in motion by two great philosophical pursuits by Miles and Alaska. The first pursuit is Miles’s search for “the great perhaps,” while the second is Alaska’s conviction in the “labyrinth.”
The story is effectively set in motion by Miles’s decision to ask his parents to send him away for his junior year in Florida. He explains his decision as his way of seeking the great perhaps, quoting 15th-century French writer Francois Rabelais. While Miles interprets Rabelais’s quote as living rather than dying, initially, in seeking the great perhaps, Rabelais referred to the mystery surrounding what awaited him after death (Kinser 34). In this phrase, Miles intertwines the concepts of life and death, objectively setting the ground for the novel’s central theme: how to live and how to die. “That’s why I’m going…So I don’t have to wait until I die to start seeking a Great Perhaps,” Miles said to his parents (Green 5). And with those words, the
story and the lives of many of the characters were set into motion.Despite this fervent display of an adventurous spirit, Miles is, to a large extent, a studious, rule-following kid. Probably, Miles frequently fell victim to bullying back in Florida, and as a result, he remained laid back, not wanting to ruffle any feathers in school. Only two kids turned up at his sendoff party, and they were not attached to him. After a suggestion from his father about Culver Creek Academy in Alabama, Miles sees this as an opportunity to find who he is, reinvent himself, and create an alternative reality. Later, Miles achieves this by coming out of the quiet kid obsessed with other people’s final words cocoon and going on to become a bold prankster
who asserts his existence.At Culver Creek, Miles becomes submerged in the process of finding himself. Joining his newfound friends, the Colonel, Alaska, and Takumi, he takes up smoking and ebulliently participates in the grand schemes of pranking their classmates. Although Miles still does not play the leading role in all of these, he becomes accommodative to new possibilities. Mile character shapes up more in this process, as occasioned with indulgences in crazy drinking on the weekends with friends, spending thanksgiving over at Alaska’s, and wild days roaming empty schools. To Miles, this might have been the “Great Perhaps” he had been seeking in the first place. In his religion class, in perhaps a more critical discourse, Miles delves deeper into exploring the meaning of Rabelais’s words. In a
midterm essay, the protagonist explores the religious take on the existential concern of dying. “I finally decided that people believed in an afterlife because they couldn’t bear to,” Miles says (Green 65). Through the process of finding himself, Miles arises full consciousness about his existence and that of the reality surrounding him.Still, Alaska is struggling with charting her path and finding the meaning of existence. Simon Bolivar’s question, “how will I ever get out of this labyrinth is one of her greatest preoccupations. Alaska equates labyrinths to suffering (Green 54). Later, we are given a glimpse into her labyrinth—its root cause being her witnessing her mother’s death and the accompanying guilt for her inaction, which might as well have driven her to get out of her labyrinth. If
this is so, then the net effects of her actions pose far-reaching consequences for Miles. While death offers Alaska an escape from her labyrinth, it creates a new labyrinth for Miles (Rybakova 117). Miles gets submerged in a maze of grief, for which he strives to get answers while at a happenstance avoiding confronting. Although Miles harbors intense love for Alaska, ultimately, he realizes that she gave up, whether or not her death was intentional. The overwhelming guilt Alaska harbored sentenced her to a sad life. In seeking forgiveness—for Alaska, and more importantly for himself, Miles chooses to soldier on in his pursuit of his great perhaps. From Alaska’s mistakes, Miles realizes that the uncertainty of life makes it worth living in the first place. Alaska’s death renders
a certain sense of urgency to such existential questions, especially to Miles, who stops viewing them as theoretical. Miles finally concedes to the limitless possibilities of the great perhaps, because, in some way, he believes in an afterlife. This is particularly imperative as these musings enable characters to explore the theme of how to die. Miles makes peace with mortality, a fact he claims teenagers take for granted.In exploring how to live, there is an insistence on the value of living in the present, enjoying every minute of existence rather than anticipating future happiness. While admonishing Miles for not paying attention in class, Dr. Hyde succinctly delivers this lesson by reminding him of the Buddhist belief in being present at every moment of a person’s existence (Green 50).
These words resonate with Miles, who largely detaches himself from the present instead of existing in a made-up world. Miles is constantly preoccupied with finding the great perhaps this pursuit robs him of an appreciation of the present, and a realization that his much sought great perhaps permeates the existence around him. Miles’s labyrinth is in his blatant refusal of engaging with the present, despite nudging to do so from Alaska and subtle recommendations such as Dr. Hyde’s. It takes the death of Alaska for Miles to confront the present fully, a fate that leads him to a fuller appreciation of existence and an acceptance of fate.Similarly, the Colonel seems to be a victim of this malady too. Being one of the poorer students at Culver Creek, Colonel
harbors strong ambitions too much up the wealth of the Weekday Warriors someday. Colonel opines that the best day of his life was yet to happen, and this day would be one when he buys his mother a huge fucking house (Green 116). Packard observes this to be a complex arising from the gaping income disparities among students in Culver Creek and cites it as the reason for Colonel’s aggressive behavior (45). For example, Colonel constantly fights with the wealthier students as a form of release for his pent-up resentment and anger. Although Colonel acts out of spite at times, his participation in pranks on the Weekday Warriors and his stellar academic performance can be attributed to endemic reasons beyond personal pride. Through Colonel’s exuberance and his focus
on prospects, viewed along with Alaska’s sudden death, the readers get a sense of the importance of the “now.” Green successfully exemplifies the fickleness of life and that the future is never guaranteed.The mystery surrounding Alaska’s death might be the most powerful lesson on how to live and die in the novel. Whether her death was a suicide or an accident should not entirely be the object of the matter as many points support either side. To properly contextualize the importance of this uncertainty, the author’s comments on the same can be instrumental. Asked to give a theory on whether the death was intentional or not, Green asserts that he left the matter ambiguous as it was for a purpose, “I made this conscious decision not to be
The original concept of a Decision Support System (DSS) defined it as a computerized supporting supplement for decision-makers. It serves to gather and analyze large amounts of data to expand the capabilities but not to replace the course of the initial decision. Such a system can be easily programmed for user needs and output data in graphical form, for example, to forecast a company’s future income. Business Intelligence (BI) is a generalized term that is used to describe a combination of analytical tools, methodologies, and applications. (Sharda 2019). DSS originated from BI, but in fact, remains the most used system at the moment. Reporting plays a huge role in the use of Business Intelligence, according to which the user must determine for himself whether a particular situation deserves
attention, and only then can apply analytical methods.The key difference between these two definitions is that DSS is a computerized system for obtaining information that helps make decisions in an organization or business community. At the same time, BI acts as a tool that uses various programs that help in organizing and managing data or valuable information within an organization. While DSS helps the user detect errors existing in the program and analyze information for decision-making, BI helps with automatic analysis and, therefore, gives suggestions that have only the implementation stage left. Another difference is that DSS requires more time to start implementation since the processes mostly involve manual processing. BI requires less time to complete all functions since the computer thinks for itself and therefore does not
require manual control.Analytics can be considered a process of developing practical solutions or recommendations for actions based on information obtained from historical data. The meaning of the word analytics has seriously expanded and no longer serves to designate individual components of computer technologies previously available under specific labels. (Sharda 2019). Today, analytics is a combination of technology, scientific methods, and statistics combined to solve specific problems. Entire industries resort to data analytics to develop reports on what is happening and predict future consequences. Almost all managers begin to understand how important the analytical component is for developing their field and turn to technological systems to simplify these processes.In the domain of healthcare, analytics covers a wide range of applications, from diagnostics to effective fraud prevention. One of the
Naturally, for me, Mexican culture is hard to define within a paragraph or even a whole essay. It is because of the wide variety of nuances, influences, and history that reaches Mesoamerican civilizations such as Mayan and Aztec. There are many manifestations of Mexican culture – in art, food, customs, values, and religion. Hence, if I were to define Mexican culture, I would say that it is a unique blend of Mesoamerican heritage mixed with European cultural influences that shaped the linguistic and religious beliefs.In general, when describing Mexican culture, one of the first things that come to mind is religion. Mexican people are very religious as some of the significant Mexican holidays are religious, such as Feast of Our Lady of Guadeloupe, which is celebrated to 12th
when they hear about Mexico. They probably imagine something from this list: big hats, colorful clothes, delicious food, and mariachi bands. I would select three symbols representing Mexican culture: costumes during the Day of the Dead celebration (1), Mariachi band, and Pyramid of the Moon: Teotihuacán (3).Day of the Dead celebration represents the mystical, spiritual, and family-oriented tradition, which connects living people with the dead, creating a strong bond with one’s ancestors.It is hard to imagine any holiday without a decent mariachi band. Music is a big part of Mexican culture, as it represents the passion and the spirit of the human soul.Finally, the pyramids that can be found across Mexico symbolize the connection of Mexican culture with Mesoamerican civilizations.
Beowulf is an Anglo-Saxon epic poem set in Jutland before the Angles migrated to Britain. The title of this literary work is the name of the main character (Hall 2). Beowulf became one of the revered heroes in Old English literature, and the poem itself had a strong influence on pop culture. This epic character, who accepts his fate without hesitation, attracts attention in modern times full of doubts and contradictions with his almost archetypal clarity and wholeness.Indeed, for example, it can be assumed that modern superhero comics are particularly popular, partly because people still need the image of a fair, superpowered being. One of the most popular heroes of the Marvel Universe is Superman. Their similarities with Beowulf are obvious – both have incredible strength and are
From the lecture, I discovered that the word democracy partly originates from the word demes which means the small division of the bigger sections that Athens was divided into during the ancient time. The second half of the word is the Greek word Kratos which means the rule. Similarly to modern times, democracy means the rule of the people, which implies that the citizens of a certain region’s major political decisions are delivered collectively. However, there are also two main differences between Athenian and modern democracies.The major and most palpable difference between the two systems is who was considered eligible to vote. In Athens, only adult men could influence the city’s political and administrative decisions, while women, children, and enslaved people did not have this right. Although most
each bill would be associated with tremendous temporal and monetary investments compared to a representative system.Nevertheless, in a conclusion, it can be argued that the gist of modern democracy is not different from the one in ancient Greece. The idea that postulates that people can and should be the bearers of political power still remains the same. Despite the fact that there are some differences between the old and the modern systems, they rather reflect the evolution of society than changes in the main principle of democracy.
Departing from social norms could lead to a magnitude of progress. Social practices have a way of dictating what to do and how to react to certain situations. An institution sets rules to be followed and challenging such norms is termed disobedience. Society, including media, is used to portraying the black community as a sad one so seeing them happy seems like a way out of order. Sharing black joy might seem like resistance from the social norms but will have a positive effect on the whole American society. Adam also had to disobey God to be set free from pre-human state to human. Therefore, leaving social norms can lead to many forms of progress for humans.Resisting the ruling power may seem like disobedience but can result in
major human development. For the African Americans, resisting the negative norms of sadness demand sharing more joy with the black community. However, it will take more than individuals to yield positive results. The artistic and media communities need to spread black joy to change the black practice of celebrating sadness and pain. Such actions would communicate the diversity of black, the need to take space and claim their belongings. According to Roderique, sharing black joy “would create spaces of opportunity, possibility, and affirmation” (4). This quote affirms that resisting negative social norms yield positive results. Therefore, if it takes resistance to achieve progress then in this case resistance is good.Acts of disobedience, although may seem wrong at first when they set in freedom, they are assumed right. When
Adam and Eve disobeyed God in the Garden of Eden, they seemed to have been corrupted by sin (Fromm 1). However, the sin or rather a disobedience act transformed Adam from pre-human to human and that is progress. The text mentions that it is until the Messianic prophets came to earth they confirmed that the act of disobedience was right that people understood the concept.Humans have continued to evolve and develop through acts of disobedience. It is through questioning the authority or set social norms that a man can prosper. Fromm says that obedience to rules or practices of a community or institution is submission and shows denial of autonomy (2). Consequently, humans are stuck in one place while submitting to the set norms. However, the moment a
would also not have written to call for black society to publicly share the joy and break the social norm of the sad black community.Disobeying set social practices is a psychological process that must entail the willingness to sin or make a mistake. Going against such norms will be termed immoral and rebellious thus one must toughen up. People can only become free of social practices by learning to say no to power. When a man frees himself from power and is psychologically free, he or she can develop positively.
The rate of patient mortality in intensive care is a growing concern for medical practitioners. Although the cause of patient motility may be attributed to many factors even before the individual reaches the CCU, it has been reported that an effective tube placement during resuscitation aids healthy circulation. It is not known if the nurse’s knowledge of capnography affects its use in critical care units. The purpose of this project is to evaluate the relationship between nurses’ knowledge of capnography and its use in coronary care units. The project will provide valuable insight into factors affecting the use of capnography, thus contributing to the field and filling the gap in the literature. The intervention protocol will train nurses on the benefit of capnography and test their implementation in
Type 1 and Type 2 diabetes contrast based on their definitions, the causes, and the management of the conditions. Type 1 manifests through the pancreas producing little to no insulin, which is why it is essential to monitor the glucose levels in the blood (DiMeglio et al., 2018). People who are genetically predisposed are the target groups, and the condition can correlate with symptoms such as thirst, weight loss, and feelings of hunger. Type 2 diabetes occurs when the pancreas does not create enough insulin while cells do not have an adequate reaction to the insulin that is being produced (Roden & Shulman, 2019). Research shows that more than 90% of Americans with diabetes are diagnosed with Type 2, while less than 6% have Type 1 (Xu et
al., 2018). Thus, lifestyle is the most critical factor in terms of prevention and treatment.Table 1: Diabetes                              Type 1 Diabetes                                                         Type 2 Diabetes

                                                    Healthy diet, exercise, weight loss, in some cases medication and insulin injectionsBased on the fact that Type 1 diabetes correlates with low insulin production while the second type is linked to inadequate response to insulin, managing this hormone that has the function of facilitating the glucose to enter the cell is essential. Moreover, since the gene that regulates the production of resistin is overactive in people with obesity, it is evident that a diet that can
reduce excess weight while addressing other diabetes-specific concerns can reduce risks.Multiple diets claim to be effective in terms of managing type 2 diabetes, yet multiple factors have to be considered. For example, the Atkins diet mainly consists of products high in fiber and low in saturated fat. Since the CDC promotes the avoidance of saturated fat and the increase of fiber intake for sugar regulation, the Atkins diet may be suited for people with diabetes ( Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, 2021). On the other hand, a reduction in carbs may lead to poor glycemic control (Joshi et al., 2019). Thus, the diet has both pros and cons depending on circumstances.Marketing claims regarding supplements, powders, and teas also target demographics looking for ways to reduce weight. For
example, researchers refer to the commonly used ephedra supplements as potentially beneficial in short-term weight loss but mention side effects such as heart and nervous system (Miao et al., 2020). Garcinia cambogia has shown to be ineffective in weight loss and correlates with reports of liver damage ( US Department of Health and Human Services , 2022). Multiple teas, supplements, and powders that claim to be helpful for weight loss are unethically marketed since FDA often finds unlisted ingredients such as sibutramine, which increases blood pressure ( Center for Drug Evaluation and Research , 2022). Instead of opting for uncertified supplements, effective diabetes control correlates with a lifestyle change, including frequent exercise and a healthy and balanced diet. These measures are not only effective in terms of weight
be effective since obesity treatment often relies on a carb reduction (Westman & Yancy, 2020). However, Alan’s recommendation of approaching the condition with a balanced overview on health based on activity and avoidance of certain foods is easier to follow and, possibly, more sustainable in the long run (Rubin & Herreid, 2003). Implementing natural remedies may be harmful since, as mentioned prior, researchers refer to the low efficacy and side effects. Thus, Morgan should maintain a healthy weight through balanced meals and higher activity levels.
The healthcare problem discussed in this assignment is diabetes mellitus, which is increasingly becoming the leading cause of disability across the world. The disease manifests itself through hyperglycemia, and it is categorized into type 1 and type 2. Type 2 diabetes is the most prevalent and it consists of close to 90% of all infections. The causes of this disease are varied, including gestation, drugs, and lifestyles. Its complications affect all body organs, leading to lethal implications. The population to be studied in this assignment majorly comprises older people with diabetes type 2 in a setting with nurse-led management.The presence of this problem is substantiated by diverse information and data from different researchers. Macido (2019) found that Diabetes mellitus is among the leading medical concerns in the United
states and the world at large. The researchers used data from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, where more than 12% of older people in the US live with the condition (Macido, 2019). Additionally, a significant number of the population remain undiagnosed with diabetes mellitus. According to the American Diabetes Association (ADA) (n. d.), the issue remains the seventh cause of death and morbidity, and there are more than one million newly reported cases per year. Therefore, diabetes is chronic illness that currently strains healthcare and stakeholders.The research is relevant because there is a need to improve population/patient knowledge and adherence to management strategies. Furthermore, the study will inform caregivers on better patient approaches beyond the clinical setting. Nikitara et al. (2019) states that most patients develop
complications due to poor knowledge of self-management and adherence to treatment courses. At the same time, uncontrolled diabetes mellitus is likely to increase hospitalizations and emergency visits in healthcare facilities. Thus, this research is relevant to inform on various aspects that could lead to shorter lengths of stay in a hospital and improved wellness outcomes after discharge.Various literature reveals that the prevalence of diabetes is rising. The number of people infected with the disease is expected to reach close to 350 million by 2030 (Macido, 2019). The most notable demographic transition is the rising number of patients older than 60 years. Nikitara et al. (2019) found that nurses should check for further clinical manifestations of the disease. They include a cool feeling, moist skin, add higher than normal
blood sugar levels. The nurse can use automatically generated procedures to manage the disease but intravenous administration of medication could be necessary when treating lethargic patients. In case of extreme hyperglycemia, the caregivers should report to the physician, who will, perhaps, transfer them to intensive care units and follow the appropriate treatment procedures such as intravenous insulin administration, or other fluids. Data reliability would depend on its currency, relevance, authority, accuracy and purpose. It would be unreliable of it misses the importance research needs, apart from being outdated and having incorrect and untrue information.There are many barriers hindering the implementation of evidence-based practice in addressing diabetes mellitus. Limited time allotted for primary care appointments with healthcare providers hinders the implementation of evidence-based remedies (Macido, 2019). Additionally, poor patient-provider
Bowel disease is a collection of disorders that includes Crohn’s disease and ulcerative colitis, which causes pain and swelling in the intestines, affecting the digestive system. The first step in treating bowel disease involves a doctor taking a careful medical history and physical examination. Numerous diagnostic tests are conducted on the patient, such as blood tests, stool samples, endoscopy, colonoscopy, and imaging studies. During blood tests, providers test patients’ blood and evaluate how well a treatment works (Fiorino et al., 2019). Blood tests include measuring hematocrit, C-reaction protein, thrombocytes, and leucocytes. A stool sample is checked for infections or inflammation, while CT and MRI scans reveal internal images of the digestive system. Health providers also perform an upper endoscopy that involves looking inside the food pipe, stomach, and
The United States has a controversial history of dietary habits that are not determined as the healthiest ones. A separate topic on this matter is fast-food and its popularity among all age groups of the population. This amount of cholesterol and sugar has negative consequences for the body and has to be significantly reconsidered together with the number of vegetables and grains averagely consumed.Hot dogs and donuts on the go have become the norm for always rushing people. A 2004 US Eating Habit Survey found that about 75% of meals were from fast-food cafes (Hellas and Calder). Almost half of the ordered items were hamburgers, and about a third of them included sodas. Americans continue to consume about 20% of their daily calories in the form of hard-to-digest
sugars like sodas (Hellas and Calder). All this negatively impacts well-being and leads to many severe issues like obesity.Healthy eating habits are incomprehensible without an adequate intake of vegetables. However, the consumption of vegetables is low: only 13% consumes the recommended amounts. Potatoes and tomatoes only make up 39% of the vegetables consumed by Americans (Hellas and Calder). According to statistics, boys aged 9 to 13 and girls aged 14 to 18 consume even fewer vegetables (Hellas and Calder). This topic demands to be discussed since it affects the nutrition of children and teenagers.The same questions arise when analyzing the consuming grain products. Whole grains should make more than half of total grain consumption, but 85.3% of the grain comes from refined products (Hellas and Calder). Refining grain
is free of bran and germ, which are a source of nutritional fiber and vitamins. Many people buy bread from processed grain, inaccurately considering it more organic (Hellas and Calder). However, this is a delusion due to the lack of acknowledgement.Modern trends are introducing new dietary habits, which are widely advertised as the recent trend in healthy eating. However, some products only sound like a good option and have many damaging consequences for the body. One example is almond milk, which reasonably has some beneficial characteristics. However, most types of almond milk contain food additives that may be harmful to the body: locust bean gum (E410) and gellan gum (E418). These additives are considered safe, but an extensive amount may provoke side effects such as diabetes, diarrhea, allergy,
The modern culture of food consumption is very diverse, and there are many recommendations and prohibitions from different social groups. Sometimes food intake becomes part of a large-scale and widespread subculture, distinguished by a particular worldview. One of the most essential regulators of eating meat was religion. Now religion is not able to control most of the society and their food addictions. Sometimes the refusal to eat meat is due to some medical factors, for example, a previous surgery. Meat is heavy food, and it is vital to cook it the right way, using steam, and not fat and oil. Modern society provides a variety of reasons for grass-eaters to stick to their position. The noticeable difference between grass-eaters and meat-eaters is in the diet and sometimes in
the way of life. In addition, these people have different medical conditions and often have different medical histories and risks.Grass-eaters do not eat meat, no matter how it is cooked. Sometimes they consume dairy products or eggs, especially if they understand that their bodies will weaken without animal fats. The severity of the herb-eater’s diet can vary based on health, lifestyle, age. Some grass-eaters fit their dietary habits into their lifestyle and eventually give up wearing leather and silk clothing. It is a strict option in which the grass-eater must adhere to a clear ideology (de Boer et al., 2017). In turn, if meat eaters have bans on consuming specific meat (Muslims do not eat pork for religious reasons), then the prohibitions are due to personal reasons and
choice. Taste, associations, unpleasant smell of a particular type of meat can affect the refusal to eat. Sometimes, meat-eaters refuse to wear leather clothing for ethical or aesthetic reasons. They are guided by the principle that brand, fashion, and aesthetics in clothing are not sufficient grounds for killing and experimenting with animals.Many people are confronted with the myth that the health of grass-eaters is better than the health of meat-eaters. The herb-eaters’ diet forces them to be attentive to their bodies and often visit doctors. For this reason, they may appear to be the healthiest, but this is not true. Like many conscious people, grass-eaters try to be attentive to themselves. Many herb-eaters additionally purchase nutritional supplements and vitamins, and they need medical advice to make the right
choice. Meat-eaters are not attentive to their health; they neglect vitamins and rarely go to the doctor without listening to their body.The average grass-eater usually has less fat and cholesterol than the meat-eater. It allows doctors to say that people on such a diet have a lower risk of heart diseases, such as coronary artery disease or hypertension. Grass eaters are generally less likely to develop type II diabetes (de Boer et al., 2017). However, this is not strictly related to eating or avoiding meat. Cooking habits play an essential role, and sometimes food for herb-eaters is prepared in a very unhealthy way. Meat eaters can eat any meat, but avoid oil, deep fat, and a lot of hot spices. So they will maintain their body mass index
IntroductionThe revolution in cooking has resulted in a huge evolution of cooking techniques. Cooking has been practiced throughout history since ancient times. Previously, an ancient man consumed only raw food; nevertheless, once, a piece of flesh fell into the fire and was roasted (Harold 6). The man ate the portion and declared it delicious. Thus, the cooking process began and evolved. Cooking food is critical because it facilitates digestion, enhances the appearance, flavor, color, texture. In addition, cooking adds taste of the food diversity to the meal, thus the food stays fresher and lasts longer.Cooking also requires an understanding of products and equipment and the ability to plan and organize meal preparation within time limits. Not to mention that traditional cooking techniques are more superior and healthier than
newer ones such as microwave cooking (Harold 4). There are numerous cooking techniques such as boiling and steaming, the majority of which date back to ancient. Microwaving is a more recent innovation (Harold 784). Various methods employ varying degrees of heat and moisture and require varying amounts of time to cook. The method used significantly impacts the overall result, as certain foods are more suited to certain processes than others.Cooking TechniquesCooking is the art of preparing food for consumption, most typically by the use of heat. Cooking techniques and ingredients vary significantly across the globe, reflecting distinct climatic zones, economic conditions, cultural traditions, and trends (Harold 777). Cooking techniques also vary according to an individual’s skill level and type of training. Conduction, convection, and radiation all contribute to
the transfer of heat to the food during cooking (Harold 782). The method of cooking is determined by the way heat is applied to the meal. Certain foods, such as leafy greens such as spinach and fenugreek, contain high moisture. These foods are prepared in a way that takes advantage of this moisture. However, rice, wheat, and pulses have a low moisture content; they are cooked with more water (moisture) (Mwale et al. 1056). There are additional methods of cooking that do not require any water; in fact, these methods assist the food to remain crisp after completion. As a result, cooking techniques are classed as either moist heat, dry heat, or frying.Classification of Cooking MethodsCooking by Moist HeatMoist-heat cooking refers to cooking that uses watery substances as
the primary cooking medium. The liquid is used for cooking food in moist heat (Bernhardt, Simone, and Elmar 328). The medium used during moist cooking include coconut cream, water or oil. Usually, the above liquids are included in cooked food or heated before the addition is done. Moist-heat cooking involves cooking at a lower temperature, often between 140 and 212 degrees Fahrenheit (which is, of course, the point at which water boils) (Lobefaro et al. 100381). In this research, we will discuss steaming, blanching, and boiling, as braising and poaching are often utilized for meat and fish preparation. This method includes submerging meals in boiling liquid or exposing them to steam to cook them. This highlights the food’s natural flavor and aroma. It is critical to understand the
many forms of moist cooking to determine the most appropriate approach for a particular dish. Steaming, boiling, blanching, simmering, and poaching are all moist-heat cooking methods.Cooking by Dry HeatDry heat cooking methods do not require the use of water to cook the meal. The meal is let to dry and then cooked using heat. In order for food to cook, it must either be heated in its juice or heated in a liquid that was added to it during cooking and evaporated, cooking the food. In fact, dry-heat cooking refers to any method of cooking that uses hot air, hot metal, a flame, or hot fat to transport heat to the meal without the need for moisture. Fat is an excellent medium for cooking on low heat (Mwale
et al. 1056). At first, glance, because the fat in a deep fryer is liquid, it appears to be moist-heat cooking. Bear in mind that dry-heat cooking brown foods, whereas moist-heat cooking does not. As a result, it’s easy to see why fat is considered a dry-heat method, as dishes cooked in fat drippings turn golden and crispy when prepared correctly.Broiling, baking, roasting, grilling, pan-broiling, griddling, sautéing, pan-frying, and deep-frying is examples of dry-heat cooking methods. The ideal meats for dry cooking are extremely soft, have little connective tissue, and be served medium-rare.Moist Heat Cooking TechniquesBraising and StewingSearing or sautéing the food before partially covering it with liquid and simmering at a moderate temperature is the first step in braising. With braising, food cooks more evenly because heat
is uniformly distributed throughout the pot, making it possible to cook it on the stovetop or in an oven (Mwale et al. 1056). Briskets from older animals or those with a larger percentage of connective tissue might benefit from being braise-cooked. The procedure is more widely utilized in current food preparation methods than in traditional ways. Braising technique is commonly used to cook modern foods as they require uniform distribution of heat.PoachingIn poaching, food is immersed in a liquid such as wine, stock, or water and cooked at a low temperature. Poaching is distinguished from other “wet heat” cooking techniques, such as simmering and boiling, by its low temperature (about 160–180 °F (71–82 °C)) (Mwale et al. 1056). This temperature range is ideal for delicate foods like eggs,
poultry, fish, and fruit, which can easily fall apart or dry out when cooked in other ways. Poaching is frequently seen as a healthy cooking method due to the absence of fat in the cooking and flavoring process (Roncero-Ramos et al. 294). Poaching is a simple way of cooking that requires no extra equipment and so saves fuel. Poached foods are easily digestible due to the absence of fat.SimmeringSimmering is a cooking method in which food is cooked at temperatures between 180°F and 205°F. When a chef looks at the water, he or she will see bubbles forming and slowly rising to the top, but the water is not yet boiling over. Simmered food cooks pretty evenly since it is surrounded by water that keeps a reasonably constant
temperature (Harold 784). It is the classic method for making stocks and soups, as well as starchy foods like potatoes or pasta dishes. The downside of simmering is that it leaches vitamins and other nutrients from the food into the cooking liquid. It is a fantastic choice for a variety of culinary preparations, including as stocks or soups, starchy things like potatoes or pasta, and many more. One disadvantage of this method of cooking is that it might lead the food to lose vitamins due to high temperatures of cooking involved.SteamingSteaming is a cooking method that involves exposing food to steam in a pressured steam cooker or heating it in a securely covered pan or other container. When cooking delicate foods like veggies, steaming is best. The cover
of the pan traps the steam, creating a hot, moist atmosphere in which the food may cook. Steaming is not only wonderful for light meals like steamed pieces of bread, but it also helps maintain nutrients. When water is heated over 212°F, it ceases to be water and becomes steam (Harold 785). Steaming is quite gentle in physical agitation, making it perfect for preparing shellfish and other delicate things.Additionally, it offers the significance of cooking faster while reducing nutrient loss that may be caused by high temperature ranges. Interestingly, like water, steam has a maximum temperature of 212°F (Roncero-Ramos et al. 290). Unlike water, however, steam can be compelled to surpass this natural temperature limit through the use of pressurization (Harold 786). When the pressure is increased, the
steam grows hotter with time. However, since cooking with pressured steam needs specialized equipment, the ordinary home chef would not use it. The steps involved in steaming include:  * In the bottom section of a steamer, let the water boil.  * Arrange veggies in a steamer or perforated pan large enough to fit on top of a double boiler.  * Lid and steam until the vegetables are soft. Leave the lid slightly ajar if the vegetables are green to help keep their color.Dry heat cooking methodRoasting and BakingWhile roasting is comparable to baking, the technique is more commonly associated with meat and poultry. Roasting food is usually doused in oil or other fluids to prevent it from drying out during cooking as opposed to baking.
Roasting and baking are virtually synonymous. Both terms refer to a method of cooking an item by surrounding it in hot, dry air, typically inside an oven at temperatures of at least 300°F (but often much hotter) (Harold 784). This method cooks food pretty evenly, as all of the food’s surfaces are exposed to approximately the same amount of heat. This is in contrast to pan-searing, in which the surface that comes into contact with the hot pan becomes significantly hotter than the side that faces up.Both roasting and baking require that the food is cooked uncovered so that the heat is provided by hot, dry air rather than steam from the food. Despite these similarities, roasting and baking might signify slightly different things to different people (Lobefaro
et al. 100381). Certain chefs reserve the term “baking” for bread, pastry, and other bakery dishes. Some people use the phrase “roasting” exclusively to refer to meats, poultry, and vegetables, but “baking” refers to fish and other seafood (Harold 784). Another contrast is possible in terms of temperature, with “roasting,” meaning increased heat and thus a more rapid and dramatic browning.Broiling and GrillingBroiling is a way of cooking that is very similar to grilling but is done in the oven. Broiling is the process of bringing food very close to an intense heat source to cook it quickly at a high temperature. Broiling is another type of dry-heat cooking that relies on heat conduction via the air (Harold 783). Broiling, similar to grilling, can also be done in
the oven as a low-fat, direct-heat cooking method. Due to the fact that air is a poor conductor of heat, broiling and grilling require the food to be extremely close to the heat source, which is most frequently an open flame. Grilling is a quick and healthful form of cooking that preserves vitamins and minerals. As a result, the food’s surface cooks quickly, making this cooking method suitable for chicken, fish, and tender pieces of meat.Essentially, because this way of cooking is exceedingly hot and dry, it is normal to marinade foods that will be broiled or grilled. Usually, there is one crucial difference between broiling and grilling: grilling entails heating the meal below, and broiling requires heating the food from above (Harold 783). In both circumstances, the
food is normally flipped once while cooking, and a grid or grate of some form is utilized to impart the distinctive grill marks characteristic of this cooking method. As with sautéing, preheating the broiler or grill prior to placing the food on it is crucial.Deep-FryingAnother common form of cooking is the deep-fat frying technique. As strange as it may sound, deep frying is not a moist-heat approach but a dry-heat method. The temperature difference between deep frying and boiling is significant. Boiling water temperatures must never exceed 100C (212F), although deep frying temps can reach 200C. (400F) (Harold 784). These high temperatures enable the product to cook more quickly and to brown. Because deep-frying entails completely immersing the meal in hot, liquid oil, it may take some time
to adjust to the fact that it is essentially a sort of dry-heat cooking (Harold 786). However, if one has ever witnessed the dramatic reaction of heated oil to even a tiny drop of water, they know that oil and water are opposed. The chef should ensure that anything they set in the hot fat is completely dry to avoid this. This may require patting an object dry with a paper towel prior to cooking.Deep-frying needs maintaining an oil temperature of 325°F to 400°F. If the oil gets any hotter than that, it may begin to smoke, and if it gets any cooler, it begins to seep into the food, causing it to get greasy. Deep-fried products should have very little oil on them after cooking, providing they
were cooked properly (Harold 786). The trick to maintaining a hot oil temperature is to fry stuff in tiny batches, as adding too much food to the oil can cause it to cool. Another indicator that deep-frying is a sort of dry-heat cooking is the delicious golden-brown hue of items prepared this way. Frequently, foods are covered in a basic batter to protect them and retain their moisture.Pan-fryingPan-frying is a cooking technique that involves cooking food in an uncovered pan with a small amount of fat. It is comparable to sautéing but requires more fat and frequently lower heat. Pan-frying is a quick and easy cooking method comparable to frying but without the fat; it is sometimes referred to as sautéing (Harold 786). To achieve the greatest results,
choose beef cuts that are 3/8′′ to 1/2′′ thick. Season the meat with salt and pepper while heating a skillet to medium-high heat for a 1/2-inch thick or less cut. Cook the meat in batches, flipping occasionally, but do not cover the skillet during the cooking process.As a cooking method, pan-frying relies on oil/fat as a heat transfer medium and on the proper temperature and timing to avoid overcooking or burning the food. Pan-frying can help preserve the moisture in meals like meats, fish, and seafood (Harold 786). Due to the partial covers, food is usually flipped at least once to guarantee even cooking on both sides. A pan-fry cooks lower than a sauté (Bernhardt, Simone, and Elmar 330). This is because the food to be pan-fried is
The differential association theory was developed in 1939 by the veteran sociologist Edwin Sutherland. The study explains how prohibited manners master’s in social establishments can lead to criminology. Multiple people grasp the mindsets, methods, and justifications for illegal techniques by interacting with different persons. According to Lokanan (2018), people can minimize fraud-related cases by understanding the theory to maneuver positive results in the organizations such as schools. Students in high school interact with distinct people who possess offensive habits, and misconducts occur during this period.During my high school period, my classmates and other senior students abused drugs that caused a severe threat to their health. The use of alcohol and cocaine was considered a crucial practice by most cliques since they could access the drugs from the drug
vendors in the nearest town. The drug dealers used to visit the school frequently to sell drugs to the addicted students within the school environment. Throughout my school experience, addictive students would rush to bathrooms to smoke, inject cocaine, and consume alcohol repeatedly. The actions arose since the learners’ parents could offer finances to the students hence, they could access the drugs.Drug abuse can lead to negative consequences such as low educational attainment, well-being problems such as brain disorders, and crime in society. The substance-induced in the body changes the brain functions through repeated use which determines the person’s genetic constituents (Fernàndez-Castillo et al., 2021). Drugs such as cocaine have enormous influences on individuals’ life and, and if overdosed, death can occur. Some individuals are better genetically sensitive
to developing cocaine addiction compared to others.Cliques in high school who used drugs committed crimes and served imprisonment in various correctional facilities. Misconduct is one of the outcomes of drug violation whereby both educators and parents should maneuver new methodologies to remedy the problem. The provision of school-based education to the youth is one of the proposed techniques to minimize the use and abuse of drugs in schools (Montgomery et al., 2022). Educational interventions in schools can boost cognitive-behavioral skills and decrease exposure to social forces that raise drug misuse. The study shows that multiple youths do not possess felony patterns in their adult life.The theory illustrates that forty percent of people below 21 years old execute offenses in society. In addition, another feature such as growing up
curb the behavior and improve the student’s performance by offering health education. Parents and tutors should play their roles effectively by taking actions such as punishing the learners who bully others or commit offenses during their high school life. Culture has also influenced young people to join organized syndicates where many young individuals have lost their lives. It is critical to educate the youths about the consequences of the breach and drug misuse to minimize the demeanor in society. Education can support youthful people to gain motivation by acquiring proper skills during school life and making reasonable decisions.
There are multiple factors that stand behind the successful implementation of the P-O-L-C framework. It is important to prioritize some of them duly in case a company faces serious issues, or when the market indicates upcoming challenges. The collapse of WorldCom in 2002, that led to one of the largest accounting scandals in the US, provides a nice example of the lack of proper communication in a corporation. The inability of various top managers and accountants to communicate efficiently in order to prevent frauds is always disastrous.WorldCom grew rapidly under Bernard Ebbers who managed to jump at the multiple opportunities that the growing interest for telecom services provided at that time. Nevertheless, the company went bankrupt in a matter of a few years. Moreover, Ebbers faced several charges,
of negotiations between Ebbers, directors and accountants are rooted in barriers to communication that include motive distortion and extreme self-absorption. The top managers and professionals who were expected to lead the company tended to prioritize their own interests and receive only the parts of information and data that was convenient to them. Thus, the atmosphere created by such an attitude eventually led to the collapse of the corporation, as a result of the lack of decently organized teamwork.
Digital forensics tools are highly popular among digital investigators, as they allow easily conducting of the necessary technical analyses. One of the most famous software programs for digital forensics is Autopsy, a toolkit that examines the images present on a device’s hard drive. Capable of interacting with personal computers and smartphones, Autopsy is highly versatile and contains several functions for properly investigating the image files present on the storage unit ( Autopsy , n.d.). Specifically, Autopsy allows viewing graphical information stored on the device, searching the repository for specific items, or extracting the data ( Autopsy , n.d.). Although this software is distributed freely, it remains an excellent tool for forensic analysis and is continuously updated to follow technological advances.Some digital forensics software is incredibly specific, created to
SummaryAs a result of numerous socio-cultural and scientific revolutions that took place throughout the 20th century, the attitude towards many social groups was revised by the collective majority. In the process of social revolution, the scientific community coined the word “marginalized” groups to describe people who do not fit into the standard perception of the normalized American. These people are devoid of the social benefits that are implied to be inalienable to ordinary citizens. The disadvantaged as a category can include various social groups that are distinguished according to different characteristics, such as race, gender, sexual orientation, or disability. The same and unifying principle for these groups is their relationship with the surrounding society, in which they are deprived of the basic conditions that are considered necessary for
a comfortable existence. This is due to their opposition to the mainstream of American society, as a result of which disadvantaged groups are in the position of a minority, suppressed by the systemic reality of the collective majority. Having considered two different social groups that fit this characteristic, it becomes possible not only to trace the history of changes in the political and cultural landscape but also to critically comprehend it.LGBTQ+ Rights: a HistoryThe struggle for homosexuals and transgender for the right to express is long enough and can officially date back to the founding of the Human Rights Society, one of the oldest human rights organizations in America. This society was the first to openly support people with non-normative sexual orientations, and their book Friendship and Freedom
was the first publication for homosexuals. Due to prolonged legislative pressure, this society was soon disbanded, but its appearance marked the beginning of the legal history of gay activism. This historical example seems indicative of demonstrating the pressure of the prevailing social forces over the groups marginalized by it. Subsequently, the fight against homosexuals was at the official level after the end of the post-war restoration (Portmann, 2018). During that time, thousands of people were fired from their jobs in government or military service. This was done because homosexuality was categorized as a mental illness that distorts the stable functioning of the psyche.LGBTQ+ Struggle for Rights NowMore recently, in America, LGBT + activism continues to bear fruit, seeking to neutralize the attitude of the social majority towards their
representatives. The empowerment of the transgender community deserves a separate mention here since, at the moment, the normative restrictions that exclude transgender people from a number of social practices are really neutralized. Toilet visits consistent with gender identity have become a separate issue here, as the Obama administration’s rule was overturned by the next President, Donald Trump. For four years, a schoolboy suffering from gender dysphoria Gavin Grimm fought the court for the right to visit the women’s toilet and won the case in 2020 (Meyer & Keenan, 2017). This example is illustrative to demonstrate how the concept of gender identity overcomes the limitations posed by normative representations of sex. This year, President Biden allowed transgender military personnel to join the army, stating that every qualified American can
fulfill a duty to a country.Native American Populations: an OverviewNative American populations experienced an unthinkable number of acts of oppression and violence throughout the 19th century and beyond. Historically, following President Jackson’s decree, the forced relocation of tens of thousands of Indians resulted in a staggering number of deaths. Genocide or ethnic cleansing has led to the murder of over 50 million indigenous people in America over the course of a century (Hackel, 2017). To this day, Native Americans are a socially vulnerable group of the American population since a complete reparation of the damage caused to these people seems to be still impossible.Indigenous Populations’ Rights TodayThe main problem that Native Americans face in modern society is their primordially distorted and biased cultural perception of them. Indians in
modern society are exoticized, considered different, and in this regard, they distance themselves from the mainstream of American society. The answer to this misunderstanding may be the spread of cultural knowledge that would destroy stereotypes. Only by educating others, who usually voluntarily abandon new knowledge in the name of a stereotype, will it be possible to overcome prejudice against the indigenous population of America. The Native American Rights Foundation is a prime example of a Native American rights organization that preserves not only their culture but also their tribal natural resources.Patriarchy and HomophobiaThe concept of patriarchy implies that in the system of social order, it is men who determine the organization and arrangement of society. In it, males have the highest authority and social privileges, being in a
dominant position over the rest of society. Through this concept, it seems possible to analyze the phenomenon of rejection of homosexuals and transgender people in American society. Same-sex relationships seem unacceptable in such a society, which can also be called heteropatriarchal in feminist theory. In such a system of social-hierarchical interactions, only a normative cisgender man can have an authoritative position. Thus, homophobia can be and is often one of the negative manifestations of patriarchal ideology.Stratification and Indigenous People in the USThe concept of stratification in sociology is a designation similar to the notion of the distribution, arrangement, and distribution of elements and categories. Stratification means a division of society into social strata determined by particular signs and criteria. Speaking about the history of the indigenous peoples in
the territory of the United States, it should be noted that from the very beginning of their interaction with the colonialists, they were socially marginalized and pushed to the bottom of the new social order. At the moment, their position is also different from the standard – according to the stratification system, they are at the bottom of the social pyramid in a number of parameters, such as income or types of activity.Self-identity and LGBTQ+It would be interesting to consider the struggle of the LGBTQ + community for equality from the perspective of the concept of self-identification. This theoretical development of perceiving a person is included in the process of constant self-reflection on the subject of their personality. A person is always aware of who they are in
Modern city planning studies how people interact with elements of the urban environment and each other. It seeks to determine what a city should be and meet the needs of its inhabitants. The city structure is widely dependent on external factors such as weather conditions, global diseases, and others. The question for urbanists following the results of the coronavirus epidemic is how to make the city resistant to quarantine. The emerging demand conditions the importance of the topic for improving city planning procedures in terms of the pandemic of COVID-19 that hit all major world cities (Kakderi, Oikonomaki, & Papadaki, 2021). Hence, it is vital to elaborate new strategies for more resilient urban design.There is no environment that would guarantee against infection with the virus. It is essential
to imagine how the population moves around the city in urban planning – this is also one of the pandemic lessons. Approximately 95 percent of all cases of COVID-19 in the first months of the spread of infection occurred in cities (Batty, 2020). The pandemic has impoverished another 120 million people, and the quality of life worldwide has declined by 23 percent (Pineda & Corburn, 2020). Throughout the pandemic, local authorities have been responsible for quickly and decisively creating a barrier to the virus. In many places, municipal authorities have coped with this task with honor. People who live without basic amenities become infected more easily and transmit the virus to others (Kakderi et al., 2021). Therefore, it is imperative to create everyday living conditions for citizens, and
for this, it is necessary to fight inequality.Numerous megacities decided to impose restrictions by shutting down restaurants, malls, and other public facilities. In addition, the authorities demanded isolation, which, it seemed, was not an ideal means of fighting infections (Pineda & Corburn, 2020). In order to keep people from social contact, propaganda had to explain that a person is not a friend to a person but a threat to health. On the other hand, public transport could not have been excluded from the proper city functioning. Meanwhile, many cities have relied on a culture of interaction by introducing masks, social distancing, and vaccinations. Citizens’ self-organization, which was highly supported by local authorities, was perhaps the most effective policy in the fight against the pandemic.Regardless of the measures undertaken,
the urban areas have undergone drastic changes since the beginning of the coronavirus epidemic. Numerous businesses went bankrupt and shut down, emptying the streets. What is more, one-fifth of the population moved out to countryside areas seeking more isolation and protection (Pineda & Corburn, 2020). However, there is a positive outcome, too – the city roads have become less congested and contaminated because citizens stopped going out every day.Even though it is impossible to completely re-plan the city for emergencies, it is necessary to introduce measures to mitigate the probable consequences of a pandemic. For instance, it is worth creating multifunctional residential quarters where all the essential services are within walking distance (Batty, 2020). This strategy will prevent residents from visiting crowded facilities and spreading the virus. Experts
have studied the possibility of a layout that will allow commercial and residential buildings to be located nearby, including affordable housing (Lennon, 2021). Such complexes can contribute to improving public health, ecology, and economic development. Increasing the autonomy of housing can significantly reduce the load on urban networks, waste removal and recycling systems, water purification, as well as food production and delivery.Furthermore, it is indispensable to develop a legally binding spatial and temporal zoning of the urban area and introduce various modes of its use. It should be based on indicators of social distancing, the permissible concentration of people, and the time of their joint stay in the same space (Lennon, 2021). Changing the opening hours of stores and institutions can be another option for simultaneously reducing the
Nowadays, there is a rapid development of technologies in many spectra of human life. Modern developments’ main task is making a man’s life convenient and safe. However, it is also essential to remember the impact of human life on nature and the environment. Thus, the development of electronic vehicles provides additional comfort for movement and positively affects the environment. With the evolution of industry and traffic systems, one should understand that human influence on nature has become destructive. It is primarily due to the consequences of the development of transportation, especially cars, which has become a cause for concern and elaboration of alternatives. In particular, electric vehicles are gaining popularity as a replacement for internal combustion engines. Electric cars are better for the future due to the absence
of negative impact on the environment since not have harmful substances emission.Carbon dioxide emissions, the main reason for which is the widespread use of vehicles with internal combustion engines, have a negative impact on the environment. It is formulated not only by air pollution but also by the destructive effect on the atmosphere. In turn, it has an effect on the climate, namely on the increase in average temperature, since the layers of the atmosphere have a protective function. Thus, the technologies of electric vehicles are essential to the automotive industry and the user due to better fuel economy and positive environmental impact (Mi and Masrur 11). In other words, electric cars will save humanity from the threats of warming-related cataclysms and help in the economic aspect. Electric
cars reduce fuel consumption, which will positively impact the exhaustive energy sources issue.The main argument for the necessity to replace cars with internal combustion engines with electric ones is the degree of influence of vehicles on the environment. Moreover, one should consider the number of engines and other types of vehicles: buses, trucks, and tractors. Passenger cars rank first in terms of the number of units used, respectively, having the most significant impact. In addition, passenger cars are ahead of other types of transport in terms of quantity, namely, airplanes, ships, and rail transport. Although passenger cars are used in most cases for trips up to 200 kilometers, they still have a significant degree of negative impact. It is stated by the fact that the number of simultaneously
used units is large, which leads to the accumulation of emissions.Fig. 1. Chart Demonstrating Emission Degree in EUAll modes of transport, except for road transport, have lower carbon dioxide emissions, and the smallest share goes to rail transport. As can be seen in Figure 1, road transportation has 72% of overall emissions, and 60,7% goes to automobiles (See Fig. 1 above) (MLA 8th, 3). One may also notice that water and air transport have a fairly high share of emissions, although less compared to road transport. Thus, one may identify that replacing internal combustion engines with electric ones will significantly improve the situation.In regards to car-related issues, one should consider the long-term implications and results. It includes two aspects: the impact on the environment and the use of
natural resources. In recent years there has been a significant increase in oil extraction (Vilches and Jonatan 164). This is primarily due to the increased demand for gasoline extracted from oil. In turn, it is connected with the growth in the number of cars, especially personal ones. In other words, one may notice that the existing indicators showing the degree of negative impact on the environment may increase. Thus, the prospect of switching to electric engines, at least in passenger cars, is an effective way to solve the problem in the long term. At the same time, it will affect the two above-mentioned aspects, namely the impact on nature and the problem of using resources.Electric cars have another advantage in terms of consumables, energy savings, and machine functionality.
It was possible to identify that the technologies of the interaction of mechanisms in electric cars, which reduce the degree of friction, could reduce energy losses by 18-40% (Holmberg and Erdemir 2). It is connected with the principle of operation of electric cars, namely the reduction of the pistons and levers quality, which wear out quickly in usual cars. In turn, applying electricity will reduce emissions and resource utilization for the construction of these parts.It was also possible to establish the advantage of electric cars in terms of carbon dioxide emissions compared to conventional cars. In combustion engine cars, the CO2 emission is 4.5 higher compared to electric cars (Holmberg and Erdemir 3). One may notice that the degree of difference is significant, considering the number and degree
of modern vehicles usage. Moreover, the electricity used to charge electric cars may come only from inexhaustible sources of energy in the future. Green energy, or energy produced with the help of natural forces, cancels the impact on the number of existing resources. It includes energy from wind, water, ebb and flow, sunlight, as well as geothermal energy, which is obtained using geothermal sources.Moreover, nowadays one has some outlines of switching to electricity not only in cars. Electric vehicle technology is applicable for locomotives, off-road vehicles (construction and mining vehicles), ships, and to some extent to, aircraft (Mi and Masrur 13). Certainly, it is necessary to apply technologies that are not yet available to people for such developments. However, it will be possible in the future, which in
turn would entail a revolution in the context of energy use. Additionally, one will significantly improve the condition of the environment due to the fact that the number of emissions will approach zero. It would solve the climate issues and improve the air condition, which would positively affect the health of the population and flora and fauna. In other words, the use of electric transport has local and general long-term advantages.The application of electric engines will reduce the need to process materials and transport them to extract fuel and gasoline. Similar to burning gasoline in car engines, the refining oil process emits carbon dioxide. Moreover, a significant amount of pollution of the world’s oceans was provoked by waste from oil refining and accidents during the transportation of oil
or fuel. Oil spots resulting from spills due to accidents have a devastating effect on the flora and fauna of the ocean. Additionally, it negatively affects the microflora of the sea, which can lead to long-term negative consequences. Besides, harmful substances settled on the surface of the water due to fuel burnout during water transportation also negatively affect both the condition of the water and flora and fauna. Thus, the transition to electric cars has a positive impact not only on the air, usage of resources, and energy but also on the world’s oceans.Reducing car emissions around the world will have a significant positive impact on air quality, acid rains, smog, and climate change. The health effects of vehicle emissions are also of concern. Car noise is harmful
electric cars on the environment and on the future life. Moreover, it is possible to switch to electric engines not only in cars, which provoke the most of emissions among transportation types. There are plans to use electricity instead of fuel in trains, ships, and airplanes. It was found that the difference between the impact on the environment and air of electric cars and ones with combustion engines is significant. Moreover, it will have positive consequences in terms of the use of energy and natural resources.
An individual’s conflict resolution capability plays a critical role in teamwork skills. As per the results of the proposed questionnaire, my ability to handle interpersonal problems is moderate since I have received a score of 15 out of 21. This outcome suggests that I am rather good at managing minor disagreements with non-critical differences in the conflicting parties’ perspectives but may require professional assistance when confronting serious conflicts.From my perspective, the questionnaire was rather accurate in assessing my capability as a conflict mediator. Firstly, the result aligns with my reactions to disagreements in real-life situations in workplace contexts and personal life. For me, it is relatively easy to negotiate and propose win-win solutions in disagreements that center on non-essential aspects of collaboration, such as the distribution of minor
BackgroundWhile appearing to be simple stories about Damsels in distress, fairy tales are full of hidden messages that impact children’s perception of reality and influence their social relationships. Even though many fairy tales have been revised and rewritten over the years, they often remained their archaic and dichotomous worldviews, expressing discriminating gender roles and social norms, reinforced and propagated through a system of reward and punishment. Even in a more global and liberal world, the underlying values of these fairy tales continue to affect children, often unconsciously, for the rest of their lives. This research will explore several fairy tales, written by the Grimm Brothers, such as Cinderella, Snow White, and Briar Rose (Sleeping Beauty) that express, especially controversial social norms and gender roles. Through classroom discussions and
performances children reevaluate meanings, scrutinize stereotypes and opinions they may have formed prematurely after first reading the fairy tales. While critical thinking is often considered as a product of education, age, and experience, this research shows that critical thinking is a skill that can be encouraged and actively reinforced at a young age already. The benefits of fostering and implementing critical thinking in young children in the context of fairy tales is especially crucial as critical thinking helps mitigate the strong influence of these fairy tales on the personalities of young children.Research QuestionsThis research aims to find answers to the following questions: 1. How do particular Grimms’ fairy tales affect children’s perception of reality? 2. Can we develop critical thinking in children by, for example, engaging the fairy
tale context critically through reading, analyzing, reenacting (role play), and discussing it with them? 3. After increasing children’s critical thinking, can we note changes in their judgments concerning social norms 4. What are the issues, thoughts, or ideas that children mention concerning their perceptions of social norms within studied fairy tales?Significance of the StudyIn an era where children are exposed to a vast amount of information, often receiving conflicting messages, fostering critical thinking at a young age becomes especially imperative. Critical thinking skills help students acknowledge different perspectives and sources of information and so making them more compassionate towards other people’s opinions. Moreover, to be able to scan sources critically helps students evaluate content, potentially protect them from manipulation. The benefits of thinking independently, reflectively, and innovatively that
come with critical thinking are enormous. Most of all cultivating critical thinking helps students in their development as well-rounded human beings, able to make responsible and mature choices in life.Literature ReviewFairy talesFairy tales are defined as “traditional stories written for children that usually involves imaginary creatures and magic” (Cambridge dictionary). They are ordinarily meant for children and are characterized by extraordinary and grotesque elements such as wizards, goblins, elves, as well as nixies. The term “fairy” refers to the magical and fanciful setting of these tales. The term does not refer to the fairy character that a particular story presents. “Fairy tales are important pieces of children’s literature that have had a lasting impact on our society” (Nanda, 2104, 1). Fairy stories often refer to folk tales that
had been transferred from one generation to the next through story telling before being published in journals, chronicles or books.The Grimm BrothersThe Two early nineteenth century German authors, Jacob Ludwig Carl Grimm and Wilhelm Carl Grimm, collected fairy tales in what is usually called Grimm’s Fairy Tales , including Hansel and Gretel, Little Red Riding Hood, Rumpelstiltskin, Snow White, The Seven Dwarfs, and many others. According to Zipes (2015, 115), the early stories gathered by the Grimm Brothers are abrupt, rude, ridiculous, funny, and sad and the Grimms brothers never intended that they would be read aloud to youngsters. The stories are about children and families and how they dealt with challenging circumstances. The Grimms believed that the stories and morals came organically from the German people through
an oral tradition, and they sought to preserve them before the tales were lost forever. The Grimms made a distinctive contribution to folklore by collecting the tales. The Grimms intended to pass down oral tales to the German people, not expecting that these tales would become relevant in other cultures as well. Although Zipes (2015, 114) states that the narratives can be regarded as part of the German nationalist movement in the 19th century, they are also connected to stories from many other nations.Critical ThinkingCritical thinking, among others, helps students understand different perspectives and imagine life situations from different point of views. The ability to think critically reflectively facilitates forming judgments individually, responsibly and more ethically, which has implications for many aspects in our lives, including decisions making.
According to Florea and Hurjui (2015), critical thinking refers to fact examination in order to reach a conclusion or form a judgment. In other words, it is an essential skill that enhances learning during the early stages of life. According to the actual educational situation (static environment) and the development stage of critical thinking (dynamic environment), early learning exercises and participation activities are developed (Florea & Hurjui, 2015). There are various teaching methods. Including the composition skills of analyzing arguments, using inductive or deductive reasoning for reasoning, judgment, or evaluation, and making decisions or solving problems. Prior knowledge about a given topic is a necessary, but not sufficient condition for students to engage the subject critically.Critical thinking is a processing and problem-solving method established on intelligent, logical, and
cogent arguments. Furthermore, it includes the selection, evaluation, and verification of the right answer to a particular assignment. Critical thinking further provides adequate reasons for rejecting alternative solutions provided during the process. It is the process of learning to persistently combine different types of data to offer advantages and disadvantages, assess them to confirm the truth, modify information, and produce new conceptions. Additionally, it is a complicated, organized, and positive procedure essential in a person’s daily life. Similar to writing and reading, listening and speaking, it entails the process of thinking that originates from a point of accumulating positive data and utilizing it to obtain reasonable results.Previous Studies on Fairy Tales and Critical ThinkingAccording to recent research children engage in the same cognitive processes and are as capable
of critical thinking as adults (Lai, 2011, 465). Fairy tales play an important role in helping children to critically reflect on stereotypical nuances and gendered content narrated in various storybooks, preparing them for the challenges in the future. Transmitted through word of mouth from one generation to the next, storybooks are essential for entertainment and education. Storybooks reiterate imaginary situations that invigorate the brains of children and so encourage children to reflect, think critically, about various life situations. Children form opinions and make emotional judgments, face ethical dilemmas, recognize the importance of certain social situations and bonds, and formulate their own social responsibility (Lai, 2011, 466). Lai (2011, 466) adds that children are often able to distinctly appreciate the importance of family life, make important decisions when facing
ethical dilemmas,Pulimeno et al. (2020, 14) performed an experiment in order to investigate pedagogic, didactic, and psychological dimensions in children’s literature, with the objective of identifying its role in advancing students’ holistic progress and wellbeing. Researchers have found that 17 studies, conducted between 1960 and 2019, focused on the pedagogical features of children’s literature. (Pulimeno 2020, 15) From a pedagogical perspective, the values in fairy tales help children to make judgments about culturally fitting moral norms. For instance, in Cinderella , children developed an analytical savvy with which they were able to better reflect on the moral of the story which, in this context, included rebuking lying and not treating others in a wicked manner. Other studies Pulimeno conducted focused on the therapeutic and didactic dimensions of fairy
tales (Pulimeno, 2011, 34). From a didactic perspective, studies that highlighted that storybooks are a helpful resource in order to enhance a student’s learning skills as well as to establish respectful classroom environments. Reading or listening to fairy tales like Snow White , or Hansel and Gretel , allowed students to learn new words practice pronunciation and so to better express themselves. Similarly, from a therapeutic point of view, researchers discovered that mental health professionals use fairy tales and storybooks to create healthy relationships among students (Pulimeno, 2011, 18). In Cinderella , for example, the stepmother’s actions warn children not to be cruel, while in the story of Red Riding Hood the appearance of the wolf warns children to not eat unhealthily.Grimm’s fairies allow children to scrutinize gender
For example, Snow White and Sleeping Beauty are rescued from a deep sleep by a prince’s kiss and their relationship is described as true love. Moreover, Snow White, in her house with the seven dwarves, represents the perfect housewife.Erum writes that feminist movements such as the women’s liberation criticized the roles attributed to women in Grimm’s Fairy Tales fairy tales and therefore rewrote some of them. In their revisions, they highlighted masculine characters to female characters. Such revisions demonstrate how meanings are not fixed and can be altered easily just by changing the story line (Erum 2009). Presenting different versions to students, they learn how to distinguish the different social norms and understand what the reason for a certain change was.
IntroductionA front-load machine usually refers to an appliance whereby the user will be loading clothes using an opening found at the front side of the washer. The devices have a distinct detergent drawer whereby an individual places the powder to use in washing. One of its benefits is that it is more energy-efficient than other laundry machines such as top loaders. They save on time used for drying because water drains out of the clothes more effectively. In addition, it is environment-friendly since they require fewer detergents, which means fewer chemicals will be released to the groundwater and soil. Its tumbling movement uses less power from the dryer and the washer, reducing the greenhouse effect in households.Furthermore, this washer has a large drum that lacks a central axis,
which means there is typically more space for laundry so that one can fit large loads into each cycle. Furthermore, the washing machine’s whirling motion depends on the gravitational pull to toss the garments over one another within the washer drum, making it rotate faster (Majewski & Ahearn, 2019). This creates increased friction among the items, resulting in a higher cleaning performance using less water. Another benefit is that the washers can be stacked on the drying machine, saving space in the utility room. This factor makes them ideal for smaller homes and apartments and makes it easier to unload and load. The machine uses paddles on the side of the drum and does not have an agitator meaning that they are generally gentle on the loads.The purpose
of instruction and procedure is to enlighten my target audience, both small-scale and large-scale households, of using a front load washing machine, which is a huge time saver. An individual can load the items on the device, begin the cycle, and walk away, so there is no need to sit and monitor the washing process. A user must read the labels since following the listed garments guidelines will increase the machine’s service life. They should never overload the dryer as this may cause a breakdown to the device, and they should sort the clothes by material color, type, and water temperature.Parts of a Front Load WasherOne of the parts of a washer is a water inlet control valve. It is located close to the water inlet point, and
it closes and opens automatically when clothes are loaded based on the quantities of water needed. Secondly, a water pump is applied to discharge water in the spin cycle and flow through the wash cycle. The third part is the paddles which are structured to move the fabric during the wash to allow the detergent to function, helping the loads to rub together while washing to remove soiling and dirt particles from the clothes. The heating system boils water up inside the machine to the required temperature. Furthermore, the printed circuit board contains all the electrical appliances that operate the washing machine. It can be automated, serving as the artificial intelligence for the washer, and at times determining the time required for rinsing. After cleaning, all the dirty
water is expelled from the machine through a discharge pipe.Working DefinitionThe front-load washing machine functions by filling the base of the inner tube with little water and using gravity and rotation of the tub to pass the clothes through the water. The side agitator inside the drum lifts the garments and moves them forward and backward in the water. This gives the cleansing effect required to get rid of dirt from clothes effectively when the cleaning process begins.Required StepsStep 1: The user should follow the guidelines on the detergent bottle; for dirtier clothes, they should use more washing powder.Step 2: It involves placing the dirty clothes into the washer’s drum, ensuring that there is enough space left for the load to move around the wash. If the user’s
palm fits between the machine and the fabric, it implies that the device has been loaded correctly.Step 3: This step entails adding a fabric conditioner to the dispensing drawer, and this should be made with caution not to fill past the top line; otherwise, it may not dispense at all.Step 4: This stage entails setting the optimum temperature based upon the labels of fabric care on the clothes. In the case of multiple temperatures, one should choose the lowest one.Step 5: This phase involves choosing the correct spin cycle; the durable clothes work better with faster cycles, while delicate require a slower one.Step 6: This step involves closing the door and pressing to unload the clean laundry immediately for maximum freshness, more preferably at least within two hours
of the cycle’s end.Washing Machine SettingsIt is essential to choose the correct settings in the instrument panel for the washing machines because the settings selected may influence the lifespan and color of the clothes. Hot water may give cleaner clothes even though it can cause fibers of the clothes to shrink and colors to bleed. Typically, the user should countercheck the tags on clothing for each item to know its right settings for washing. Some specify their specific temperature settings, while others are recommended to be hand washed. Normal cycles are mostly preferred for sheets, cotton, and linens.The delicate setting is for light clothing like those written handwash only and silks. Darks is recommended for bright or dull colors in a casual fabric and is mainly designed for
dyed items that may bleed. Moreover, heavy-duty is used for large loads of colorfast clothes, sturdy and heavily soiled items, and can be used for blankets, rugs, heavy bedding, and comforters. Super speed is meant for small loads of lightly soiled garments that need to be washed quickly. Lastly, the water is expelled in the spin cycle, allowing the garments to spin off excess water.Using the WasherThe operator should pile clothes high up, making sure not to cram them beyond the last row of holes at the front while loading. Several steps should be followed while unloading the washer safely. One should use a stool to reach into the washing machine and a folded carpet to protect the knees. This is followed by lifting the basket with a
good form, using the hands to support, then lastly, turning the feet in the direction of the body. Below is a guide on how to put softener and detergents.The user should begin by placing the laundry into the machine without exceeding the inner-tub level, pouring recommended amount of washing powder in the dispenser, and pushing the start button. This makes water flow into the dispenser, releasing the detergents into the tub; afterward, this is followed by adding a suitable softener without surpassing the maximum fill line. The water will automatically flow into the dispenser during the final rinsing cycle, sending the softener into the tub. Applying the proper cycle for spinning and washing will aid clean the clothes and keep them looking their best.Maintaining the Front Load washerOne
of the tips for maintaining washers is to apply the recommended washing powder and the minimum amount suggested. The users must consciously scrutinize stickers since some of the regular detergents give much more suds with time, can create a film in the hoses that become a breeding ground for molds. The finished loads should be removed immediately because they provide an ideal breeding condition for mildew and musty smells when left to remain in the machine. When not in use, the washer door should remain ajar to improve air circulation within the device.Safety Measures and PrecautionsThe laundry products should be kept in their original containers with their labels and closed tightly when not in use. Care should be taken not to mix household cleaners since some chemical mixtures
When you realize that there is no electricity flowing into the washer, an individual is required to confirm the household electrical panel to inspect if the circuit breakers have been tripped. Secondly, when the motor is overheated, the washing machine will shut down to cool before starting it. The lid must permanently be shut for the switch to activate and check if the button is positioned correctly and in good repair.
Now humanity lives in an age of rapid information and technological progress; many technologies are being imported into every person’s daily life. Information technologies, in particular the Internet, permeate the environment of every person and become almost invisible. One of the relatively new concepts is the Internet of Things (IoT). IoT defines as a network of physical objects with built-in technologies that allow interacting with the external environment, transmitting information about their state and receiving data from the outside.Internet of Things implies connecting devices into a chain and allowing them to collect and analyze information. It involves processing and transmitting data to other objects through software, applications or technical devices. IoT devices function independently without requiring human-to-computer interaction. Nonetheless, people can customize such devices or provide access to
IntroductionRacism is a belief in certain human beings who possess or have different behavioral characteristics that correspond to inherited attributes. Racial inequalities have also manifested in most American societies through the racial differences in the health sector, bankruptcy, police brutality, housing privileges, unemployment rates, and incarceration rates (Barkan, 2017). Therefore, this research paper will look at racial and ethnic inequality and healthcare as a social problem.Summary of the ArticleIn the news article titled “A history of race and racism in America,” racial inequality is regarded as a form of American tradition as black people earn close to less than 23% compared to their fellow American counterparts. The black people in America also have a higher probability of getting incarcerated on a specific day. During early 1991, several black
people were under the correction system’s jurisdiction compared to colleges, universities, and other learning institutions (Kendi, 2017). However, over recent years, there has been an increase in social progress and economic barometers. Nevertheless, the country still has a lot of work to do and implement policies to give black people equal rights. The black people also firmly believe that someday they will have equal rights just like their American counterparts (Kendi, 2017). In addition, most Americans tend to think that being white is a privilege in society. At the same time, close to half of the population in America says that being black or Hispanic influences one’s ability to get ahead.Analysis of the Article Concerning Health Care as a Social ProblemRace is among the four social concepts that
refer to inherited features and characteristics such as skin color, facial features, and structure. In the US, it is pretty more straightforward for one to notice that people differ physically as some people tend to have dark skin. In contrast, others have white skin and this in some cases leads to discrimination or racial inequality (Valdez & Golash-Boza, 2017). Ethnicity is another form of social concept; it is regarded as one of the most complex forms of a social construct as it plays a vital role in impacting personal identity and how people relate socially.Prejudice and stereotypes are another form of a social concept or construct as it entails a negative attitude, what someone feels, or what one believes. An illustration of this is how some individuals, especially
in the healthcare environment, think that black Americans are inferior and do not deserve premium healthcare services. Most black Americans have poor health care outcomes compared to whites, Asians, and even Hispanics. For example, black women are close to 3% times more likely to die due to maternal issues than white women. In addition, the infant mortality rate among black women per 1000 births is a higher number than that of the US, which is 5.8 (Barkan, 2017). However, the vent may vary from one state to another. Nonetheless, social stratification is also a social construct that plays a crucial role in ranking people and classifying them in society. It also brings several universal inequalities as it advocates for unequal distribution of resources, promoting discrimination and racial and
inequalities over the past years were an American dilemma as there were no appropriate policies and regulations for curbing this challenge. However, after the 1960 demonstrations and riots, the discrimination against black Americans became a topic of discussion. Moreover, it is clear that racial and ethnic inequalities are depicted through police brutality, income, education, and health statistics. Although in the recent years there has been an increase in diversity and social progress.
Swimmer Lia Thomas attended the University of Pennsylvania as a student. In 2021, the media focused on her successes in sports as a trans woman. Lia Thomas, a first-time competitor in the women’s division, had a strong showing. Early in December, she had her greatest college results of the year in Ohio, when she competed in the two hundred and five hundred meter sprints. After Lia Thomas’ successes at university swimming pools, she was criticized following the fact that she was born a male, which gave him an advantage. Some people argued that because Thomas was taking testosterone therapy, he had an unfair advantage over other athletes. Describing her victory to be unfair was completely wrong following the fact that trans genders are always allowed to compete by
in the past seasons is a testament to his hard work and dedication. He has shown that transgender athletes can also be as successful as anyone else and should be respected for their achievements. However, the fact is that Thomas has been subject to all the same testing and regulations as any other athlete. He was not allowed to take more testosterone than any other male athlete, and his testosterone levels are closely monitored by officials. A year-long course of testosterone-suppressing therapy was prescribed following NCAA guidelines for the swimmer’s recovery. These restrictions have been deemed inadequate by the Women’s Sports Policy Task Force, for example, in the case of athletes who begin their transitioning after puberty.

The plot of the biography, identified and formed by the Ackerman Institute for the Family in the life of the heroine, consists of dynamics, personality development and its patterns. The genre affiliation of
this publication is defined as a popular science biography. This work is addressed to a special audience and meets the requirements of verifiability and consistency.The degree of the author’s presence in the biography, and the amount of transformation of life events are insignificant. Interpretation of life events and logical analysis are carried out without moral evaluation, there is no emotional coloring. Since authors are objective, and there is no biased interpretation of the life events of Beverly Greene, the source can be called accurate and valid. It has documentary and scientific features, devoid of stylistic picturesqueness or imagery. The authors of the biography do not bring their life experience and values to the study in any way. The text of the biography is organized through a consistent description
of verified and repeatedly verified facts. A special scientific concept is summed up under the description of events; this biography is a scientific study. The narrative about the personality of Beverly Greene is built on verifiable facts.This source was very useful, as it allows the reader to get a fairly clear idea of the origin and scientific path of Beverly Greene, which are necessary to understand the context of the psychologist’s views. After presenting this work, the reader can get an idea of how the scientist’s life path influenced the formation of her new scientific theories. By reading this article, it can be also tracked which events in the life of Beverly Greene preceded the making of discoveries in the field of psychology and the emergence of new
ideas in her. Due to the information presented by the authors, it is possible to observe in what conditions the information accumulated by different scientific disciplines formed into a single picture. Ensuring productive interdisciplinary interaction of history and psychology helped in solving the difficult problem of identifying the concept of the flow of scientific knowledge in Beverly Greene.Rubin, L. (2022). Beverly Greene on Race, Racism and Psychotherapy . Psychology. Web.This article deals with the peculiarities of the psychotherapeutic work of people suffering from racism. The reader is presented with an interview with Beverly Greene, who raises the problem of racism and considers it from the perspective of psychotherapy. The focus of the professional activity of the psychologist includes clients who have suffered from racial discrimination. Beverly Greene gives
a detailed answer to the question of how racial stereotypes, prejudice, discrimination affect psychological health. The psychologist also refers to the situation with George Floyd as an example illustrating the actual problem of modernity. Beverly Greene emphasizes that the signs of nationality should act as an incentive for a psychologist to show increased attention and alertness to the presence of injuries associated with the experience of discrimination.The main advantage of this publication is its objectivity which in this case does not mean the mathematical accuracy of the transmission of the scientific position expressed by Beverly Greene. Rather, it is the coverage of the conversation with her, excluding emotions and separating facts from opinions. Such objectivity is associated with the structure of writing a text in a form of
as useful as possible. The reader can see not only the specific view of the Beverly Greene person on the specifics of working with patients affected by racism. It is also possible to assess the level of her education and culture, calculate the angles of her worldview and identify her high competence in psychology. If there is a lack of understanding of what the respondent is talking about, the interviewer asks her clarifying questions, so that everything said is definitely presented in an accessible form for the reader.
In the modern world, news stations and physical news media such as newspapers are often disregarded, with many people turning to social media as a more reliable source of current events. Although most people still get their news from the more old-fashioned sources, 48% of Americans are cited to obtain their news from social media (Walker & Matsa, 2021). The media most used as a news source, according to the same survey, is Facebook, followed by YouTube, Twitter, and Instagram (Walker & Matsa, 2021). Overall, there is a general distrust in the population towards the mainstream news sources such as CNN, NBC, and FOX. Approximately 65% of Americans believe that they are being “misled” by “journalists and reporters” who report “false or gross exaggerations” (Meek, 2021). Therefore, there
A strategic initiative in a business organization is a comprehensive plan that links up the companies’ objectives and its future goals and visions. Based on the results and outcomes from the SWOT analysis we conducted, as a measure to assess the establishment’s strengths, weaknesses, opportunities, and threats, my team came up with a tremendous life-changing initiative to upgrade the financial management of the DIVERSICARE HEALTHCARE organization. Referring to the financial statements we looked into, one of them being the organization’s income statement, it is discovered that the business was not on a sound financial footing and hence required critical and quick changes to rescue it from potential financial crises.Some of the changes agreed upon for the organization’s financial betterments were that the organization would look into ways of
reducing operational costs as lowest as possible to increase its gross profit. Reduction of these costs will create room to reduce expenses on the business, and hence with fewer expenses, the revenue increases; therefore, the organization will increase profit. For the coming financial years, an increase in sales revenue was also suggested by strategizing on the best possible ways to bring revenue in. The revenue would be increased by reducing the overall labor costs for the business, reducing the insurance premiums, and finally reducing the organization’s utilities to maximize incomes and save on expenses (Fischer et al., 2018). All these changes set aside had the same outcomes, and that was that it would have maximized and stabilized the business’s financial standing by increasing its revenue and hence a
high business growth rate.The budget figure below illustrates the proposed comprehensive plan and a simple budget to accomplish all changes and obligations after the financial management was revised and improved.1.

America is a large continent, where today, a huge number of different nationalities and representatives of different races, genders, orientations, and ethnic groups live. Thus, diversity is an essential part of American society as it plays a vital role in the relationship between people and influences their interaction. I had plenty of encounters with individuals who reflect diversity in my everyday life. That has impacted me as a personality and contributed to the values and views towards discrimination that I have today.I remember that when I started to go to school, my family and I moved to a district where the prevailing party of our neighbors was black people. A lot of my classmates also were Afro-Americans, which at the first time was surprising for me as a
Diversity is one issue that has been observed in several institutions in the world. People from different walks of life are united through religion, education, entertainment, and living together. When people embrace their differences, existing peacefully becomes a result (Bell, 2021). However, when people cannot harmonize their differences and coexist, chaos becomes the character of existence. Education is one of the significant aspects that bring people from diverse backgrounds together. Some researchers have identified diversity to affect students’ performance in their studies. The diversity of the students comes in terms of ethnic, racial, gender, and age distribution. This paper seeks to research the impact of the above factors on performance in my school.Age and gender cause a difference in performance in my school. According to the research, the
composition of females and males in the school is15000 and 13500 respectively. This means that the number of females admitted to my school is slightly higher than males accepted each year. According to my research, 9% of females graduated with distinction while 15% of males graduated with distinction. This finding indicates a performance difference between males and females that other factors may cause. Another research done from the different learning institutions show that males perform averagely better than females, though there is a slight difference in performance (Bush et al., 2017). Most of the students in my college are 17 to 24 years of age. From the research findings, age does not have a significant influence on performance. However, the findings also indicated that some students who enter
college at an advanced age are likely to take academic work seriously more than the younger ones.Moreover, racial and ethnic diversity may also influence students’ performance in my school. The racial composition of students in the school is; 70% white, 25% African American and 5% others. The students’ performance at graduation is not affected by their races as there is no statistical evidence of a particular race performing better than others. However, most African American excels in their college education compared to the other races. Another research indicates that few African Americans graduate from high school to college, but the few get good performance (Roksa et al., 2016). According to the study, the ethnic groups were well distributed and had no significant difference in academic performance.While doing the
There is sufficient reason to think that the two-nucleotide code evolved to form the current triplet genetic code. With this in mind, one can conclude that the number of amino acids was slightly less than the current 20 because the two nucleotide codes could constitute only 16 amino acids. Sixteen possible combinations of the four nucleotide bases of the DNA would give rise to the 16 amino acids. Therefore, it posits that the ancient primitive proteins constituted fewer amino acids encoded by the two-nucleotide code. Furthermore, deletion or insertion mutation experiments of one or two nucleotides into a gene formed no protein (Frank & Froese, 2018). However, the reading frame of the mRNA got restored once a third nucleotide was deleted or inserted. Nonetheless, the current triplet genetic
code entails 64 codons encoding for the twenty amino acids.The genetic code is termed degenerate, where a single amino acid can specify more than one codon. Each codon specifies a single amino acid, while the amino acids can have more than two codons. For instance, tryptophan and methionine have a single codon each except for UGA, UAG, and UAA termination codons. Isoleucine has three codons, valine, threonine, and glycine, proline, and alanine have four codons. Arginine, serine, and leucine have six codons, and the remaining nine amino acids have two codons (Frank & Froese, 2018). The genetic code’s degeneracy feature helps prove that in ancient times, there was a two-nucleotide code that translated into the 16 amino acids in primitive proteins. The first two bases of each codon
have greater specificity than the third. The connection between the mRNA and tRNA anticodon of the first two bases is often stronger. The third base loosely pairs with its corresponding anticodon base.The DNA sample with a G + C content of 70 percent will require more temperature than the G + C content of 45 percent to separate its strands. The DNA double helix stability that constitutes two complementary polynucleotide chains that interact via the hydrogen bonds depends on several factors. They include the length of the chains, sequence, base composition, and the presence of mismatches. A factor like alterations in temperature can further perturb this stability. A DNA sample with higher G + C content is more stable than the one with a low G + C
As economic concepts, the notions of income and wealth are not to be conflated. While income is used to denote a sum of money received regularly within a specific period, wealth means net worth (Fuller et al., 2020). From a democratic perspective, social equality requires equal distribution of capital, which leads to the question of whether economic equality should be defined by the equality of income or that wealth. Since equality suggests equal chances to exert power within society, the level of wealth appears to be the primary factor, defining wealth to a significant extent, the income also plays a major role in building democracy.When viewing democracy as the opportunity for all citizens to participate in shaping state policies and gaining political influence, one could connect wealth to
Mercator is a commonly used projection, but it does not adequately represent the real size of the country. The most common complaint is that the size of the country is extremely biased. The sizes of Greenland and Africa are classic examples. According to the Mercator projector, they have the same size. The Mercator projection mistakenly exaggerates the size of Europe and North America. Greenland, which appears as a huge frozen land in the Mercator projection, has shrunk dramatically. The African Continent occupies a far more prominent place on this new life-size map. Distorted sizes aren’t just worrisome, as they give the wrong impression of what the world looks like. In relation to non-white nations, Mercator is expanding and perhaps increasing the importance of white nations.As far as I
an increasingly globalized world, having relevant geographic knowledge is essential. Misunderstandings about the size of continents can disappear as people become accustomed to maps of the same area and the spherical Earth. My view of the world changed when I realized that the Mercator projection wasn’t accurate. I understand that the actual size of a country may differ from the size and proportions shown on the map.
Dreaming is an exciting and still inexplicable human experience that occurs entirely in one’s brain during sleeping. Before taking this course, I was skeptical about the value of dreams. Indeed, I was influenced mainly by the studies that explained this phenomenon from the point of continuous activity of people’s minds that processes daily routine during the night. However, after studying various sources about our visions during sleep, I understood the reasoning behind less scientific explanations. This class allowed me to be more attentive to dreams to understand my emotional problems and helped me learn about the causes of students’ nightmares.The new information that interested me was the dreaming experiences of Jordanian students that were similar to their counterparts from Western countries. It was unusual to learn from this
chapter by Nasser & Bulkeley (2009) that negative dreams were recalled and reported more frequently. Most of the participants’ nightmares had some association with their daily concerns. Dreaming about elements of the supernatural world, like jinn, was the reflection of these individuals’ cultural and religious beliefs (Nasser & Bulkeley, 2009). Even though it is logical to think that people’s habits and thoughts would appear in their dreams, it was still fascinating to read how their brains were able to reconstruct these ideas into realistic images. I used to dream about book and movie characters, but I only recently admitted that my mind could create imaginary scenarios involving me in these fictional stories. Analyzing my behavior in these nightmares revealed that I isolated myself from my friends and became
lonely in dreams. Indeed, I realized that our brains might generate visions to prepare us for similar challenges in the future.The prophetic dreams of some people remain a mystery, and I am less skeptical about these cases after reading Icelandic stories. Specifically, the article by Heijnen (2005) made me alter my viewpoint about dreaming. Before enrolling in this course, I could relate to those Icelanders, mentioned in the paper by Heijnen (2005), who “qualify dreams as personal fantasies not worth much pondering upon” (p. 194). Although I did not become superstitious about nightmares after reading this manuscript, I started to be more careful about the psychology behind episodes that my friends or I may see while asleep.There is no certainty in the authenticity of the stories presented in
In the introduction to his book, Drive-Thru Dreams: A Journey through the Heart of America’s Fast-Food Kingdom, Adam Chandler uses pathos as the central appeal to convince the audience in the strength of his reasoning. The Fries that Bind tells the story of the joy that was brought to a small Alaskan town by the fast-food giant Taco Bell. The employment of vivid imagery and emphasis on provoking emotions in his readers help the author reach his goal and make one think about the role fast-food culture plays in the American society. The claim that Chandler (2019) makes – that fast-food is an integral part of the American way of life – intrigues the audience and compels them to read the book. The story provided in the introduction
Colorado mountains. The build-up to the facility’s rugged workers being reliant on fast-food chains to provide them food takes a reader’s breath away and makes them want to explore the rest of the book. Schlosser’s (2012) claim is similar to the one Chandler (2019) makes: fast-food, its history and influence on the United States’ national culture are impossible to ignore. Support to the story is provided by a couple-of-pages-long foreword, epitomizing the fast-food industry’s influence in facts and numbers, as well as in the author’s reasoning about the cultural impact it has made. The book is intended for every American who wants to find out more about the subject.
Atlantic City is a famous coastal city in New Jersey characterized by its beaches and developed entertainment industry. The city is relatively small in both size and population. There are several local casinos, many hotels, recreation centers, and shops. The prevalent part of the population of Atlantic City consists of African-Americans and Caucasians. Local shops are tourist-oriented and provide a wide variety of souvenirs and vintage goods such as books and wine. Since Atlantic City is a city located near the ocean, many local restaurants specialize in seafood. The average income for an individual who resides in Atlantic City, per the 2021 was only 29,232 USD for a household.The culture and ambiance may be categorized as a “party” or “fun” city. Because of this, alcohol and drugs are very popular among residents, which may pose a community health issue and is applicable for all ages entering or residing within the city. Additionally, this issue may only amplify, as a new law was passed in 2020 allowing for the public consumption of alcohol within the city’s tourism district. Unfortunately, alcohol is a part of the city’s culture and is embraced, even with the potential long term effects drinking can cause to a person’s health. Luckily, there is an Alcoholics Anonymous outreach facility for those who find themselves in need of such assistance and several medical emergency facilities, including psychiatric and behavorial health facilities.
Beverly Daniel Tatum, a prominent expert on education and psychology, argues that racial identity is one of the most pressing matters in contemporary society. The issue of discrimination against people of color is ubiquitous despite democracy and international law. Why are all the black kids sitting together in the cafeteria?: And other conversations about race is the author’s sincere monolog about injustice, which provides insight into its grounds, effects, and approaches to overpower it.The book reveals the issue of inequality from multiple angles, and it is demanding to pick out a few leading ideas, as Tatum tries to cover distinct topics in a certain number of pages. She starts with a definition of racism and explains that it is challenging to have an honest conversation about race due
to its negative stigma. Furthermore, the author’s point is to define the state of discrimination in the country and the world nowadays and explore what steps need to be taken to develop identity. The book educates readers on how black people perform in white society and how white ones act in their community, noting the various subtleties and characteristics of security and privilege.Moreover, one of the central themes is the concern of patience and silence. People need to understand that black children sit together because they feel understood and can develop a part of their identity that remains unformed without these connections. They think that other individuals are incapable of sharing their values, and therefore it is unsafe to be a part of their circle. One of the
first efforts to comprehend systemic discrimination is eliminating the fear, shame, and protection around the word racist. Whether white or colored, everyone is exposed to the smog of stereotypes, misinformation, prejudice, and disregarded history.There is a tendency, especially among whites, to deny the existence of systemic racism because accepting it as truth is like admitting that they are racist, and that needs to be altered. The author’s idea is that there must be a clear distinction between the negative attitudes, assumptions, and stereotypes that one person may project on another and how racism operates in society. If everyone understood discrimination as a set of policies and practices that systematically give white people an advantage over people of color, the matter would become apparent.Why are all the black kids
sitting together in the cafeteria?: And other conversations about race raises fundamental issues of discrimination that are particularly acute in education. The negative racial biases that black children face lead to frequent suspensions, resulting in excessive absences and the fact that they cannot receive the same quality of education as their white counterparts. After reading, it becomes apparent that it is necessary to create encouraging conditions for communication between diverse students. It is the educator who can control the nature of this interaction directly. The book helps comprehend that education is the most promising tool to fight racism and build inclusive societies. Children can and should be taught equality, respect, and tolerance from a young age. Moreover, the author’s thoughts inspire a shift in the approach to learning
so that students of color feel empowered rather than victimized. Equally meaningful is communicating to white children and explaining their role in discrimination counteracting.Education contributes to building a global community in which integrity, ethics, non-discrimination, and respect for the rule of law are essential pillars. The author’s central message emphasizes the educator’s role in developing the students’ ability to operate existing or acquired knowledge to alter their behavior. It is necessary to promote proper conduct in appropriate circumstances, such as making ethical decisions and speaking out against discrimination. Fighting something as pervasive as systemic racism may seem like an impossible task for an educator, but Tatum emphasizes that everyone can start with their sphere of influence. Every individual has some impact on the lives of others and is
racism.In conclusion, Why are all the black kids sitting together in the cafeteria?: And other conversations about race is a book that explains the hardships that people of color experience. Despite the controversial ideas, the author describes the causes of inequality in an accessible manner and points out that everyone can enhance the situation if they take action. Thus, this book is helpful to everyone, especially the educator, who lays the foundation of the relationship between diverse groups of children.
Drug addiction is a terrible epidemic that destroys many lives, and therefore many countries of the world are waging war on drugs. However, the methods used, insufficient data quality, and biases affecting the course of the struggle have negative consequences. Laws against drugs have a disproportionate impact on national minorities, women, and other oppressed groups. At the same time, the roots of the addiction problem, which lie in poverty and social inequality, are often ignored. Despite all the dangers of drugs, the fight against them should not worsen the living conditions for the population and aggravate injustice.The problem of racism in America’s justice system is particularly acute. The American system is the largest globally and contains the most prisoners. At the same time, people of color, especially African-Americans,
Alcohol and substance abuse is a massive issue in New Jersey, and one of its outcomes is the opioid epidemic that emerged in the state during the last decade. In 2021, Governor Phil Murphy passed several bills based on the provision of harm reduction services, hypodermic syringe distribution, and local drug overdose fatality review teams established to respond to the challenge (State of New Jersey’s Department of Health, 2022). The latter is a relatively new policy for New Jersey, and local communities are discussing its impact on population health and healthcare services practice. Bill A798/S52 is deployed according to the example of other states where opioid use is regulated legislatively, and people with sufficient knowledge and experience in working with addiction treatment are involved (Senate Health, Human Services
and Senior Citizens Committee 2021). This paper aims to critically analyze the policy about local drug overdose fatality review teams’ establishment and discuss how it aligns with the concepts of advocacy, population health, and the ANA ethical statements.The Bill A798/S52Legislative regulation is essential to fight against the opioid epidemic because it provides sufficient power to make practice changes, track and eliminate violations, and predict improvements. Bill A798/S52 was officially released on January 18, 2022, to establish local drug overdose fatality review teams and provide healthcare and social support for people with alcohol and drug addictions (State of New Jersey’s Department of Health, 2022). The primary sponsors were Verrelli, Vainieri Huttle, Armato/Singer, and Greenstein; they also participated in passing other opioid epidemic-related regulations. The policy identifies the responsible groups’
activities, such as developing methods to decrease the number of overdoses statewide, researching the causes of abuse to recommend further legislative updates, and supporting the affected (Senate Health, Human Services and Senior Citizens Committee 2021). Consequently, the main aim the drug overdose fatality review teams will pursue is to become the trusted medium between the people in need and the government.Bill A798/S52 is beneficial for the population’s health even though it does not include any direct intervention or medical services providence. As the drug overdose fatality review teams will be formed in multiple areas, they will improve the government’s data collection and timely notice of serious deviations even in the smallest towns (Artiga & Hinton, 2018). Furthermore, New Jersey’s Commissioner of Health responsible for the groups’ operations will
have to coordinate the abuse situation with the local healthcare organizations and provide additional sources when necessary. The concept of advocacy enabled support for the vulnerable on the legislative level and allow them to explain the causes of New Jersey’s opioid epidemic (Artiga & Hinton, 2018). Indeed, the teams will observe and communicate with the affected people, and additional options to help them prevent addictions might occur, leading to a decrease in drug abuse prevalence.Nursing practitioners involved in helping addicts or practicing in healthcare organizations with relevant departments would benefit the drug overdose fatality review teams, and it is ethically correct to join them. The bill does not identify any specific professional requirements for the potential participants; they only must have experience in social or healthcare work with
improvement.The opioid epidemic is one of the severest health challenges for New Jersey and developing workable legislation to address it is urgent for the county’s population. Bill A798/S52 submits the demand for the specific local drug overdose fatality review teams and identifies their rights and obligations. The establishment of novel regulations is beneficial for New Jersey’s healthcare as it will result in a more precise view of vulnerable people’s issues, attention, and help initiatives from communities and organizations.
Primary education for children in bilingual immigrant families can be challenging for parents. They often face problems of cultural inconsistency, that is, a lack of understanding of certain self-evident norms and traditions. For example, in the United States, it is common practice for parents to attend school, while in South Korea this behavior is considered impolite. Parents can also experience psychological discomfort when communicating with teachers due to language barriers. Therefore, family engagement is the most common approach to reduce the distance between teachers and parents and improve communication. This paper aims to discuss how family engagement and other teaching strategies address the needs of dual language learners.Dual Language Learners and Family EngagementDual language learners (DLL) are students who are educated in a language different from the one,
primarily spoken at their homes. Interestingly, these students often also face a different cultural setting. DLLs usually are US-born children of immigrants, and sometimes of US-born parents. The most populous immigrant groups in California are Spanish, Vietnamese, Korean, and Tagalog. Since the immigrant population usually presents a considerable cohort of US citizens there are widespread educational practices developed specifically for the DLLs. For instance, the strategy of family engagement was created to improve the communication between the DLL’s parents and teachers.The US educational system recognizes the importance of the family in the process of learning new knowledge. Therefore, the concept of engagement was introduced at an early stage in the scientific discussion of DLL learning strategies. The idea behind this concept is to provide broader expectations for the
families of students, that is, the perception of them as a strong partner with many opportunities. In other words, the modern US educational system is based on the idea that the family has more wisdom about the education of children than the school curriculum. In this regard, one of the main goals and objectives of the system is to create the prerequisites for improved interaction between families and schools.Equally important are such generally accepted concepts in the educational system as cultural capital, social capital, and human capital, as well as the approach based on the ecological theory fundamentals. In general, the ecological theory considers the children’s developmental systems such as proximal systems and distal systems. Proximal systems are the systems common for learners like school, and home, this
is a tangible system in which the students exist. At the same time, the distal system is the concept that describes the more intangible, ideological aspects of learning like culture and neighborhoods.There is also a perception that these two systems present a bi-directional interaction, which is also studied. According to the theory, the only way to establish optimal learning is to harmonize the two systems. Then, the concept of cultural capital embodies the idea of the cultural knowledge, beliefs, and customs inherent among the students’ family members. At the same time, social capital refers to the students’ social networks as valuable assets of support and influence. Finally, human capital is the concept describing students ‘personal qualities that help them succeed in the learning process. These qualities may include
the initial education, competencies, and skills, as well as the personal attributes.Scholarly DiscourseScholars generally recognize the family engagement approach as correct and offer ways to implement this approach within the school curriculum and lesson plans. For example, Quin et al. (2018) recognize the importance of introducing the ecological model for students ‘learning development and consider the most critical factors inherent in the model, such as teacher’s support that has a high positive relation with the student’s engagement. The scholars also admit the great influence on behalf of the students’ community, family, and peers. Quin et al. (2018) determined the factors perceived as protective concerning the learning success. These are teacher support, academic grades, prior engagement, family management practices, and others. The risk factors included antisocial peer affiliation, community
disorganization, absences from school, and school dropout.Although these factors were developed for the 10th and 11th graders, they are also appropriate for younger students, as they discuss the common situation of receiving education by younger and older children. Interestingly, these factors could be introduced into the initial and more generally perceived family engagement approach since, according to the scholars ’report, they have shown a high potential. The presented information can as well be used to develop the requirements and evaluations of the students ’success and when looking for the red flags in students’ school performance. For example, teachers could develop questionnaires for parents where family members could answer questions related to the presence or absence of risk factors or supportive factors.Consultation is one of the acceptable forms of
family engagement in the learning process. Teachers can provide valuable insights on which home-based family practices will be most effective for DLL students. For instance, there are widespread and commonly accepted practices or characteristics of family engagement. These practices include joint decision making, regular two-way communication, collaboration with teachers and exchange of knowledge, learning in-home and in the community, and joint family-program setting of learning goals. Therefore, the consultations can be seen as the feature of the two-way communication between the teachers and family.Smith et al. (2019) assert that consultations are an appropriate way of promoting family-school engagement. They positively correlate with the children’s social-behavioral competence, academic achievement, and mental health. No less important, consultations affect the relational outcomes, parent practices, and parent attitudes (Smith et al., 2019).
Therefore, the scholars conclude that there is strong evidence that consultations improve the critical students’ outcomes. Importantly, this claim also correlates with the family engagement approach.Interestingly, given that the practice of counseling is so beneficial for both teachers and students, teachers should include weekly parenting counseling in their curriculum and create separate programs to engage and motivate parents. The implementation of such plans will create an environment in which children can receive support in learning both at home and school. Given the general difficulties faced by DLLs, this educational environment can be an indispensable condition for the quality assimilation of new knowledge.Teacher-training programs are a particular factor that has a positive influence on DLL’s educational success. Interestingly, these practices can be seen in the framework of the ecological
theory, as an inherent part of the proximal system which usually consists of students ‘family and school support systems. Smith and Sheridan (2017) studied how the teacher-training practices (TTP) influence the DLLs’ social-emotional, behavioral and academic development. The scholars reported that the TTP also impacted the teachers’ knowledge, attitudes, and family engagement practices. The latter showed a high positive correlation, providing evidence for advice to implement the TTP as a handy tool to improve the students’ school performance. Smith and Sheridan suggested considering the TTP components like communication strategies, problem-solving and collaborative planning to develop future TTP practices. The practices studied were professional development programs, teacher in-service programs, and preservice university courses. Given the above, the school administrations should encourage the teachers ‘professional development and create the prerequisites
IntroductionDuke Ellington is an American composer and pianist who played a major role in the revolution of Jazz music across America. Ellington recorded his music with his band and became one of the composers of distinctive jazz sounds highlighted in his concert in Copenhagen in 1965. His band is comprised of fourteen members whereby each is tasked to play a different musical instrument during the performance. The members of Ellington’s ensemble include Duke Ellington, Billy Strayhorn, John Lamb, Sam Woodyard, Paul Gonsalves, Russel Procope, Jimmy Hamiliton, Chuck Connos, Buster Cooper, Cootie Williams, Herbie Jones, Cat Anderson, Ray Nance and Harry Carney. The band played a set of air and string instruments in the performance, which included trumpets, violins, trombone, clarinet, tenor saxophone, alto saxophone, baritone saxophone, bass clarinet,
bass guitar, drums, and piano, which was Ellington’s specialty. The Copenhagen performance is divided into five shows that constitute different musical aspects. The pieces in the concerto are live performances, namely midriff, Ad Lib on Nipon, Part three, Tutti for Cootie, and Rockin’ in Rhythm, respectively. The concert is vibrant as the ensemble plays the musical instruments in a happy and fast melody which, on the other hand, engages the crowd. The concert plays a major role in indicating the development of music as Ellington explains to the crowd about every piece that is presented, which gives information about the genre of music to be performed. The crowd is involved in the music as it is hard to sing and clap along to the music in the concert.
Telling jokes before a performance engages the crowd to be more attentive hence making the performance to be more lively.Main bodyThe Midriff Live is the first piece that was presented in the Copenhagen performance, which involves a fast melody that welcomes the audience to the concerto. The melodies that are played in this piece include fast tubas and clarinets. The most thrilling part of the performance is when Duke instructs the general ensemble on the melody they are going to start with. Ellington is seen to begin by setting the tone for the performance by playing his piano then, followed by the band who play the music in a fast rhythm which indicates the beginning of the performance. In this piece, the band plays a high-pitched melody that
indicates the distinctive style of jazz known as Swing jazz. In the Copenhagen performance, swing jazz is the dominant style played as it comprises a large ensemble that is divided into three or four members playing similar instruments. The swing melody is also characterized by the feeling of snapping fingers to the melody, which also is heard from the crowd as the orchestra plays the music.The fourth part of the performance was also fascinating, especially the music texture of the performance. The piece applies the fast, slow, fast style of jazz music, which is important in engaging an audience. The piece is also classified by the orchestra members playing solo which captivates the attention of the audience. The performance Tutti for Cootie has musical elements such as syncopation
whereby the orchestra sets accentuation melodies that sound like as bombardment of musical instruments. Syncopation helps the orchestra to indicate the beginning of a new song or the end of the performance. The use of syncopation helps in creating a happy mood through the performance that promotes audience participation. The performance has an element of improvisation whereby Ellington plays the clarinet which is backed up by the trumpets to create a singular tune. Improvisation plays a major role in ensuring the coordination of similar musical instruments to produce a similar melody. The key musical factor in the Copenhagen performance is the use of fast, slow, fast rhythm, as it ensures that the audience remains focused on the performance. The performances, especially Tutti for Cootie, act as a reminder
to the American citizens of the tunes that were played during the attainment of independence; hence the performance is not only entertaining but also a cultural event. The tone gravity of this particular performance indicates the melodious coordination of the violin and the piano to create a happy mood across the performance. In the background, the audience is heard singing, clapping, and snapping along to the performance, which indicates that the performance has a vibrant tone row.The overall performance at Copenhagen depicts swing jazz as the orchestra maintains a happy melody across the performance. The alteration of musical chords and tunes is excellent, as there is a smooth transition of the musical instruments into one melody. The overall augmentation of the melodies in the performances is generally short,
as it ensures that the audience is not bored by monotonous notes. Another key reflection of the performance is the delayed resolution used in most performances. Duke Ellington is famous for applying delayed resolution in his pieces, whereby a resolving tune is delayed later than expected by the crowd. The tune is then replaced by a bombarding tune, such as a tuba, as in the example in the Part three performance. Ellington uses guide tones from the piano to guide the orchestra on the melody to be played. Using guide tones ensures that the whole band synchronizes to the dominant tone and therefore plays their musical instruments according to the head. Another outstanding feature of the general performance is providing musical background to the audience before performing. Providing
is an example of individual harmonies blended into one major melody as he picks individuals who have mastered the use of different musical instruments. Nevertheless, there is poor lighting in the performance, which does not enable the audience to clearly visualize the orchestra members. However, the arrangement of the orchestra members on the stage enables perfect coordination of tones since the musical instruments are arranged according to the musical intensity produced.
In order to understand the structure and functions of society, it is essential to study a vast number of sociological theories and perspectives created by various scientists. For example, Emile Durkheim, a French sociologist, expressed his view of society in the theory of functionalism. According to Durkheim, there is vital interconnectivity of all the elements of any society that share common ideas and principles, and the sum of these elements is not as great as the society itself. The sociologist viewed society as a huge biological organism that requires all its parts to function properly in order to remain alive. Further, when discussing collective and individual behavior, Durkheim stated that these two concepts are entirely different, and there is the collective conscience that makes people adapt their actions
it with class one.It is evident that functionalism and conflict theory contradict each other. They are different in almost all ideas and concepts, including the primary structure of society. The main purpose of functionalism is to promote stability and make all elements of society function properly to avoid errors. At the same time, the key goal of conflict theory is to emphasize change because, without it, society cannot exist. Therefore, it is completely or almost impossible to see how these theories may complement each other.
The United States’ health policies are unique and developed to provide the nation with accessible and optimally effective care. The option to establish state regulations also benefits the local citizens and sets the standards for practitioners’ and physicians’ education and career. Although providing healthcare administration authority for entities is relatively uncommon, regulations passed by local legislators are similar to European countries. For instance, in the Netherlands, the law allows practitioners to advise medication the patients after completing specific pharmacology programs and practicum hours (Maier, 2019). This paper aims to compare the Dutch and American prescriptive authority for nurses and identify the role of international organizations in developing policies to regulate healthcare.Prescriptive authority for nursing professionals is widely discussed in the United States because of its benefits and disadvantages
for patient outcomes. While most states admit that timely medication advice makes healthcare services more efficient, there are several entities where drug abuse is perceived as connected to the practitioners’ rights to distribute substances (Bodenheimer & Grumbach, 2020). However, the prescriptive authority is developing and expanding in most states, and the policies around it are similar to European. Indeed, nursing practitioners from countries such as the Netherlands are required to receive licensing based on specific educational and practical courses to get the right medication advice.The Dutch policy that regulates prescriptive nursing authority is universal for the entire country in contrast to the American state-based regulatory power; however, these conditions are applicable to countries’ political systems in general. In the Netherlands, a specialist can prescribe any medication within their
competency after receiving at least a Master’s degree in nursing and completing the additional pharmacology curriculum (De Bruijn-Geraets et al., 2018). Similarly, in American states with independent practice, a professional must graduate from certified educational courses to get the prescriptive authority. The main Dutch policy that regulates nursing is the Individual Health Care Professions Act (BIG), and all decision-making regarding practicing, licensing, and education is based on its statements (De Bruijn-Geraets et al., 2018). In contrast, in the United States, various legislations and boards, such as local Nursing Practice Acts and boards, exist to administrate different aspects of the profession (Germack, 2021). The comparison revealed that the Netherlands has a centralized and universal healthcare system regulation, and analyzing its efficiency is insightful for developing strategies for enforcing American
of safety and prevention measures, and governments worldwide used them to pass the laws for healthcare systems’ regulations updates and adjust the professionals’ responsibilities and activities. Although WHO’s guidelines have an advisory authority, healthcare organizations and practitioners can utilize them to increase the services’ quality and include them in the policies.Healthcare systems and the nursing profession are administrated differently in the United States and European countries, yet the Netherlands’ example reveals many similarities in the policies. Practitioners’ prescriptive authority is complete for the Dutch specialists, and American states’ local regulations include the corresponding requirements. International organizations, such as WHO, are valuable for healthcare policymaking because they provide evidence-based and objective solutions for countries to improve people’s well-being worldwide.
Dyslexia affects children with normal eyesight and intellect in different ways, such as an inability to read or acquire words. Coaching or a specialized educational intervention may help most children with Dyslexia to perform better in school. According to the article, Learning difficulties are one of the many consequences of Dyslexia. A youngster with Dyslexia will have difficulty keeping up with their classmates in most classrooms since reading is such a fundamental ability in so many areas. In the absence of treatment, Dyslexia may lead to poor self-esteem, behavioral issues such as anxiety or anger, as well as detachment from peers and teachers, and parents. When Dyslexia is not diagnosed and addressed throughout the childhood, it may lead to long-term issues in adulthood. The chances of children succeeding
IntroductionReliance on the internet and mobile devices to do business leads to the so-called E-commerce. The term is hardly old, based on its adoption in the 2000s after the internet revolution. E-commerce is a real force in the present and future business world due to several facets. For example, the invention’s capacity to eliminate reliance on the costly brick-and-mortar system of doing business makes it favorable to many investors. Equally, e-commerce’s unique traits, such as reduced entry barriers and readily available large stocks of online customers, make the aspect highly cherished. The invention comes at the right time when the world’s population leads a busy life, while its needs often beat local producers’ ability.The world’s rapid adoption of e-commerce justifies the invention’s match to people’s unique needs. Citizens
worldwide never have to walk or travel to buy commodities or struggle to search for unavailable stuff inside sparingly located stores like before during the e-commerce age. Such unmatchable benefits make e-commerce a real force cherished by many.Nothing reveals the essence of e-commerce more than the COVID-19 pandemic state. Reported first in the mid of 2019, the epidemic causes significant pressure on humans by changing virtually every past way of living. The closure of businesses to protect people from contracting the deadly contagious virus changed working conditions significantly (Saeed, Bader, Al-Naffouri, and Alouini, 2020). Organizations seeking to survive the global plague thus resulted in working online, using the internet and e-commerce strategies to beat the challenging situation. Moreover, the worldwide population relied substantially on technology to acquire life’s
necessities due to the enacted quarantines. Such benefits make many people blindly accept the invention without caring about its effects on other fundamental aspects, such as the environment. Like any other facet, e-commerce exhibits both beneficial and harmful effects on the environment, thus requiring moderation.Positive Impacts of E-Commerce on the EnvironmentOther than making people’s lives easier and fairer, e-commerce poses several beneficial effects on the environment. The following discussion reveals some of the invention’s paybacks about the surroundings.Transport EmissionsThe e-commerce business model operates differently from the traditional brick-and-mortar structure that requires vast parcels of land and a large workforce traveling to the offices every morning. Relying on the internet means that businesses selling items online requires a lesser number of stores or smaller size machine-intensive production units that
can produce on-demand items (Gaffer, 2016). Therefore, the reduced need for land parcels implies a decrease in the natural ecosystem’s destruction, thus saving the environment. According to Collins (2021), transportation is one of the largest contributors to greenhouse gases that harm the environment substantially. Therefore, having people work from home makes the e-commerce model beneficial to the environment by reducing harmful transportation emissions from commuter vehicles.Paper WasteBusiness records play a major role in organizations’ survival, leading to the storage of almost every activity’s details. Filling physical receipts, invoices, purchasing orders, permits, and other essential documents formed a crucial part of businesses’ operations prior to the e-commerce era. Some companies even set aside massive record stores to manage the aspect. Most of the papers used in storing such details,
together with paper waste from packaging material, ended up in waste sites, leading to massive paper litter with immense effects on the environment. Additionally, relying on papers to conduct business implies cutting down trees and clearing forests to acquire indispensable writing materials. Therefore, e-commerce is highly beneficial to the environment due to its ability to eliminate paper reliance and waste from businesses.Digital StorageLastly, e-commerce promotes digital storage while eliminating reliance on warehouses that require a large workforce and emissive machinery that harms the environment. Collins (2021) cheers on the creation of digital manufacturing tactics due to e-commerce as an effective environmental protection initiative. Businesses operating online mostly do not keep large stocks of products due to storage limitations. Consequently, the replacement of large environmentally unsafe traditional storage techniques
with digital storage methods proves e-commerce’s benefits to the environment.Negative Impacts of E-Commerce on the EnvironmentTransportation EmissionsE-commerce promotes unregulated buying and excessive order volume relative to the traditional model of business. The matter pushes investors to acquire numerous delivery vehicles to meet the rising demand and urgency. Such machines mostly run on fossil fuels, thus causing excessive emissions that harm the environment (LaRosa, 2001). Collins (2021) observes that congestions caused by the numerous delivery vehicles lead to traffic that worse the emission problem. Consequently, the rigorous movement of vehicles as they deliver small and large orders to customers to meet urgent requirements significantly cancels the benefit realized through having workers work from home.PackagingThe rise in consumer demand and the streamlining of supply chain mechanisms imply an increase in
In Chapter 3, there is a discussion on the early evolution of parole in the US, as well as its utilization in the current sentencing practices. Among the most critical points of the chapter is that recent studies show that inmates who tend to leave prisons without parole supervisions demonstrate higher failure indicators in comparison with ones released with parole requirements. Then, it is suggested that reinstated discretionary parole release is to be provided for an inmate, given solid pieces of evidence. Then, the authors assume that parole release decisions are to be made by a competent and proficient board. The latter should have particular guidelines and formally established principles that would make its functioning smooth and transparent. Overall, the content of this chapter is delivered clearly and
Unfortunately, middle-aged women may run a risk of pathologic menopause. Therefore, it is necessary to take into account what specific features may aggravate the problem. The author of the post under consideration suggests that their patient with obesity and predisposition to breast cancer should take Metoprolol instead of Norvasc to illuminate the symptoms of premature menopause. Also, it would be of help to keep a diet and give up smoking. Such recommendations are bound to be efficient because they fully correspond to the patient’s needs.Admittedly, in case of menopause, a patient’s hormone levels and BMI are measured to find out whether there is a possibility of severe impairment. According to recent studies, “sex hormone levels after menopause are associated with women’s increased CVD risk later in life” (as
cited in J Am Coll Cardiol, 2018, p. 2555–66). It sounds sensible that the patient under analysis should discontinue Norvasc intake because of its side effects, causing the risk of heart diseases in the long run because of reduced of motor activity. Being a beta-blocker, Metoprolol is sure to be an accurate decision for this particular case.However, the patient’s obesity status is better to be reconsidered before prescribing an exact diet. Banack and their team of researchers conducted a research, the results of which “demonstrate that a BMI cut-point of 30 kg/m 2 does not appear to be an appropriate indicator of true obesity status in post-menopausal women” (Banack et al., 2018). It means that fast weight loss can be useless and even harmful. The same concerns HRT
women who wish to avoid the risks of HRT” (Stubbs et al., 2017). Thus, HRT is not to recommend because it is generally believed to increase the risk of cancer.To sum it up, the author’s recommendations are likely to lead to a successful treatment of the symptoms of premature menopause. The suggestion to replace Norvasc with Metoprolol seems to be a reasonable decision. As far as HRT is concerned, it is of utmost importance to diminish the risk of cancer. That is why SSRIs/SNRIs may prove to be the right approach to hot flushes treatment. Still, the prescription of a diet should be reconsidered according to new data.
The Bhagavad Gita is an ancient Indian scripture that consists of 700 verses and is part of the larger epic Mahabharata. This book is one of the central holy scriptures of Hinduism and dates from the second half of the first millennium BC. e. The plot of the Gita unfolds within the framework of a conversation between Arjuna, the prince of the Pandavas, and Krishna, his guide, charioteer, and the supreme God incarnate. Krishna prompts Arjuna’s behavior patterns and helps to solve some moral expectations. The latter is connected with the need for the Pandavas to fight against the Kauravas. This paper aims to reflect on the Bhagavad Gita , one of the most outstanding books of the Indian epic.Arjuna exhibits characteristic traits, such as self-confidence, arrogance, pride.
Arjuna demonstrates outstanding martial skills and is one of the best warriors. Krishna is the personification of the Supreme God and his traits include wisdom, humility, knowledge, and benevolence. The two characters have a close relationship: “Then, Madhava (Krishna) and the son of Pandu (Arjuna), stationed in their magnificent chariot with white horses yoked to it, loudly blew their divine conchs” (“Bhagavad Gita,” 2021, p. 13). Other characters are the Kaurava king Dhritarashtra and his adviser Sanjaya, secondary characters.The purpose of the author of the epic was to tell about the battle of Kurukshetra, where two Indian armies gathered to fight until the final victory. Arjuna asks Krishna to drive up to the center of the battlefield and finds those who will participate and those who want war
outstanding books of the Indian epic, was provided. The book is relevant, as it reveals eternal themes – morality, justice, a sense of duty, a feeling of love for one’s neighbor. The philosophical dialogue between Arjuna and Krishna touches on the most challenging ethical topics that apply to both war and peace. The characters discuss identity crisis, the purpose of life, the human self, and human temperament.

Team building activities will integrate key cultural elements of Ecolab into FictComp LLC. A representative manager of Ecolab at FictComp will ensure cultural integration monitoring, and employee training will address more formal elements of the merger. The support team will assist FictComp in situational or specific matters, and communication channels will allow employees to be closer to Ecolab. Preserving relaxed and innovative elements of the culture will eliminate the loss of company identity.
Economic globalization is an inevitable process due to many reasons, but many people argue that it has a detrimental effect on the development of many countries or even the entire world. Nevertheless, globalization positively influences the evolution of human society at large, although some adverse effects are apparent (Wade, 2004). First, it is essential to understand the benefits of economic globalization to embrace it rather than try to oppose it.Undoubtedly, economic globalization enables people to trade more efficiently and effectively as they have access to diverse resources and markets. An entrepreneur in every part of the world can offer products and services to people from other continents with the help of technology. The abundance of ideas contributes to the creation of new products making people’s lives more comfortable
Transportation plays a leading role in global logistics; at the moment, a digital revolution is taking place in this area, the speed of which is increasing due to the epidemic that has arisen in the world. Digitalization is the factor that opens up new opportunities in logistics such as acceleration, restructuring of the business model, provision of an expanded range of services. The speed of change is such that logistics does not have time to rebuild and entails disruption of the supply chain. The activity of transport companies consists in continuous cargo flow. In order to avoid the suspension of global cargo traffic, it is necessary to digitalize the five existing modes of transportation. Although it is difficult to imagine a completely new type of transportation in the
foreseeable future, the impact of new technologies (especially of AI) on the Big Five opens up many logistics opportunities.The attributes of the Fourth Industrial Revolution – machine learning and artificial intelligence, big data and the Internet of Things – laid the foundation for a new approach to supply chain management – Supply Chain 4.0 (Klumpp & Zijm, 2019). The point of growth was the initial development of AI-based cargo routing technologies by companies. Supply chains consist of links; the company has many such logistics links: suppliers of components (raw materials), manufacturers, logistics companies, distributors, warehouses, carriers, retail chains, etc (Bowersox, 2019). The business efficiency of all participants in the supply chain depends on the speed of this exchange and the quality of the transmitted data. With the advent
of the Supply Chain 4.0 era, the logistics of companies has become more predictable — facts, not a subjective vision of a person, have come to the fore (Klumpp & Zijm, 2019). Moreover, AI finds such interdependencies that a person cannot build, because there is no direct connection between the data, and the amount of data is huge.One of the most striking examples of the use of AI in the field of logistics is predictive analytics systems. The traditional approach to route planning is based on a limited number of factors that are largely static and do not take into account current changes. Using AI, the model can include data on traffic, weather, waiting time, loading and unloading speeds at specific points and at certain suppliers, the influence
of specific company and customer personnel on the speed of delivery. Focusing on the data coming in real time, such a model will be able to build the optimal route with much higher accuracy and calculate the ideal delivery time. This means that at the same time it is possible to reduce costs and delivery times and increase customer satisfaction with quality service.At the moment, the global market is dominated by the unique model that looks like a combination of sales channels. The omnical model’s policy is set up so that the consumer should not feel the difference between an online store and an offline store (Wang et al., 2019). In this regard, the number of small orders is increasing, as well as the functions of stores that
combine both a place to sell goods and a warehouse are changing. Therefore, it is vital for a logistics company to ensure timely delivery of goods, transparency of the supply chain, transparency of the product life cycle and the quality of services provided. To do this, new technologies are regularly applied to the Big Five supply chain management: drones and artificial intelligence. This digitalization allows the consumer to control the delivery process without leaving the home digital device, increasing confidence in the manufacturing company.Due to the use of new transportation technologies, the supply range is also increasing. For example, drones are able to transport cargo by air; since the absence of a pilot and other maintenance personnel facilitates border crossing, the range of supplies is expanding (Klumpp &
“Edges of the Rainbow” was created by Michael Delsol and Haruku Shinozaki in 2017. It is a collection of photographs and personal stories of LGBT+Q community representatives from different parts of Japan. Michael Delsos is a French photographer who depicts the people connected with art creation, and his pictures are published in magazines and newspapers. He also participates in the exhibits where Delsol presents his work separately or with other photographers. Haruku Shinozaki is a journalist, and he explores the marginal communities and minorities in Japan, particularly LGBTQ+ community members. This book applies to a specific audience, such as social activists, representatives of minority groups, demographic researchers, and those who are interested to learn more about the experience of the marginal communities in Japan.The purpose of the work
is to tell the audience about the experience of minorities in one of the most conformist and traditional countries in the world. The title of the book means the two different sides of the LGBTQ+ culture in Japan, implying that, on the one hand, it is a general topic that appears in books, shows, anime, the Japanese cartoons (Delsol & Shinozaki, 2017). On the other hand, underneath it, there is a certain amount of prejudice and conservatism, which is clearly depicted by the name “Edges of the Rainbow.”The confessions of the people whose stories are told on the pages of the book are intriguing and fascinating since, eventually, the person of different professions and class belonging can represent the LGBTQ+ community. Delsol and Shinozaki (2017) mention an Episcopal
priest that from a very young age, was very religious and decided to hold services for the LGBTQ+ parishioners so they would have a safe space where they could embrace their spirituality. Another example is an initiative called akta that works to provide sexual education for people and spread awareness about HIV/AIDS prevention (Delsol, Shinozaki 2017). They also have literature and other informational resources on the LGBTQ+ topic and welcome queer people that seek help or assistance in any personal situation.People of different sexualities and genders are much more diverse than it demonstrates the typical stereotypes. One of the main thoughts of Delsol and Shinozaki (2017) is that society has the image of an LGBTQ+ person as someone extravagant in bright clothes and unusual appearance, but mostly they
IntroductionDue to rising meat consumption and decreasing farmland supply, creating alternate protein sources is pressing. According to Van Huis (2015), food security occurs when all populations have physical, societal, and financial access to adequate, secure, and healthier meals to suit their dietary requirements for an active lifestyle at all times. Globally, meat consumption is anticipated to rise by 76% between 2005/2007 and 2050 (Van Huis, 2015). Therefore, alternate protein supplements, such as duckweed, seaweed, and cultured meat and insects, would represent a dietary adjustment. This paper aims to critically analyze the various sources of meat and their biochemical compositions. Additionally, the essay highlights the advantages and limitations of edible insects as a source of protein.Sources of Meat and Their Basic CompositionThe various sources of meat, as discussed herein,
including beef, fish, pork, and poultry. Beef is the flesh of cattle, Bos taurus, and is classified as red meat. It refers to mammalian meat that contains more iron than fish or chicken (Michael et al., 2019). Beef is mostly protein with various quantities of fat. Animal protein is often of excellent quality, including all nine necessary amino acids required for proper bodily development and enhancement. Beef includes a range of fats, generally known as beef tallow. Water, protein, fat, and ash are the four primary elements of fish’s edible parts. Liquids serve as a conduit for the movement of nutrients and molecules, with water constituting the majority of these fluids. Lipids are mostly composed of triacylglycerol and phosphoglycerides in fish muscle, both of which include nonesterified fatty
acids (Kiczorowska et al., 2019). Protein is the second most prevalent element in fish myocytes, often ranging between 16 and 18% (Kiczorowska et al., 2019). The eating patterns and reproductive cycle affect the protein content of fish tissues.Pork is the household pig’s (Sus domesticus) meat, and just like all meat, pork is primarily composed of protein. When dry, lean pork has a protein concentration of up to 89%, making it one of the most protein-dense foods available (Adamczak et al., 2018). Like other classifications of red meat, pork is mainly comprised of saturated and unsaturated fats in roughly equal proportions, thus an important protein source.The bulk composition of poultry flesh comprises copper, fat, water, iron, phosphorus, protein, and other nutrients necessary for proper digestion. Cooked poultry flesh contains
between 25% and 30% protein, contingent on the section of the carcasses and the cooking process (Gumułka & Połtowicz, 2020). Poultry flesh is very protein-dense and is often recognized as a substantial source of high-quality protein and has more protein than red meat.Examples of Other Sources of MeatVenisonOther illustrations of where meat can be obtained include venison and chicken. Venison is a phrase that relates to deer meat, which is a type of red meat. Venison is an excellent source of zinc and includes trace levels of the majority of other micronutrients. This meat is a high-protein meal with a reduced fat and calorie content and B vitamins (Nagy et al., 2019). Venison meat is derived from mammals that can graze naturally in their native habitat. Chicken contains
high-value proteins, including all nine necessary amino acids present in animal-derived foods. Without the covering, chicken is one of the leanest meats, particularly the breast, with a fat level of roughly 2% (Chmiel et al., 2019). In addition, chicken flesh contains vitamins majorly from the B complex, including niacin (Chmiel et al., 2019). These vitamins are essential for the body’s sugar and fat processing, including the well-being of cells.The Advantages and Disadvantages of Using Insects as a Protein SourceThe nutritional benefits of insects vary according to food, growth level, gender, breed, habitat of existence, and assessment techniques. On average, edible insects have 35%–60% protein by dry weight or 10%–25% protein by fresh weight, greater than plant protein sources such as wheat, soybeans, and lentils (Kim et al., 2019).
Insects supply more protein than meat and chicken eggs at the top end. Orthoptera edible insects, such as crickets, grasshoppers, and locusts, are highly protein-dense.Additionally, societies that eat insects tend to link them with a variety of health advantages in addition to their nutritional value. For instance, caterpillar fungus possesses immunostimulatory and anticancer effects (Kim et al., 2019). Numerous investigations of insect enzymatic hydrolysates have shown that they possess antioxidant and anti-diabetic characteristics, as well as the potential to suppress angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) (Kim et al., 2019). Therefore, the medicinal importance of insects cannot be underestimated: thus, more research should be undertaken to uncover other clinical values fully.While insects are ingested in many regions of the world, this does not exclude them from causing allergic reactions. Their eating
of specific beetle species is harmful to human health. As such, their excessive intake might result in health problems. There is a minor elevated risk of lead or arsenic contamination when insects are consumed.ConclusionIn conclusion, entomophagy may hold the key to resolving the world’s growing food security crisis. For example, insects have more protein than meat and chicken eggs, making them healthier. However, despite their therapeutic and nutritional advantages, excessive consumption of some species may cause health concerns since several species possess poison that is fatal when eaten. Therefore, due to the enormous health benefits associated with the consumption of insects, nations must adopt insect farming to provide an alternative source of proteins for their citizens.
Supervision is a process of knowledge exchange, social experience, and psychological support received by trainees in work, career, and professional development. It includes informal communication, usually between two people, over a long period, between an employee who has a large amount of relevant knowledge, wisdom, or experience, and an employee or student who has these qualities to a lesser extent. In this regard, the supervisors must have particular traits and specific demeanor to succeed in their activities.One of the essential personality traits of a supervisor that makes him the ideal professional is adaptability. Nowadays, almost everything is changing – science is developing by leaps and bounds, new technologies are being introduced every day, approaches to how students need to learn and how teachers need to convey information are
changing. In such an environment, the supervisor must be flexible and open to new ideas and knowledge to meet ever-increasing demands. Davis (2020) notes that especially important are such human qualities of a supervisor as humanity, kindness, patience, decency, honesty, responsibility, fairness, commitment, emotional balance, and self-criticism, which become professionally significant prerequisites for creating favorable supervision relationships.The ideal supervisor is distinguished by the manner of communication. The ability to build effective and friendly communication is one of the most significant aspects of perfect supervisors who will never raise their voice or overstep the boundaries of what is acceptable in communicating with students. Beckett (2020) asserts that the supervisor must structure the work experience, transfer it to the young specialist, and clearly and consistently state the necessary information and
comments on the trainee’s work data. Moreover, ideal supervisors should be leaders because they are not just teaching, but directing their students in the right direction, setting a good example, and encouraging. Only such a supervisor can earn credibility and become a professional who will be grateful for hundreds of students. It is also essential to have a desire to be a supervisor. Otherwise, it will be perceived as an additional burden, which sooner or later will affect the quality. The supervisor is required to have a sincere commitment to helping the wards, and not just from time to time to evaluate the results of their work.Supervisors have a set of functions and responsibilities, the successful implementation of which makes them the ideal professional. According to Corey et
must not only have the appropriate skills, knowledge or experience, but also be able to communicate them correctly and on time to students and new employees. Therefore, not every person is capable of performing the functions of a supervisor. In addition to excellent proficiency in occupational skills, supervisors must possess versatile knowledge, be carriers of the key values of corporate culture, as well as have several personal qualities and a particular model of behavior.
The following project proposal considers a number of factors that makes a coworking space effective and productive through the means of design choices. In order to create a space that adheres to the values of the company and to the needs of its employees, certain features were thoroughly considered and integrated into the final design. These include the safety, health, and wellbeing of the employees, the elimination of social, environmental, and community issues, and the inclusion of appropriate spatial and design elements. As a result, certain components such as health and safety prioritization, adaptability, and sustainability were chosen as thematic guides for the project. Sustainability and health-related changes mainly affect the environmental aspects of the working space, while adaptability responds to concerns over social and communal conflicts.There are
a myriad of features that can distinguish an effective co-working space from a dysfunctional one, but only four core characteristics are really necessary. First, the space must be inhabited by a community with either a like-minded purpose or attitude. While this is not a direct facet that can be controlled by interior design, the appearance of a space is likely to attract individuals that are more responsive to it. As such, a community found within a co-working space with an appealing yet productive appearance is more likely to function in a way that adheres to their overarching goals and ideals. Second, hospitality is integral to creating a space that values the wellbeing of those inside it. Similarly, while design does not directly create hospitality, the presence of better
lighting, friendlier colors, or non-claustrophobic spaces is likely to instill a more engaging atmosphere. Third, the space must be primarily designed to uphold certain facilities, such as specialized equipment or work spaces for certain professional operations. Fourth, business is essential not only for the main purpose of conducting production but also in the maintenance and correct workflow of the space.A number of factors within the design of a workspace can impact the health, safety, and wellbeing of employees. In order to maintain the health of those inhabiting such spaces, it is essential that a designer consider the things that usually cause a drawback on the wellbeing of employees. Though some changes may seem small, they may have a large impact on the physical health of those working in
these spaces. For instance, making a staircase more accessible and easy to reach can encourage employees to take the stairs instead of an elevator for additional exercise (Kohll, 2019). It is also essential to consider mental well-being, as employees will spend a significant amount of time within the designed space. A primary concern is the lack of natural light, which has been linked to decreased physical, psychological health, and energy. The safety of the space’s inhabitants is also incredibly important as even non-hazardous workplaces may cause issues in the health of employees. Some common issues found within office spaces include poor posture as a result of seating and lack of good air quality. As such, the design of the space must account for ergonomic seating and working spaces
as well as ventilation that will be appropriate for a given area.In the case of co-working spaces, social issues can often stem from concerns regarding privacy, hierarchy, and personal necessities. Certain working spaces do not allow for employees to remove themselves from busy environments in order to be productive or require spaces to remain non-individualized. Similarly, certain working spaces make stratification of employees distinct through design, creating a sense of disbalance and inequality (Vijay, n.d.). As such, it is vital that co-working spaces are designed in ways that permit both collaborative and individual work. This can be achieved through the introduction of open spaces or conference rooms as well as work spaces that are isolated from main areas which are usually used for breaks or loud work. Cubicles
are largely ineffective and more modern individualized work spaces are suggested, such as the placement of worktables or labs in more remote and quiet locations. If any distinctions are made between the workpaces of employees and managerial or administrative staff, they should not compromise on the comfort and visual quality of the employee work spaces.In an effort to make an office more environmentally conscious it is essential to consider the sustainability of its functions. Much of the detriment that working spaces cause to the environment currently are the result of the ease with which inferior but cheaper products are utilized and then discarded. As such, a design space that aims to curb such an issue will implement items, concepts, and functions that are sustainable, maintainable, and directly environmentally
friendly. Some initial design changes can include the use of materials that are created through a process that itself is not damaging to the environment. Both these materials and any other pieces installed in the offices should be sustainable and with an adequate life span. Essentially, not having to replace items, furniture, or other elements contributes to its sustainability and the environmentally conscious aspects of the work space.Community components within working spaces are often centered around aspects of culture and branding. Culture refers both to the attitudes and values upheld by a company, multiculturalism, and diversity. Clashes between a number of these facets are not uncommon, but they often are caused by the lack of certain features within the physical design of a workspace as much as the
social and political functions of it. As such, in the case that the design or space does correspond to the needs of certain employees, it is important to introduce adaptability. In fact, the initial creation of the space must be susceptible to any later changes. Work conditions or flows may change, certain employees may leave while others may join, and other changes are unavoidable. As such, the design of the physical space must contribute to any necessary change, especially in accordance to the community inhabiting it. This can often manifest as multifunctional items, mobility, and the consideration of local cultural norms (Chang et al., 2017). Similarly, branding is essential in making the space unique and creating a company identity among the community associated with it.The design proposal considers
Materials and equipment were chosen based on their negative or positive impact on the environment. Certain other essentials, especially those that are usually disposable, were replaced with more sustainable or recyclable options where possible. The larger features of the design, or those that are expected to be in use frequently, also utilize mobility where possible in order to allow employees the option to individualize or increase the comfort of a work space. In conclusion, many modern design spaces createthe general appeal of the physical appearance and the functionality of a space for its original intended purpose, but it is also vital to encourage changes that facilitate other benefits. As such, this design project attempts to introduce these new features in a seamless and beneficial way.
Elon Musk is one of the smartest and wealthiest people on the planet. The engineer is considered the genius of the modern world. Musk achieved everything himself through hard work. Despite a difficult childhood, he stubbornly went forward and reached great heights. The primary mission of the Mask is to help humanity and improve all areas of life. His main virtues are his desire to work and create something new, listening to criticism, not being afraid of risks, and achieving great goals other people would not understand.Elon Musk faced many difficulties on the way to his current status, but this did not stop him. He started working at an early age, and at the age of 12, he created his first video game. Currently, the engineer works about
80 hours a week and follows the development of his two companies, which is admirable. Musk believes that working harder than others is the most critical key to success because life is short, and a person must do everything possible for a successful existence (Fernholz 16). He maintains that the ability to work should be so high as to achieve what some take years to complete in months. However, Musk says that not everything depends on performance (Higgins 35). The most important is the organization of hard work to achieve results. Musk works hard and does things that are different from many others. He believes that his competition in the market is less this way, and his constant work pays off better (Higgins 35). The engineer focuses on
creating innovative technologies with a small number of these products. Additionally, his ability to work depends on his passion for his work. If a person hates his job, he will never achieve high results and will quickly give up. Elon Musk entered the engineering industry with innovations initially not accepted by society (Musk 57). As a result, he almost went bankrupt but could avoid it through hard work. Thus, he listened to the criticism, understood his risks, and successfully coped with them.Despite earning money from his first projects, Elon Musk wanted more recognition for his technologies. In this regard, he was not afraid to take risks and sell his first companies for the sake of the new SpaceX and Tesla, which subsequently entered the world market. However, Musk’s
ideas were initially on the verge of collapse, and he understood his risk when entering the market with new products. His ability to take responsibility even in such difficult moments is admirable. Elon Musk did not give up because of the initial failure of the company and put all his savings into the cause. It was a significant risk, as the entrepreneur did not know if his investment would pay off. However, at the same time, he advises taking on such responsibility at a younger age, when a person does not have to feed his family. At an older age, risk should be calculated more carefully, and savings should be left in case of failure. This approach causes respect for a person and highlights positive qualities in him.
Additionally, Elon Musk’s risks were justified because he constantly asked for criticism, which he listened to carefully. Even though many people, including entrepreneurs, want to hear praise, Musk chose a different way to reap the benefits. In his opinion, criticism helps a person see his weaknesses and develop them. The complaint can be why a person stops believing in himself; nevertheless, Elon Musk could process a negative assessment into a catalyst for new ideas and tasks. He asked friends and investors not about positive experiences with his products but the negative feedback (Muegge and Reid 9). In addition, Musk clarified all the feedback from his customers, which helped him improve the business. Thus, he always thinks about big goals, consisting of small feedback.Elon Musk’s ambitions are extraordinarily high
IntroductionThe Battle of Gettysburg in 1863 is considered a turning point in the American Civil War. The following year, the main leitmotif of the North’s military campaign was an attempt to stiffen Confederate defenses on all fronts and, if not to defeat them in a decisive battle, at least to deplete the South’s living and material resources and destroy its economy. Nevertheless, the Confederacy was not yet broken and was unwilling to admit defeat. In May 1864, the enemies met again at the Spotsylvania settlement, a series of cabins made strategically important by their proximity to the crossroads.Yankee Blitzkrieg. Wilson’s Raid Through Alabama and Georgia ReviewThe book Yankee Blitzkrieg. Wilson’s Raid Through Alabama and Georgia explores primarily the U.S. Civil War, highlighting significant figures and battles for one
side or the other. One of these generals, reviewed and studied in this book, is Emory Upton, who made a tremendous contribution to the war effort (Jones, 2021). The book analyzes every action and decision the general made, step by step, and focuses on the battle of 1864, where Emory created a whole new type of offensive.MethodsIn order to understand Upton’s contribution to the development of strategy and combat tactics, it is necessary to pay attention to what factors he considered significant. From the text of the book and the general’s own reasoning, it can be seen that Emory Upton considered two factors to be fundamental to success on the battlefield. It is namely the number of soldiers and time in terms of the amount of it in
the enemies (Jones, 2021). From this point of view it is necessary to conduct a detailed analysis of his strategy, and to identify the reasons for the failure of the most significant battle in the history of the general.Results of FindingsThen, it was decided to throw units of General Governor Warren’s 5th Corps in support of Upton. Once again the choice proved unsuccessful, Warren’s men had already participated in a hopeless attack a few hours earlier that had ended in profuse bloodshed. The order to attack Confederate positions did not excite the troops (Jones, 2021). The soldiers were reluctant to advance, but when they entered a field littered with blue uniforms, they turned back and quietly occupied their trenches.It was at that moment that the fate of Upton’s
men was decided. Taking advantage of the confusion among the Federals, the Southerners moved three infantry brigades to the site of the breach. Deployed in lines, the Confederates advanced on three sides toward the plucky colonel’s position. Fortified in the trenches, the Federals fought off fierce enemy attacks for hours, hoping in vain that backup was imminent. Upton simply could not believe that everything had gone to waste and that the successful breakthrough would end in nothing. Nevertheless, the Confederates succeeded in breaking the resistance of the irrepressible Yankees. The Federals lost more than a thousand soldiers, Colonel Upton himself was wounded, and was eventually forced to order a retreat (Jones, 2021). Keeping order, the shot regiments of Northerners left the dead-covered trenches and returned to their original
positions, bringing several hundred prisoners with them.Upton’s Strategy ResearchBefore the attack, Upton decided to inspect the formation to determine the weaknesses of the opponent and to determine which vector to take. Ultimately, the officer concluded that the main objective was to break through the fortifications, since the situation did not allow for bypassing or outmaneuvering them. It should be noted that the positions of the opponents were better fortified than usual, which made the task much more difficult. Then Emory Upton decided that a classic attack would be defeated by musket-wielding detachments. Then the general decided to divide the troops into four sections so that each had a width of three.At that time, the advancing infantry often lost formation and the attackers mingled into one unruly crowd. The
general decided to deal with this problem not in the classic way through training, but by stealth. He gave each squad a tactical assignment that prevented soldiers from mixing among themselves and disrupting the strategic formation (Jones, 2021). After the breakthrough, the 121st New York and 96th Pennsylvania Regiments would deploy to the right and capture an artillery battery, while the 5th Maine would deploy to the left, extending the breakthrough area (Jones, 2021, p.88). The 2nd and 3rd attacking lines would enter the breach, while Vermont regiments would remain behind and act based on the situation. One point Upton stressed was that officers had been ordered not to allow soldiers to stop, even to help the wounded.Notably, Upton’s regiment was tasked with breaking through enemy fortifications. At
the beginning of the battle, Upton’s detachment came out of the woods and was immediately hit by a musket volley. Without stopping, the attackers rushed forward, crossed the open space in a minute, and rushed the fortifications. The barrage broke their line, then they were hit by the second volley, but did not stop, and the fight in the fortifications began (Fitzpatrick, 2017). The second wave of attackers broke through the line and the regiments began to turn left and right, widening the breach. So Upton’s objective was accomplished and the fortifications were destroyed. The remaining regiments immediately continued their advance, suffering fewer casualties because the musketry was destroyed or scattered. However, the plan was thwarted and could not be executed to the end, resulting in defeat. Upton
accomplished his mission – he broke through the enemy’s fortifications and waited for Mott’s advance, not yet knowing that he would not be there. Meanwhile, the Southerners moved to counterattack, pushing their positions back (Fitzpatrick, 2017). Upton’s entire plan was based on the idea that additional units would be brought into the breach, but Mott’s attack was repulsed, and General Wright did not know how to proceed.Although the attack resulted in defeat, one cannot overlook Upton’s enormous contribution to infantry strategy. The fact is that such an attack alarmed enemy generals, who began to develop defenses against such attacks. Upton’s actions were extremely effective against infantry fortifications, which were very popular in ground strategies (Fitzpatrick, 2017). Thus, the general’s main contribution consists of new insights into the fight
against defenses and barrier units. His actions forced modern generals to reconsider both defense positions and attack capabilities (Fitzpatrick, 2017). In addition, tactical decisions at the time were made on the battlefield rather than analyzed afterward. With this in mind, Upton introduced the concept of unpredictable troops, that is, actions on the part of the enemy that cannot be predicted.While on the front lines, the commander of the 2nd Infantry Brigade, Emory Upton, watched the battle intently. In spite of his youth, Upton was considered an experienced serviceman: just before the war he graduated from West Point, began his service as a second lieutenant in the artillery, advanced quickly because of his ability and scientific mindset, and at Gettysburg was already in command of an infantry brigade (Jones,
2021). Upton suggested to General Grant, commander of the Army of the Potomac, that he abandoned the satchel and break the Confederate positions with a massive infantry attack on a narrow section of the front. The attack was directed at the weakest part of the enemy’s trenches, which due to their configuration became known as the Horseshoe of the Mule (Jones, 2021). The offensive was to be carried out by twelve reliable infantry regiments, arranged in a powerful assault column of four successive lines (Jones, 2021). The attack was to be conducted at an accelerated pace, turning into a run, while the personnel were strictly forbidden to stop and get involved in a firefight with the enemy.Knowing that no one would follow instructions in combat, Upton made sure
the soldiers, while loading their rifles, did not put the primer on the breechblock spigot. An exception was made only for the first line. At about six o’clock in the evening of May 10, 1864, 5,000 blue uniforms, in four battle lines, like a devil out of a snuffbox, emerged from the woods and, issuing a belligerent roar, rushed toward the enemy’s positions (Jones, 2021, p.74). The Confederates were experienced soldiers and were not the least bit confused. As they drew the enemy closer, they fired a powerful salvo that swept away the first wave of attackers. While the greys reloaded their weapons, a second wave reached the fortifications, almost unhindered. The Federals jumped up on the bulwark and fired a killing salvo at the enemy at point-blank
range (Jones, 2021). The surviving Southerners had already been bayoneted from top to bottom, like harpoons. General Doles’ three Confederate regiments, manned by Georgia natives, were almost entirely dead in their positions.The blue uniforms were able to take a fairly wide swath of terrain at once. Fortified in the trenches and deployed lines to the right and left, the Yankees began mowing down Confederate units with longitudinal fire. At the Battle of Gettysburg, the division was caught in a meat grinder and exsanguinated (Jones, 2021). Since then, the personnel never recovered from the shock. Besides, the soldiers were nearing the end of their contracts and no one was burning to take a bullet in their last days. Mott’s division had no time to turn around when Southern artillery
In humanism and human rights, personal dignity implies respect and a sense of worth and value inherent in every human being. In medical care and clinical ethics, this concept is associated with respect for the patient’s health, physical and psychological, as well as their emotional state, privacy, and self-perception (Kadivar, Mardani-Hamooleh & Kouhnavard, 2018). In a clinical setting, patients may feel dependent and vulnerable (Crump, 2019). It is a vital part of the professional values ​​of nursing to ensure the preservation of patients’ dignity and develop a delicate and respectful approach to healthcare (Sæteren & Nåden, 2021). The challenge to advocating for dignity in the medical environment is that patients and caregivers do not always have a universal understanding of human dignity. Its concept changes depending on the
and protecting the personal dignity of their patients.In nursing, the fundamental principles of healthcare include ensuring respectful, positive, and kind treatment of patients and dealing with their stress, nervousness, or fear with understanding and empathy. Handling the patient requires the nurse to have emotional intelligence, compassion, and commitment while performing all medical procedures in a timely and professional manner (Crump, 2019). Particular attention should be followed with aged patients. Sometimes, preserving the human dignity of retired patients is associated with providing them with a sense of greater autonomy and support. In many cases, elderly patients need intense listening and choice. A friendly and respectful conversation and a personal approach will help to establish such interaction.
people’s opinions on certain groups of individuals (Fiske, 2022). While such incidents have never been personally experienced, it is certain that the lives of people I know have been affected in terms of self-esteem and confidence, which can often be negatively impacted because of discrimination. I would like to explore racial bias due to its relevance in today’s day and age, namely how it manifests on structural levels.
Due to rapid population increases, human-generated conditions have caused significant disruption in the earth’s biosphere. Increased population has caused an increase in deforestation and the burning of fossil fuels. According to Brusseau et al. (2019), the world’s population is progressively increasing at a rapid rate. This increase has promoted encroachment of forested land for human settlement. Forest clearance causes climate change, soil erosion, and flooding. Moreover, the burning of fossil fuels due to the development of technology has led to increased emissions of carbon dioxide, which destroys the ozone layer, worsening the problem of climate change. According to research done on the effect of fossil fuel on the environment, fossil fuel is the leading cause of the environmental population (Li et al., 2019). Population pressure and technology have
Environmental protection has been at the forefront of people’s minds for a number of years recently, with a lot of effort going into protecting and conserving the planet we all live on. The reduction in personal waste, as well as systematic change both work towards the same goal of reducing carbon emissions and protecting the sanctity of natural resources. Many politicians and activists notice and understand the importance climate action has on securing a future for the entire human population. However, there are also significant problems that still have to be solved, many of which might uproot the entire foundation of modern economy. For the most prime example, it is interesting to explore the fossil fuel industry. The term used to describe a combination of oil and petroleum-related
businesses, fossil fuel has been continuously cited as being dangerous for the planet.1 (Fossil fuels and climate change: The Facts).The acquisition of oil, as shown by research, as well as its processing, emits gasses into the atmosphere, creating pollution. In addition, oil fuels cars and other types of vehicles, all of which contribute to the global pool of CO2 emissions. 2018 research has cited fossil fuels and the connected industries as 89% of the reason responsible for global CO2 output ( Fossil fuels and climate change: The Facts ). This means that a number of companies and organizations involved in this industry have an incredibly large influence over the wellbeing and prosperity of the planet. Furthermore, it has been noted that the oil firms knew and understood their
own impact even in the past. As shown by investigations, the members of the fossil fuel industry with political power have been pushing against clean air legislation for years, all in an effort to protect their profits ( Oil firms knew decades ago fossil fuels posed grave health risks, files reveal 2021). The presently existing setting puts a small minority of people responsible for the problems the rest of humanity has to solve, which becomes a point of contention for many.All people live on the same planet, and protecting the environment is important. To breathe clean air, have fresh water, and to be able to enjoy nature’s wonders, we have made progress in restoring and conserving different parts of the Earth. However, there are still many problems people
worse and has the potential to affect the quality of water as well. The dangers associated with fuel industries and their work might have to be overlooked if people want to protect their planet. Furthermore, experts have found out that many working in oil firms have lied about the potential harm their work does, and tried their best to prevent politicians from regulating it. It is more important than ever for people to talk about and consider the dangers fossil-based fuels present to the world. To move towards a better future, society might have to change their preferred methods of transport, and the way they lead their lives altogether.
norepinephrine is formed from dopamine. Hence, norepinephrine is a catecholamine, meaning that it is synthesized in the process of enzyme conversion with tyrosine being a precursor that needs three steps of interaction for a successful reaction.Finally, serotonin synthesis is different from that of dopamine and norepinephrine. Its precursor is the amino acid tryptophan, which is at first hydroxylated and then catalyzed by tryptophan hydroxylase. Figure 3 depicts the synthesis of serotonin in two steps that have been mentioned. In this way, serotonin is a biogenic amine neurotransmitter, which precursor is tryptophan that undergoes two-step catalysis.
Evidence-based decision-making necessary for efficient work enables practitioners to search and explore different studies formats, such as cohort or randomized controlled trials. The method determines the scope of participants, the hypotheses formulation, possible outcomes, and even ethical considerations (Wang & Kattan, 2020). A well-prepared practitioner should obtain theoretical knowledge about all research types to distinct them and use them for gathering information in professional circumstances. This paper aims to discuss, compare, and characterize cohort studies and randomized controlled trial formats.The cohort study is a valuable method for healthcare research because it analyzes several hypotheses and compares the outcomes simultaneously. Indeed, multiple samples (cohorts) are followed longitudinally to reveal the results of interventions (Teague et al., 2018). Another method selected for this assignment is the randomized controlled trial (RCT)
which is based on dividing participants into groups without considering any specific factors. In such studies, half receive the intervention to be tested, while the rest get alternative treatment (Naidoo et al., 2020). RCTs are helpful when biases and other influences on a result must be minimized, and it allows to study and measure specific actions or products.The fundamental difference between the cohort study method and RCT is how the sampling is performed. The former requires considering the participants’ characteristics to form groups and study intervention, and, in contrast, the randomized format makes researchers eliminate any individualized factors from the equation (Naidoo et al., 2020). Another significant distinction is the timing because cohort studies require to be conducted for a prolonged period to retrieve sufficient evidence to make
conclusions and observe the interventions’ results (Thampy et al., 2019). RCTs tend to be shorter because there are fewer factors to consider, and only one specific activity is being analyzed.The cohort study tends to be related to extensive epidemiological research because interventions require participants with diverse conditions to be involved and observed for an extended period. The massive advantage of such a method is that it results in a broad scope of data that calculates risk percentage and incidence. Furthermore, multiple factors or interventions can be studied simultaneously on diverse populations and provide a sufficient foundation for further research (Wang & Kattan, 2020). Disadvantages of a cohort method are the time and expenses it requires and the impossibility of establishing causal effects of an intervention.Correlational studies are conducted
for further decision-making.All types of research are valuable for evidence-based decisions in nursing, and a practitioner must be able to identify and select them according to their needs. The cohort study design is necessary for retrieving the information about the longitudinal following of specific populations. The RCT type provides sufficient data about certain interventions and eliminates the biases that weaken the conclusions. The research pyramid is a tool to select the study to conduct or explore based on the strength of its evidence.
IntroductionWith the development of the gaming industry, growth of its target audience’s amount, and the spreading of the Internet, electronic sports are becoming more and more popular competitive activity. Electronic sports are often referred to as eSports or egames, and imply organized video gaming. The primary concept of eSports can be seen as a competition of teams against each other in tournaments for a prize, usually in the form of cash and a title. From this perspective, eSports are similar to traditional sports competitions.The Transition of Games from Singleplayer to MultiplayerThe history of transferring games from a hobby to professional sports began in the 1990s. It is connected to the rise of the accessible worldwide web. The Internet has connected gamers; thus, it enabled competitive gaming and contributed
to the growth of the popularity of games. Then, in 1997, the world’s first eSports event, the Red Annihilation tournament for Quake game was conducted and held about 2000 participants. A short time after this competition, a gaming league named Cyberathlete Professional League (CPL) was formed. In 2017, the total Esports prize money amounted to $110.6 million from a total of 3765 tournaments.Gamers used to compete playing through game consoles before the industry went online. Playing with another player via the same console offline is still a common way to have fun with friends and relatives living in the same place. It also enables to deepen into competition due to specific atmosphere complementing the process, which is also why many tournaments prefer to gather teams in one room
adjusted for playing. In addition, few games do not support online multiplayer mode still. However, all the other benefits are attributed to playing games online. It is simpler to connect with people through the word via Internet, and more and more games have a well-functioning multiplayer.The Discussion of Two Popular Multiplayer Games and Their ConceptsBackground and Development of League of LegendsLeague of Legends is currently one of the world’s biggest eSports that emerged from the Warcraft 3 mod Defence of the Ancients. In 2005, Feak and Mescon created a company named Riot Games. After fours years, the idea of League of Legends came alive and became popular for both amateurs and professionals Free-To-Play game. This game is compared to DOTA, which has a similar concept. Currently, League of
Legends counts millions of active players, hundreds of teams, and dozens of regular tournaments.The concept of League of Legends and the viewer or gamer perspectiveLeague of Legends is a Multiplayer Online Battle Arena (MOBA), which is usually played with two teams consisting of 5 players. This concept enables the high competitiveness of the process and requires teamwork for the win. Each team has its primary building – the base and towers that are defensive structures. The objective of a team is to destroy the opponents’ main building. Isometric battle arena has three lanes, a jungle between them, and a river dividing the map between two teams. Gamers choose champions with unique abilities they will be playing for the next game. Depending on the champion, each player has a
role they usually stick to for the benefit of team play. Gamers have access to the internal market, where they can purchase items that strengthen their characters for gold, which is earned for killing opponents’ champions and neutral enemies. Professional players try to fully express the strengths of their characters and not opponents to use their weaknesses, such and vulnerabilities to some form of damage, low health points, low speed, inability to buy artifacts fast, and others.With respect to the viewer and gamer point of view, League of Legends has an isometric perspective for them both, as it is the most convenient for such type of strategy-like games. Viewers and gamers and switch between locked and free cameras and choose whether it is fixed on a specific character
or not. The two differences between ones who watch the game and one who plays are the opportunity of the last to see through the fog of war through every champions’ “eyes” and the additional statistics. Simultaneously, players can only see what is revealed by their and their allies’ champions.Background and Development of ValorantValorant is another popular Free-To-Play AAA game supported by Riot company. The genre of the game is tactical team-based FPS shooter. The game’s development started in 2014, and it was officially released in June 2020, after a closed beta period. This game’s producers were inspired by a series of shooters Counter-strike. What is interesting about Valorant is that Riot pays great attention to storytelling, making every of the game’s champions more than a playable character
but rather a living person with their background and unique features. Even though this innovative game intended to gather the strengths of its close competitors has begun to grow activity not so long ago, it is already popular enough to be claimed as a future of multiplayer shooters.The concept of Valorant and the viewer or gamer perspectiveValorant is slightly similar to League of Legends, as it is also focused on the competition between two teams. However, a broad list of differences confirms the uniqueness of Valorant’s concept. The goal of each team is to win 13 rounds, which is done by killing all the opponents’ champions (agents) or detonating the “spike” (bomb). The game can be compared with such tactical shooters as Counter-strike, Overwatch, and Apex Legends. All
the playable characters have unique abilities that determine their role, which can be duelist (DPS class), initiator (intending to initiate fights), or sentinel (supports). After choosing a unique agent, there is a buy phase, during which players can buy guns and abilities, and then, a round begins.Valorant is the first-person shooter that implies that a gamer does not see his own character but only the weapons he holds. During a game, a player does not track his opponents until they are visible for the agent they are playing for. However, while viewing a match, it is possible to see red figures indicating an opponent team’s agents, while the perspective stays the same (first-person). It is possible to make a camera free to have an overview of the entire
battlefield without sticking to one of 10 players.The Platforms to Play the Games, Selection of Characters and the Use of AvatarsIt is possible to list all game platforms to provide an overview of what is actually can be used to play before proceeding to opportunities Valorant and League of Legends provide to their audiences. It includes: Personal computers (PC), consoles, mobile, virtual reality, arcade, television, web browser, and streaming.The most popular and oldest platform to experience video games are PC, suitable for most games while enabling customization of a gaming place with different accessories. It is not surprising that both of the games are available to play via this platform. The mobile platform, including both Android and IOS based devices, is expected to support Valorant in the nearest
future, while League of Legends is already available for gamers to download and play.Riot Games company also promises to launch both their games via consoles in a year or two. It is possible that television is also can be used to play those games, for instance, with the help of the connected PC. However, it is likely that neither Valorant nor League of Legends will be ported to arcades or will be available to play via a web browser.Speaking about picking characters in Valorant and League of legends, the system is the same for both games. All the player has a set of playable characters, more than 140 for League of Legends and 15 for Valorant. There is a specific order for picking champions or agents that depends
on the mode of the game. For instance, in a regular game, a player can choose any hero at any time, if only it is not banned by others (every player has a limited number of votes to ban one or another champion). In a tournament or in certain game modes, teams pick a champion each by order. The only rule that is always must be adhered to is that it is not possible to pick the same hero twice. Basically, all these nuances are needed for the balance of the games and their fairness.With respect to players’ avatars in those games, each player has an avatar of the champion/ agent they play for, known as summoner icon. They are used to determine who plays for a specific
hero that enables to coordinate team play. Moreover, League of Legends enables players to use and customize their personal avatar intended to personalize a gamer’s profile for their convenience and a better experience. Avatar creator enables to choose among a broad range of facial features, hairstyles, and outfits. Although it is not essential for gameplay, it does influence the attractiveness of a game for players.ESport Tournaments and Gaming as a Career15 years ago, no one could imagine that playing games would become a lucrative career opportunity. About 80% of teenage girls and 95% of teenage boys play video games, and it reveals the close attention of the younger generation to the global eSports market. The other representative indicator of the industry’s potential is that it has grown to
$1.9 billion by the end of 2018. Speaking about the earning of gamers, in 2015, four people made more than $1.73 million, while members of many other professional teams had more than $100,000 in income. ESports players earn money in prizes for winning events, advertising, sponsorships, and salaries. Although not many gamers make sums enough for living, with the maturing of the industry, so will be growing players’ incomes. There is only one way in eSports to become a valuable professional; it is to improve skills and to win. Then, there is a chance to join a team and sign a contract with its owner that will eventually lead to global tournaments and opportunities to win high prizes.The above-mentioned eSports tournaments are competitions between two teams consisting of
5-6 players each. The most popular games to duel in are League of Legends, Overwatch, Fortnite, Dota, Valorant, and others. Most amateur and professional events cost about $10-20 to spectate or participate, while a ticket to the League of Legends Championships can cost up to $70. The prize or the jackpot for winning teams can vary from a few thousand to millions dollars. Such events take place around the world, including cities like Lo Angeles, San Francisco, Seoul, Tokyo, Shanghai, Hong Kong, and others.The Investing Companies of ESports and the Development of Mobile versions of the GamesThe above-mentioned mobile devices are one of the platforms many games can be developed for or ported into. While League of Legends can already be downloaded as a mobile game, it is
likely that Valorant will also eventually have its own mobile version, which is not even announced yet. Porting of games, which implies designing it for another platform, is associated with some challenges. For instance, the opportunities to control a unit via a phone are significantly restricted compared to PCs’ ones. Although Riot company managed to launch the League of Legends mobile version, it is known for being less convenient for players, and therefore it is not used widely for conducting tournaments. It is even the general approach of all the companies not to enable players using different platforms to play with each other to maintain the balance and fairness of the game.Global eSports industry in one of many others worthy to invest in. It is expected that in
2021, its revenue will exceed $1 billion and will grow up to $1.8 billion in 2022, which makes gaming companies attractive for potential investors. Some of the investing companies (ones having esports stocks) are Activision Blizzard Inc. (ATVI), a video game developer known for Overwatch and Call of Duty, and the owner of Grand Theft Auto Take-Two Interactive Software Inc. (TTWO). It is also can be recommended to consider Electronic Arts Inc. (EA) known for Apex Legends and FIFA and Roblox Corp. (RBLX) owning a platform enabling users to make their own games.ConclusionCurrently, more and more people are becoming engaged in eSports as viewers or players, which makes the industry, which began as a casual hobby, grow to a huge market. With the spread of the Internet, multiplayer
company, the famous game developer, is known for League of Legends, MOBA game, and Valorant, tactical team-based FPS shooter. The common platform for playing those games is PC, but League of Legends has a mobile version, and both of the games are expected to be ported to a console. Playing games is a solid career opportunity now, as many professional players have high income due to prizes, salaries, and advertising. Some of the largest companies even have their own stock, which anyone can invest in. Predictably, the industry will be growing further, which brings to the conclusion that eSports will not only continue to be popular but will even rise in activity.
The situation with a psychotherapist Kiara and her client is ambiguous: while she eventually provided the informed consent form, she did it only after three months of therapy. Initially, she only briefly mentioned confidentiality and the client’s rights, stating that everything said in her office will remain there. When Kiara visited the conference where the malpractice in confidentiality was discussed, she realized that she had forgotten about the consent form and presented it to the client, who was confused by that (Corey, 2015). By that time, the trust between the client and Kiara had already been established, but it began to fade after that situation. Eventually, the customer left the therapy and never returned.To understand the situation with Kiara, one should analyze the ethical code and client’s rights
If she did not make it, I think it will not be good to mention it: she only must ensure that the client’s personal information will not be shared. In my opinion, it was an excellent alternative to her action: it would save the trust between her and the client. It would be ethical, as Kiara would not actually compromise the customer and, thus, should ensure that they will not stop trusting her.
Richard Mason (1986) summarizes the most important ethical issues of the information age in a single acronym – PAPA (privacy, accuracy, property, accessibility). Privacy stands for the level of exposure of personal information to other users. Accuracy refers to the accountability for errors in information and the subsequent choice of the person to blame. Property deals with the question of ownership of information and the means of its transmission. Finally, accessibility underscores the opportunity and conditions of obtaining information. Analyzing real-life examples is essential in understanding the exact nature of each ethical issue.I personally experienced the inadvertent invasion of privacy when a professor instructed students to bring laptops for presentations. We connected the laptops to a projector in order to make the audience see the slides for themselves.
own devices. Had there been a computer provided by the administration, no violation of privacy or the necessity to resort to personal gadgets would have taken place.Another episode highlights the issues of accuracy and property of information. At some point, I had to take a seasonal job with an employer who paid most of my salary in cash in order to minimize taxes. However, when I contacted him for subsequent tax deductions, I suddenly realized that most of the transactions were never officially registered, which was a violation of accuracy. I tried to learn how much money he had actually saved by paying in cash. However, my employer framed my inquiry as a violation of his informational property, which was completely reasonable.
It is important to note that the core ethical principles of the Belmont Report clearly outline three core elements. In accordance with the report, these include respect for persons, beneficence, and justice (Office for Human Research Protections, 1979). The case study presents a situation where the researcher, Dr. Jones, failed to comply with the ethical principles by justifying such measure with risk-benefit assessment in favor of children. It is evident that all three principles have not adhered to some degree or extent.Firstly, Dr. Jones failed to comply with the principle of respect for all persons. The report states that the given principle is rooted in “the requirement to acknowledge autonomy and the requirement to protect those with diminished autonomy” (Office for Human Research Protections, 1979, para. 12). In
other words, since the subjects of the research were drug abusers, they could fall into both categories. By not informing the parents about the primary purpose of the research, Dr. Jones exhibited disrespect for all persons, which include drug abusers and child abusers as well. Parents are autonomous agents who must be informed about the research in which they are deciding to participate. A similar case can be observed in the Milgram study, which also involved deception and non-provision of the research objectives. The main reason is that subjects were led to believe they were to administer shocks for fake test subjects, and they were the primary research interest in order to observe the impact of authority on obedience (Yanow & Schwartz-Shea, 2018). In both cases, there is
a sense of deception and untruthfulness in regards to research participants.Secondly, Dr. Jones evidently failed to comply with the ethical principle of beneficence. One can see how the researcher justified the beneficence of the research since it could have led to fewer children being abused. However, the report states that there are “two general rules have been formulated as complementary expressions of beneficent actions in this sense: (1) do not harm and (2) maximize possible benefits and minimize possible harms” (Office for Human Research Protections, 1979, para. 17). In other words, the harms of the research were present, where a parent could become a subject for more research projects. In addition, in the most desirable outcome, child abuse cases would only stop among drug-abusing parents, but child abuse
On the one hand, the concept of ethical relativism provides a unique opportunity of finding the middle ground and introducing a compromise into the discussion of a contentious moral issue. On the other hand, ethical relativism incorporates quite a range of contradictions and challenges to resolving moral concerns. Therefore, considering the essential objections to the idea of ethical relativism is vital to the development of a cohesive argument.The attempt at establishing the idea that no objective truth can be located in any circumstances and that every situation could be seen as ethically ambiguous is the main issue that ethical relativism suggests. The challenge of maintaining some semblance of moral standards and differentiating between the objective good and the objective evil increases exponentially with the incorporation of ethical relativism
Culture is one of the main characteristics of human behavior that can be shaped through the existing beliefs, norms, and values. There are several ways to learn the importance and impact of culture, and the two most common approaches are cultural relativism and ethnocentrism. For a long period, ethnocentrism was the norm for understanding the context of a culture in human interactions. The main idea is that someone’s culture should be considered a standard for measuring other cultures. In other words, researchers aim at comparing similarities of different cultural elements (beliefs or practices) through the prism of a particular culture. It is enough to use one culture for analysis and rely on its origins for judging other cultures. However, this method is usually associated with incorrect or subjective
Horror films have become one of the fundamental genres of cinema, the popularity of which is not inferior to the other styles. The reason for it is the specific reaction of the target audience, namely a powerful emotional impulse. Moreover, it becomes a psychological relief for some persons, which helps to distract from one’s problems. Horror films are not the modern version of public lynching; they formulate a way for people to obtain a strong emotional response through fear.Fear is a primary human emotion, which manifests itself as an instinct for self-preservation, namely a reaction to a potential threat. It may seem strange for one that people pay money to feel such an unpleasant emotion while watching horror films. However, in the essay Why We Crave Horror Movies
watching scary scenes. Besides, the powerful emotional response makes horror films so popular and successful nowadays.To conclude, one identified that horror films do not formulate a form of modern public lynching. They are the one’s method to receive the bright, emotive response. There are various reasons for it, beginning from obtaining psychological discharge and ending to distracting from reality and one’s urgent problems. The audience’s reaction is the key point to evaluating the horror film’s success and why it is considered art.
The film “Coded Bias” provides comprehensive information regarding the problems related to facial recognition algorithms, determining several sources of bias. They primarily include the original orientation of creators on white faces, leading to the lack of data regarding dark complexion and the prevalence of prejudiced male developers. These conditions do not allow establishing equality in terms of race and gender and seem to present a significant threat to the field stemming from the failure to meet everyone’s needs. In addition, the lack of knowledge of how the programs process data and make conclusions does not help eliminate the risks.In turn, the possible ways of reducing this type of bias attributed to present-day facial recognition algorithms are to prevent their implementation in legal proceedings and police activity in general
precision of programs but also resolve the challenge concerning surveillance and racialized minorities. This standpoint is based on the above consideration, according to which accountability for decisions should be clearly established. This change can be performed if the algorithms work correctly, and minimizing or eliminating bias, in this case, is possible if internal and external evaluations correlate with each other. In this way, the future of this field in terms of its suitability for investigations is conditional upon the efforts of specialists in resolving the existing issues to address major concerns of Nakamura and Browne.
Albinism is one of the genetic conditions affecting numerous people throughout the world. It is commonly defined as a “rare, non-contagious genetically inherited disorder”, which can occur in various individuals “regardless of ethnicity or gender” (Reimer-Kirkham et al., 2019, p. 748). Diagnosing albinism typically requires a visual examination, upon which such signs as lack of color in the skin, eyelashes, and hair, or abnormalities in the eyes can be observed. To specify the type of albinism, genetic testing might be conducted (Reimer-Kirkham et al., 2019). As this condition is caused by defects in particular genes, genetic testing allows establishing which genes are damaged and how severe the occurrence of albinism is.In the majority of albinos, the lack of melanin leads to such symptoms as the absence of pigmentation
have albinism or carry the relevant gene (Liu et al., 2021). As a result, this disorder cannot be fully treated, but some methods can alleviate the severity of the symptoms. Although some strategies have shown great promise in eliminating gene malfunctions, their further efficiency for the broad population is yet to be proven (Liu et al., 2021). Therefore, diagnosed individuals primarily rely on sunglasses and sunscreen to protect themselves from the ultraviolet rays and might also receive surgery to reduce involuntary eye movements.
The nurse practitioner’s work is vital in providing high-quality treatment for patients. Nurse practitioners can be considered as providers of medical services and as mediums between patients and clinicians, ensuring the ethical and educational aspects of care. The two last factors are connected primarily with achieving the highly-efficient communication with the patient. Through the gained experience, I enhanced my understanding of the concepts that can be applied in communication with different patients. The approach, as well as the educational strategies, may vary depending on age, nationality, and other factors. It is vital to implement the relevant particular case approaches to ensure efficient education for patients. Another valuable aspect of my experience is the work with my mentor. She provided me with the opportunity to develop assessment skills through
Face recognition is the automatic localization of a human face in an image or video and, if necessary, identifying a person’s identity based on available databases. Interest in these systems is very high due to the wide range of problems they solve (Jeevan et al., 2022). This technology is a biometric software application capable of identifying a person by comparing and analyzing templates based on facial contours. This is possible because each person has unique facial contours (Kumar and Munish, 2019). In this regard, it is essential to understand what this technology is used for today and whether it poses a danger to people.Technology DevelopmentMachine vision and face recognition technologies have been developing very actively since the middle of the last century. However, they have only reached a
significant level and begun recognizing faces with almost perfect accuracy (Wang et al., 2020). Technology’s rapid development was preceded by several reasons that together have become critical factors in its improvement. First, powerful computers could cope with processing significant amounts of information. Secondly, databases appeared with photographs of many people, which made it possible to develop machine intelligence (Adjabi et al., 2020). The third factor was the leap in developing neural networks, which play an essential role in face recognition.Possibilities of UseThe technology is applied in a large number of spheres of human activity. These include the security and safety sector, bank card verification, online payments, forensics, mobile applications, searching for photos in large image databases, and tagging people on social networks (Li et al., 2020). All this
makes it much easier to perform work and routine daily tasks.In addition to the applications above, facial recognition also works in medicine. Dedicated medical applications such as Face2Gene and DeepGestalt use facial recognition to detect genetic disorders (Latorre-Pellicer et al., 2020). They analyze the faces and compare them with a database of faces of those people who have various disorders. In addition, this technology helps to provide a greater level of security in society. Many stores have facial recognition systems that mark people as a threat if they steal something from stores. Such a system can identify a shoplifter and notify the store owner of his past antics, even if such a shoplifter has never been to the store before. Facial recognition can also be implemented in the
education system. For example, one school in Sweden uses this system to check class attendance (Kun, 2022). This is how people use the latest invention today, but in the future, it can be said that the methods of applying the technology will expand significantly.Critical AnalysisDespite the uniqueness and innovativeness of the technology, it has its drawbacks and disadvantages. For example, in March 2019, IBM was accused of illegally using photographs of people to improve facial recognition algorithms (Solon, 2019). At the same time, it is unknown how many such cases remain unreported, which seriously threatens human privacy. There is a risk that private corporations or the state may use personal photographs of people for their purposes without their consent (Guo and Xiaoguo, 2019). This, in turn, raises ethical
The core idea of the collision theory is manifested in the notion that reactions only occur when particles collide with each other. In addition, the colliding particles must carry enough energy for the reaction to occur. The overall orientation of the particles is also critical for the reaction since they need to be oriented accordingly. In short, according to the collision theory, the factors affecting reaction rates include collisions, orientation, and activation energy levels. When applying the framework, the key elements are a steric factor, collision frequency, and activation energy per unit, as well as other important chemical variables, such as temperature, concentration, and constants (Gottfried 418). Therefore, the collision theory is comprised of three core factors as well as additional variables.It is important to note the fact
that activation sources can be different. Reactions between ions in solution occur with small activation energy, which is required to dehydrate the ions. Reactions between free atoms and radicals do not require activation energy since atoms and radicals are active species (Timberlake 107). In homogeneous gas reactions, the main source of activation is collisions, the proportion of which is determined by the Boltzmann distribution law and increases with temperature. Activation can also be caused by external causes, such as the absorption of light quanta during photochemical reactions, the action of electrical discharges, the impact of electrons, a-particles, neutrons, and other radiations (Gottfried 423). In heterogeneous catalytic reactions, the sources of activation can be the changes that occur in the reacting molecules when they are adsorbed by the catalyst
surface.In the event of a collision of active molecules, there must be a well-defined arrangement in the space of the active groups that make up the molecule, which would ensure the formation of final products. The steric factor, in most cases, characterizes the probability of a certain geometric configuration of particles in a collision. The collision theory, with its comparatively simple treatment of the problems of chemical kinetics, has explained many different factors. However, at the same time, because of its schematic nature, it led to contradictions with observations. The method of active collisions does not explain the influence of the solvent, pressure, additions of inert gases, and other factors on the reaction rate (Gottfried 460). It does not allow a theoretical assessment of the steric factor, and
AbstractIt has been more than a decade since first commercial flight and the Airbus A380has not experienced the success once thought it would. Many airlines have retired the A380 and opted for smaller planes for various reasons. However, it is unknown why the production of the plane has stopped. This research is conducted to find out the reasons behind the failure of the production of Airbus A380. Three methods of data collection, that is using documents and records from the company, survey and interview, were used. For the survey, one hundred and twenty participants agreed to be involved and three others for the interview. After analysing the data, some of the reasons behind the failure include inaccurate predictions, size, as well as its inefficiency. With the current situation
of the fuel prices and reduced number of passengers, having a plane that uses four engines is not economical.IntroductionAirbus Company decided to come up with a spacious plane model named Airbus A380. Throughout the entire world and among all aircrafts ever constructed, it is ranked as the largest. In 1990, with the intention of fighting for the market share with Boeing 747, the company announced its intentions of coming up with the plane. To start the process, it launched more than ten billion programme ten years later. The initial model was revealed in 2005 in Toulouse with its first flight in the same year. Issues with the electrical wiring resulted in a 2-year delay plus the development cost rose to eighteen billion pounds. The company received its certificate
from EASA as well as the United States Federal Aviation Administration in 2006. The aircraft was delivered to Singapore Airlines as the first delivery in 2007 and started service a few days later after delivery. The production of the aircraft climaxed at thirty annually in 2012 as well as 2014. Nevertheless, the company admits that the twenty-five billion dollars it invested in the project cannot be recovered. Airbus announced in early 2019 that production of the aircraft would end in 2021 after last delivery to Emirates.More than a decade after first air travel for commercial purposes, several airline companies have opted for stopping the use of the A380 plus its production is no longer going on. In spite of the plane being spoken so highly of as compared
to others including the Boeing 747, it has remained unsuccessful in the market. Apart from focusing on the plane alone, it is essential to identify the issues that hinder the air travel sector and thus airlines. Understanding the issues can help in pinpointing the root cause behind the issue of Airbus A380. The air transport industry is huge and supports so many people working as staff of various airline companies. It also contributes a large portion to the world economy. Regardless of the many challenges until the COVID-19 pandemic emerged, it was on the path to success. It is correct to claim that even though the pandemic adversely affected the industry, it has started recovering from the impact left by the pandemic and may get back to where
it was prior to the pandemic. This paper looks at the review of the problems facing the airline industry as a whole, the methodology used in the research, findings on the failure of A380 production and the analysis.Narrative BodyReview of the Airline IndustryAlmost fourteen years from the initial commercial flight, many airlines have retired the A380 and its production has stopped. Even though the aircraft is an engineering masterpiece, it was not successful in the market, as suggested by (Nelson, 2020). Apart from just focusing on the aircraft alone, it is important to understand the challenges that face airlines. The air transport industry is a universe in itself and encompasses a huge workforce plus contributes a major portion to the world economy (Arjomandi et al., 2018). It was
set for significant growth, regardless of the many challenges until the COVID-19 pandemic emerged (Gupta et al., 2020). It is correct to claim that even though the pandemic adversely affected the industry, it has started recovering from the impact and may get back to where it was prior to the pandemic.The air transport market has been on the rise and appeared to have success before the pandemic hit. In 2018, a study revealed that the world aviation market outlook had been positive within a few years earlier (Jackson, 2021). The study report shared that at that moment, the world air transport industry supported more than sixty five million jobs plus contributed more than two trillion dollars in global financial activity (Jackson, 2021). Moreover, it stated that a free-trade
strategy would aid further the growth in the sector. It will also come to record more than five trillion dollars in financial activities by 2036 while also guaranteeing close to one hundred million job opportunities (Jackson, 2021). The sector plays a key role in the modern society but it is essential to point out that it has its own challenges. From struggling with recessions to governmental regulations as well as terrorism to labour shortage, such issues can lead to airline reducing or even stopping production.Fuel efficiency is among the main challenges facing the airlines. Availability of fuel as well as costs remains a significant financial factor impacting the airline (Belhadi et al., 2021). High prices have a direct influence on the financial portfolio of airlines. With the increase
of airline companies every year, the prices of fuel have skyrocketed which has resulted in a vicious cycle. Other alternatives for fuel have failed to be impactful and thus maintaining efficiency has remained a challenge for the industry.The global economy is also a challenge for the sector and thus the airlines. The status of the global economy is a primary issue in the market. For instance, the 2008 economy crisis had a major effect on the sector. As the economy takes a hit, travel as well as fuel prices rise while the number of passengers reduces. The effect of the recession on other sectors such as tourism is also a critical factor impacting the sector. As the travel companies seek development in different nations plus explore new ways,
they have to remember the market situation as well as volatility in the regions. Different nations have unique economic situations which airliners need to consider when they plan for global expansion.The experience and comfort of a passenger while on a journey is also a challenge in the sector. The air transport sector is service-oriented and its success is reliant on how great the passengers feel, as suggested by (Ika et al., 2021). The reason why this is a challenge is because there is always a group of passengers who are not contented with the services. Nevertheless, this is something that has resulted in companies being seamless through the entire air travel. To accomplish a state whereby all passengers are satisfied with the services is difficult because no customer
is alike. Surveys on customers and their feedbacks show that not every passenger has a great travel experience, as suggested by (Ika et al., 2021). For example, an IATA survey in 2017 showed that only about fifty-six per cent of North American customers were okay with the travel experience. This shows that companies will continue to struggle to impress all their customers at once.Airline infrastructure is also a huge challenge for the airlines worldwide. Airports require consistent upgrade of its infrastructure such as terminals, runways, hotels, lounges, among others (Li et al., 2020). There is a significant competition in the area of infrastructure as it determines how even customers view a company. To sustain the image of an airline and stay ahead of others, onsite facilities like the
aircraft ground handling systems will require regular renovation. While doing that a few times can be beneficial to a company and increase the number of customers, doing it regularly requires a huge financial investment (Ika et al., 2021). Even more crucial is the fact that an aircraft needs a regular upgrade and maintenance too. This is because the safety of the customer depends on the condition of an aircraft. Having faulty aircraft seating or doors is liable to get an airline sued. Infrastructure is among the most crucial challenges of the market as carriers are support to maintain available fleet plus also guarantee to buy the latest ones while ensuring lowering costs as well as fuel efficiency.Worldwide congestion is also a major challenge facing airlines around the world
and thus the sector. Several years ago, the air travel was a luxurious event, which a few rich people engaged in (Ika et al., 2021). It is no longer the same and more people are traveling using air transport which has resulted in overcrowding of many airports globally and flight delays. Majority of flights appear to be full, the terminals congested, and the skies overcrowded with the excessive number of aircrafts. Air traffic plus airport congestion are significant challenges facing the market which appears to lack the solutions. Carriers are still struggling to make seamless trips for customers and thus remain to be a viable problem.Advancement in technology is among the challenges the airline sector is facing. Technology is a double-edged sword that in spite of the good
it has brought to the world, the increase on its dependence has resulted in vulnerability of the sector. For example, if there is a software problem, the operations may remain crippled until resolution. If there is inadequate financing, upgrade of infrastructure like the communication system may prove impossible which might result in the failure if the whole system.Terrorism which is a security issue is among the major challenges of the modern times. Tragedies from past times have resulted in fear of many passengers as well as staff (Woo et al., 2021). Even though, terrorist attacks have reduced recently, it still remains a threat as companies in the sector have to remain vigilant always. The rise in fear results in rigorous check-ins plus consequently longer lines as well as
delays. It has in the past forced companies to develop highly secure screening methods as well as equipment (Woo et al., 2021). Even political conflicts between countries can be viewed as a major challenge of the industry. Irrational regulations by one nation because of conflict can make it hard for carriers to transport passengers conveniently as well as move cargo in the international territories. Lastly, without doubt, climate changes as well as environmental problems are issues that prove to be a challenge to airlines globally. It is something that has gone on for a long time spanning for more than three decades.MethodologyIn this research, the main research question is the reason behind the failure of the Airbus A380 production. Knowing this, it is important to find the right
method of data collection that suits such a study. Studying about an aircraft involves much review of available data in documents and records as well as online surveys and interviews. I decided to contact the Airbus Company through email and ask for a chance to access some documents and records that would help in my study. After they agreed, it was a great opportunity as I analysed the data myself and therefore it was difficult to obtain incorrect information. The advantage of using documents in such a research is that it allows an individual to obtain consistent information so that analysing it becomes easy.After studying the documents consisting of information of the plane, I decided to use survey method. Conducting a survey can be difficult and has its
limitations especially if people one requires response from are far. Therefore, to counter this, I settled for the online survey which can accommodate anyone and from any distance. Through the use of mail services, I reached out to over one hundred individuals who work and those who worked for the air travel company to get their opinion on the issue. While sending the surveys to them, I also attached another document that explained how I had accessed their contact information and what the research is about as well as their information would not be revealed to anyone else. Ensuring that they do not have the fear of being exposed empowers them to give unbiased responses.I collected and analysed the responses through the mail services too as nearly ninety-five
per cent of participants submitted their responses. After the survey, it was important to interview a few managers of the company to get their opinion on the issue. Most of them declined as they cited their employment status as a concern. However, three executive managers accepted but in the condition it does not involve questions that would put their jobs at risk. After the interview, the information gathered was enough to come up with reasons why the production stopped.FindingsThe aircraft is among the largest commercial models with many claiming it as the largest one with the capacity to hold up to eight hundred and fifty-three passengers at once. Being the lone commercial aircraft to have more than full deck, it is considered an engineering masterpiece (Woo et al.,
2021). Since the first flight more than a decade ago, it has two hundred and fifty one orders with one hundred and twenty-three belonging to the Emirates Airlines. Nevertheless, several airlines have already started retiring the aircraft and one of the reasons is the pandemic. Airbus has closed production plus it is testing last aircraft after fourteen years of production.Among the reasons behind failure of its production is that the aircraft is too big. It is noteworthy to know that many companies did not order for the aircraft because of its massive size. With a wingspan that is bigger than several Boeing 737s, it proved impossible to fill the plane to full capacity on a trip to a particular route. Due to size, the aircraft could only land
at particular airports which needed renovation including having wider gates that could accommodate the plane.Another reason is that the aircraft was inefficient and that because of its size, more issues of inefficiency arose, as suggested by (GENG & BHATTACHARYA, 2021). The plane needed four engines to remain on air which is highly inefficient for companies because of the amount of fuel burning. The smaller Boeing 787 with two engines consumes five thousand and four hundred litres of fuel every hour while A380 consumes more than twice the amount every hour. After the tragedy in 2001, fuel costs skyrocketed which decreased the popularity of four engine aircrafts. Nevertheless, Airbus had already invested much in the study plus development of the model that it appeared too late.Another reason is the
Airbus company inaccurate predictions of the aviation market. At the start of the twenty-first century, the company projected that the future of aviation was going to be big size long-term airlines like the Boeing 747 (Ferreira et al., 2020). According to the company, smaller planes would utilize less preferred routes and airports to a hub airport plus fly to a second hub airport and then to another less preferred airport. Nonetheless, the trend did not last and the hub-and-spoke model as it was known no longer was popular. In addition to above reasons, it can also be said that the recent pandemic to hit the world, COVID-19, has resulted in a significant drop in air travel demand. The lockdown restrictions as they began to be implemented by different
nations impacted the number of flights as well as passengers. As a result, many companies in the air travel industry began going back to smaller planes, for example, Airbus A220.ConclusionNearly fourteen years from the initial commercial flight, many airlines have retired the A380 and its production has stopped. Despite being termed as an engineering masterpiece it has failed to be successful in the market. Apart from just focusing on the aircraft alone, it is important to understand the challenges that face airlines. For instance, terrorism, pandemics that lead to lockdown restrictions, high fuel prices as well as unsatisfied customers. The air transport industry is a universe in itself and encompasses a huge workforce plus contributes a major portion to the world economy.It was set for significant growth, regardless
The eighth paragraph of David Dockery’s Faith and Learning discusses the New Criticism in Literary Christian Theory. The main feature of this perception of the literary text is that the reader should not look for the secret meaning of the writer (Dockery 281). Thus, the perception of the reader himself did not play a role because the meaning of the text was entirely consistent with what was written. The paragraph also discusses poststructuralism and deconstruction. Both phenomena are explained by the dynamism of literary theory, including within the framework of New Criticism. Poststructuralism and Reconstruction emphasized the aesthetic belonging of the text and did not consider the ethical aspects. These movements also reinforced the overconfidence of critics to understand the meaning of the text correctly. The author also
The authors of the article Feature engineering for crime hotspot detection state that cities with a complex infrastructure require ‘smart’ systems of crime detection; they claim the hotspot detection approach to be highly effective. The reviewed article focuses on two cities: San Fransisco (US) and Natal (Brazil); the authors analyzed “spatio-temporal and urban features” of both cities in order to evaluate their significance in crime detection (Borges et al., 2019, p. 2). Such factors as the number of odds per area, prosecution rate per area, road types, police types, and time features have been taken into account for a proper depiction of the criminal hotspots (Borges et al., 2019). The interlink between particular infrastructural specificities and areas with high crime records has been analyzed (Borges et al., 2019).
The virtual exhibition that I chose to visit is the one at the Smithsonian National Museum of American History, exploring the American food culture from the second half of the twentieth century up to the present day. The exhibition presents five different sections, each of which is devoted to exploring a particular phenomenon. Julia Child’s Kitchen explores the impact that a legendary cook Julia Child made on the way Americans viewed cooking, transforming the art of cookbooks and becoming one of the biggest television stars along the way. New and Improved! The section provides insight into how attitudes about an improved way of living alongside new technologies influenced the food culture in postwar America. Resetting the Table expands on various sources that contributed to the Americans’ thoughts and
feelings about food – from immigrants’ cultures to activists’ principles of life. Brewing a Revolution speaks about brewing in the United States, and Wine for the Table communicates how with no wine traditions beforehand, America eventually sparked a revolution in the wine industry in the 20th century.When it comes to identifying the fields of social studies this exhibition is related to, it is linked to communication studies and history. By visiting different sections and reading about factors contributing to the alterations in American food culture, one develops an understanding of how important it is for us to communicate with one another. Without ideas brought by Americans to their country from abroad and unique manifestations of different cultures that immigrants aim to preserve, it is hard to imagine how
scarce modern American cuisine could be. That is why the section I found especially thrilling was Resetting the Table – it tells the story of how immigrants opened up new doors for the residents of the United States in terms of products, flavors, and ways of cooking. Additionally, it explains how various occurrences, such as the phenomenon of dieting, political movements, and countercultures, all affected food culture in their respective times. I was surprised to find out how much historical events affected what and how Americans ate. It really gives a perspective on how interconnected all spheres of our lives are, which is fascinating.Such exhibitions are a genuine find for implementation in my future classroom. These virtual field trips are essentially a history lesson, but with information delivered
an entertaining way. Exhibitions such as Food: Transforming the American Table are great at capturing a student’s attention while giving them a unique history lesson. When one looks at photographs capturing processes that resulted in a cultural phenomenon or familiarizes themselves with images of artifacts of a particular time period, they are likely to not look away. At least less likely than while listening to a lecture – no matter how interesting – or reading a paragraph in a book. Therefore, such virtual field trips are incredibly useful in a classroom.
I have been working as a nurse in one of the hospitals in Illinois for a long time. The US healthcare system has a pluralistic character, expressed in the absence of single centralized management and numerous types of medical institutions. For several categories of citizens treated for free, expenses are compensated by the state or special funds. Many economists are concerned that so much of the gross domestic product is spent on healthcare. After all, if so much money is spent on medical services, less is left for housing, food, clothing, and other vital goods and services.The Medicaid program, designed to help people with low incomes, is funded by the federal government and the state level. Since each state has its own Medicaid program, this creates significant difficulties
OutlineThe presentation will begin with a detailed description of psychotropic medication and the possible risks related to its use during pregnancy. The research will offer a thorough review of the consequences of using psychotic medicines during pregnancy. The paper will then address the use of folic acid during the pregnancy period, which is an essential vitamin that prevents abnormalities. In this segment, the report will address the recommended doses and anticipated benefits of use.Furthermore, the paper will explore toxicity of folic acid and symptoms of the drug overdose. Additionally, the paper will review the impacts of folic overdose during pregnancy. A case study within this project will help elaborate on using folic acid supplements among women using psychotic medications. The findings of this study will help the researcher
come to recommendations to improve the understanding of the relationship between the use of folic acid and psychotic medicines during pregnancy.Psychotropic MedicationPsychotropic medications describe any drugs that affect the users’ behaviors, perceptions, moods, and thoughts. It is an umbrella for different medicines, including mood stabilizers, antidepressants, antipsychotics, stimulants, and anti-anxiety agents. Psychotic drugs are vital tools in the society that helps promote wellbeing, since mental health and illnesses affect our daily livelihoods. These psychotic medications do not cure mental illnesses but rather help suppress the symptoms that might interfere with the therapy. Indeed, the drugs take the edge off and allow the patient to develop skills to cope with and better manage their mental health. Additionally, the psychotrophic medicines do not work instantly but take weeks before a
patient experiences their full effect.Risks of Psychotropic Medication during PregnancyAlthough the evidence on the risks of prescribing psychotropic medications remains limited, studies have linked exposure to antidepressants during pregnancy to malformations and long-term developmental outcomes. The drugs also cause neonatal and pregnancy complications, such as low birth weight, spontaneous abortion, persistent pulmonary hypertension of the newborn, developmental disorders, autism spectrum disorder, and neonatal serotonin discontinuation symptoms (Samochowiec et al., 2019). Niethe and Whitfield (2018) also note that exposure of the fetal to lithium during pregnancy increases the risk of cardiac malformations and other congenital disabilities. Hence, psychotropic medications may have a wide range of adverse impacts on the unborn child. The use of psychotic drugs during pregnancy can also cause long-term neurobehavioral sequelae, direct neonatal toxicity, and teratogenic
effects. However, of the growing concern is the risk of untreated mental disorders, which can influence the fetoplacental integrity and the development of the central nervous systems of the fetus. Hence, weighing the benefits and risks of using psychotic medicines during pregnancy is essential.Consequences of Using Psychotic MedicationDespite the risks these medications might pose to the unborn baby, these drugs help promote mental well-being for pregnant mothers suffering from different mental illnesses. They do so by adjusting the level of brain neurotransmitters or brain chemicals like serotonin, norepinephrine, dopamine, and gamma aminobutyric acid. However, the side effects linked to these medications are more pronounced. Commonly reported side effects to include exhaustion, nausea, blurry vision, nightmares, headaches, trembling, and dry mouth. According to Goldberg and Ernst (2018), psychotic agents
cause massive weight loss and other gastrointestinal complications. Therefore, psychotic medication can cause both mental well-being and adverse health effects to the user.Folic AcidFolic acid is a synthetic form of vitamin B called folate that promotes the manufacture of red blood cells. The vitamin also facilitates the growth of the baby’s neural tube into the spinal cord and brain. Folic acid serves as a dietary supplement that the body converts into folate. Some people use folate in food fortification since it is more stable during handling and storage. However, folate is a vital component that enables the body to make RNA and DNA and the metabolism of amino acids, essential for cell division. Although the vitamin occurs naturally in some foods, the recommended daily intake of the vitamin
among pregnant women cannot be met through foods alone.Recommended DosageThe Institute of Medicine Food and Nutrition Board of the National Academy of Sciences recommends all expectant mothers take a 400 mcg dose of folic acid afore and after the perinatal period to inhibit congenital infirmities (Centers of Disease Control and Prevention, 2021). However, the user can consume up to 600 mcg between the fourth and final months of pregnancy. For the folic acid to be helpful, women should take the vitamins daily, starting a period before she becomes pregnant.Components of Folic AcidIt comprises inactive ingredients like lactose monohydrate, stearic acid, sodium starch glycolate, and microcrystalline cellulose. The folic acid supplements contain three large sub-components: glutamic acid, para-aminobenzoic acid, and pteridine ring. The glutamic acid serves as an amino
acid that the body can synthesize by itself. These components of the folic acid contribute to the growth of maternal tissues and hemopoiesis during pregnancy.Benefits of Folic AcidFolic acid helps reduce the plasma concentration of homocysteine during pregnancy. According to a study by Shiralizadeh et al. (2017), folic supplements decrease homocysteine levels during the prenatal period. Reducing plasma homocysteine plasma levels and protein oxidation helps condense oxidative pressure and prevent the commencement of illnesses like a congenital abnormality, hypertension, and other sicknesses that emerge during the prenatal period resulting from oxidative stress. The intake of folic acid supplements is vital in different metabolic pathways, promotes nucleic acid synthesis, growth, and healthy development of the fetus.Additional Benefits of Folic AcidBesides the impact of folic acid use on protecting against
neural tube defects and other mental illnesses, it can also safeguard the mother and the unborn child from adverse health outcomes. The supplements reduce the risk of premature birth and miscarriage. According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (2021), the intake of the recommended dosage of folic acid during pregnancy reduces the risk of low birth weight, poor development in the uterus, cleft lip, and palate. Among pregnant women, the intake of folates diminishes the risk of heart disease, stroke, some forms of cancer, Alzheimer’s disease, and pregnancy complications like preeclampsia. Hence, the intake of 400 mcg during pregnancy may positively impact both the mother and the unborn baby.Women who Need more FolateHealthcare providers recommend consistent intake of folic acid supplements among women who have a
higher risk of giving birth to a baby with neural tube defects. The at-high risk women include parents with neural tube effects, history of the flaws within the family, diagnosis with type 1 diabetes, and if the mother takes seizures and epilepsy medications that affect the folate absorption. Medical professionals should prescribe the dosages with care to pregnant women with various lifestyle diseases since the medicines can affect the treatment and control of other illnesses like seizures. High-risk women should take 5 mg of folate every day, within is ten times higher than the dosage recommended to lower-risk women. However, the women should take these medications under medical supervision.Toxic Dose of Folic Acid1000 mcg of folic acid intake is more than twice the recommended dietary allowance of 400
mcg. Indeed, a folic acid overdose occurs from taking a toxic level of folic acid supplements other than consuming too many folate-rich foods. Although the overdose can benefit a specific group of people like the elderly, the practice may negatively impact the users’ health. Consuming more than 1000 mcg of folic acid every day may have no benefit to the pregnant woman but can pose severe health damages.Symptoms of Folic Acid OverdoseThe development of excessive intake of the folic acid supplement can cause hypersensitive reactions, gastrointestinal issues, and difficulties sleeping due to irritability, hyperactivity, excitability, and inability to concentrate. Moreover, the overdose also causes psychotic behaviors, depression, masking the deficiency of vitamin B12, and derails the absorption of zinc in the gut (Shiralizadeh et al., 2017). Other indirect
impacts entail seizures since the medication decreases the functionality of anticonvulsant drugs among the users. Hence, the overdose of folic acid may have adverse health impacts on the users. Common folic acid overdose signs include gastrointestinal difficulties like gas, nausea, bloating, diarrhea, and abdominal cramps. In extreme cases, the overdose may result in irritability and depression.Consequences of Folic Acid Overdose among Pregnant WomenThe excess intake of folic acid supplements can use adverse side effects like slower brain development for children and fastened mental decline in older women. The extra intake masks the vitamin B12 deficiency, which consequently causes irreversible brain damage, megaloblastic anemia, and thus, speed age-related mental decline (Bailey et al. 2020). Supplementing with too much folic acid increases insulin resistance and slows down children’s brain development.
People who take more than 1000 mcg of folic acid stand a higher chance of developing cancer later in life. Altogether, the excessive intake of folic acid during pregnancy may affect the child’s brain development, mask a B12 deficiency, speed mental decline, and increase cancer recurrence.Meta-analysis Case StudyBender et al. (2017) carried out meta-analyses to assess the influence of folate levels on the functionality of psychotic medications. The study is a meta-analysis exploration that carried out a statistical analysis by combining the findings of multiple scientific studies. The researcher entails a collection of reflections about folates among pregnant women with mental illnesses. The reliance on several experiments allows Bender et al. (2017) to establish a statistical significance across the studies with conflicting results.Study BackgroundBased on the analysis, people
with mental illnesses like depressions tend to have lower folate levels than those without mental challenges. Similarly, the lower folate level directly impacts the probability of developing different mental illnesses, increased risk of more severe depressive symptoms, and depressive-symptom relapse. The folate deficiency emerges from different causes, including inadequate dietary intake and the destruction of the vital vitamin during cooking. Based on the review of the past studies, there is a direct affiliation between folate deficiency and mental problems like depression. Hence, it is essential to understand the impact of folic acid supplements on women patients using psychotropic medication during pregnancy.SampleFollowing the PRISMA guidelines, the current meta-analysis study used digital literature search in articles found in the PubMed and PsycINFO databases. PRISMA is a set of questions that
allow scholars to report wide range of meta-analyses and systemic reviews. Commonly to assess the risks and benefit of health care. After collecting the required data, the researcher performed a meta-analysis in R Package Version 3.11 using the metaphor package. The meta-analysis comprised 43 experiments with 48 outcome sizes.Study FindingsThe current meta-analysis found out that folate or folic acid supplementation improved the efficacy of depression treatment. Based on the study findings, folate supplementation has an increased ability to add value to treating different mental disorders like depression during pregnancy. However, although the intake of folic acid supplements led to positive outcomes with depression due to shorter inpatient treatment stays and improved efficacy of traditional treatment, it has no impact on depressive symptoms. Hence, folic acid supplementation may reduce
folic acid affect the effectiveness of psychotropic medications. Indeed, there is an increased need for how underdose and overdose of folic acid supplements influence the efficacy of psychotic drugs among mentally ill pregnant women. Future studies should also collect data from pregnant women from different cultural background. The findings of such future studies will help enhance the overall well-being of pregnant women and reduce the overall cost of care. The results will also leave a substantial impact on the current body of the literature.
Biomedical research includes direct interaction with individuals, and rules exist to set boundaries for studying subjects in a morally appropriate manner. After terrifying experiments conducted on humans during World War II, ethical regulations were established to regulate scientific work and eliminate harm or disrespect to the participants (Piasecki & Dranseika, 2019). History revealed that although rapid technological progress is impossible without research, respect for subjects must always be shown regardless of how it might complicate the process. The latest studies include ethical considerations and peer-reviewing boards also check if the biomedical studies have doubtful aspects in their methodologies. This paper aims to discuss the impact of the history of research ethics on modern approaches and the protection of the rights of human subjects.Ethics are vital for biomedical research
because their methodologies include direct intervention into an individual’s private space, body, or mental health conditions. The history of regulations began with the Nuremberg Code established in 1948 which declared that no study could be conducted on a person without their voluntary consent (Dawson et al., 2020). Another significant part of the research ethics in biomedicine is the Declaration of Helsinki which provided the guidelines which, for instance, prohibit the conduct of studies without prior laboratory testing on animals (Piasecki & Dranseika, 2019). The regulations address main principles such as respect, beneficence, and justice through informed consent, risk assessment, and fair outcomes prognosis. Learning the history of research ethics impacts the view of biomedical studies by providing the understanding of the priority of human rights over any scientific
progress, even if it promises beneficial results for healthcare.Many modern and old biomedical research articles have been read and studied throughout the nursing educational course, and different ethical considerations were noticed. Furthermore, during the work on the PICOT question, the most recent studies related to the COVID-19 pandemic were analyzed and can serve as an example of protecting human rights. The practicum issue for which the PICOT framework is used is the increased number of skipped follow-up visits by impoverished patients in the local clinic (Dawson et al., 2020). Studies about the identified population and the influence of non-attendance on their health outcomes and service quality were selected for retrieving evidence to develop an intervention. For instance, the article “Negative impacts of COVID-19 lockdown on mental health service
used for educational or scientific purposes and requires a signed document to allow personal data analysis.The history of research ethics had crucial lessons about prioritizing human subjects’ rights and addressing the principles of justice and beneficence. Indeed, scientific interventions must have boundaries that cannot be passed despite the demand for further progress, and participants must always be aware of the studies’ methodologies. The analysis of articles related to the PICOT question about the impoverished population skipping their follow-up visits revealed that the researchers might still underestimate the ethical considerations.
In the 21 st century, the matters of teamwork and organizational structure have been in the spotlight of the experts’ and researchers’ attention. However, the concept on its own is not a recent invention, as the pioneers of business acknowledged the essential role of a well-organized team in the development of a corporate entity. The creation of a strong, functional team that works in a synchronized manner is not an easy endeavor. As Henry Ford once said, “coming together is a beginning. Keeping together is progress. Working together is success” (Di Feliceantonio, 2015). In this regard, the case of his company provides a vivid example of how a strong business team can create success in long-term development.Henry Ford is known for having revolutionized the landscape of the automotive
industry, but his impact extends beyond one sector of global economy. Ford’s contribution to the rules of business, in general, make him a legendary figure and an important source of inspiration for business-related research. As per Riopelle and Wang (2019), Ford favored teamwork and believed in the prospects of mutually beneficial collaboration as a driving force of business development. Within his own enterprise, he is considered to be the pioneer of efficient organizational structures that utilize the joint efforts of the team to make the production process quick, reliable, and cost-efficient (Link, 2018). The assembly line is one of Ford’s essential inventions that became possible through the precise team-building around a solid central structure. His anecdotal decision to pay his repair workers for the time they rest rather
Ford Motor Company presents a clear and concise business strategy that consists of four key elements. In particular, the company strives to improve people’s lives, strengthen the bonds between communities, and make our planet healthier ( Ford , “Our Purpose”). Therefore, it is important to hire employees who will be committed to these elements of corporate strategy. Aligning their talent with the company’s strategy would demand clear communication; as such, an HR specialist must recruit capable people and build an atmosphere of trust and cooperation among them. In addition, the employees must be motivated — in this regard, it would be necessary to maintain high job satisfaction rates through friendliness, fairness, and adequate pay for their work.These tasks are accomplished on multiple levels within the typical HR Department.
For instance, the U.S. Bureau of Labor and Statistics offers two variants of the HR Department job positions: Human Resources specialist and Human Resources manager. The HR specialist screens candidates conduct interviews and introduce new employees to their professional roles ( U.S. Bureau of Labor and Statistics , “Human Resources Specialists”). The HR manager operates on a strategic level by planning, coordinating, and directing recruitment efforts for the whole organization ( U.S. Bureau of Labor and Statistics , “Human Resources Managers”). Consequently, the HR manager is usually required to have several years of experience in a related occupation and receives considerably higher pay. Given these facts, I would prefer the position of an HR manager since it offers better pay and implies significant influence over matters critical for
the company’s future. However, a realistic assumption tells me that one has to work for at least several years as an HR specialist to acquire the skills and competencies necessary for an HR manager.Regarding Ford, Human Resource Management (HRM) can be used to enhance the competitive advantage associated with diversity and inclusion. Most importantly, diversity will bring no good if the objectives and goals are not set. Therefore, Ford should provide all employees with an explanation of the benefits that diversity brings to them and the company. Furthermore, it would be useful to eliminate any remaining non-merit-based status differences between the demographic groups in the organization as possible (Guillaume et al.). According to the One Ford truth of Ford’s corporate culture, all company employees should rely on, respect,
employees, which is essential for talent retention. Lastly, Ford can extend support to currently unemployed specialists to incentivize their re-entry into the workforce. This move will let the company show that age or gap in employment is not a world-ending obstacle. As a result, Ford will be able to obtain the valuable professional knowledge of new employees and stay true to the declared principles of diversity and inclusion.
Gabriel Chodorow-Reich and John Coglianese’s article, “Projecting unemployment durations: A factor-flows simulation approach with application to the COVID-19 recession,” was published in the Journal of Public Economics on March 5, 2021. Publisher Elsevier has partnered with the Copyright Center RightsLink service to offer a variety of options for reusing this content. This article is part of a special series on the state of the public economy during COVID-19.In their work, the authors propose a new method for predicting unemployment, which is carried out in three stages. Since the paper is part of a series, the Chodorow-Reich and Coglianese article complements other research in the field that analyzes changes in the labor market during the COVID-19 recession. The peculiarity of the article is that the study is aimed at
trend of remote work.I like the Chodorow-Reich and Coglianese study because the authors propose a new three-stage factor flow modeling approach to predict the duration distribution of unemployment. The article presents numerous graphs explaining the operation and features of their model. For example, the heterogeneity of re-employment after dismissal dramatically affects the unemployment rate. Chodorow-Reich and Coglianese analyze other studies on the topic and put forward their predictive model.
Four Seasons Riyadh hotel competitorsFour Seasons hotel is a five star hotel that fosters prominent competition within Saudi Arabia’s hospitality industry. The main reason for optimal overlap against competitors lies in the ability of establishing major outliers concerning service delivery system. According to researchers, it is the responsibility of indicating major outliers that enhance the development of advantages within the key framework (Wan & Rob, 2017). The lack of institutionalized mainframes regarding the structural enterprise risks client dissatisfaction.Four Seasons Riyadh hotel business descriptionFour Seasons hotel is a hospitality industry sector that offers dynamic services to enhance client satisfaction. The diversification of certain features boosts the value of purchase and render the prominent essence of brand positioning (Wan & Rob, 2017). The establishment of competitive advantages fostered the intensification
in acquiring significant market share. The main economic issues within the mainframe enshrine pricing, social spectrum, style, performance index, fuel optimization, brand, space, and safety that influence patronage. Primarily, the concept of buyers’ intention is a framework encompassing an interplay of distinct entities to steer satisfaction.Four Seasons Riyadh establishment fosters significant competence based on the optimal options for leisure activities within the region. The illustrations of distinct variations of services enhances customer satisfaction and worthiness of the purchasing price (Lu & Saloomeh, 2019). The diversification of entities plays a vital role in determination of competitive advantages against other hotels. It is crucial to indicate the managerial strategies that enhance performance in the company’s operations. The intensification in business activities is an issue that involves the intersection of market
segments and dynamic competitive advantages. It is the responsibility of managerial team to assess the customers’ needs as a baseline of understanding key product features. Globalization steered by technological advancement rendered the increase in professionalism and strategic management aspect. Saudi Arabia is one of the Asian countries with a remarkably economic growth percentage due to the oil-based enterprise improving the flow of monetary resources.Four Seasons Riyadh hotel financial performanceThe financial performance of Four Seasons Riyadh attributes to the proficiency in the competition within marketplace. Different factors foster significant capacity in management of factors of production. According to research, the company records at least $4.23 million and employs seventy workers (Dun & Bradstreet, 2021). The optimal productivity relies on essence of incorporating strategic management initiatives (Dun & Bradstreet, 2021).
The core advantage withing the enterprise enshrines diversification of service and product features. The lack of key indicators enhancing firm’s position in the bazaar risks profound trickle-down effect for distinct variables.Four Seasons Riyadh SWOT analysisSWOT analysis of a company fosters the comprehension concerning the performance outlier within the marketplace. Therefore, it is crucial to assess the distinct entities elevating product and service performance. An excellent example of a framework that intensifies the profound interdependence on Four Seasons Riyadh competence lies in understanding consumer needs (Dun & Bradstreet, 2021). Saudi Arabia clientele focuses on attainment of optimal service experience relative to the purchasing price. As a result, it is crucial to incorporate dynamic strategic management conceptual frameworks.Four Seasons Riyadh SWOT analysis (Strengths)Four Seasons is an international brand that poses
significant impact across the marketplace due to proficiency in determining standards of operations. The competence of an organization depends on the effective monitoring and control of dynamic business operations. The dynamic business operations that enhance competitive advantage engulf planning, analysis, implementation, and control. On the one hand, the structural approach in brand positioning gears the development of competitive advantages at the organization. On the other hand, using an unstructured aspect involves the lack of definitive business goals and objectives. Over the decades, globalization fostered the intensification of business competition. Therefore, a lack of concise enterprise objectives limits a company’s efficiency incompetent service delivery (Khalid et al., 2020). In this case, the disparate approach poses a challenge in boosting the firm’s competence than a structured approach in trademarking.Four Seasons
the proficiencies geared by the initiative involves both internal and external administration of the operations. The intrinsically based governing operations encompass stimulators and inspirational acts, verification tools for the planned activities, and promoting efficient employee relations. The extrinsic-based operations enshrine the strategic placement of the identity architecture, an indicator of the business’s growth objectives, and its communication strategy (Nguyen, 2019). Brand positioning is a pillar to the development of strategic management of a corporate due to the integration of internal and external directorial tools.Four Seasons Riyadh SWOT analysis (Strengths: effective service)
Gender identity and stereotyping begin the moment a child is born. The first question asked by relatives and friends is, “Is it a “boy” or a “girl”? Society has already formed a classification based on the two genders. The two genders have identifiable features, mainly contributing to gender identification and stereotype. They include body shape, hairstyles, walking styles, clothing types, voice, etcetera. These can be said to be some of the main identification attributes that society forms to identify the two genders. We can define gender identity as “the ability for one to label their sex accurately” (Bergin & Bergin, 2019). Various complex concepts play an integral part in the gender identity in children.One of the concepts is the distinctive qualities and features that define us in our
gender and how comfortable we feel. The other is how we define ourselves and are proud to identify with our gender. The conformity and content in our gender is also a critical concept. These concepts play a critical role in how people live their lives from childhood to their adult life. Starting at infancy and in toddlers, in my opinion, it is arguably to state that infants can create categories, and one of them is gender. At a very early age, they can distinguish between males and females using some of the features earlier discussed. They progress to differentiating between a boy and a girl as they start to label people like girls and boys as early as two years of age. It is also critical to note
that their gender labelling ability is mainly influenced by appearances (Bergin & Bergin, 2019). Therefore, if one gender disguises as the other, they may not tell the difference in this early stage of development.They also become curious about distinctive features that differentiate girls from boys early. Gender stereotyping kicks in when they can tell the difference between the toys that are supposed to be for girls and boys. Parents also play a critical role in children’s gender typing; for example, a father may involve his young son in physical activities while the mother may encourage her daughter to play with dolls (Halim, Walsh, Tamis-LeMonda, Zosuls, & Ruble, 2018). Gender nonconformity may tend to show in some children as they grow. In middle childhood, one can argue that gender
In the Heat of the NightThe idea behind Supertom can be described as a trope used to make a black character heroic. The result is a peculiar image of a magical black, who is a minor or even almost background character, whose mission is to help the protagonist guide him. To show the audience that ethnic minority characters are not bad people, Supertom takes a step forward to help others. They usually enter into the life of a much more privileged and, in particular, almost always white, the central character, and in some way enrich the life of this main character. Some examples of Supertom include Lucius Fox from Christopher Nolan’s The Dark Knight, Michael Clarke Duncan in The Green Mile , Bagger Vance in The Legend of
Bagger Vance, and Uncle Remus from Song of the South.Thus, a black character is endowed with high achievements and extraordinary positive characteristics, and Supertom is obtained. Mr. Tibbs is Supertom as he “is smarter than all the white people, the best homicide detective in Philadelphia, brave enough to face down a lynch mob,” and exhibits “a somewhat unexpected knowledge of varieties of plant life.” (Vera, 156) He is a kind of racial Sherlock Holmes.In other words, the relationship in the movie suggests the kind of friendship between blacks and whites that Americans like to think of as accurate, but that is not true in the context of the time frame in which In the Heat of the Night takes place. In the film, at no point or scene
does Gillespie seem to reach the point of accepting Mr. Tibbs. At best, at the end of the film, there is a sense of indifference. Nothing in the film feels like a buddy moment, more like constant violence and almost kidnapping. The scene in Gillespie’s living room was the closest thing to friendliness. Thus, discussing this film in relation to buddy films proves to be a difficult task.Do the Right ThingIn February 2020, two white men killed Ahmaud Arbery for allegedly robbing someone. In March, two police officers broke into the apartment of Breonna Taylor, who died from their gunshots, during an anti-drug raid. Then comes the culmination – Floyd’s death in May. Therefore, despite the age of creation, Do the Right Thing does not lose its relevance.The
Gender Differences in Climate ChangeThe paper discussed in this precis is “Gendering Climate Change: Geographical Insights” by Farhana Sultana. It was published in the 2014 issue of The Professional Geographer after its initial submission in 2011. In the given article, the author discusses the implications of climate change on gender and social relations and encourages scholars and activists to think critically and engage in debates on a global scale.The leading argument of this publication is related to gender differences in the effects of climate change and adaptation policies. Sultana (2014) argues that “the majority of the policy discourses and debates as well as academic writing on climate change have been largely ungendered, yet the impacts of climate change are acutely felt along gender lines and adaptation to climate
change is a gendered process” (p. 373). It means that policymakers and climate change scholars currently disregard the fact that climate change affects men and women differently. Yet, for adaptation policies to be truly effective and comprehensive, they should consider the gender-specific challenges experienced by women.Throughout the paper, the author provides numerous arguments to support her point. Firstly, she mentions the disproportionate effect climate change would have on different genders, increasing the existing divide (Sultana, 2014). Since gender relations are already made more difficult by other social factors, such as race and religion, the addition of climate change might bring irrevocable problems. Further, Sultana (2014) argues that women, particularly in South Asia, are more significantly affected by climate change because the patriarchal system limits their power and access
to resources and knowledge. Finally, the author writes that current policies lack a gendered perspective because women do not participate in policymaking initiatives, which makes their voices unheard.Personal ReflectionAt present, gender equality is far from being achieved, and the article provides numerous examples of how gender inequalities are manifested in climate change. From this article, I learned that gender is one of the multiple social dimensions, along with class, religion, and race, which affect individuals’ experiences. For example, because of the prevalence of patriarchy in South Asia, one’s gender defines many aspects of one’s life. It determines whether a person has access to education, jobs, and community resources. Moreover, in some countries, gender seems to determine the person’s worth. Sultana (2014) writes that, during disasters, some parents prefer
also be applied to circumstances other than climate change. For instance, this perspective can be used in disability justice policies. Men and women can be affected by disability differently. Being disabled can be more difficult for women because of their generally accepted role of a caregiver and often experienced discrimination in employment and other areas. Overall, taking gender differences into account is important in order to ensure that no population group appears to be more disadvantaged than others.
Generalization of the results identifies the most significant features for a group of objects or phenomena that determine their most critical qualitative characteristics. In experimental practice, generalization usually concerns four main points of the research process (Žukauskas et al., 2018): the situation, the answers, the personality of the subject, and the dependencies between these components. Generalization of the problem involves transferring the results to a broader range of circumstances. Generalizing responses means summarizing various reactions under one common category that unites them (Žukauskas et al., 2018). It is necessary to prove that the differences in the form of specific answers are insignificant, are private, and do not affect the final result and the relationship between cause and effect.Generalization at the level of personalities is the recognition of the
of communication also becomes an explanatory factor concerning particular types of behavior.Research is a type of cognitive activity of a person, a system of logically consistent methodological, methodological organizational and technical procedures that allow obtaining reliable data about the object, phenomenon, or process being studied. Scientific research is the process of acquiring new scientific knowledge, the content of which is the processes of study, experiment, conceptualization, and verification of theoretical ideas (Žukauskas et al., 2018). There are two levels of scientific expertise: empirical and theoretical, and the corresponding methods – empirical and theoretical research.
Every individual in a family has a diverse character depending on the generation they find themselves hailing from; as a result, such personnel is fueled towards achieving different ambitions and desires. In this context, characters have portrayed disproportionate aspirations. For instance, in Lorraine Hansberry’s play Raisin in the Sun , the concept is shown via the manifestation of generational parity and its influence on the Youngers family’s characters. Furthermore, in a society or family aspect, people often have unique personalities based on the generation from which they come or are raised; consequently, the particular person is motivated to accomplish a variety of goals and aspirations.Selflessness is a virtue that is critical towards ensuring the bond within a family is maintained, while greed has separated many families. As demonstrated
in the play Raisin in the Sun , Mama worries about the entire family’s future. Therefore, she asserts that she will purchase a better house for the family away from the slums upon receiving the insurance payout. Moreover, Mama feels like men today; Walter, an example, is lazy and does not want to toil to earn wealth; instead, they want it easy; she further aspires for Walter to work hard as other men she saw in the past generation.I come from five generations of people who were slaves and sharecroppers – but ain’t nobody in my family never let nobody pay ’em no money that was a way of telling us we wasn’t fit to walk the earth (p. 89).Evidently, the above quote illustrates that African American forefathers
were independent in the past and did not accept gifts they did not rightfully earn. Mama appeals to Walter not to take Mr. Lindner’s money, a notion which Walter is pondering. She argues that hardly any of her forefathers acknowledged payoffs intended to suggest that they were unfit to exist on the earth a few centuries ago. Mama again emphasizes to Walter that he hails from a proud legacy of consciousness and identity despite the world’s attempts to diminish him as an individual due to his poverty.Today, most men dream of being rich and successful by engaging in business activities. As seen from the play Raisin in the Sun, Walters’s idea, like most men of his age, dreams of being successful business owners, and thence he wants the
compensation money to start a liquor store. He has demonstrated that he desires to become extremely wealthy by running a liquor store and using it to support his family. He asserts that money is the foundation of a family; life would face extinction without it. Walter is a depiction of the recurring power of money’s influence in today’s society. He is also an example of young African Americans viewed in the play as lesser and worthless throughout the historical past. Since ancient times, their sole interest in society has been liberty upon its fulfillment, their desires shift towards success.Education has influenced individuals to acquire desirable characters as some literate African America who acquired formal education were enlightened towards the current issues around the world. In the play Raisin
in the Sun, Beneatha Younger’s trait is portrayed more contrasted as compared to her other family members. Her educative background played a fundamental role in influencing her ambitions. Her ambitions are to further her education and fulfill her dreams of becoming a doctor.Walter: Who the hell told you you had to be a doctor? If you so crazy ’bout messing ’round with sick people – then go be a nurse like other women – or just get married and be quiet…Beneatha: Well – you finally got it said…It took you three years but you finally got it (p. 38).From the preceding quote, it is evident that Beneatha aspires to be a doctor, a concept which Walter belittles. He does not believe women can be doctors; he perceives them
as fit only in supportive roles. Therefore, Walter feels he is entitled to the insurance payment so that he can accomplish his dream of being a renowned businessman, whereas Beneatha, who also needs the same money to further her education, can be get married or be a nurse like other women.In today’s culture, cases of unwarranted abortion are rampant as compared to the preceding cultures. The play Raisin in the Sun has demonstrated this fact as highlighted in Ruth’s predicaments. She aspires to keep her pregnancy a secret as she is sympathetic to the family’s financial constraints and struggle. Regrettably, she plans on aborting the child as she feels the baby will be more of a liability to the family, but after contemplating, she decides to keep the
pregnancy. Ruth is an example of an unselfish woman who puts other individuals’ needs before hers. Albeit, she is further the opposite of today’s women who lacks patience and compassion, she endures the hurdles she faces in her marriage with Walter.Giving back to society has always been an aspiration for many young learners studying abroad, as evident in Lorraine Hansberry’s play Raisin in the Sun . Asagai hopes to return to Nigeria, bring his knowledge from abroad, and share it with the citizens living in his hometown to better their lives. Likewise, he has confidence in transferring the technological developments he learned in the West to Africa so as to better the continent’s living standards. He is positive about his ambition while being cognizant of the obstacles ahead.
Asagai also proposes to Beneatha as he always aspires to marry her. Asagai assures he will educate and guide the people while Beneatha study’s medicine and assist in the care of others. She seems reluctant to accept Asagai’s offer, but she will eventually accept.Racial segregation dates back to ancient times, and it has encroached on most neighborhoods to date. Segregation has impacted harmonious coexistence in society; as a result, it is few and between to see a black man living in an all-white neighborhood. As seen from the play, Karl Lindner, a white man representing Clybourne Park, has his character as a racist influenced by the fact that he is a white representative of the neighboring Clybourne Park.It is a matter of the people of Clybourne Park believing,
rightly or wrongly, as I say, that for the happiness of all concerned that our Negro families are happier when they live in their own communities (p. 553).From the above quote, Lindner aspires not to see the Youngers in an all-white neighborhood since they are blacks; hence he feels they are inferior to live within Clybourne Park. Therefore, he confronts the Youngers in their home and tries to cajole them towards moving to the neighborhood where most white people reside. However, the Youngers overlook his idea and instead move to the neighborhood despite no guarantees of being happy ever after.The racial disparity has been a menace to tackle since time immemorial. The latter has been rooted deep down the hearts of individuals; hence eradicating it has been a
hard nut to crack. In the play Raisin in the Sun, the generational difference has ensured the likes of Mrs. Johnson detest the black people. Hansberry’s play exploits the Mrs. Johnson persona in order to foreshadow and ring the bell on impending danger awaiting the Youngers. When they move, they will be the first blacks to live in the white neighborhood, Clybourne Park. Mrs. Johnson is rude and unpleasant, asking indelicate, too intrusive inquiries. At one point, she virtually declares that she is prayerful that the Youngers’ new home would be attacked. Even though her warnings are about the very serious risk to the Youngers, her tone is so insulting that she looks almost laughable.In general, Lorraine Hansberry’s Raisin in the Sun vividly depicted how generational distinctive can
Beneatha, since she is educated, dreams of being a doctor upon completion of her study, something which is difficult due to financial constraints. A racial generation has also manifested the play as it can be seen that whites did not like the blacks in their neighborhood. Lastly, Asagai aspires to return to Nigeria and transform his hometown with the new ideas he learned in school.
In the modern world, the practice of generic tourism is gaining more and more popularity. Its essence is moving to another country for the further birth of a child and acquiring citizenship in it. This right in the United States of America is given on the basis of the right of birth or jus soli on the territory of the country. Hence the concept of an “anchor child”, since he or she becomes a tool for his or her walkers to acquire a permanent place of residence. However, with the spread of this phenomenon, many problems have arisen. An example of such an issue was a case that happened in a Chinese ancestral home in Flushing, Queens. A woman from China stabbed five people. This research paper aims
to examine this case and its circumstances in order to gain knowledge about how this problem can be prevented in the future.First of all, it is necessary to understand the phenomenon of generic tourism. Foreigners resort to this action often to find a better life and in the desire to follow the American dream. In this case, children born to all persons living in the United States automatically receive American citizenship (Rodriguez 3). Another reason is the desire to provide better education to descendants, as well as health care and other services provided to society by the state (Jaramillo et al. 96). If the research considers the legislation of China, many foreigners want to circumvent the two-child policy. These reasons are the main driving forces for residents of
other countries.This study deals with a specific example of what happened in the ancestral home in Queens. It happened recently and received a lot of coverage by the American media. Henceforth, in a boarding house for Chinese “child tourists” in the city of Flushing, in September 2018, one of the workers committed a brutal crime (Moore et al. para 2). A woman stabbed three newborns and two adults before trying to commit suicide. The incident occurred in the early morning at an institution that provides assistance in caring for the children of immigrants who were born in America and were sold for thousands of dollars. A woman named Yu Fen Wang suffered a nervous breakdown and attacked an elderly colleague and a man. The injured man was the
father of one of the children who were in the house. After that, the woman attacked three babies and ran into the basement of the building to commit suicide, but she did not succeed. The reason for this strange behavior was the presence of a psychological disorder in the employee of the ancestral home. Thanks to the quick work of medical specialists, all the victims were rescued, but one of the wounded was very seriously injured.After getting to the hospital, a psychological examination was carried out on the criminal, which showed that the woman had mental health problems. The place where these traumatic events occurred is a registered state enterprise called Mei Xin Care Inc. However, employees secretly provided citizenship services for foreigners, known as birth tourism. On
the basis of a tourist visa, pregnant Chinese women came to the United States to give birth to a child in order to obtain citizenship of the country. Newborns in America have this right in accordance with the 14th Amendment and have a few weeks to get all the necessary documents. This procedure is aimed at a long-term perspective since adult children can then apply for the return of the parents and their receipt of a green card. Such manipulations of generic tourism are gaining more and more popularity due to their relative simplicity, compared with other methods of obtaining permanent residence.After conducting an audit, the US Department of Children and Families Affairs determined that the facility in Flushing is not a licensed care program. The main reason
for this was that the organization violated the law, which prohibits the provision of services for the care of newborns up to six weeks babies. Moreover, in addition to illegal activities, the organization placed false advertising on the Internet as a licensed daycare facility. At the same time, the maternity tourism institution charged the parents who resorted to their services (Laudick 281). One woman said that she laid out 4,600 dollars to stay in the institution for a month (Moore et al. para 15). This fact proves that families resorting to this practice have specific resources to purchase generic tourism as a way to settle in the United States.Therefore, after analyzing this case, it can be concluded that it is necessary to take a number of measures to
ensure the safety of children in such institutions and conduct more frequent inspections. It is worth noting that the practice of coming to the United States and other countries to obtain citizenship is not illegal. However, sources note that a tightening in the direction of the country’s immigration policy is required. Krikorian, the owner of such facility in Washington, DC, stated that “as for whether the facility itself is legal or not, it is more of a municipal or state issue and if it is illegal, it is probably not because it is a citizenship center or maternity hospital” (Moore et al. para 15). However, in the case of Flushing, this circumstance may be somewhat complicated. This is due to the fact that for a long time, the
Biracial people have many advantages that open many opportunities for the non-standard perception of the world. In this case, the reader is confronted with the story of a girl who has problems with the perception of her own identity. There are problems associated with the fact that the girl cannot detect her belonging to a particular group, which causes anxiety about the impossibility of having friends. This essay reveals various features of biracial people that allow them to feel their identity better. This is an opportunity to combine different cultural characteristics, which manifests itself in confidence and a decrease in the feeling of belonging to one particular group.Multi-racial persons can have better self-esteem than mono-racial people if they are nurtured to identify with both parents and comprehend their
diverse racial ancestry. An important feature here is that biracial people do not depend on the stereotypes that society imposes on other people. An example here is a situation where a person may face uncertainty or fear of failure since others may judge him as a stupid or uneducated person based on their race. That is why being a biracial person is less influenced by someone else’s opinion. The girl needs to realize her main feature, which allows her to adopt the qualities and characteristics of different cultures. In addition, another important characteristic that allows people to develop their own confidence better is a more excellent range of interests and hobbies (Weaver, 2020). This allows biracial people to strengthen their self-confidence since they are also independent of stereotypical
ideas. In this case, they open up many opportunities related to professions or other things that could be perceived negatively by society in a normal situation.The fact that multi-racial persons might inherit a more extensive range of characteristics is significant. Mixed-race offspring are more likely to inherit a variety of physical traits from both parents, allowing them to defy preconceptions. They can be brown-eyed blondes, fair-skinned tiny brunettes with various eye colors, or fair-skinned petite brunettes with various eye colors. There are many physical combinations for mixed-race children, especially when their parents do not look similar (Weaver, 2020). In reality, there have been reported occurrences of mixed-race twins that appear to be significantly different from one another, such as one who is fair-skinned while the other is brown-skinned.
confrontations. On the other hand, the girl must recognize that the opportunity to establish her own identity is a significant duty.Thus, summing up, it should be noted that biracial have unique characteristics that allow them to perceive the surrounding reality in a different way. This is manifested in overcoming the framework of stereotypical judgments and reducing the level of dependence on one racial group. All this also makes it possible to increase confidence and strengthen interactions with representatives of different, heterogeneous cultures. Thus, the girl from this case needs to learn to be aware of her own special identity.
The primary objective of the presentation is to explain the hardships the Israelites had to pass through after they fled from Egypt and the harsh conditions they had to make through. The presentation also pertains to the way of living of the Israelites during the Exodus. There is no undeniable archeological proof to verify the story of the Exodus. Some intellectuals date the Exodus around 1260 BC during the leadership of Ramesses II (1290-12130). Some suggest an earlier date, around 1440BC, under the reign of Thutmosis III (1490-1436). The kingdom period is between 1550-1069, according to Egyptian history. The red sea had two arms–the Gulf of Suez (nearEgypt, Suez canal today) and the Gulf of Aqaba (North-Eastern arm pointing towards the Dead Sea). Israelites left Egypt for Canaan
to the North part of the Red seaExodus is the freeing of the people of Israel from slavery in Egypt in the 13 th -century AD under the leadership of Moses. It dictates the living delivery of the Israelites by their God, Yahweh. This is the Journey that the Israelites had to take before reaching the Promised Land, Canaan. It also defines the memories of the Israel community and the hardship they experienced in Egypt. The route the Israelites were instructed to take passed through a wilderness where there was no water, no growing food, and was inhabited by hostile tribes. Water was accessed through the wells at particular points. Sometimes, they had to request water directly from their God via Moses conducting miracles; thus, in this context,
water was sacred. Agriculture is a sector that was not given so much concern during the journey as the climate could not support crops; they were provided with manna by their God.During the departure, the Israelites camped at the foot of Mount Sinai. The Bible dictates that it is on the top of this mountain that Moses met with God and was given the tablet of the Ten Commandments. On this very location, the Israelites had lost faith in God, were punished, after which they entered into a new covenant with God, and offered new guidelines to follow as they continued with the journey. According to the Book of Exodus and the Book of Kings, this mountain is regarded as the mountain of Yahweh. Mount Sinai is also
Global economic justice is a concept that presupposes equal distribution of resources between all people of the Earth, taking into account their necessities and their input into the world’s economy. An ethical issue of whether wealthy people should share their resources with the poorer population has continuously stirred people’s minds. On the one hand, it seems unfair that wages for the same work differ drastically across the continents. On the other hand, the distribution of benefits by the states does not often take into account how much a person works and are allocated on the basis of needs rather than actual merits. This paper hypothesizes that the notion that the wealthier population should help the poorer is, in essence, right, and fair. Within this paper, two moral theories
are applied to prove the validity of this position. Natural law theory and virtue ethics theory show that the notion that the wealthy should partially provide for the poorer is correct (Murdoch and Oater 561). Moreover, the arguments covered within two scientific articles are given to support the justice of such a notion.The ethical issue of helping the poor is firmly rooted in our life. Many people donate money to the disabled or those who find themselves in severe life circumstances. All people are prone to illnesses, and there is no guarantee that one will not need help sooner or later (Singer 232). Economic crises or natural disasters leave people without money and shelter or without a job and the ability to provide for one’s family. While some
people have too much money to spend, others suffer from hunger and water shortage. The concept of global economic justice presupposes distribution of recourses on account of people’s needs, allowing to avoid the situation when the most significant part of the planet’s resources is concentrated in the hands of a minority group.To evaluate the issue of global economic justice two theories will be used. Natural law theory evaluates an issue through a series of tests that assess its intent and effects. When the overall benefits are compared against general harms, it is imperative to look at which side outweighs (Singer 231). The first step of analysis within the natural law theory is to see whether an action is permissible. Since there are no laws against helping the poor,
and charity organizations enjoy exemption from taxes in many countries, the action is permissible. The next step of the analysis is to determine the positive and adverse effects of the issue. The positive effects are that the action benefits many people by reducing the level of poverty and providing access to medicine for low-income families. Moreover, the action helps combat many world diseases that abound in third-world countries due to the absence of hygiene, crowdedness, and extreme poverty. The adverse effects are not many since wealthy people here do not give away much-needed resources but share only the surplus of money they can spend on luxury goods (Murdoch and Oater 561). Adverse effects do not stem from the beneficial ones as, indeed, if not given to charity, the
funds would probably remain in a bank account for a long time. Beneficial effects by far outweigh the adverse ones since they allow millions of people to improve their living conditions, get rid of diseases, and lead an economically active life, thus returning the money into the global economy. The intention of wealthy people who share their recourses with the low-income populace is, by all means, a noble one since they give away something that belongs to them for free. The overall picture shows that all three tests are passed within natural law theory: the action is permissible, the good effects outweigh the adverse ones, and the intention can be described as positive. So, the issue that wealthier people should share with the less fortunate ones seems well-grounded.Virtue
ethics theory seeks to find a golden middle, considering whether an act tends to go to extremes or is reasonably balanced. The balanced action is considered to be correct. Another test performed within this theory is evaluating an issue in terms of its merits and vices (Singer 241). If the action is performed to excess, rich people will give all their money to the poor, which does not seem fair since wealthy people worked hard to earn it. At the other end of the scale, if people do not share their resources, millions of people would live in poverty while billions of dollars would stay in the banks, not contributing to the world’s economy. The issue is balanced as neither the first nor the second extreme can get
the upper hand over the other. The agent of the action – rich people who voluntarily share their resources – can be described as noble, so this test is passed.Many authors support the notion of global economic justice. From an economic point of view, charity is a kind of mechanism for the redistribution of resources between the owner of resources and their consumer. Under certain conditions, this mechanism is more effective than tax since it initially involves lower unit costs of bringing the resource to the end-user. Affluent populations should share food and water with poorer countries, which would benefit both sides, as helping others people get a deep moral satisfaction (Murdoch and Oater 561). Redistribution of resources from the rich to the poor improves the general welfare
of the population (Singer 241). It enhances societal awareness of the problems and the desire to work on them collectively as a community.My own personal position is based on the economic aspect. I believe the redistribution of resources helps engage part of the population that would otherwise remain economically inactive. For example, when charity organizations build schools in the countries of the third world, they provide children with primary education which later may allow them to find a job (Murdoch and Oater 562). While uneducated women mostly stay at home, not contributing to countries’ economic development, education helps turn many people into economically active who can provide for themselves and their families.Recently there has been a shift from providing resources to the poor to providing means and educating
of aid to the poor, proving that it is ethically right and economically beneficial for all. The natural law and virtue ethics theories both support the claim that the redistribution of resources from the rich to the poor is a moral and economically beneficial practice. My personal position is that helping others people is an excellent proceeding that allows people to feel needed, enhances their self-esteem and unites communities, and, globally, stimulates the growth of the world economy.
Canada was chosen as a state for international market expansion. When domestic organizations expand globally, their intention is to reach new markets and expand their product’s relevance. The other benefits of global expansion include increases in revenue streams, acquiring new customers, obtaining access to talent pools, and competitive advantage in the addressable market. As far as Canada is concerned, the evident advantage of global expansion includes a beneficial environment for trade and international partnerships, as Canada is a tariff-free zone for manufacturers regardless of the location within the state (Kreklewetz & Raphael, 2018). When it comes to the expansion’s impact on the business, the product introduction in the new markets increases the company’s recognition outside the domestic audience. The business’s integration into the global trade community may provide
the company with the advantage of finding cost-efficient suppliers and a secure customer base throughout the world, increasing the product’s resilience to local market trends and influences (Osano, 2019). Hence, the strategic planning and the supply-chain management of the company gain more security due to the variety of supplier options and market entry possibilities.The societal impact of businesses’ global expansion cannot be overlooked. The existing environment is designed to encourage small and medium domestic enterprises to create internationalized products that can be easily tailored according to the target customer’s needs. In the case of baseball bats, the product itself is highly dependent on the target culture, as baseball is a product with less relevance in the European and Asian markets. For this reason, the choice in favor of
and infrastructure. For example, the Asian market segment has evolved significantly in terms of supply chain and transportation over the past years in order to secure international cooperation with western countries.The target culture of global expansion is another significant aspect to consider. In order for the product to be successful, it is of paramount importance to study the customers’ values, purchase behavior, and relevant marketing strategies. In the case of the US domestic business expanding to Canada, the customer portfolio, along with the customer needs, is relatively easy to identify. Hence, it can be concluded that expansion abroad is a promising strategic move for the company to avoid further sales flattening.
The number of factors that influence oil prices is always large. And now, there are so many of them that an ordinary investor does not understand at all which news to follow and which to ignore. Is it worth worrying about changes in US crude oil inventories, or should one primarily monitor the decline in supplies from Iran? Sometimes it is not easy to answer such questions – much depends on the specific market moment. For the purpose of this assignment: the historical change in the price per barrel of Brent was selected from 2010 to 2021. It is assumed that this time is the most interesting for understanding the influence of modern political and economic trends on price fluctuations.Source: International Monetary Fund. (2021).Based on the resulting graph,
you can see several critical fluctuations. First, the price per barrel of Brent rose rapidly throughout 2010. In March-December 2010, oil prices stabilized after the global crisis at $ 70-80 per barrel; growth resumed at the very end of 2010. The subsequent fluctuation was in 2014 and represented a sharp collapse in the price of Brent – the oil brand lost 51% in value from January to December. It is also important to note the drop in price registered from January to May 2020.The fluctuation that happened in 2014 seems to be interesting to investigate in detail due to its amplitude and causes. Analysts attribute the decline in prices to an oversupply of oil on the world market due to several factors. Thus, the United States and Canada
have increased their production, which was facilitated by the emergence of hydraulic fracturing technology, making it possible to reach deposits in shale formations that were previously inaccessible for drilling (Prest, 2018). The volume of production in the United States has surpassed nine million barrels per day. This is the highest rate in more than 30 years (Prest, 2018). At the same time, there has been a slowdown in economic growth in China, which has the highest energy consumption in the world. The Japanese economy has fallen into depression, and the eurozone is on its doorstep (Prest, 2018). In the United States, the emergence of cheaper oil has led to a decrease in gasoline prices to their lowest level in several years, which in turn contributed to the acceleration
The COVID-19 pandemic and Donald Trump’s presidency are critical factors that affected supply chains at a global level, creating new challenges for logistic networks worldwide. Globalization enables businesses to operate on an international scale, reaching new markets and customers and expanding sourcing opportunities. At the same time, global supply chains are characterized by increased complexity and competition and are associated with greater logistic networks risks.The Trump PresidencyIn particular, the Trump administration resulted in such challenges for global supply chains as increased tariffs and costs for both businesses and consumers. As tariffs were imposed on numerous trading partners of the United States, including China, Canada, Mexico, and the European Union, many exporting industries faced increased costs and partners’ retaliation. Furthermore, according to Seddiq et al. (2022), “Trump sought to
As reported by Wayland (2021), “automakers across the globe are expected to lose billions of dollars in earnings this year due to a shortage of semiconductor chips” that hinders production (para. 1). Furthermore, border closures aggravate the situation by disrupting supply chains, increasing delays, and reducing the capacity of air cargo. Overall, recent events have revealed the vulnerabilities in global supply chains that need to be addressed in a strategic and timely manner.
In the globalization era where many different countries closely cooperate in achieving manufacturing goals to satisfy the needs of their internal markets, the country’s economic efficiency is determined by its readiness for international cooperation. The transportation environment and global policies substantially contribute to the country’s successful participation in globalized trade. This essay will compare and contrast differences in the European and North American freight transportation systems, globalized trade, and global policy implications.First, the practical organization of the transportation system within a country favors its economic growth by creating favorable trade conditions in domestic and foreign markets. According to Wiegmans et al. (2018), The freight transportation system in Europe is presented by dense road and rails infrastructure, accompanied by inland waterways. The authors’ study estimated that the most developed
transporting infrastructure in Europe is the roads system which accounts for 75% of the freight operations. On the other hand, the distribution of population in the North America required an extensive transportation system. According to Wiegmans et al. (2018), the United States’ transportations system favors the use of trucks and railways. The road infrastructure accounts for nearly 45% of the freight operations, and railways are used for 30% of the freights in the United States (Wiegmans et al., 2018). Comparing the area of both regions and the population’s distribution patterns explains the differences in the transportations systems of the two regions. Therefore, the differences in geography contribute to the choice of the transportation systems and determine the speed of the local and global trade operations.Next, comparing the level
of the economic integration of North America and Europe in economic globalization will help identify the differences in European and North American trade structures. According to information provided by the Bureau of Economic Analysis (2021), the United States’ overall level of participation in economic globalization is presented by an increased share of imports ($1,434.8 billion in 2020). On the other hand, the level of European integration in the globalized trade is inconsistent with some years noted by the prevalence of import share. However, in general, Europe’s role in the intranational trade is being the exporter of goods and services, while the North American region is playing the role of the importer.Lastly, one of the factors that influence the development of globalized trade is legal spere and policies. According
The modern world is currently facing a significant change under globalization trends that shape economies, politics, the workplace, education, and even everyday behavior. Most importantly, due to the active exchange of information between people worldwide, culture is changing. Researchers try to understand whether the culture will be further homogenized in globalization or diversified. This paper will argue that culture will become more diverse under the influence of globalization due to the introduction of multiple cultural elements into societies.The latest processes in cultural change demonstrate that both sides of the argument, namely those supporting diversification and the ones claiming homogeneity, have reasonable grounds. On the one hand, Cowen (2010) states that in a globalized society where a dominant culture prevails, diversity will be substituted with the culture that is
demonstrates that people adopt new cultural phenomena with acknowledgment of their origin. According to Bestor (2010), “Japan remains the world’s primary market for fresh tuna for sushi and sashimi” (p. 110). Thus, having integrated its product into the cultures of other countries, Japan has expanded its market share.In such a manner, with the ease of transportation and communication enabled by globalization, there is a merge of cultures around the world. However, since market forces commonly rule these processes, the host cultures are aware of the origins of the borrowed cultural clusters. Therefore, to summarize the discussion, one might state that culture will not be homogenized in globalization but rather diversified with credit given to each cultural component.
The “Good Samaritan” law in Louisiana was enacted to protect a passerby rendering aid to a stranger from incurring liability and criminal charges in case of a bad outcome. No individual gratuitously providing first aid or rescue in good faith to an injured person, including transfer to a location with medical services, is liable for civil damages (Dudley DeBosier, 2021). Furthermore, this law extends to physicians gratuitously acting outside of medical facilities, even if they are not licensed in the state of Louisiana (Dudley DeBosier, 2021). A passerby can be sued for additional injuries or damages only if their actions can be proven to have been grossly negligent. The Louisiana “Good Samaritan” law encourages citizens to help each other if the police and emergency service are unavailable or
or any additional injuries because he was acting as a passerby. However, the same protection does not apply to Sally, the nurse attending Bill. She is a registered professional providing service inside a medical facility and will be held to the standard of her nursing license and employment contract. Sally is legally responsible for assessing and advocating for Bill, recording his medical history, and administering treatment. The “Good Samaritan” law only covers help given gratuitously by a passerby, not professional business relationships such as between a nurse and a patient.
The three main benefits offered by Grammarly and Turnitin used for text editing purposes are significant amounts of time saved on proofreading, simplified writing process through recommendations and help in maintaining tone through the paper. Moreover, as a form of text editing tool, Turnitin and Grammarly utilize elaborated AI and machine learning processes that offer more text editing opportunities. For example, once the app detects that the text features listing elements, it will automatically provide the user with an option to make a list of these items for more comfortable reading. According to Wang (2020), AI presents a vital part in Turnitin, and its work within the app focuses on improving the quality of students’ writing.On the other hand, mistakes can always occur with text editing applications, as
use of tone suitable for conversation purposes. When the user confuses different words for formal and informal tones, the app will correct the text and help choose the right sentence structure. Moreover, the use of such applications could become essential for non-native English speakers and their career progression. Many companies are now starting to implement remote job principles in their work, which means more room for misunderstandings in communication. Using applications like Grammarly and Turnitin for academic or business teamwork will help to maintain productive collaboration through effective communication that leaves no misunderstandings.
Knowledge and theories produced by the representatives of different ethnicities in American society play a crucial role in learning the country’s history and current interpersonal relationships. Many critical events, personal stories, and intellectual traditions unite people across the United States. However, despite the intention to live in an equal and fair society, certain social struggles of ethnic groups cannot be ignored. Today, Americans continue living in a world where racial inequality determines the quality of life, and group affirmation turns out to be one of the possible solutions for minorities. City of Ghosts and other class readings create a solid background for identifying and understanding the uniqueness of community stories and realizing that ethnic differences still matter. It is hard for some people to live around reasoned and
irrational biases and neglect their interests, beliefs, and attitudes toward social obligations. Sometimes, it is extremely important to consider cultural roots and respect differences. In some cases, people should learn to diminish the power of their emotions and cultures and assimilate with dignity to avoid unnecessary conflicts, following the rules of self-affirmation and historical trauma theories. The history of American society is long and complex, including the struggles of Latinx and Mexican communities against discrimination, unequal interpersonal relationships and educational restrictions, and the ways how to share feelings and intentions.Common struggles and movements to support equal interpersonal relationships and reduce discrimination impact are probably the most significant events in the lives of ethnic minorities who live in the United States. People believe that their society offers equal conditions
for developing work and life affairs and decision-making. However, the differences between black and white Americans exist and affect their choices in terms of interracial friendships. Ingraham indicates that about 75% of whites have only white social networks, with no minorities present. The quality of such relationships may be understood through the historical trauma theory when populations experience slavery outcomes and cannot eliminate certain associations and prejudices. Many individuals immigrate to the United States admiring the dream of having a better life, employment, and a safe future. They cannot realize that borders between countries are not just barbed-wire fences with multiple political and legal rules but the line that divides people physically and spiritually (Náñez). Discrimination is both abstract social and concrete brick-and-mortar walls that people create to
keep everything in order. In the third episode of City of Ghosts , the old lady shared her memories of no fences in the park, and everybody contributed to the community’s heartbeat. Mexican and Latinx communities have to live in a world full of such walls and fences that divide people from being themselves.Another serious lived experience that challenges many American Latinx, Mexicans, and other ethnic groups includes education restrictions that promote group affirmation. In addition to routine relationships and communication, ethnic groups prove their right to equal education and skill development. Colton is one of the characters in the second episode of City of Ghosts who represents a common image of a white boy in American society: parental support, high expectations, and multiple opportunities. Not all children
from minority communities have the same chances. In Arizona, the decision to ban Mexican-American studies is discussed to improve state tests and remove controversies about ethnic studies (Planas). This course is associated with multiple benefits for young people to better understand their society. Students should know how to reflect on their cultural experiences, diversity, and history. It is wrong to believe that education in the United States would automatically give some priority in the country or abroad (Carcamo). Education is just another criterion according to which ethnic groups are divided, and the self-affirmation theory explains the essence of this challenge. People are motivated to maintain their integrity and predict outcomes. Self-affirmation shows if there are any threats to the self-using reflection and acknowledgment of personal responsibilities. Almost the
same happens in the case of group affirmation for education – people unite their efforts to prove their rights in American society.Finally, social struggles experienced by Latinx, Mexican, and other communities are related to the personalities and the ability to cope with feelings and emotions. Ethnic minorities continue facing social injustices, biases, and controversies regularly. Although the governments make policies and create laws where all citizens are equal regardless of their age, gender, or skin color, it is impossible to control people at the individual level. Thus, many recommendations are given to support people, motivate them properly, and demonstrate that some decisions and relationships depend not on the history of inequality but on personal achievements. In the first episode of City of Ghosts, one of the characters, Mariko,
offers her friend to feel the energy of the environment because most buildings and land have a history that inspires. It is not the question of believing or accepting something that does not exist. This kind of support is obligatory for all ethnic groups who should find the strength to struggle and survive in an unknown place. Homesickness, pleasant memories and expectations for a better future fulfill many immigrants in the United States (Wessler). The stories of Native Americans, Mexicans, and Latinx prove that there is always some invisible power that stimulates and make it possible not to notice social inequalities and existing biases. Diversity is inevitable in the modern world, and it is an individual decision based on emotions and actual intentions to either enjoy differences or
The Caribbean history includes the ruthless colonization by Western countries like Spain. Upon colonization, the area was home to native groups such as the Ciboney or Guanahuatebey, Taino Arawak, and Carib. The colonizers brought a bunch of enslaved Africans who would work in their homes and plantations. The Whites were the minority and foreigners in the Caribbean but brutally seized and ruled against the Blacks majority. However, the Blacks maintained their identity and self-expression through various cultural activities evident to date.The Caribbean is the home for many musical genres expressing human freedom and revolution. Reggae is associated with the Caribbean people, and it is the unofficial soundtrack of many Caribbean vacations. Reggae musicians such as Bob Marley and the Wailers produced revolutionary and redemptions songs protesting against the
and identified themselves through music and distinct African heritage. Reggae songs helped the Blacks protest against the pitiless white rule, and events such as the parades and carnivals commemorated slavery. Furthermore, African cuisines such as Callaloo identified Africanism in the Caribbean. Despite the brutal rule by the White minority, the Blacks in the Caribbean expressed and identified themselves through songs and events that are evident to date.
The source of information for this blog post was Google Arts and Cultures’ explore page. An original search led to the discovery of the subject, and some of the keywords used were “modern art” and “modern European paintings.” The most important element of the explored exhibition is a representation of modern European art from Croatia by Gruž Harbour. In particular, there is a painting depicting a harbor and two people, a man, and a woman, displayed in Picture 1. This painting was created in 1965 in Croatia, which is consistent with the modernist art movement. This movement originates in the early decades of the 20th century, reflecting the new culture created by artists globally (Tate, n.d.).I decided to explore modern art and this work in particular because this
movement is the reflection of the artists’ views of modern times; hence this art is easier to understand for people of my age. This topic is important for the understanding of the arts and cultures in the global environment because, in many cases, regional arts, synch as the one from small European states, for example, Croatia, is not studied by students. Still, it reflects some of the tendencies and trends of the years and allows one to see the diversity of modern art. The original search led to this topic as I was exploring modern art from different states and found it interesting to look at paintings of lesser-known artists.My blog relates to the intercultural thinking and creativity issues because it explores the art that the majority of
all over the world; for example, the painting in Picture 1 is from the Croatian museum of modern art. Hence, Google Art and Culture influences understanding about art by allowing us to see the varied examples of artworks. I was feeling excited and overwhelmed when I explored Google Arts and Cultures because many of the paintings and artworks I had never heard of or seen before. My subject search integrates the knowledge of the interconnections between culture, art, politics, the economy, and the social environment because it reflects the pattern of the artists’ thinking and the issues that the society was concerned with at that time. Picture 1 represents the social relationships and Croatia’s economy that is linked to the sea and ships.Picture 1. Gruž Harbour, 1965
The challenges which Hamlet faces during his story seem truly harsh and brutal to endure without them affecting at least slightly his mental condition and developing obsessional grief. Therefore, it is unmistakable that the main character may experience difficulties withstanding all the issues during his life. By and whole, it appears that Hamlet’s complicated relationships with his relatives, along with their actions, are the reasons for him becoming uncertain about him continuing to live his life.To begin with, it is evident to the reader that the main character is overwhelmed by the grief and mourning of his father. As a matter of fact, his father was killed by his uncle, Claudius, who then became his step-father (Shakespeare, 2016). Undoubtedly, such a situation is likely to negatively impact anyone’s
health, considering that the deaths of loved ones seem challenging to withstand at any time. Indeed, Hamlet is no exception as he experiences a vicious cycle of mania replacing depression, which affects his moods, leading to him obsessing over his father’s death and seeking his revenge.Furthermore, Hamlet experiences difficulties in explaining his grief to his mother, Gertrude. It seems that the fact that they do not share the same opinion about his father’s death complicates Hamlet’s grief even more. Therefore, the character recognizes this loss as something more profound in his soul that never lets him just be. That is why when Hamlet meets his father’s ghost, he experiences a feeling of importance, meaning that he has to do something to not only make himself feel better but
to avenge his dear parent. To be more exact, he starts planning his vengeance thoroughly, but it appears that after the “For Hecuba” part, he loses his rush and becomes more cautious about his aim (Shakespeare, 2016, p. 25). Overall, his focus on vengeance shifts to inaction, which is slowly killing him from inside and making him feel guilty, but his evident depression and grief take the best of him, so he continues doing nothing.In fact, Hamlet also faces numerous difficulties in his relationship with Ophelia, his love interest, which only develops his obsession and uncertainty. Hamlet’s attempts to avenge his father definitely border on him losing his sanity, so Ophelia becomes especially worried about his mental state. Moreover, it seems that it is actually Hamlet’s goal to
prove to everyone that he is genuinely insane and is losing his mind so that he can continue working on his plan of vendetta without any interference from others.Even though his aforementioned mental issues indeed cloud his judgments, including his goal of striking his uncle for Claudius to pay for Hamlet’s father’s death, the main character still believes in his deep connection and love to Ophelia (Shakespeare, 2016). Nevertheless, his manic episodes become even more intense when he experiences one more death of his dear Ophelia. As a matter of fact, it seems that this loss has even more impact on his condition as Hamlet desires to be buried with her just so that no one can separate them ever (Shakespeare, 2016). Hamlet shows the character’s suicidal inclinations
Mission StatementThe organization is dedicated to supporting families and children who are deaf or exhibiting hearing problems.

In achieving its mission, the organization is partnering with the right people, including parents and consumers who are deaf, thus giving a basis for handling the vulnerable in the community.Summary of ServicesHand and Voice is one of the organizations in the world whose
Health Information Technology (HIT) is a crucial tool in improving nursing quality and security. The proliferation of IT in the healthcare sector increases the population’s overall health through quick and timely medical treatment. Doctors employ HIT to gather data that help to evaluate the effectiveness of curative mediation required in a medical routine. Experts need to optimize training and align with medical trends to ensure patient protection and safety.In facilities where HIT has not been introduced, disruptions may occur in the work of the medical staff and in determining the treatment of patients. The establishments need to use the appropriate resources to procure high-standard tools which offer quality medical assistance (Kruse & Beane, 2018). In addition, organizations should employ an experienced workforce to maximize service delivery and diminish
systems. Securing people’s privacy and confidentiality is essential in promoting public confidence in wellness services such as laboratory and diagnostic care to reduce stigma or discrimination. The execution of HIT tools at institutions is likely to grow because their targeted outcomes are more promising in securing privacy.Various HIT trends implemented in pharmaceutical systems improve patient safety by helping them understand the importance of healthcare procedures. Artificial intelligence and voice search are new trends useful in recognizing patients’ needs. The HIT deviations can decrease the doctors’ efforts in the patient treatment and boost service commitment for the clients. Medical faults in organizations can decline through the demand for improved HIT modes in healthcare to maintain good health for the people.
Health administration is challenging and requires excellent memory, high concentration, and stamina. Thanks to the development of information technology, a significant part of the administrator’s work can be transferred to spreadsheets (for example, Excel) or other programs. Computers and sophisticated technology can now be found in any hospital, and using them is one of the critical skills of an administrator. Excel does a great job with concepts such as probability and measures of central tendency, and it helps medical staff to have straightforward access to extensive databases. It is also easy for administrators to manage hospitals or departments within Lean and Six Sigma using information technology.Probability in work can be calculated using a unique formula given in the table. This function is called PROB, and it divides the
number of favorable events by the total number of possible events. These calculations are quick and easy; the specialist can vary the events and numbers. For example, people can calculate the probability of emergencies per shift in this way. Based on the results obtained, it can be concluded how many specialists should be ready and what equipment should always be available. Sometimes people can use the OR and AND tools to calculate the probability.In addition to probability, Excel allows people to calculate measures of the central tendency. Kros and Rosenthal (2016) postulate: “Time spent by physicians with patients what is called the central tendency of the data. There are three commonly employed measures of central tendency: the mean, the median, and the mode” (p. 184). These complex calculations
are also based on processing a large number of data and estimating the arithmetic mean. The Lean and Six Sigma management concept allows people to minimize errors during production or operation. A recognized concept postulates that a business should always strive for success and increase its requirements. For managers, the predictability of future results should be necessary. People can predict them using Excel and formulas, thereby analyzing a large amount of data.Despite the abundance of computers and sophisticated technologies in hospitals, doctors’ role remains crucial in terms of morality. Doctors can still be spiritual guides for people: they can see their vices, illnesses, sufferings. According to what they know, they choose the appropriate treatment. It is essential not to forget the biblical truth: “On hearing this, Jesus said,
complex central tendency measures, which helps to organize large layers of information. The Lean and Six Sigma management concept is based on constant development and striving for new successes. It is essential for administrators in this concept to predict further actions, possible risks, and successes. In addition, they need to see the mistakes made and quickly correct them. In the future, the studied material will help solve critical administrative tasks: the purchase of medicines in the right quantities, equipment, training of doctors and nurses.
The United States’ healthcare system is regulated on federal and private levels, and policy-making processes are distributed to multiple state and local administrations. Consequently, the regulations can be complicated, slow to establish, lobbied in political or business interests, and be duplicated on different governmental levels. (Bodenheimer & Grumbach, 2020). The fragmentation caused by the states’ ability to pass their policies is beneficial when a local problem requires an urgent legislative solution; however, it is a massive obstacle to developing a strong public health infrastructure. After the Affordable Care Act (ACA) passage in 2010, regions developed their insurance programs based on the insurance marketplaces allowed by the ACA. For instance, the New Jersey Health Insurance Market Preservation Act requires tax residents to get the coverage, duplicating the ACA’s initiatives.
This paper aims to explore the two similar health care regulations passed on different levels, discuss the implications of federalism, and identify how the government should be involved in policy-making.The New Jersey Health Insurance Market Preservation Act enabled the state to develop the Get Covered program to enroll the residents to receive basic insurance. Although the ACA established the regulations for getting the coverage on federal levels, the government had to allow local policy-making due to the high autonomy of many regions (Bodenheimer & Grumbach, 2020). New Jersey’s program and insurance policies duplicate the national insurance legislation, making the state’s financing system benefit from the residents’ payments. Get Covered offers the taxpayers to qualify for receiving local government’s support for essential health services, similar to the national Medicaid
program (Get Covered NJ, n. d.). Although the ACA aimed to enforce the public influence on healthcare, the duplicative state-wide initiatives provided an additional opportunity for private insurance and financing for the industry.The duplication of the ACA regulation by New Jersey’s Get Covered program is beneficial because it enables the state to address local issues without involving federal forces and finances. Moreover, the socioeconomic conditions vary among citizens, and having similar policies on two levels is an advantage because it provides an individual with the choice for the most appropriate coverage (Olfson et al., 2020). The disadvantage of the regulations’ duplication is the difficulty of taking emergency actions, such as the COVID-19 aid measures, because the usefulness of financial and implementation is unclear. If a particular government’s intervention
and funding are appropriate for a poorer state, it might not work for a wealthier one, and that inequality exists in health insurance, making it difficult to build effective strategies. Furthermore, Sparer (2020) claims that “strong national standards are critical to preventing partisan politics from trumping the health policy process” (p. 490). Indeed, the existence of public and private regulation, federalism in which states share powers with the national government result in various lobbying and disruption opportunities.The individual-mandated health insurance model has existed in the United States for a long time, and the ACA passage enforced the government’s role in regulating the industry. However, the policy-making processes are aimed to solve the states’ local problems rather than improve the system in general. Furthermore, the United States’ federalism is
IntroductionThis community assessment will address the city of Orlando, Florida. It is a city in central Florida with a population of over 300,000 individuals (United States Census Bureau, 2021). It provides an overview of critical determinants for health as outlined by Healthy People 2030 program, and enable public health nurses to evaluate the community for potential interventions. It features a plan for potential intervention, including roles and responsibilities and community partners.PopulationAge, Gender and Race DistributionTotal population numbers of Orlando, Florida, as of April 1st, 2020, is 307,537 individuals. The age makeup of the city indicates a prevalence towards the middle, as 62% of these people are between 18 and 65 years of age. Geriatric population is at 10.2%, whereas children and teens stand for 27.8% of the total
(United States Census Bureau, 2021).Fig. 1. Population AgeWhen it comes to gender makeup, the population is divided relatively equally, with females having a slight advantage, being at 52%, with male individuals constituting the remaining 48%. This could be explained by the fact that women, on average, tend to live several years longer than men. This corresponds to the country’s average male to female ratio (United States Census Bureau, 2021).Fig. 2. Orlando Gender MakeupOrlando is a predominantly white community, but many individuals of different races also live here. Whites alone constitute 61.3% of the population. The second largest group are blacks, with 24.5%. White Hispanics constitute 32.6% of the total. Asian-Americans and Natives are a relative minority, with 4.2% for the former and 0.2% for the latter (United States
Census Bureau, 2021).Fig. 3. Population by RaceBiology and GeneticsCertain diseases often correspond to racial makeup of the population. Black populations are typically exposed to diabetes, sickle cell anemia, cancer, heart disease, stroke, asthma, pneumonia, and HIV/AIDS. Hispanic populations are more at risk for diabetes, hypertension, obesity, elevated low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol, low levels of high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol, and smoking. Asian-Americans are more likely to contract hepatitis B, liver cancer, tuberculosis, and lung cancer, among other conditions. Native Americans are at risk for chronic liver disease and cirrhosis, diabetes mellitus, unintentional injuries, assault/homicide, intentional self-harm/suicide, and chronic lower respiratory diseases. White non-Hispanic population is more likely to be affected by anemia, iron deficiency, arthritis, cancer, cardiovascular diseases, dementia, diabetes, and kidney diseases. Knowing this data as a PHN
is important for predicting the likelihood of occurrence of certain diseases based on the population makeup. Based on the community census, diseases affecting white, black, and Hispanic populations are likely to be the most common.Mortality and Morbidity RatesOrlando city’s mortality and morbidity rates are not too different from state statistics. Florida saw 239,381 deaths in 2020, with the three top leading causes being heart disease, cancer, and COVID-19. These diseases alone account for over 100,000 deaths, with the other half associated with unintentional injuries, strokes, lung diseases, diabetes, and others (Florida Health, 2020).Fig. 4. Leading Causes of Death in FloridaMorbidity rates reflect mortality rates in that those causing the most damage are the ones most prevalent in the population. Throughout the year 2021, COVID-19 saw more emergence, even
as death rates saw a relative decrease in relation to the number of incidents in the population. COVID-19 is the only pandemic currently affecting Orlando city (Florida Health, 2020).Social FactorsHealth ServicesOrlando City offers a broad variety of healthcare services available to the population. These include primary care facilities, rehab facilities, LTC, assisted living, hospice care, mental health and home care, as well as various dental, vision, chiropractor, and alternative services. The majority of the facilities offering care operate in networks, which provide reimbursements to individuals possessing Medicare and Medicaid (“Healthcare,” 2022).Access to Health CareThe majority of the communities in Orlando city have a primary care center or a kind of other medical facility within 15 minutes of their location. The majority of hospitals and large-scale medical centers is
located near the center of the city. Physical access to healthcare, thus, is relatively robust. Availability of care to individuals with insurance and those eligible for Medicare and Medicaid is slightly higher than average in Florida and the US (“Access healthcare of Orlando,” 2022).Social ServicesOrlando city’s social services are presented by the Orange County Social Service Department, which is a government agency providing services for residents of the city. These include healthcare, human services, low-income programs and government benefits. They aim to assist children, the elderly, and vulnerable adults, especially women (“Orange County Social Service Department,” 2022). Besides government programs, there is also a food stamp program, shelter facilities, and several non-government agencies operating in the area. They assist the community by providing services and assistance to individuals
that live below the poverty rate and/or experience problems beyond their ability to handle.Safety and TransportationThe majority of Orlando’s population travels using cars. Public transportation is present, represented by buses and rail services. They are, however, limited, mirroring the situation in the majority of the US. Taxi services are represented by Uber and similar services. Car-sharing is available to the general populace as well (Visit Orlando, 2022). However, taxi services are expensive and cannot be relied on for regular transportation. The city has its own law enforcement, fire department, and emergency services present and in adequate condition to address the needs of the community.Economics and Housing: Orlando city features low unemployment rates at about 4.5%, which is lower than that in the US, which is approximately at 6.5%.
Average weekly wages vary between 850$ to 1100$, which is higher compared to the county and state levels. Leading industries in Orlando are trade, professional and business services, as well as education, leisure, and hospitality (“Orlando, FL, area economic summary,” 2022). Poverty levels are relatively high, with over 17% of individuals living in poverty, including a substantial number of children. Only 35% of people in Orlando city own their own house. Around 2,000 individuals are estimated to be homeless (“Orlando, FL, area economic summary,” 2022). The conditions of the available housing are not readily available.Environment: Quality of air in Orlando city is considered reasonably good, with readings for the presence of pollutants varying between 2 to 9 μg/m³, depending on the month (IQAir, 2022). The primary toxin found
in the air is PM2.5, which is dangerous in high concentrations, able to cause lung diseases, skin diseases, and cancer. The primary pollutant in the water is water algae (IQAir, 2022). Environment can significantly affect population health by facilitating the spread of diseases. Being a coastal city, Orlando is in danger of floods caused by hurricanes.Recreation: Orlando city features 148 parks, gardens, recreational areas, and hobby centers to address the needs of the populace (City of Orlando, 2022). Cinemas, private entertainment establishments, and similar facilities are also present. Many of these do not require payment for entering, thus being available to the impoverished populations as well. Overall, the city features nearly any form of entertainment available state-wide (City of Orlando, 2022).Education: Orlando city provides options for primary, secondary,
and post-grad education. Graduation rates for the city in 2020 have been over 90%, though these parameters dropped after COVID-19 went into full swing (Postal, 2021). Special education is provided to individuals with limitation, and the availability of these services has been increasing since 2015. Schools typically feature wellness and health education programs, as well as physical education for children and teenagers. Free or reduced meal plans are available in some facilities. College accessibility is also slowly growing, especially for blacks, Hispanics, and impoverished families (Postal, 2021).Policies and Government: The city adopts a liberal approach to policies regarding vaccination and immunization. In regards to COVID-19, Orlando city has a mandatory vaccination ban, meaning that employers and other authorities cannot force individuals to undergo vaccination (“COVID-19 latest information,” 2022).
Masks and social distancing are considered optional. Nevertheless, these policies are not helping slow down COVID-19, as daily infections are at around 10,000 new cases a day (“COVID-19 latest information,” 2022).Behavior: Smoking, inactivity, and obesity remain some of the biggest risk behaviors in Orlando city. These factors increased due to COVID-19 lockdowns. About 30% of all Orlando citizens are obese (“These are the top health concerns,” 2019). Drug usage is another risky behavior that is present in Orlando city. Positive factors include exercise, gym attendance, hiking, walking, and swimming, but those were limited by various mandates previously in place in the area. Healthy dieting is presented in several restaurants, but cheap fast foods remain popular among the population.Fig. 5. Obesity in FloridaVulnerable Populations: Vulnerable populations in Orlando city
include homeless, migrants, and the poor. According to statistics, around 17% of the city’s population live at or below the poverty line. The city also has over 2,000 homeless individuals (“Orlando, FL, area economic summary,” 2022). They are exposed to the elements, hunger, drug addictions, and crime. The primary determinant of health for these individuals relates to the economy, as often they do not have enough money to pay for health services, proper food, or accommodations.Analysis of Community Assessment: Healthy People 2030 health indicators state that social determinants of health include economic stability, educational access, health access, neighborhood and built environment, and social contexts (Healthy People 2030, 2022). The analysis of the community assessment indicates that the economic factor remains dominant in determining access to health and education
facilities. Availability of these services is correlated with the individuals’ ability to afford and get to them, as most of them are located near the center of the city. Impoverished individuals and the homeless are the most vulnerable.Priority Community Health IssuePriority community health issue in Orlando city is obesity. Obesity relates to poverty, poor health, availability of health prevention services, and income inequality. Overweight individuals often do not have transportation to travel to markets and shops, and have to rely on fast food services for nourishment. Providing healthy alternatives to traditional high-fat dishes and encourage healthy eating would help reduce obesity in vulnerable populations.PlanThe proposed plan of action focuses on three priority interventions from the PHN Intervention wheel. They are as follows (Schaffer & Strohschein, 2019):  *
Social marketing: Provide access to cheap and healthy nutrition for the poor populations;  * Collaboration: Work with fast-food chains to offer healthier menus as part of their regular course;  * Health teaching: Educate individuals vulnerable to obesity about the dangers of unhealthy eating as well as recipes and routines on how to cook healthily.Community Resources and ReferralsHealthy Weight – provides general information on obesity the BMI index, as well as links to helpful sources and organizations dealing with obesity in Florida.Beltre Bariatrics Center for Metabolic and Obesity Surgery – a helpful resource for individuals in need of surgical interventions in Central Florida.Healthy Lifestyles Program – a step-by-step guide for children and parents, involving exercises, challenges, and dieting.MobilizeOrganizations involved in the proposed interventions have to have the
medical expertise required to educate the population, provide healthy foods and alternatives to fast food, and provide assistance to those already affected by obesity. General hospitals, NGOs, and fitness organizations can engage with the educational portion of the intervention. Fast food restaurants, shops, and other providers could be contacted with the intention of providing a healthier menu to the populace and a wider variety of products to purchase. Finally, Orlando government could provide coverage, authority, and financial assistance to the proposed interventions.Organization                      Description of potential role on the team

What is the issue?In the East Orange Hospital Clinic (Carewell Health Medical Center), most beneficiaries represent the impoverished population, and the problem of skipping the follow-up appointments has recently occurred. More than 25% of patients did not attend the planned visit with their doctor during the last month, and the attendance keeps decreasing. The problem of skipped follow-ups is significant, and multiple reasons cause patients to non-attend their doctor after the initial visit. One of such factors is the socio-economic status of beneficiaries as it influences their priorities and healthcare insurance services affordability (Dantas et al., 2018). Employment and family obligations, costly transportation, and long clinic wait times prevent impoverished populations’ representatives from re-attending a hospital (Ofei-Dodoo et al., 2019). The issue is also related to the clinical
practice as the patients lack education about the importance of the follow-up visits, cannot communicate their needs, or do not receive additional reminders.Why the issue is urgent?The problem is urgent because the growing number of skipped follow-up visits signals lower satisfaction with the quality of the services. The lack of additional examination negatively influences the initial treatment outcomes and can worsen patients’ conditions. Consequently, they will have to return to the hospital, and the costs for it would be much higher than for attending a follow-up visit on time. It will result in a financial burden not only for the impoverished clients but also for the organization that will have to organize services and human resources for treatment (Dantas et al., 2018). The practical intervention to influence the
beneficiaries’ behavior should be implemented urgently to avoid negative consequences and help the patients develop the correct perception of hospital appointments’ attendance.Who should be involved?The project to influence the impoverished population’s behavior must address the reasons for their decision-making, and that goal can be achieved through updates in doctors’, nurses’, and administrators’ actions. Indeed, physicians can improve patient education through teaching how crucial it is to attend the appointment; administration can develop reminder practices (Ofei-Dodoo et al., 2019). Nursing practitioners can also adjust their communication to tailor the importance of follow-up visits and ensure that the client understands. Diverse activities are necessary to be performed by several practitioners simultaneously to achieve sustainable results. The quality improvement team, preceptor, and leaders must also be involved to control and assess
the intervention’s effectiveness.What are the intervention objectives?The two key objectives were developed be based on the research about the population and the practical interventions that can be implemented urgently. The number of missed appointments should decrease by at least 10% in 8 weeks to consider the activities performed to address the issue effectively. Then, the awareness of the follow-up visits importance must be improved through each patient’s education within the next two months. Although this objective is difficult to measure, it is assumed that communicating on the topic with each client will influence their behavior and decision-making (Rew et al., 2020). In 8 weeks from the project’s implementation, the feedback must be gathered to identify the challenges and adjust the strategy to address them.What is the intervention plan?Diverse
Charlotte Perkins Gilman wrote the novel Herland during the times of suffragettes. Unable to embrace life in its full volume, women started to issue the restrictions put on them by society. Being a feminist herself, Charlotte Perkins Gilman displayed many of her beliefs in literary works. In this novel, Charlotte Perkins sheds light on the theme of women’s emancipation. One of the ideas Herland reflects is that women’s domestic duties and societal roles are the main reasons they are perceived as weak and inferior creatures and the main things that restrain women’s true potential. Men, many of whom find an idea of an independent woman unpleasant, have to accept that women obtain the same abilities and intelligence and reject a concept of women’s inferiority.Women, which conduct the population
of Herland, represent the author’s position towards their capability to be independent; Herland’s residents have mastered agriculture, they sustain advanced infrastructure, and they maintain a healthy society without men’s help. “Strong, free, active women, the sturdy, field-working peasant, the burden-bearing savage, are no less good mothers for their human strength” (Gozlet 23). Thus, Charlotte Perkins attempts to object to the concept that was popular among her contemporaries – the assumption that a woman cannot manage without a strong hand of man. In addition, Herland’s society represents a system that is less chaotic than the whole Western civilization of her time. For example, child-rearing has become a public matter and is strictly separated from motherhood. “Gilman believed that fit women had the moral duty to produce more than one
child in order to prevent race suicide just as she believed in Herland, unfit mothers should forego their opportunity to do so, even when it was biologically possible” (Gozlet 23). The population of Herlanders constantly grows, providing the country with new residents. Thus, the society of Herland represents a strong, autonomous, patriarchy-free, and prospering environment.The complete understanding of women’s emancipation requires defining the difference between patriarchal and matriarchal systems, and this is what the author tries to do; these two systems are different in various aspects. First of all, the portrayal of the world, which men built, is strongly connected with an understanding that it cannot be a safe place for women. At the same time, the male heroes regard their world as “safe and civilized enough” (Gilman
14). In the matriarchal society of Herland, the concept of ‘femininity’ is absent; thus, from the author’s point of view, the women are free from being bound to their sex. A well-trained society of hunters and warriors functions as a single organism – everybody understands his duties. Unlike the default Western patriarchal environment, Herland is devoid of such social problems as economic inequality or influential struggle on higher echelons of society (Gozlet 26). On the other hand, the male intruders depict the default patriarchal attitude towards an independent woman: almost everyone finds what he observes unsettling. Moreover, throughout the story, they often refer to Herland as a “national harem” (Gilman 15). Therefore, the matriarchal society of Herland often represents a more just and balanced system of values.It is
the perception, distorted by patriarchal values, which pushes society to overlook women as weak creatures incapable of building their own state, having their own opinion, or protecting their own beliefs. At the beginning of the story, male protagonists question the possibility of matriarchal society’s existence. “They would fight among themselves; women always do,” – says Terry, one of the male explorers (Gilman 10). Although women are often depicted as inferior creatures, they do not intend to harm the intruders directly. However, men in this novel are shown as creatures who are willing to act aggressively towards women. Terry is possibly the worst example of this behavior. He fantasizes “of turning the land into his personal Harem and becoming the king of Herland” (Gozlet 26). When a man avoids
the attempt to convert him and introduce him to the new system of values, he rapes his wife and escapes Herland. One negative aspect, which may be noted in the author’s depiction of this problem, is the generalization implemented towards both men and women; feminism criticizes the system, not the gender (Roy 762). In overall, the issue of gender-based bias has always been present in Western society.However, the author’s viewpoint often raises quite disturbing topics, promoting and supporting ideas of racism, ethnocentrism, and societal hierarchy. Even though the discussed topic, which was raised by Gilman represents an acute problem, which is present even in modern society, the novel often offers wrong answers to the raised questions. For example, the appearance of all residents of Herland is described as
manlike; women have short hair and muscular bodies (Roy 763). The environment requires a woman to remain pure; the mothers of this land are “parthenogenetic” (Gilman 74). While each wave of feminist movement promoted the idea that woman has no duties, Gilman states the contrary in her work. Moreover, the whole concept of a segregated women’s society in some sense crosses out the feminist goal to coexist with, and not without, men as equals. In addition, Gilman shares her “controversial views on African-Americans”, since the white-only society of Herland women resembles the concept of heterosexual Aryan women (Gozlet 22). Thus, while trying to depict a patriarchy-free society, Gilman uses old patriarchal concepts, such as a woman’s duty to avoid casual sex and to be a mother, as well
by women of Herland looks like it still maintains the traditional patriarchal rules and guidelines. No romantic relations between the residents of this country can exist – only maternal or sister love. The Spartan-like society of strong-bodied white women can be regarded as almost perfectly uniform. Even though this novel supports the fact that women are equal no less than men are, this statement is often distorted by the author’s controversial views.
238 A.D. is called the era of six emperors. During that time, six rulers were changed in the Roman Empire. The first emperor was Maximinus Thrax, who ruled since 235 A.D. but was overthrown at the beginning of 238 A.D. Then there ruled two emperors simultaneously – Gordian and his son Gordian II. The latter was killed during the battle near Carthage, and Gordian committed suicide when he found out that his son was dead. After that, two senators, Pupienus and Balbinus, were elected as the rulers of the Roman Empire.However, they were not popular among Roman citizens. Hence a thirteen years old Gordian III became the Emperor instead of them. At the same time, Maximinus tried to go back to Rome but spent some time on the
siege of Aquileia, where he was killed in March 238 (Herodian, 1961). Then Balbin, who, together with Pupiennus, remained unofficial ruler of the Empire, went back to Rome. However, the two senators argued quite often, and during the last fight in July 238 A.D., they were captivated by the soldiers and later killed. Hence Gordian III remained the only Emperor and ruled till 244 A.D.When reading Herodian’s text, it is possible to single out several reasons for the latter fall of the Roman Empire. As seen from the events of the year of six Emperors, civil and internal wars significantly weakened both the economy and the army. They also caused a crisis of power when the rulers could not reach a compromise. A clear example of such a
required a lot of money for the army and different needs. It led to the growth of taxes and provoked inflation and public rage. Another reason is the emergence of a prosperous opponent – Byzantium, which flourished when Rome faced several crises. There exists one more reason, but it was implicitly mentioned in Herodian’s writing. It was the weakening of the army since Roman people were not eager to enroll in the army, and those already registered were tired of constant battles (Herodian, 1961 ). Hence, the fall of the Roman Empire was caused by several factors that influenced both the economy and the army.
The history of blood transfusion dates back to ancient times when people tried to treat animals with blood. Hippocrates recommended that patients suffering from mental disorders drink the blood of healthy people (Community Blood Center, 2020). Blood was commonly credited as having a rejuvenating effect. It is also believed that blood is a miraculous liquid: once it is applied, life can be extended for many years (Community Blood Center, 2020). I find those facts especially interesting in the context of how blood transfusion and blood banks would be further developing.The development of donation was accompanied by numerous ups and downs – from the deification of this method to the state ban on its use. The first documented intravenous injections refer to the beginning of the world’s first academy
of sciences – the Royal Society of London, founded in the 60s of the 17th century (Community Blood Center, 2020). It was not easy to make an intravenous infusion of blood to a person in those days: before the invention of a hollow injection needle and a modern syringe, there were still two centuries left. Christopher Wren, in 1656 used a bird’s feather as an injection needle and bladders of fish and animals instead of a syringe (Community Blood Center, 2020). Although the first attempts gave good results, blood transfusion was not widely used. It was a technically rather complicated operation, and in several patients, the transfused blood caused severe complications.Moreover, the works of early researchers showed that blood transfusion remains an exotic method of medicine, in which
the result depends not on the doctor’s knowledge and skills but on random yet unknown factors. It is known that there are compatible and incompatible blood types (Community Blood Center, 2020). For these and many other reasons, blood transfusion was not a method of daily medical practice. The main and perhaps the only indication for blood transfusion was only acute blood loss.The last century’s world wars and technological progress greatly accelerate the study and application of blood transfusion. Thanks to different methods of blood storage, as well as the invention of freon freezing chambers, blood began to be transported over long distances and stored for a longer time. In 1932, the world’s first blood bank was established in a Leningrad hospital (Community Blood Center, 2020). Soon after establishing
but also for strengthening strength, nutrition, fighting infection, and preventing various diseases. And so it went on almost until the mid-80s, until the AIDS epidemic radically changed the attitude towards blood transfusion.Currently, the blood service is one of the dynamically developing sectors of health care that is focused on ensuring the quality, safety, and availability of transfusion care. Priority areas at the present stage of the development of transfusion medicine are the maximum automation of work processes based on the development of information systems, the use of high-tech equipment, and the improvement of the product quality management system.
Hewlett Packard (HP) has a matrix organizational structure, which implies the distribution of responsibilities based on the different products that the company offers. In particular, in a matrix structure, there are usually two lines of command: one responsible for the functional line, and the other for the product or project line (Iyer, 2021). Within an organization, there are various divisions that interact with each other and are responsible to functional managers ( Working together , n.d). Within divisions, there is also a hierarchy of employees and managers. The image of the HP organizational structure, which was modified in 1975, is shown in Figure 1.Fig. 1.

The relentless predators that attack people can be not only bears or wolves coming out of the forest. Sometimes, seagulls also are merciless, like in “The Birds” by Daphne du Maurier – a short story written in 1952. In the center of this work is the story of a farmer and his family, whose settlement is attacked by whole flocks of sea birds. In 1963, Alfred Hitchcock made a film of the same name, which differs significantly from the idea of du Maurier. Although the short story “The Birds” and the movie The Birds are often perceived as a single entity, it is possible to consider all differences between these two versions thoroughly due to historical criticism.Even though the film and story have the same name and base,
which involves a narrative about people suffering from the birds’ attacks, many episodes make them different. Firstly, while the written version focuses only on the farmer Nat Hocken, the movie has a lot of heroes. For instance, the viewers can see Melanie Daniels and Mitch Brenner. Secondly, in The Birds , there are more storylines: the birds’ attacks, the line of relationship between Melanie and Mitch, Cathy’s party, and episodes with her teacher. Finally, there are also less visible differences: the events of the printed story occur in London, and events of the movie – in California. The film starts from the meeting in the pet shop, while the written version begins from the moment where Nat sees a lot of birds, “jackdaw and gull, mingled in strange
partnership” (du Maurier 4). In addition, du Maurier describes the situation where the seagulls’ punishment is directed at all city residents, while Hitchcock’s birds are more aimed at the main heroine. Therefore, although both these versions are interesting, they are pretty different.I believe that the written version is superior since it better conveys the idea of nature’s rebellion against humanity. Moreover, this story was created when the dangerous eastern wind could symbolize the potential threat of the East to the USA. Although the film has more characters and storylines, the written version seems more dynamic. It would be wrong to forget that Daphne du Maurier disliked the final script of the movie due to the numerous changes (Carr). I think the printed version is more substantial and more
with the use of some aspects of the written story: the name, the general idea, and the atmosphere.Although certain elements unite the story by du Maurier and film by Hitchcock, they should not be perceived as two parts of one artwork. Due to the historical criticism, it becomes clear that du Maurier puts more meaning into the narrative, symbolizing both the attack of nature and the threat of the East. However, both film and story are bright, engaging, and make people think; therefore, they are worthy of reading and watching.
The article by Clarke (1997) focuses on the role of people of color in Canadian life and history. This well-grounded work attracts attention not only due to the author’s style and exciting data provided by him. The article is impressive because Clarke describes the country’s history from the inside, comparing the outward veneer of a liberal and tolerant Canada with a less pleasant inward reality.This work contains several facts that seem to be surprising but compelling. Firstly, Canada pretends to be racially tolerant, in fact, it accused people of color of promoting a culture of violence. Secondly, it is strange that “83 percent of Canadian adults did not know” or perhaps did not want to know “that slavery was practiced in pre-Confederation Canada until 1834” (Clarke, 1997, p.103).
historical data but exciting ideas, is worthy of reading.This article is a significant contribution to the exploration of Canadian history since it shows the inner mechanisms of the state. The author focuses on various facts of Canadian history that emphasize the depreciation of the role of people of color. Clark chooses an unexpected manner of narrating, describing historical events, and diluting them with elements of imagery. Therefore, this work is as surprising as it is compelling.
IntroductionCaring for a chronically ill relative by family members is a network of multifaceted activities and psychological adaptive mechanisms that aim to show empathy and meet the suffering relative. Relatives everywhere influence the patient’s life by scheduling meetings with them, choosing food and gifts for them, and giving them their time and attention to communicate. Emotional support from the relatives’ side is capable of underestimating the level of stress in self-management. Emotional investment has a beneficial effect on the process of adaptation to illness and the search for the most comfortable and at the same time productive life.Aging Process and the Stigma of AgingIf a chronically sick relative is elderly, this can impose additional complications on acceptance and assistance to loved ones. The stigma of aging is usually
not only internally psychological but also social. This implies that the patient not only experiences discomfort and an urge to realize his age but may also feel an increasing distance between himself and his family. In such situations, the patient’s level of suspicion and distrust can increase, and a sense of detachment and abandonment can grow. This leads to depressive effects of the state, which is implicitly an obstacle to a comfortable life in the future. That is why a high level of family support through communication, frequency of visits, and involvement in an activity, can objectively increase the level of the patient’s self-management, give them a feeling of support, but at the same time the full value and independence of their personality.The Process of Coping and Tolerance
to DistressAmong the traditional problem reactions that chronically ill patients faces are grief and its various stages with high emotional dispersion. The mechanisms of humility that patients use to adapt to their condition are in many ways similar to the strategies of coping with grief since they include similar parameters. Emotional responses such as disappointment, anger, and ignorance, as a result, are replaced by acceptance in the case of positive dynamics of psychological self-regulation (Russell et al., 2019). Impulsive and unhealthy habits, on the other hand, underestimate the tolerance to distress and, accordingly, minimize the future chances of a healthy life. Such tolerance is formed independently, yet with the help of medical personnel and the environment of loved ones, further priorities and quality of life of the patient
depend on it.The Concept of Power and Helplessness in the Context of the Chronically IllThe situation of helplessness in the context of the chronically ill can grow not only because of the awareness of their illness but also because of the lack of proper support provided by the nurse. Once in the health care system, a person may receive an insufficient number of not only the proposed adaptive strategies but also real human attention. The time that nurses devote to patients should be allocated from the point of view of real psychological adjustment, so as not to make the patient feel helpless. It is on how the attending staff interacts with the patient that their willingness to receive help and seek support in their psyche depends.A person in
a situation of such heavy pressure should be able to find independent strength to come to terms with the fact of the disease and learn to live with it and resist it. The feeling of control over the disease or, accordingly, helplessness in front of it is largely formed through communication with medical personnel and loved ones. It also depends on the nurses how to communicate with relatives so that they cannot harm the patient with their braces.There are specific methodologies for communication between nurses and patients that can give the patient’s relatives sufficient instructions on how to give them a sense of motivation and not downplay that feeling. It should also be noted that a feeling of helplessness may appear in a chronically ill person who is
feeling like being torn out of the usual cultural context. In the situation of the modern world, a willingness for multicultural adaptation and the ability to show empathy towards a member of a minority should be completely natural in any nurse practitioner.Health PromotionHealth promotion has historically been the primary concern of nurses focused on improving patient health, both physically and mentally. In the case of critically ill patients, promotion implies all kinds of support and provision of access to services that patients are still able to receive. These services include suitable and proper nutrition, social support, and relaxation programs. Particular attention should be paid to stress management programs which can be of different dimensions, both psychological and spiritual. Yoga and meditation in this aspect can be quite practically
effective practices for perfecting the patient’s internal balance.In general, maintaining the patient’s health at this stage of the end of life should imply the provision of a psychologically and socially comfortable life. It adapts to the primary and secondary changes that happened along with the disease and its development (Lubkin & Larsen, 2013). Thus, this practice turns out to be focused on activating human potential and giving it a positive realization even at critical moments in life, which is one of the main tasks of a health worker. Expressions of grief in the context of the chronically ill involve the ability of the nurse to convey information about the patient’s health in a way that makes sad news sound as traumatic as possible (Patinadan et al., 2020). The
information itself should not serve as a reason for despair, but the search for hope.Holistic PracticesIn addition to the aforementioned health care practices that should help patients shape their psychological state more naturally, there are so-called holistic medical practices. The idea of a holistic relationship between a nurse and a terminally ill patient is to develop initially beneficial communication. The idea of centralization and balance plays a significant role in building such an attitude since it implies the constant presence of the nurse’s awareness of oneself at a particular moment of what is happening. From the feeling of being with the patient, the actual presence of a psychologically healing environment is created (Dossey & Keegan, 2013). Getting rid of critical and value judgments is also encouraged in a
holistic approach, which rather aims to ensure that information is not perceived from a position of evaluation or judgment.The spiritual dimension also seems to be extremely important in the psychology of holistic medicine. The idea of man as a unity of the physical and spiritual, of the presence of the sacred and eternal nature of human existence, does not seem like an exaggeration or a hoax in the face of real death. Therefore, understanding one’s physical life as just one of the stages of a grandiose magical journey does not seem to be a psychological manipulation when it comes to the psychological well-being of a doomed person. This holistic orientation allows you to find meaning in life and give a positive meaning to your finitude.Insurance and Disposal of
Health Care ResourcesThe enormous financial spread in the modern American healthcare system is caused by the high segmentation of the healthcare sector, which is not only a state institution but also a full-fledged market for services. The inequity in the distribution is due to the discrepancy between the ability to privately provide treatment to the upper stratum of the population and the need to receive free medical care for the poor (Sommers et al., 2017). Even though, in recent years, programs to help the poor have been actively developing, the middle class, with its absence of state subsidies at the high cost of medicine, is extremely vulnerable.This problem could be solved by the state federalization of most commercial medical institutions. The creation of a clearer and less capitalist
The first major takeaway from this week’s reading is the complex role nature of parenting. As a preschool teacher, I had an opportunity to witness the massive impact created by parental roles personally. According to Gestwicki (2016), parents fulfill various roles, ranging from workers to consumers and nurturers. I can confirm that many parents are virtually consumed, even overwhelmed by these roles. The constant deficit of time and possible conflicts between the roles create immense pressure on parents. Raising a child in good conditions is costly, which often forces parents to prioritize the worker’s role. However, emphasizing work sometimes leads to a lack of attention to the educator’s role, which can also hurt a child. In a way, I feel that my professional duty as a preschool education
as an expansion of self, try to fulfill moral obligations, look for affection and fun, or follow certain achievements (Gestwicki, 2016). In regard to my work, I think that some of these reasons may lead to harmful consequences for a child. For instance, I feel that pushing a child into disliked activities to satisfy the parent’s ambitions is a traumatizing experience for a child. As such, an educational worker should communicate with parents and warn them if they spot any troubling signs. Parents may be responsible for a child’s upbringing; however, that responsibility does not turn a child into a property object.
In the video, an actual six-level Hong Kong Air Cargo terminal is described. This technologically advanced building meets the needs of clients and management departments. Due to its $1 billion logistics facilities and computer-driven automation, the terminal works great and brings a number of benefits, including security, speed, and flexibility. Handling equipment, advanced automation, and IT development promote the development of customer-focused services. For example, no physical (human) intervention is possible through the implementation of the pack tools box storage system (BSS). There are about 3,500 storage positions at the highest level, and cargos are administrated with the frames of computer-generated plans.One of the main elements of high-tech methods to sort, track, and control shipments at Hong Kong Air Cargo is the absence of direct human activities and
and managing (Bhattacharya, 2018). If I were a manager in the air cargo industry, I would use the Hong Kong system as one of the best examples to be followed. First, it is necessary to use computer-controlled conveyors to reduce the human impact on shipment activities. Second, the implementation of mapping systems cannot be ignored because they enhance security and flexibility. Finally, the idea of pack tool BSS is a good chance to support total security in the cargo system.
IntroductionGenerally, the market for housing is categorized at the regional and national levels. The two providers tend to relate and consider the rate each use in terms of pricing and average square footage. It, therefore, requires real estate managers to conduct proper analysis to identify the prevailing charges in the sector. To determine the significant relationship in the industry, data containing the name of the state, county, region, house listing price, cost per square foot, and the square footage.PurposeThe project’s purposes are to analyze housing sales prices in a local region in the United States and determine if they are higher than that of the set standard housing price of the national market. The project addresses this claim (hypothesis) by first carrying out a statistical test of means
of both the local housing sales market and the national market price. This will be archived through a test statistics T-test on the two means: the local housing sales market price and the national market price. Additionally, the project will use a simple comparison method by getting summary statistics of the local housing sales market price compared to that of the national market price. After that, the conclusion will be drawn based on the findings on whether to reject or accept the null hypothesis.A random sample represents a group or population in which each item in the representation has an equal chance of being chosen (Tamhane & Gou, 2018). Random samples are meant to eliminate biasness in the population depiction. On the other hand, a Hypothesis is a
statistical claim or assumption where an analyst tests those assumptions (claim) regarding a population parameter that is valid.Sample SizeThe main focus of the statistical analysis is to evaluate and determine if there is a significant difference between the housing issue in the region and those in the national market. A random sample of size 100 houses picked from various counties will be used to establish the findings, after which a general conclusion will be deduced concerning the population under study. The sub-set of the population contains state, county, region, house listing price (HLP), cost per square footage (CSF), and square footage (SF). In the research, the means to be analyzed are average prices and the cost per square footage.The project subjects’ samples from the housing sales market price
data of size 100 are chosen at random (each sample has an equal probability of being sampled) to minimize type one error in the project. The sampled data has an appropriate sample size, and the process of extraction involves randomization. To very further the condition of the data, I need to confirm if it is normally distributed to ensure it meets the necessary conditions for the analysis.The samples include explanatory variables such as State, County, Region, house listing price, cost per square footage, and square footage. The main focus will be to establish if there is variation between the house listing prices and the cost per square footage in the region and national market. The state and county variables will not be included in the analysis as part
of the population parameter.Questions and Type of TestsHypothesesTo test the hypothesis, the project employs paired T-test statistics. Population parameters in the project based on the samples are the Housing listing price and square footage of homes under the analysis. A hypothesis is an unproved claim or judgment that is not tested and proven true or false. The test aims to confirm the claim if it is true or otherwise.In this project, the Null hypothesis is that the local housing sales market’s mean price is higher than that of the National housing market sales price. However, the alternative hypothesis is that the mean market price of local housing price is below or equal to the national housing market price.In the selected sample, the following are the hypothesized claims: 1.
Mean housing listing price, mean cost per square footage, and mean square footage are greater than that of the national market.Where μ 0 is the mean of the local housing market price, and μ 1 is the mean of the national market price. 1. Mean housing listing price, mean cost per square footage, and mean square footage are equal to or lower than that of the national market.Test StatisticsThe project’s statistical test inference will be the student’s test (t) of comparing the sampled mean to the national mean price. The test is defined as follows:Xbar is the sample mean, s is the sample variance, and n is the sample size. The above formula will lead to the value of t critical, which is essential in decision-making. If the
estimated confidence interval is outside the calculated range of the data, we will reject the Null Hypothesis; otherwise, the project advises that the null hypothesis is true. Moreover, suppose the estimated value is much higher or lower than the calculated data or set measure. In that case, the project advises rejecting the null hypothesis; this is true if the estimated value is in the range of -0.5 to +0.5 of the set measure of the national market price (Tamhane & Gou, 2018). A 1-tail test suggests that the calculated (estimated) value is either on the negative or positive side of the set mean.Confidence LevelThroughout this project, a 95% level of significance is used; because a 95% level of significance describes 95% of the data values that contain the
true actual mean of the population. It is effective based on this analysis which uses a large sample; thus, the interval range enhances precision.Data AnalysisThe following figure and table give a summary of statistics on the housing market price.Table 1.Table 2.The table below shows the summary of the spread of the data in terms of mean, mode, median, sample variance, and standard deviation.The following figure gives a bar graph of the house listing price.Figure 1.The histogram below summarizes the house listing price.Figure 2.The following table gives test statistics on the house price listing, and the cost per square footage meansTable 3.InterpretationThe appropriate test statistic used in this project is a t-test and based on the results in table 3 above, the t-value is 22.597, and the P-value of
a one-tail test is found to be 3.644e^41. The p-value at the 95% significance level is much lesser than the critical (tabulated) value; that is, 0.05 is greater than 3.644e^41. Therefore, there is no significant difference between the house listing prices in the region and the ones provided in the national market.DecisionBased on the analysis, the project advises rejecting the null hypothesis and accepting the alternative. Therefore, there is no statistical evidence to show that the local house listing price is greater than the national house listing price (Tamhane & Gou, 2018). In relation to the outcome of the research, it is evident that the house prices in the region are not higher than the ones in the national market average.On the 2-tail test, The Hypothesis 1. Mean
housing listing price, mean cost per square footage, and mean square footage are greater than that of the national market.Where μ 0 is the mean of the local housing market price, and μ 1 is the mean of the national market price.The 95% level of significance was chosen, as it has been explained earlier. The population parameter under this test is the house listing price and the cost per square footage. The following table gives the summary of the output.Table 4.The normal condition has been met in the data; this is explained in the histogram about its relatively bell-shaped distribution. Also, the statistical mean, mode, and median are almost all equal. The 95% confidence interval range of values of the square footage of a home in the local
figures.Table 6.The project result is such that it is 95% sure that the square footage falls in the range between 50.00 to 52.00.ConclusionIn conclusion, based on the research data analysis, both the house listing price and the square footage in the region and national market do not bear any statistical difference. Therefore, a real estate company can invest in either regional or national markets. The analysis included the critical variable, and based on the randomization of the sampled houses, the information provided is effective for investment decisions in the industry.
Nowadays, due to the constantly changing economy, employees are expected to obtain new skills and qualifications to remain in demand as professionals in the labor market. Training and coaching are the most widespread methods in the workplace for workers’ development. Although there is enough research on the group training’ outcomes, the effects of external and self-coaching are arguable and not extensively justified in the light of their high costs. First of all, it is essential to clarify the differences between these terms: training is the systematic process aimed at the provision of the specific required knowledge, whereas coaching refers to a more individual approach with continuous support. Self-coaching, in turn, follows the same methods and structure as individual coaching but without a contact person. Thus, the coaching is
presumably more applicable to the development of work-related performance if the leadership style, transactional or transformational, fits the needs of coachees.Procrastination is the focus of the paper due to its high relevance for the people in different settings, including workers and students. The research on the effectiveness of the various methods to reduce the negative consequences of the phenomena is based on Kirkpatrick’s (1959/1994) four-level model of training and learning evaluation. Satisfaction (reaction), content-related knowledge (learning), goal attainment, and state procrastination (behavior) were assessed as the primary measures among the subjects in four experimental conditions: individual coaching, self-coaching, group training, and control. Transactional and transformational leadership behaviors were measured with the statements: “The coach helped me find new ways to reach my goals” and “The coach made it
attainment was not so significant in comparison with other groups. Overall, the practical implications of the empirical evidence include that both individual coaching and group training are similarly successful ways of intervention for the fight with procrastination as well as for skills and knowledge development in general. Self-coaching, in turn, appears to be not sufficient for performance improvement. The leadership strategy plays an essential role in clients’ perceptions that influence the final results.
Bankers used to determine if a person was worthy of being granted a loan or not. The criteria for granting loans were based on the applicant’s habits and relationship with the bankers. People close to the bankers were granted loans causing women and minority ethnic groups to suffer. The loaning system changed when Earl Isaac and Bill Fair invented a system known as FICO. FICO used algorithms to determine the defaulting chances of a loan applicant by comparing their income and expense records. Credit agencies like Equifax use the FICO model to identify default customers. Credit scores are clear, and its industry is regulated, unlike the modern e-score, which is vague and unregulated. E-score algorithms use data like real estate, websites, and items purchased to determine the e-score
rating. For example, wealthy estates are given more ratings than poor ones. Since it is illegal for organizations to use credit scores for marketing, companies tap into massive unregulated personal information they use in the marketplace. The E-score model uses proxies that categorize people into races, and if someone’s race turns out to have criminal, the person is considered unworthy of loans.Data scientists should be taught that including race and zip codes in ethics classes is unfair and unethical when building E-score models. Statistics models have always been efficient in the modern world. However, the models sometimes fail, and the victims are seen as collateral damage. Creditworthiness is no longer about the ability to pay debts, as companies use credit reports to make different versions of credit scores
which are then used as proxies. Credit scores have increased poverty because most employers use credit checks to hire employees. Consequently, some states passed laws to ban credit checks to reduce the poverty gap between whites and African Americans.In low-economy setups, critical decisions are automated, making humans prone to computer errors. Minimal data regulation has led to the purchase and sale of data between corporations and data brokers. Despite efforts by the FTC to push for transparency, data brokers still display minimal information when they ask for their details. Automation of data scraping systems and algorithms has led to mistaken identity cases because computer errors are inevitable, hence the need for fine-tuning data algorithms. Algorithms for E-score, predatory loans, and recidivism sentencing models predict the past into the
The rapid globalization of the 21st century caused the emergence of distinctive characteristics of modern times. The major change in this respect is attributed to the development of technologies, especially to the emergence of the Internet. In 2021, 4.6 billion people had access to the Internet worldwide (Johnson, 2021), so almost everyone could express his or her opinion about any acute topic. For this reason, ​​Chareonwongsak (2002) sees the emergence of a multidimensional view of truth. The goal of a thoughtful Internet user is not to find necessary information but to sort the relevant one from random speculations. This trait is seen in Singapore’s reality, where the users of messengers and social media can spread fake information about vaccination and coronavirus.The fact that thousands of millions of people
The Cult of the Head StartSalaryTips, incentives, and overtime compensation are not included in the salary when working as a BCBA. In the United States, the average BCBA pay is around $62,000 per year and the worst ten percent make $47,000 per year, whereas the top ten percent get $97,000 per year, excluding bonuses (Epstein, 2020). BCBAs at the entry-level earn around $57,000 per year, with annual wages rising in the following order: Humble beginnings: $60,000, immediate post: $65,000, and late-career get about $75,000 to $68,000 for a seasoned BCBA and $71,000 in final years (Dounavi et al., 2019). As a person develops expertise as a BCBA, you may anticipate your income to rise.Similarly, an individual’s place of work can have a substantial impact on the compensation. A
BCBA who works in the private sector, for example, typically receives more pay than a BCBA who works for a state agency or learning institution. BCaBAs make an average of $44,000 every year, with the top earners receiving more than $70,000 after rewards (Lotfizadeh et al., 2020). However, the annual pay for BCBAs often tends to grow with time.When Less of the Same is MoreSkillsFor an individual to get certified, all BCBAs need to complete stringent conditions, although some BCBAs are in greater competition than others due to added talents. BCBAs with competence in clinical management, ABA, Autism Spectrum Disorder, Structural Analysis and creating processes and standards are sought by employers. BCBAs with functional analytic expertise, for example, recorded a compensation rise of 5%, while clinical supervision abilities
can boost your pay by about 2% or more (Lotfizadeh et al., 2020). Although there is a high demand for BCBAs right now, having extra abilities can give you confidence and generate more revenue.The BCBAs are known for their robust and effective communication and a desire to inform and assist others. They are skilled at interpreting individuals’ attitudes and body posture. BCBAs must evaluate a patient’s behavioral issues and come up with the appropriate treatment plan for that person (Lotfizadeh et al., 2020). The patient’s condition often determines their method; for example, somebody with autism will react differently than somebody with a personality defect.Thinking Outside ExperienceExperienceA professional who has earned accreditation in applied behavior analysis is a Board-Certified Behavior Analyst. The Behavior Analyst Credential Board issues the certification
to BCBAs (Epstein, 2020). For those who wish to train, BCBAs must have attained a master’s degree and be board-certified prior to start working on their own, and they usually need roughly six years to acquire their training and gain experience.Behavior analysts need to demonstrate that they have undergone the requisite level of practice in one of three methods. Practicum, which requires a minimum of 1000 hours of medical practice under strict monitoring, independent monitored research work requiring not less than 1,500 hours of medical practice under the supervision of a qualified behavior analyst. An Intensive practicum that needs not less than 750 hours of medical practice under the most stringent supervision is required (Epstein, 2020). BCBAs often undergo job training to understand the company’s systems and procedures
after the job opportunity.The Trouble with Too Much GritNames of Relevant DepartmentsThe growth of the market for BCBAs results from an attribute to increase in public knowledge of autism and the use of applied behavior analysis as a therapy method. Individuals also realize the value that a qualified BCBA may bring to other fields (Dounavi et al., 2019). The following professions are steering for an increase in demand for behavior analysts: therapy for drug addiction, gerontology of conduct, sport behavior psychology, long-term environmental stability and pediatric psychiatry. There has been a considerable growing market for BCBAs due to a recent broadening of what behavioral analysis and therapy can be used for inpatients.Flirting with Your Possible SelvesTypes of Organizations and Actual organizationsBehavior analysts can work in colleges, health centers,
clinics, and nonprofit organizations. However, most behavior analysts mainly focus on specific areas such as psychological issues, autism and developmental disorders. Companies that hire behavior analysts include Devereux Advanced Behavioral Health, The ABRITE Organization, The Columbus organization and many more (Boydston & Jowett Hirst, 2020). It is a good moment in the United States to be a board-certified behavior analyst, as BCBAs are in the growing market.ABA treatment companies throughout the state are on the lookout for licensed behavior therapists to be part of their staff. There is an enormous job opportunity for either BCBA or a junior behavior analyst, regardless of certification. In recent times, demand for trained behavior analysts has surged in all fifty states (Boydston & Jowett Hirst, 2020). The BCBA job market has grown
dramatically due to increased public knowledge of the field and the wide range of ailments to which one can perform.The Outsider AdvantageJob DescriptionFor a candidate to have a chance to be a part of fitness and wellbeing specialists. A qualified behavioral specialist who is hunting for a career opportunity in a health center specializing in Behavioral Health, the person need to be a considerate and competent board-certified behavior analyst (Sellers et al., 2019). To engage with a clientele group that consists of people with autism and other developmental disorders, emotional stability issues, and more, the BCBA must have compassion and understanding. The best person will need to have strong communication, conflict solving abilities and a record of successful behavior change.Fooled by ExpertiseTrends and Future ProjectionsBCBA or BCaBA, are
members of a career with a substantially brighter job outlook compared to the state average. Based on the present job development rate, a profession in behavior analysis is anticipated to be good and lucrative for a person. From 2019 to 2029, the increase in employment for marriage and family therapists who attained master’s-level therapists is expected to be 22% (Normand & Bober, 2020). Behavioral counsellors, who must have attained a bachelor’s degree, such as BCaBAs, are expected to witness a 25 percent increase in employment by 2029 (Dounavi et al., 2019). As the demand for experienced behavior therapists grows, an individual employment option will be available.Learning to drop Familiar ToolsRegionIn 2019, the BACB issued a survey that Burning Glass Technologies did, and it came to the realization that
The article How Sushi Went Global by Theodore C. Bestor explores the phenomenon of the sushi boom that occurred in the United States and the world, in general, in 1970th. Such growth in popularity of Japanese food and culture was explained by the fact that more people started thinking about leading a healthier life and replacing red meat with fish, rice, and vegetables. The Japanese way of life and food preparation appealed to many people, and from the local dish, sushi became a symbol of Japanese culture that is famous all around the globe.Sushi expansion caused the growing demand for tuna for sushi and sashimi making. Though in 1970th, Japan remained the leading producer of the raw fish that is used during the process of sushi preparation, tuna-producing
farms appeared in many countries, including Spain, New England, and Canada. Though the workers there were not Japanese people, the majority of the technologies used in these farms came from Japan. At the same time, the sushi boom was influenced by the globalization process that made Japanese culture and cuisine even more recognizable. Moreover, sushi gained such popularity that it even made the owners of Chinese or Vietnamese restaurants change their course towards Japanese cuisine in order to get more profit and new clientele.After sushi was recognized globally, Japanese people created a whole industry to teach sushi chefs and other workers relating to the global sushi business. However, sushi is currently associated not only with the Japanese but the Asian culture in general since people from Korea, China,
Vietnam, and other countries run sushi restaurants all over the world. However, Japan still remains the core of the sushi industry and sets trends for other countries to follow.The article Why Hollywood Rules the World by Tyler Cowen concerns the most influential movie producing area of all times and its influence on the movie-making industry and the world in general. Since cinema is one of the hardest spheres for globalization due to the complication of the process of movie-making, it is hard to outperform Hollywood who remains the leader in the field. Unlike other movie production companies, Hollywood is more susceptible to globalization due to its orientation on the wide range of viewers. Hollywood movies are designed not only for the American audience but for audiences all over
attention to such aspects as the commercial success of the film and refuse to work with those that have lower chances of obtaining it. However, it is wrong to say that Hollywood studios contribute to American cultural imperialism since a lot of directors and actors are non-American by birth. Hence, when speaking about Hollywood, it is better to regard it as a universal movie-making industry that is based on American ethos.
Patient falls are considered to be a crucial safety concern in clinical practice. Nevertheless, there is an evident lack of systematic techniques to reduce the frequency of such incidents. A patient fall is a descent to the floor with or without injury to the patient. Thus, numerous risk factors should be eliminated to minimize the risks that patients can be exposed to while at a hospital.In pediatrics, patient falls are of major concern since children and adolescents are generally more active. Most early attempts to analyze and solve the problem centered around the techniques that helped identify those young patients most likely to fall. Nevertheless, these studies did not provide uniform generalized ideas on how to prevent such occurrences. Therefore, medical workers had to develop and utilize various
Organization Development & Manpower Planning and Information Reporting  * Organization development targets improving the organization’s capabilities through the alignment of people, structure, strategy, and management processes.  * The main aim of manpower planning is to estimate the number of people for the successful work of an organization. They do it by counting the number of working personnel, establishing the types of skills required for the job, and analyzing demand and supply trends.  * Information reporting section specialists research the ratio of customers’ approval of the services. They gather statistics through phone calls or public polls for the clients.Recruitment  * Recruitment specialists search for new employees and lead them through all the stages of employment.  * It is the responsibility of the recruitment section
Technological development is becoming the dominant factor influencing the transformation of modern society. It creates unique opportunities, opens horizons for personal growth, and contributes to the shift of the values of humanity and its social structures (Quinn, 2020). However, besides the noticeable positive transformations, technology poses a threat to civilization, and its containment, regulation, and implementation are challenging. An average person cannot stop the constant process of technological expansion, and it is impossible to conclude which way the result of specific means will go in advance (Quinn, 2020). However, it does not signify that it follows its path. People should not simply observe the industrial growth and produce everything they can or set in motion processes that lead to the destruction of natural living conditions. On the contrary,
of any intellect is the ability to learn, which is not a self-governing process.Technology cannot perform specific actions independently without prior human intervention; hence, its work and application are primarily people’s responsibility. Therefore, individuals must be guided by values while realizing that the choice of exploitation has severe consequences (Quinn, 2020). Technology itself cannot create or destroy societal values; on the contrary, the environment in which it develops determines how it will continue to work. Significances such as the rule of law, democracy, individual liberty, and human rights are reasonable for overcoming the direct consequences of industrialization. These principles make the use of technology ethical and preserve all social benefits.
Research question: What are the risk factors for developing cancer due to Human papillomavirus (HPV) infection?This research question will look at the risk factors that lead to the development of cancer due to HPV infection. This is necessary to develop the most effective measures to prevent comorbidities and complications for already infected patients. For the investigation of the question, the observational design will be used, which is widely used in epidemiology to collect data (Paneth & Joyner, 2021). As part of this study, the researcher monitors “the exposure and disease status of each study participant” ( Section 7: Analytic epidemiology , n.d). To answer a research question, a cohort study is most suitable, which will identify exposure to the disease. Based on the data obtained as part of
researcher can collect the necessary statistical data on the incidence of cancer due to HPV infection and consider risk factors that potentially increase the possibility of developing the disease. Most importantly, observational design as part of a research question will collect data for future statistical analysis. Follow-ups of patients who already have cancer due to HPV and a study of their lifestyle will help identify contributing factors. On their basis, later, it will be possible to make an analysis to identify patterns of cancer development as a consequence of HPV. The information obtained in the framework of an observational study may be sufficient to consider the question posed.
A society, or human society, is a group of individuals linked by long-term relationships or a large society that shares the same geographical or social territory and is often dominated by the same political authority and cultural norms. Human society is defined by the pattern of relationships (social relationships) between individuals who share a common culture or institution (Lazer et al., 2021). Members of the society can be considered the sum of these relationships.In the social sciences, subgroup stratification or dominance patterns are often observed in larger societies. Society can enable its members to benefit in unthinkable ways without personal cooperation. Therefore, personal and social outcomes can be identified or duplicated in many situations (Lazer et al., 2021). Within a dominant and larger society, societies can also be
order to see the society. I saw people doing morning jogging, families having time together, and many different people who were walking to work. All of these people were of various ethnicities, genders, and probably with many other individual characteristics. Despite that, all of them are living in the same geographical area and are bound by certain social relationships. That is what made me recognize and explore the society around me.
Human trafficking is a significant problem in the United States and abroad, which is considered to be modern-day slavery. Human trafficking involves the use of force, fraud, or coercion to obtain some type of labor or commercial sex act (Zhang et al., 2012). In Latin America, the problem is crucial, as many gangs and criminal organizations use human trafficking as one of the sources of funding their illegal activities (Zhang et al., 2012). Thus, it is crucial to partner with organizations in Mexico and other Latin countries to address the problem. It is also crucial to focus on women and children, as they are the most frequent victims of human trafficking (Zhang et al., 2012). Therefore, I would partner with Justicia Para Nuestras Hijas, as it provides legal
“Above all it is thus that we can acquire the virtue of humility, and that is by far more precious treasure than all academic progress. From this point of view, it is perhaps even more useful to contemplate our stupidity than our sin.” These words of wisdom imply that the success of learning is not to elevate a person’s ego, but rather teach them humility through enhancing their understanding of the world. This appears to be the ultimate outcome of thorough academic engagement that reflects a person’s ability to acquire a certain degree of critical thinking and reflexivity. I am inclined to agree with the main idea expressed by the quotation. In my opinion, humility is a virtue that helps an individual become motivated and complete. Through this
key quality, one can understand how their grow further in terms of personality. A humble individual will never overestimate their own skills and performance, meaning that they will remain in a constant pursuit of improvement. Furthermore, humility is a virtue that directly counteracts pride as the deadliest of sins. By exercising humility, a person acts by God’s design.When it comes to this quality, it is often opposed to success in both academics and career. More specifically, one may assume that humility negates confidence, preventing an individual from fulfilling their potential. For example, promising opportunities may be declined by a humble person simply because they do not consider themselves fit for this position. As far I am concerned, this point of view does not reflect the truth. Humility and
In some cases, changing the DNA of an unborn person is the same as changing fate and giving a chance for a happy future. Since science does not stand still, people have learned to influence DNA to a certain extent. To date, the idea of “designer babies,” which claims that it is possible to alter the genes of the embryo, carrying out specific genetic manipulations, is becoming pretty popular but needs to be explored more.The opportunity to alter DNA is an excellent step toward the development of science, but it should be used carefully. While nature “has a marvelous mechanism to ensure that each human life has an identical number of chromosomes” and is unique, genetic changes should be utilized only in urgent situations (Belsky, 2015, p. 38).
The altering DNA for such reasons should hardly be admissible. Therefore, a significant gap lies between the desire to choose the child’s sex or eye color and the striving to save the life or prevent the disease.The idea of “designer babies” can hardly be evaluated as exclusively positive or negative. On the one hand, it indicates the development of genetics and contributes to the destruction of some diseases a child could suffer. On the other hand, the idea of designing unborn humans in the same way that technologists create computer machines seems unnatural. Therefore, in several cases, the manipulations with genes are indispensable and can bring extraordinary benefit, but in other situations, perhaps it would be better to entrust this matter to nature.
One of the deepest social issues that I am feeling for my whole life is immigration as an emerging process. Moreover, nowadays, this problem only devastates me, which literally increases my wish to help others due to the risk of being the victim of such a phenomenon. Many people face the obstacle connected with continuing living in a country that does not meet their expectations and cannot provide the needed conditions of residing and working throughout their whole life. As a result, the world population experience a significant decrease in overall quality of life. From the global perspective, the most influencing countries in the world use visa and other conditions of entering the country as a migration regulating tool. However, when it comes to the emergency outflow of
are trying to escape their home country to avoid more significant problems.Turning to the solution contribution, I would force private entities, which succeed to become international “players” to help those people who cannot properly become political migrants due to the severe regime which does not admit such status officially. This solution would increase private companies’ reputation in the world society. Moreover, due to the great social responsibility reliance, local and global authorities might decrease the international companies’ tax pressure, which will relatively compensate the company’s losses on the social responsibility programs. From the other perspective, the tax exemption and companies’ contribution to the migration process easing are mutually eliminating operations, which might stop inflation from increasing when it comes to countries with unstable domestic currency.
Boeing is the largest aircraft manufacturer of all time, having success stories running throughout U.S business history. The company is well-known for its commercial airplanes and input in space and security. William E. Boeing established the company in 1916 in Seattle before moving to Chicago (O’Connell, 2020). Boeing started manufacturing by transforming a building plant designed for wooden boats. The company earned its first income from the United States military and contracted it to develop aircraft. Due to the influence the firm had in the market, the owner focused on ensuring that he gathered input and ideas from all staff members.Boeing also developed aircraft specifically designed to deliver mail to faraway cities and towns in the country. The aircraft provided a faster way for people to share information
despite having distance barriers. This forced the company to change its business model to incorporate airplane manufacturing and flights. In 1931, Boing transformed other airlines into a single one to form United Airlines (UAL) and also purchased other airplane manufacturing companies to expand its operations (O’Connell, 2020). Later, the firm changed its name to Boeing Airline Company and played a significant role in developing military aircraft used during World War II.When the war was over, Boeing shifted back to manufacturing commercial aircraft to make single trips across the country. This meant that the company had to eliminate aircraft that used propellers and adapt turbojets. Boeing started receiving large orders from the United States air force, which made it roll out the 707, commonly used by Pan American Airlines.
This airplane model was the public’s favorite since it allowed them to move from one city to another within a few hours. Becoming the public’s favorite aircraft enabled Boeing to manage large orders for the airplane model. The high number of orders for the 707 made Boeing develop the 737 and 747, which affected the production process, almost making the company announced bankruptcy.As Boeing considered the production of the 747 models, the industry was hit by a recession which acted as a barrier to domestic carriers purchasing new aircraft. The production of the 747 was also affected when the company started building the 2707 model, whose production had been halted due to the high costs involved. However, the 747 became the highest-selling aircraft since they were bigger and
had faster engines (Hayward, 2020). Boeing never gave up on the airplane model, which was fruitful. The company has seen an increase in revenue coming from its diverse product line and a high number of orders from customers. With time the company has opened up multiple subsidiaries to handle various operations. Despite being a giant in the aircraft manufacturing industry, Boeing still has many competitors seeking to overtake its position.Boeing started expanding its operations to enable the production of helicopters. Boeing’s assembly lines also integrated the manufacture of missiles for the military, with the first missile being launched in 1962. Boeing also expanded its processes to allow air and land craft building, with NASA being the main customer. This enabled the company to produce rockets to take human
beings to the moon and back. The firm also manufactured vehicles designed for the space shuttle mission organized by NASA till the project was closed down. Boeing later produced the 757 and 767 aircraft models, which were more beneficial since they were used in flying and training exercises. This helped cut down on costs needed to purchase aircraft designed for the two processes differ. Boeing was also involved in managing a housing project designed to develop various projects to improve housing in the country.The 777 models from the company used a design and manufacturing software that was computer-aided. Boeing managed to save time and resources when building the aircraft by failing to create a physical frame first. The firm later turned to the production of the 787 Dreamliner,
have enabled the firm to become a top manufacturer globally.Boeing has employed more than 140,000 people in various countries. Being located in various parts of the world has allowed the company to get one of the most diverse and talented workforces (Boeing, 2017). The company also focuses on offering its customer’s service solutions for the wide range of products available in the market. Boeing has customer support which is active to ensure that aircraft operate with high efficiency and enhance mission assurance. Boeing also has a capital corporation that provides its customers with a wide range of financing solutions. This helps to ensure that they have adequate funds to purchase different aircraft products hence minimizing struggles likely to be experienced due to lack of funds.
It should be noted that climate change is one of the most important challenges of modernity, and properly addressing the problem is of paramount relevance for the future of humanity’s development and civilization. NASA’s interactive time machine clearly shows how the Arctic sea has shrunk since 1979 by a significant margin, whereas CO2 concentration in the atmosphere has increased drastically in less than two last decades (“Carbon dioxide”). In other words, major indicators of climate change are all pointing towards the fact that some measures need to be taken in order to stop further catastrophes ahead. Similar observations can be made in regard to temperature, which also shows significant heating of the planet. In addition, a simulation of sea-level increase by six meters, major cities, such as Miami
macronutrients, micronutrients and other elements vital for the growth of plants and animal life” (Jansson and Hofmockel 35). In other words, the microbiome of soil is a key determining factor for food production since both animal and plant lives depend on it. However, drastic changes in the climate not only hinder the growth of crops through increased rates of natural disasters and droughts but also soil depletion and scarcity of essential nutrients. Therefore, it is a highly probable possibility that the most significant threat of climate change is global hunger and famine. With an ever-increasing world population, demand for food is growing as well, which means that food shortage might become the most impactful effect of climate change.
Human beings always encounter conflicts in their daily lives, and, unfortunately, many of them fail to deal with these challenges effectively. Undoubtedly, they are inevitable and make a negative impact on individuals if not properly resolved. Therefore, it is essential to invest time and effort in advancing one’s conflict resolution skills in order to positively affect different areas of life, ranging from family relationships to work performance. One of the useful ways to achieve it is to reflect upon the conflicts, which occurred in the past.To begin with, during the last year, I dealt with a number of conflicts, both effectively and ineffectively. For example, my friends often disagreed with me about various issues, such as the place to travel together, different perspectives on social problems, or ways
to complete some tasks. I also had multiple arguments with my relatives and neighbors over either minor or major questions. It can be concluded that I faced conflicts almost every day in the past year. I suppose that most people do it as well, though they may not recognize all disagreements, as they are a routine part of humans’ lives.The be honest, I clearly realize that it is more effective to adopt the interest-based approach to addressing conflicts, though sometimes I concentrated too much on my own position and refused to consider others’ needs. Nevertheless, in most conflicts, I endeavored to collaborate with another party in order to find solutions, which would benefit everyone. I tried to focus on others’ desires, fears, and concerns, as well as to
express mine clearly. Hence, I successfully resolved many of the disputes in 2020 and felt incredibly satisfied after it. However, I incorporated the positional approach several times, and it definitely led to negative outcomes.Furthermore, I notice that I had a tendency to collaborate while having disagreements with various individuals. I was willing to accept their ideas and combine them with my views. Still, sometimes I avoided conflicts when I was convinced that another party would undoubtedly stick to their position and avoid considering my own needs and desires. Simultaneously, I never incorporated an accommodating style to resolve disagreements, as it opposes my personal characteristics. Although I competed for my position, I knew when it was the right time to compromise in order to achieve the satisfaction of both
As a matter of fact, renewable energy that includes wind, solar, hydropower, biomass, ocean, geothermal, or biofuel energy, may be regarded as a highly essential power generation source in the nearest future due to its efficiency and the impact on ecosystems. The major benefit of the generation of renewable energy is the minimization of water and air pollution as it does not presuppose carbon dioxide emission and soil erosion. Consequently, clean soil, water, and air contribute to the safety of ecosystems all over the world. However, regardless of its multiple advantages, the sources of renewable energy may be potentially harmful to the environment. Their negative influence is predominantly connected with the location and peculiarities of facilities, the production of constructions’ parts, and the improper utilization of materials required
for production.For instance, the use of wind energy is highly beneficial for the preservation of ecosystems in the future. First of all, it may be regarded as a free and renewable source the supply of which will not change in the course of time. Moreover, wind energy is a source of non-polluting and clean electricity – in comparison with traditional power plants, wind stations do not emit greenhouse gases and other air pollutants.At the same time, wind energy may have a negative effect on wildlife through the constructions for its generation. Thus, all wind plants have “the potential to disrupt wildlife behavior through day-to-day turbine operation, maintenance activity, and construction noise” (NREL, 2020, para. 4). In addition, spinning turbine blades may be dangerous for lying species, including birds
and bats (Office of Energy Efficiency & Renewable Energy, n.d.). Although this impact may look insignificant, its accumulation may substantially change ecosystems, especially coastal ones. In this case, governmental approaches to the design, construction, and operation of wind plants should be improved (NREL, 2020). Offshore winds are a great source of clean energy, however, the natural habitats of wildlife should be protected from the negative consequences of wind energy generation.Similar to wind energy, solar energy contributed to the preservation of ecosystems by the absence of hazardous gas emissions. At the same time, the constructions for its generation may have a negative impact on the environment as well. First of all, “larger utility-scale solar facilities can raise concerns about land degradation and habitat loss,” and they cannot be united
According to the case under discussion, Company F purchased 40% of Company K on June 30, 20XX. The primary question is how Company K should account for investments made to Company K. Before accounting for the costs of investment, dividends, and income of Company F, Company K should identify the appropriate accounting method. According to Tuovila (2021), when one company has a significant influence on the other company (owns between 20% and 50% of shares), the equity method should be applied. Under the equity method, the investment is initially recorded at historical cost, and adjustments are made to the value based on the investor’s percentage of ownership in net income, loss, and dividend payouts (Tuovila, 2021). This implies that Company F will need to record the initial investment
, Company F should record a debit of $200,000 (40% of Company K’s income) as “Investment in Company K” to the asset account. 4. On December 31 st , Company F should report a credit of $200,000 to Investment Revenue. 5. Similarly, on December 31 st , the company should record a credit of $40,000 (40% of Company K’s dividends) to cash. 6. Additionally, on December 31 st , Company F should report a credit of $40,000 from the asset account as “Investment in Company K.”Thus, at the end of the year, investment recorded in the balance sheet will be $4,160,000 ($4,000,000 + $200,000 – $40,000). At the same time, the income statement will demonstrate a change in cash value by $3,960,000 ($4,000,000 – $40,000).
A cardiac angiography entails the determination of any form of blockage in blood vessels. The procedure is done by injecting contrast dyes through a catheter, followed by the visualization of the flow of the pigment through blood vessels (SCOT-Heart Investigators, 2018). Any impediment to the movement of the dye is an indication of blockage of blood vessels and restricted blood flow to the heart.The doctor ordered this test because the patient complained of chest pains when climbing up the stairs. Chest pain is a common problem for people with heart disease even though other organs could contribute to this discomfort. However, the patient’s weight and lifestyle (smoking, sedentary lifestyle, and consumption of fatty and sweet foods) predispose him to heart disease. Mr. Perkins’ diagnosis is angina pectoris, which
is chest pain attributed to the inadequate flow of blood to cardiac muscles. The organ system that is mainly affected by Mr. Perkins’ condition is the cardiovascular system, which includes the heart and blood vessels. However,Cardiovascular disease impairs the transport of blood to and from the lungs, which ultimately affects the respiratory system. Other organs that may be damaged by poor blood flow are the kidney and brain. Insulin resistance may also develop due to being overweight. The doctor ordered an angiography to find out whether the patient’s blood vessels were blocked and contributing to the chest pain. Mr. Perkins’ blood work might show high levels of cholesterol, triglycerides, low-density lipoproteins, and glucose as well as low levels of high-density lipoproteins.Suggested treatment plans for Mr. Perkins include pharmacological
interventions such as statins, beta-blockers, angiotensin II receptor blockers (ARBs), nitroglycerin, aspirin, angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors, and calcium channel blockers. In contrast, non-pharmacological interventions for the patient include engaging in at least one hour of moderate-intensity exercise for three to five days a week, cutting down on the consumption of fried and sugary foods, eating plenty of fruits and vegetables, as well as reducing his intake of salt. Mr. Perkins should also stop smoking cigarettes to reduce the risk of additional heart problems.Shilipa is suffering from a bleeding disorder. Antibiotics have inhibitory outcomes on hemostasis and the coagulation of blood. This phenomenon is common following the use of broad-spectrum antibiotics such as second and third-generation cephalosporins in addition to semisynthetic penicillin. These medications mimic the action of warfarin
BackgroundClinical laboratory science is very essential in the diagnosis of infections and disorders. It provides information that guides in the collection and examination of a specimen. The results obtained enable doctors and other physicians to make the accurate diagnosis and therefore design the appropriate drug therapy for the patients. Some diseases like rheumatoid arthritis are interesting to learn due to their unique laboratory tests performed. Anti- cyclic citrullinated peptide test is carried out to check presence or absence of anti- cyclic citrullinated peptide antibodies. This test is positive for people who are prone to these diseases. Such diseases have promoted research in this department, enabling more accurate diagnosis and therefore treatment of patients.Point of Care TestingThis is the laboratory testing of patients in operating rooms, recovery areas, patient’s
bedside, or home testing. This has increased the interaction of laboratory physicians, respiratory therapists, nurses, assistant physicians, operating room technologists, and anaesthesiologists. It provides cost effective methods and advancements in medical care and enables an immediate and accurate assessment in intensive care units or parent units, emergency departments, and operating rooms. Tests performed mostly are analytical, such as prothrombin time coagulation test, partial thromboplastin time coagulation, and erythrocyte measurements like hematocrit. The regulations of CLIA’88 are followed to ensure accurate and quality results are obtained as well as quality control and proficiency testing is provided. The laboratory director ensures that all regulations are implemented and adhered to.SafetyThe safety of the patients and the laboratory personnel should be maintained. Most of laboratory accidents are usually caused by lack of
paying attention to instructions, carelessness, and lack of concise and proper communication during the testing. By use of suitable mechanism, strategies, common sense, and staying alert can be used to minimize such accidents. There are bodies that are responsible for ensuring blood borne pathogen prevention and protection, and ensuring electrical, fire, and chemical safety is guaranteed which Health Administration, and Occupational Safety and other bodies. Musculoskeletal disorders are the most common physical, ergonomic stressors where muscles, nerves, tendons are affected, for example, tendinitis and sciatica.Workers are vaccinated against hepatitis B, rubella, and measles infections. Conducive working conditions, education on first aid methods, and personal protective equipment are provided. The Joint Commission and National Patient Safety Goals reinforce patient safety methods. Therefore, errors in the pre-analytical phase, for example,
in blood sample collection and patient identification, and analytical errors like verifying the accuracy of abnormal results are avoided as well as Post-analytical mistakes like communication of tests results are avoided.PhlebotomyThis is the process of making a puncture in a vein, usually in the arm, with a cannula for the purpose of drawing blood; It is also referred as a venipuncture. Factors such as ambient temperature, altitude, humidity, and light are considered during this procedure. This procedure should be carried out by trained personnel to ensure the patient’s safety and that the correct results are obtained, and no complications like iatrogenic anemia arise. Anticoagulants such as ethylene diamine tetra-acetic acid prevent coagulation caused by fibrinogen. Blood cultures should be protected from contamination. Specimens are susceptible to clotting, hemolysis;
icterus, and lipemia, in addition, tests performed are mostly pre-analytical. Laboratory and clinical standards institute are responsible for regulating laws and legislations governing phlebotomy.Clinical Chemistry: LipidsLipids are biochemical molecules with cholesterol and triglycerides; they are plasma-bound, forming lipoproteins. They have functions in the body, for example, insulation to allow nerve impulses and heat loss, energy storage, structural components of cell membranes, and they act as hormones.70% of the cholesterol in the human body is from the liver, the rest if from dietary intake. High levels of cholesterol increase the risk of atherosclerotic disease. Cholesterol is an essential structural component of the animal cell membrane and precursor of bile acids and steroidal hormones.The serum is the specimen used by a patient who has fasted for 12-15 hours. The instrument
used is a serum separator evacuated tube, and an enzymatic cholesterol assay is carried out. The desirable amount is less than 180mg/dl, the moderate amount is between 200-239mg/dl, and those at high risk have levels of more than 240mg/dl. Familial lecithin cholesterol acyltransferase deficiency is a disease transmitted as a recessive trait. It is usually associated with hyperphospholipidemia and hypercholesterolemia with underlying conditions of hypertriglyceridemia.Hematology: LeukemiaThis is an uncontrollable and abnormal proliferation and progressive displacement of hematopoietic cells with standard cellular elements.They are classified morphologically into lymphocytic and myelogenous, they termed as acute or chronic, depending on the amount or number of blasts available. Examples include acute myelogenous leukemia, chronic myeloproliferative disorder, and lymphoblastic anemia. Flow cytometry identifies specific cluster designation and cell surface membrane markers. Christmas disease
or Hemophilia B, also called factor IX (FIX) deficiency, is a genetic disorder caused by missing or defective factor IX.Microbiology: ParasitologyThis is the study of parasites, their hosts, and their relationship. Parasites such as Trichomonas vaginalis cause infection to their host. The trophozoite is tear-shaped, elongated, and with a jerky undulating motion. It is present in freshly voided urine in wet vaginal preparations and prostatic secretion and can be analyzed and reviewed under the microscope (Turgeon, 2018). A rapid antigen detection test is available; it is very easy and rapid conduct the OSOM Trichomonas Rapid Test which is a dipstick method. The TV system is used for culture and direct microscopic examination in Pouch.Immunology: Autoimmune DisordersThis is the study of molecules, cells, and systems responsible for recognizing and
disposing of non-self-substances. Autoimmune disorders include that body attacks healthy cells; they include systemic lupus and rheumatoid disorders.Rheumatoid arthritis is a chronic inflammatory disorder affecting joints structures and tissues. The manifestations can be articular and extra-articular. Juvenile rheumatoid arthritis is another chronic synovitis condition that affect chidren in their childhood stages.The immunofluorescent technique detects high immunoglobulin G, and immunoglobulin M. Identification of R factor in serum or synovial fluid is used for diagnosis. The higher the R factor, the more joint destruction there is. The R factor is determined by conducting a test known as Rapid Latex Agglutination.Blood Banking: PlateletsGenerally, patients who are bleeding excessively are subjected to platelets concentrates due to low platelet count, abnormal platelets, or after massive transfusions. Platelets are harvested by the process of
or blood transfusions. This process can be conducted by testing the presence of diseases in the blood or typing the blood before it is transmitted. Such an approach is fundamental during the patient care unit because it helps the physician avoid any medical-related errors before donating or transfusing the blood.Coagulation: Therapeutic Anticoagulant TherapyCoagulation is the process by which coagulation factors, plasma proteins, and calcium are subjected to work together on the platelets’ surface to make or form a strong fibrin clot.Therapeutic anticoagulation therapy uses glycoprotein receptor drugs such as abciximab, eptifibatide, aspirin and clopidogrel, intravenous antiplatelet membrane, and thrombolytics. Direct thrombin inhibitors (DTI) such as new oral anticoagulants, warfarin, a vitamin K antagonist analog, and anti-Xa anticoagulants such as heparin are also used.
Toxic water pollutants have an adverse impact on the environment and people’s health. Nowadays, due to the tremendous amount of factories’ wastes, many dangerous emissions fill the air, water, and, unfortunately, human bodies. One of the most life-threatening toxic elements is mercury pollutant. It causes irreparable consequences for the environment and human health. Every year vast amounts of mercury are found in the different water pools. The toxic metal connections, contaminating the water inhabitants, cumulate in the fish. Then, people eating fish and shellfish get themselves exposed to mercury contamination. As a result, life-threatening diseases incrementally develop and can lead to abrupt death. Therefore, to reduce the risks, environmental health specialists should adequately analyze the potential threat of mercury contamination and provide recommendations. Mercury contamination prevention practices are
also vital for ensuring public health safety.Mercury pollutants are dangerous for all park users because of their adverse effects on human health. The toxic contamination can spread through swimming and fishing in water pools. The skin is one of the direct channels of how mercury can get into the human body. Due to the highly toxic and corrosive nature of mercury, this pollutant can pass through the exterior layers of the epidermis and have a high chance of getting into the blood (Casso-Hartmann, et al., 2021). As far as mercury is pretty heavy, it can accumulate in the blood supply system causing frequent damage to the neurological system. This process is especially dangerous for adults and the elderly who suffer from tachycardia. Moreover, mercury can damage the skin
causing allergy or severe skin irritation (Casso-Hartmann, et al., 2021). Thus, swimming in the lake, estimated to have mercury pollutants, is dangerous and should be strongly prohibited.Lake fish is also exposed to the long-lasting effect of mercury. The longer fish is affected by the dangerous pollutants, the more it can harm the human. The fish scale is a perfect material to accumulate mercury elements because of its patchy texture (“Persistent organic pollutants”). Therefore, the fish contains much more pollutants in its body than people can get through swimming. Getting mercury with fish while eating is the easiest way to be exposed to mercury pollution. The digestion system quickly spreads all the mercury particles into vital body organs, and people risk having severe health problems (Casso-Hartmann, et al., 2021).
Thus, as far as eating fish is the most dangerous way to get mercury contamination, fishery in the contaminated lake and further fish selling should be prohibited. People’s health directly depends on their understanding of risks and awareness about how to avoid contamination. Park visitors should be mindful of their safety and stop fishing and swimming in the lake.The risks of mercury pollution to the different types of lake users are various. The severity of the mercury contamination consequences depends on the age of the person exposed to the contamination, the way of contamination, the health condition, and many other factors. Scientists believe that age is one of the most common factors determining contamination exposure (“Health Effects of Exposures to Mercury”). However, the most dangerous effects mercury has
on unborn children in the womb of pregnant women. Scientists, analyzing the social-medical consequences of mercury pollution, state that methylmercury is often found in fish and has adverse effects on unborn children’s brain development (Budnik & Casteleyn, 2018). The infants are at high risk of severe neurological distractions and different kinds of malformations, which can even cause the abrupt death of the newborn (“Health Effects of Exposures to Mercury”). Therefore, mercury pollution is hazardous for pregnant women and their future kids.Young children also run a risk of falling victim to the adverse consequences of mercury lake pollution. According to practical research, children exposed to mercury contamination in the age of eight to fourteen often have different kinds of neurological disorders like attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (Figueira, et al.,
2017). Usually, such neurological distractions are temporal and disappear after the neurological system changes. The symptoms disappearing is possible only under the condition of complete mercury exposure avoidance (Figueira, et al., 2017). The young children’s brain activity is still unstable and continues to develop. As a result, they are also at a high risk of being badly harmed by mercury contamination.Speaking about older children, they seem to be less vulnerable to toxic emissions. However, the investigated practical examples showed that the children after fourteen being exposed to mercury contamination often have such adverse effects as coordination disorders and sometimes even tremors (Figueira, et al., 2017). Moreover, the contamination can affect the neurological systems, hearts, lungs, or kidneys in a long-term perspective (“Health Effects of Exposures to Mercury”). The
connection of neurons also becomes weaker, and as a result, long-term problems with memory and brain activity may occur. Thus, different kinds of diseases have a more significant change to appear in their adult years. Older children often have non-obvious consequences of mercury contamination and run a higher risk of falling ill with life-threatening diseases.Adult people have their bodies fully developed and are likely to be exposed to mercury through eating fish. As far as mercury influences the cardiovascular and neurological systems, adults have a risk of high blood pressure and an increased chance of heart attack (Figueira, et al., 2017). Moreover, the natural decrease in vision and hearing caused by age body deterioration has adverse implications and can lead to the loss of seeing and hearing (Figueira,
et al., 2017). A massive amount of mercury can lead to Minamata disease and harm the whole body’s functioning (Budnik & Casteleyn, 2018). This disease significantly shortens the lifespan of adults because adverse body distractions are hard to restore. Therefore, mercury exposure is dangerous for all types of lake users and causes life-threatening health problems.Mercury contamination in the water is a threat to human health safety. Mercury is highly toxic and affects the neurological system of the human badly. Besides, mercury can cause other severe destruction s in the bodywork. People can be exposed to mercury through swimming and eating toxic fish. Unborn infants and small children are at a higher risk of being exposed to mercury contamination. However, people of all ages should avoid using water pools
The proposed study presupposes the adherence to the quantitative research paradigm and secondary data. The choice is justified by the fact that to answer research questions, specific correlation methods should be used, which presupposes the collection and analysis of quantitative and statistical data. Additionally, the complexity of the current situation caused by the COVID-19 pandemic impacts the employment of secondary data as a way to guarantee the credibility of findings.There are two main research questions of this study as follows:  * What is the correlation between cross-border e-commerce and Chinese international trade?  * How does cross-border e-commerce impact Chinese international trade?In order to research these two questions, the study employs quantitative research methods and secondary data.Firstly, the correlation research will be conducted to establish the relationship
IntroductionThe British company ASOS is an example of a company that has very successfully adapted to the new age of the Internet. The brand launched its online store in 2006 and began selling its clothes and shoes. The new generation of millennials was the company’s target audience. Now the total revenue of ASOS is growing very fast. ASOS demonstrates how online commerce can allow the company to become an international market leader. The promotional events held by ASOS and the wide range of products help the economic growth. However, the current measures are not enough to ensure such intensive growth.The Context of the ProblemThe emergence of online commerce has opened up new opportunities for both manufacturers and consumers. The world economy has evolved significantly with the advent of
the Internet. A powerful logistics system made it possible to deliver goods worldwide and provide services remotely. Large firms managed to create a particular model of doing business on the Internet. Its features include incentives, a focus on the global marketplace, and the integration of new technologies to drive growth. All of this saves customers time and, during discount periods, saves them money. The Asian, U.S., and European sales market has moved almost entirely online, and major local and international leaders are emerging.The sharp decline in ASOS quotations at the end of 2018 led the media to believe that the end of the era of online shopping was near. Sales are no longer as intense as they used to be, and therefore profits are down. The reason for
this is the fact that traditional online retailers cannot keep up with a market ruled by infrastructure companies. Shoppers are no longer satisfied with waiting weeks for an order and demand next-day delivery. However, due to logistical difficulties, not every company can meet this demand. This level of quality is not yet available to many companies. In addition, revelations about the nature of sales promotion have driven some customers away from retailers.ASOS should have thought about competing with stationary retail outlets, where customers can hold goods in their hands and start using them immediately, without waiting for order delivery. Promotions and special offers have spoiled European and American shoppers. That is why they are often unwilling to accept discounts of less than 50%, for example, during the pre-New
Year period. ASOS, an experienced player in the market, has to take this factor into account. The company monitors sales dynamics and, if necessary, can pull up the statistics by stimulating marketing activities. However, it did not do so, for example, when the stock collapsed at the end of 2018.Three Solutions to the Problem: Improved LogisticsSolutions to the problem can include ways such as teaming up with other companies, changing the existing logistics system to focus on Amazon’s experience, and improving the site to meet customers’ high expectations. Long delivery times are one of the most common customer complaints. Amazon, the largest online commerce site, deals with this problem quite effectively. In particular, the company has begun reserving space for its shipments on cargo ships. This helps the
company get rid of go-mediators, which will make the delivery process faster. Amazon is also working with its fleet and testing drone delivery. The company plans to create a flying warehouse, which will also reduce logistics costs.ASOS should consider using Amazon’s expertise. The company does continue to implement a single warehousing system between the U.K. and the U.S. and promotes the development of partners’ operational capabilities. In addition, the firm’s investment in improving logistics is significant, and there are known cases of building partnerships with firms in this area. However, more intensive measures, such as those taken by Amazon, are needed. Amazon’s separate, powerful analytics system calculates the most economical way to deliver packages. It calculates the shortest route for each parcel, saving the company millions of dollars
in fuel costs. ASOS’s revenue allows the firm to budget extra money for better logistics.Improving Site Performance and DesignThe Internet is a significant source of growth for the company, but the retailer’s surge in popularity has repeatedly caused numerous website glitches. In addition to technical errors, some questions are raised by the ASOS interface, which would lead to improved customer satisfaction. Although the company has several subsidiary brands, its advertising is poorly represented. In addition, there are problems with positioning – most customers know ASOS only as a clothing store. Moreover, the case analysis mentions that visitors to the site and its primary customers are women and men between 16 and 34. People in this age category make up only twenty percent of the total number of online
shoppers. Accordingly, some aspects of the ASOS site and its appearance could be improved.The solution to this problem has to do with site analysis. As noted in the case study, the staff at ASOS is now organized by hierarchy. There are separate departments that deal with specific tasks. Therefore, it would be advisable to assign or create a department that would conduct a UX audit to verify the site’s usability. The result of a usability audit is usually a document that explains the site’s problems in detail and suggests solutions and notes best practices as examples. Due to the customer information collected on the site, online retailers know exactly what customers are looking for. Accordingly, ASOS needs to make sure that the site is performing as well as
it should in order not to lose profits.Company Growth through IntegrationThe integration process leads to the merger of companies operating in the market. Horizontal integration is the merger of companies producing the same type of product. Its benefit is to reduce costs and increase market share. After this type of merger, the product made remains the same. Companies resort to vertical integration to reduce operating costs. The company already has a successful integration experience, for example, with Topshop. ASOS then reported results for the second half of the fiscal year 2020. According to it, even in a pandemic, there was an increase in profits. Immediately after the merger, a significant increase in traffic was recorded. Accordingly, integration can be an effective way for the company to grow further.Eliminating
Two SolutionsThe company should not consider a website redesign only based on aesthetic needs. Changing the external interface has no direct correlation with an increase in the company’s income. And in an attempt to create the perfect site, clients and performers lose a lot of time that could have been spent on more productive changes. Website redesigns can cause an adverse reaction, even if the previous site was far from perfect. It is necessary and keeps in mind that radical modifications often lead to unpredictable consequences. All of the above suggests that ASOS should pay attention to other ways to increase company growth and profits.Vertical integration coordinates the various components of an industry chain in an environment where bilateral trade is not profitable. While this type of integration
usually reduces some risks and transaction costs, it also requires significant upfront capital investment. Moreover, the effectiveness of such coordination is often questionable. Horizontal integration increases resource efficiency, lowers prices, and lowers costs. However, weaker competition and increased concentration of sellers in the market worsen the efficiency of resource allocation, which poses a threat to monopoly. Integration is not the best way to develop ASOS because efficiency is questionable and monetary costs are high.Creating an Action Plan with the Remaining Way to Solve the ProblemASOS sales growth seriously slowed down late last year due to the difficult situation caused by a new strain of Omicron coronavirus infection. Revenues fell by one-fifth, the exception being the local U.K. market. One should pay attention to Amazon’s experience. The company has
shown tremendous growth and has a talented supply chain. Moreover, Amazon’s automated technology increases customer satisfaction with service quality. Boeing rentals and cargo ship seats ensure that the company delivers quickly and smoothly. After purchasing electric vans, Amazon can now claim that express shipping is environmentally friendly.Robotic systems such as Kiva movers have fully automated the process of storing, picking, and packing goods. With the help of robots, the Internet giant reduced operating expenses by 20%, which amounts to 22 million dollars per warehouse in monetary terms. Its network of postal terminals allows customers to receive their parcels conveniently and without queues. In addition, it allowed the company not to lose revenue due to FedEx’s decision to stop deliveries. ASOS can successfully use all these logistical methods. The
IntroductionKrisna Hospital provides secondary and tertiary healthcare services to its patients. The hospital is committed to providing patient-centered care, which resulted in introducing a new position as a patient care executive (PCE). This professional is in close contact with patients and families to help physicians spend more time on medical aspects and less time on communication with patients. Patient retention, as well as revenue, increased, but the hospital is also witnessing an increasing turnover rate among physicians. Due to a significant deficit of high-profile physicians in India, losing a high-skilled practitioner is a serious problem to be addressed as hospitals try to attract talent. Discussions with the staff make it clear that the clash between PCEs and physicians is one of the primary reasons for leaving. This paper
includes a brief analysis of the problem and a solution to ensure the sustainable development of the healthcare facility by improving the quality of care.Phycological Contract Breach at Krisna Hospital and Ways to Address ItOne of the issues the physicians employed at Krisna Hospital find influential is the psychological contract breach. It has been found that psychological contract breach has serious adverse effects on employee job satisfaction (Collins and Beauregard, 2020). The practitioners expect to be trusted professionals influencing patients’ health-related decisions. However, this expectation is not met as PCEs appear to be the central figures who affect patients’ behaviors and decisions. At that, trustful relationships between the doctor and the patient are the basis of patients’ adherence to treatment regimen and, as a result, patient outcomes (Cánovas
et al., 2018; Hefner et al., 2018; Chandra, Mohammadnezhad, and Ward, 2018). The fact that patients are willing to communicate with PCEs rather than physicians and follow the recommendations of the former can be seen as an influential factor contributing to the breach of the psychological contract.One of the causes of this serious problem, leading to the high turnover among physicians, is the existing patterns of sources of power in the hospital. PCEs are responsible for maintaining proper communication between the physician and the patient. However, they are more than that as they become the major source of information and support for patients. These professionals exercise expert and referent power regarding patients’ decision-making process. These types of power encompass trust and proper relationships based on the belief in
the person’s expertise and positive personal attitude (admiration, close connection, and so on) (Håvold and Håvold, 2019). These types of power are critical in healthcare settings as patients feel vulnerable and need support and empathy in addition to expertise and clinical care.At the same time, physicians’ source of power is associated with their position within the healthcare facility (legitimate) and their expertise (limited expert power). At Krisna Hospital, physicians are completely responsible for patient treatment, and their authority is not expected to be questioned by PCEs (which happens quite often). Patients also understand that doctors have the necessary expertise, but in many cases, people choose to follow the recommendations of PCEs whose expertise is valued more than that of physicians. Patients trust PCEs rather than their doctors, which
has negative effects.To address the psychological breach and improve communication between patients and doctors, it is necessary to design detailed sets of responsibilities for both positions. These responsibilities should be clear to physicians and PCEs, who should collaborate rather than compete. It is critical to creating teams consisting of physicians, a PCE, and other healthcare professionals. PCEs should stick to the treatment plan and provide recommendations consistent with these plans, ensuring proper communication between the medical staff and patients.Main Reasons for Resisting the PCE ProgramAs mentioned above, the psychological contract breach is one of the primary reasons for resisting the PCE program at the healthcare facility. Physicians believe that patients should follow their recommendations while people often disregard them and follow PCEs’ advice instead. However, PCEs have no
deep medical knowledge, which can have negative patient outcomes, according to Krisna Hospital physicians. Disrupted communication is a serious reason that makes physicians resistant to the program. These practitioners and PCEs do not communicate properly, which creates two lines of communication instead of one single approach developed by the healthcare team. , the lack of communication skills in doctors can also be an issue to be addressed. They can be too concerned with the medical aspect and forget about such domains as empathy and patient psychological and emotional needs (Kee, Khoo, Lim, and Koh, 2018; Pascual-Ramos et al., 2021). The hospital administration should consider launching a training program aimed at improving communication skills for physicians. Team-building incentives (following the creation of teams of physicians and PCEs) should also
be implemented.A Viable Solution: A Plan to Implement the PCE ProgramTo improve the situation and decrease the turnover rate at the hospital in question, it is possible to use Lewin’s theory of change widely employed in the healthcare setting. This theory of change implies three stages: unfreezing, changing, and refreezing (Bamberg and Schulte, 2019). During the first phase (unfreezing), it is essential to make all the stakeholders aware of the issue and involved in the process of change (Beasley, Grace, and Horstmanshof, 2020). The urgency of the problem should be discussed during regular meetings, and the panels should be held in three variants: physicians, PCEs, and both groups together.The stage of change will also involve weekly discussions because miscommunication or even the absence of such is an apparent
issue. The practitioners should share their concerns and suggestions regarding the improvement of provided quality. It is critical to make sure that both, PCEs and physicians, are equally committed to the organizational goals (one of which is the provision of patient-centered care). Physicians and PCEs should discuss their responsibilities and the need to hold a single line based on the developed treatment plan when communicating with patients.The stakeholders should agree to use this approach and ensure that patients receive recommendations based on physicians’ decisions and treatment plans. If PCEs (based on patients’ fears, concerns, personal beliefs, and so on) have doubts regarding some choices physicians make, these professionals need to discuss the treatment plan and develop a single communication line. Some training is required for both PCEs and
Society has always been a fundamental institution influencing the development of states. Communicating in groups, people share values, views, and responses to a particular phenomenon. Interaction in communities or clubs cultivates a public attitude to multiple events, forms a lifestyle, and influences politics. For this reason, the changes in civic life are significant for states. Putnam, in his essay “Bowling Alone,” also emphasizes this idea, saying that the social life of the USA collapses, and it is difficult to predict the results of this process. Active engagement in social processes has always been one of the major features peculiar to the country, but the situation has changed. Putnam says that “tens of millions of Americans had forsaken their parents’ habitual readiness to engage in the simplest act of
such as clubs, are replaced by new mass membership organizations. Putnam says they have more political importance and might impact the country; however, they do not promote civic engagement. “For the vast majority of their members, the only act of membership consists in writing a check for dues or perhaps occasionally reading a newsletter” (Putnam 70). This line shows that Putnam is worried about the continuous process of disconnecting community members, who become divided and disengaged. From a long-term perspective, it might result in the collapse of civic life. The results cannot be predicted as the USA has always been a state with strong community relations. That is why Putnam says that if nothing changes, we will bowl alone, isolated from others.
Spend types are important for an organization when deciding on data-driven choices. Spend needs a perfect understanding of spend classes which comprise of direct, indirect, maverick, and tail spend. Another name for direct spend is direct procurement and it revolves around obtaining raw materials and goods required for production. Indirect spending is also referred to as indirect procurement which, can be categorized as operating costs and above costs that cannot be straightly linked with the entire cost of the end product. Maverick spend or maverick buying occurs when acquisitions are made outside of the institution’s attaining plans (S. Sheth et al., 2020). When procurement is not involved in purchasing decisions, chances are lost for price evaluations and deductions while accumulating the risk of acquiescence matters.An intuition can improve
its method of identifying a spending type in purchasing using the following strategies; by working in tandem with investors, obtaining can help reduce maverick spend and discover other opportunities that can help save on the costs. Examining direct and indirect spending is a sourcing approach that can pinpoint areas for cost-savings, expose probable supply dangers or predetermined gaps, and upsurge competencies. Scrutinizing spend analytics of acquisition orders will aid in identifying drifts and zones where enhancements can be applied to influence the buying power.A supplier is an individual or a business that offers products or services to another institution. An organization can use the following strategies to ensure that they improve their methods of identifying suppliers, the institution should ensure that the suppliers they meet for negotiation are
capable of meeting their demanding standards (Avery, 2021). The organization should be open-minded, it should extend its obtaining policies to different parts of the world not just in one region. Evolving and positioning sourcing tactics for conservation, repair, and tasks (MRO) goods and services for a corporation with amenities situated all over the world seems difficult.The integrated approach of buying and selling while sourcing some MRO imports internationally, has helped to identify the best suppliers. UTC, Intel, and other worldwide corporations have achievements with cohesive supply models, where they hire suppliers or other firms to take over the buying process, integrating the provider’s technology with their own. Another vital feature is that the suppliers should depict readiness and capability to provide what they need before making any contracts
For a healthcare organization, maintaining continuous success in a highly competitive and, most importantly, increasingly challenging and strenuous economic setting is a tremendous challenge. Although the Asian Health Services (AHS) has managed to find a niche that has been allowing it to maintain dominance in the market for a while, the current approach has become quite outdated, calling for a change in the strategy. Specifically, what the company called its “Blue Ocean,” namely, a pool of opportunities for strategic marketing and active development, has largely depleted. By focusing on the management of its turnover rates and investing in the professional growth of employees and the expansion of the services, AHS will be able to find a new “Blue Ocean.”The current policy utilized by Ahs seems to be geared
toward sustainability and patient-oriented care. To its credit, the company has managed to introduce an effective strategy for handling financial risks, which is especially notable given the current economic circumstances and the challenges associated with maintaining effective financial performance. However, there are certain issues with the business strategy that AHS has been implementing; particularly, the lack of focus on the factors that shape employee retention and turnover rates should be seen as an important concern. Specifically, the observed trend may signal low levels of content among employees, which may entail a significant drop in performance and, therefore, a drastic loss of service quality. Due to the high levels of competition in the healthcare sector, the failure to maintain its competitive advantage is likely to cause the organization to
ultimately dissipate. Therefore, AHS must revisit its corporate policies, particularly, those aimed at managing AHS’s human resources.In order to develop the much-needed flexibility in risk management and ensure an increase in employee retention rates, AHS will need to shape its approach toward talent management. Specifically, AHS will have to prioritize the needs of its employees, providing additional benefits to staff members. These could include not only financial incentives but also training opportunities, which align with the idea of constant innovation that AHS should pursue to remain relevant. Indeed, studies show that the increase in the range of opportunities provided for staff members, particularly, in regard to the provision of professional development opportunities, affects retention rates positively, reducing the extent of staff turnover (Harris et al., 2020). The observed
change can be explained by the rise in employee loyalty and engagement, as well as the rate of motivation among staff members (Harris et al., 2020). Therefore, the focus on professional development in the target population should eb seen as one of the highlights of the future change within the organization.Furthermore, AHS will have to involve customers into the process of organizational decision-making to increase their sense of importance within the company. Namely, employees should participate actively in shaping the company’s policies and its organizational setting (Azizi et al., 2021). By providing staff members with a strong voice within the corporate context and cementing their impact on the organizational culture, AHS will be able to promote diversity and acceptance in the workplace environment, therefore, making it more acceptable
of employees and their individual needs. Indeed, the existing theories of employee motivation point to the necessity to provide staff members not only with a chance to satisfy their basic needs, but also with the chance of self-actualization (Azizi et al., 2021). Specifically, according to Maslow’s Hierarchy of Needs, the specified requirement constitutes a vital part of effective management of employees’ needs and aspirations, contributing to the overall extent of their enthusiasm and engagement (Kurdi & Alshurideh, 2020). Therefore, the transition to a framework where AHS prioritizes the needs of its staff members as its vital stakeholders must be seen as a central part of the improvement process.The changes outlined above are largely justified by the high level of stakeholder influence that AHS experiences. Being a healthcare organization,
professional development, the specified solution may also be regarded as a framework for investing in the human resources and, thus, introducing another competitive advantage into the organizational setting. The emphasis on employees’ professional growth and the introduction of the respective strategies that will also allow for the launch of incremental innovation and quality improvement within the organization will serve as another “Blue Ocean.” In other words, it will become the basis for the continuous innovation within AHS, being a breath of fresh air for the company’s strategic development.
Ever since the 17th century, the colonies in North America have been home to various ethnicities, including the Hispanic immigrants, who contributed to forming the unique American identity. If to talk about the Hispanic population in the United States, now it concludes more than 60 million people, after the rates of immigration in America skyrocketed during the 20th century. In many cases, immigrants form or join the closed communities, and the people, who live there, are often not adjusted to the environment of the main population. The musical In the Heights , written by Quiara Hudes and Lin-Manuel Miranda, depicts various social problems within the Hispanic community on the example of multiple characters. The authors raise the topics such as homesickness, poverty, which results in a lack of
possibilities, cultural conflicts, and depression among the immigrant youth. Nina Rosario is the daughter of two hard-working immigrants and the first person in her family to go to college.Her story is an excellent example of how a person faces an alien environment and gets depressed because of it. Another good example is Usnavi de la Vega – the story’s narrator. He is experiencing homesickness and feels like an unnatural element of the country’s environment. One of the most discouraging issues for immigrants in the United States is that a person may feel like an alien in a new aggressive and sometimes xenophobic surrounding. Thus, the musical shows that the immigrants remain secluded within their communities, lacking the possibilities and education, and measures must be taken by the government
to give these people a better future.First of all, it is essential to note that the environment, which became home for many Hispanic immigrants, makes them feel rejected. In Nina’s case, she encounters a severe gap between herself and her college mates during her first schooling year. For instance, when she talks with Benny about differences in various Spanish dialects, she proclaims that “they spoke different language at Stanford” (Miranda and Hudes 63). This means that even though she is a good scholar and tries to integrate into American society, she cannot be the natural part of the surrounding environment. As for Usnavi, New York has never been a welcoming place for him compared to his home country – the Dominican Republic (Miranda and Hudes 106). After finding
his bodega looted, Usnavi expresses his sickness towards his home country and decides to travel there (Miranda and Hudes 100). As Peter Debruge says, “In scene after scene, “In the Heights” acknowledges how hard immigrants must work for their place in this country” (69). Thus the newcomers, who want to take their place in the country, almost constantly feel rejected and have to work harder than the average American.In addition, bicultural people conduct a big fraction of the Hispanic population; unfortunately, many of them cannot relate to any culture, thus feeling distressed. The term “bicultural” in this case means that second-generation immigrants represent two ethnic identities – their native culture and the American one (Mancenido et al. 1269). Usnavi and Nina are second-generation immigrants, referred to as bicultural
people (Ragavan and Cowden 243). Therefore, the fact that they are a part of different, and in some cases, opposing cultures serves as a severe stressing factor (Mancenido et al. 1269). The main reason for it is that the individual’s personal perspective may be distorted due to the conflict of opposing values. As a result, these individuals are highly exposed to distress and anxiety since they cannot relate to any of the mentioned communities, most likely feeling foreign and alien.Another critical aspect of the immigrant experience in the United States is the lack of opportunities, connections, and proper education, which leads to ever-increasing crime and poverty rates. For instance, the parents of Nina, neither of whom has any educational degree, praise their daughter for going to college, stressing
how important education is. Not surprisingly, when Nina fails to complete her first schooling year and returns home, her father says that the girl is “useless, like my father before me” (Miranda and Hudes 36). This way, the author shows that the perspectives both in Latin countries and among Latin immigrants in America appear to be quite unpromising. Given the fact that the environment in the United States has tended to be anti-immigrant for more than ten years, migrant communities encounter low social mobility and high poverty rates (Roche et al. 2328). Thus, the whole community is facing a problem of the inability to climb a social ladder to gain a better job or a proper education.Finally, the problem resulting from previously mentioned factors is second-generation immigrants’ skepticism
towards their prospects in society. After losing her scholarship, Nina is unsure about her being able to gain a proper education to find a suitable job and ensure a bright future. She proclaims that “maybe she should have just stayed home” (Miranda and Hudes 19). This is the author’s way of showing that immigrants’ youth sometimes display incertitude about their future due to the surrounding poverty and xenophobic society. The studies show that higher social optimism has been connected with the economic status of the young person’s family (Roche et al. 2329). Therefore, the rates of optimism are relatively low among Hispanic immigrants in the United States (Roche et al. 2329). Thus, second-generation immigrants often lack the optimism needed to cope with various difficulties and barriers.There is a
clear need to improve the current living conditions of immigrants and the representatives of ethnic minorities; it is important to make the surrounding environment less aggressive, offering more working and education opportunities. Many people, who came to the United States from developing countries to find a better job (Klasen et al. 265). Although they sought opportunities, they did not gain any of them. The country operates as a closed environment. Therefore, any newcomer will be pushed away from education or even citizenship due to the lack of money or connections. Thus, it is important to focus on raising the number of community colleges. Community college is an alternative to standard higher educational facilities (Leo et al. 2). In addition, it is possible to expand the system of scholarship
grants to provide capable students with proper education. Giving a first-generation immigrant a feasible opportunity to obtain citizenship is another way of addressing the mentioned issues (Roche et al. 2336). This will provide the communities with a confident outlook on their future in the country, as well as give them the possibility to find an adequately paid job.Integration of the immigrants in the society is one of the essential needs of the government, especially that of the bilingual and bicultural people. The representative of the minority rarely associates himself and his culture with the country he lives in (Mancenido et al. 1269). In this case, the government must undertake several actions to improve the situation. For example, it is possible to promote biliteracy on a state level. This
way, the student will have an opportunity to achieve proficiency in two or more languages, including English and his native language. As a result, the bicultural people will understand that they represent two unique cultures and that they are accepted in both environments. Citizenship is another factor of a person’s integration into society. It allows an individual to take part in the country’s political life and offers him a possibility to invite his family members to live in the United States. More importantly, a citizen cannot be deported; the individual understands that the country cannot be hostile towards him. Thus, an immigrant, integrated into society no longer considers himself a foreigner; he feels a commitment towards his new country.Finally, there is a need to address the issue of
skepticism and depression among the immigrant youth by providing them with an understanding that they have various social possibilities regardless of their level of income. It is essential to understand that many young second-generation immigrants displayed higher levels of optimism towards their future when they were provided with social programs, for example with community college scholarships (Roche et al. 2336). This means that the offered possibilities provide individuals with a more optimistic approach. The government might also aim at reducing the levels of marginalization of Latin American adolescents (Roche et al. 2336). It is important to promote group therapy facilities to individuals with social anxiety and depression. This way, an adolescent can gain support from the representatives of his community as well as learn how to maintain an
on with her life and do anything possible to prosper in the future (Miranda and Hudes 133). As for Usnavi, he understands that he belongs to the place where he lives (Miranda and Hudes 153). This story gives a reader an understanding of how important it is to give possibilities and hope for a better future to any individual, who came to the United States to seek opportunities.
The word “inclusion” comes from the verb “include” (of French origin and means “to contain, to include, to embrace, to have in its composition.” Nowadays, this word is becoming a term that reflects essentially a new view not only of education but also of a person’s place in society. Inclusion is the central idea of the development of modern education, affecting profound social and value changes in our society. Inclusion is based on the idea of an inclusive society. It means that any person (of a different race, religion, culture, or person with disabilities) can include in public relations. Inclusion should promote the interests of all members of society, despite their limited physical capabilities, to ensure equality of their rights in all types of activities.The idea of inclusion
arose within the framework of large-scale changes in understanding human rights, dignity, and identity. The change in attitudes towards people with disabilities has become just one of the manifestations of these changes. The ideology of inclusion (inclusive society) forms because of awareness of the value of human diversity and differences between people. The introduction of inclusion is possible only based on the principles of democratization and in the absence of discrimination on any basis.Inclusivity is the process of meeting the diverse needs of all students and responding to them by increasing participation in learning and communities and reducing the number of cases of rejection and exclusion from schools. There are several essential stages and significant events in the evolution of inclusive education. Until about 1965, the “medical model”
operated mainly. In the education process, children with disabilities were placed in special schools and boarding schools (Ramel, 2020). In response to the isolation of children with severe health conditions, voices began to be heard in countries focused on the democratic foundations of society, calling for reforming the entire system and making it more humane.The search for ways of joint education begins, conducted in parallel in European countries (Scandinavian countries), the USA, and Japan. If integration begins to be carried out in Scandinavia mainly in a normative and practical way, then in the USA, its implementation is preceded by pedagogical searches and experiments. The concept of normalization, adopted in the USA and Canada, emphasized education in the spirit of cultural norms accepted in the society in which a
person lives. It was the beginning of the civil rights movement for those previously excluded from society, including people with disabilities. The economic, technological, and information capabilities of Europe, the USA, and Japan have made it possible to create a parallel educational environment. The mass education system for the implementation of inclusive education, along with the existing particular education system.In addition, the urban infrastructure was made as accessible as possible for people with disabilities, information, and other barriers that limited the opportunities for this category of population to participate in social life remove. This period is associated with integrating children with developmental disabilities into the environment of ordinary peers (Ramel, 2020). Gradually, the concept of normalization began to appear not perfect; integration began to be defined as “positive
discrimination.”The end of the 80s of the last century was marked by the adoption of several international documents that contribute to changes in attitudes toward children with disabilities. In 1989, the UN General Assembly unanimously adopted the Convention on the Rights of the Child, signed by 193 countries to date. It was followed in 1994 by another significant event. Under the auspices of UNESCO, a World Conference on the Education of Persons with Special Needs was held in Salamanca (Spain). The term “inclusion” was introduced into international use, and the principle of inclusive education proclaim. The Declaration of the conference stated that every child has the right to education and should be able to receive and maintain an acceptable level of knowledge; every child has unique characteristics, interests,
When doctors in the United States first discovered patients with an unknown disease affecting internal organs in 1981, they did not yet know that a virus caused it. Healthy young males suddenly began to develop illnesses that had previously been found in premature newborn infants and or due to the birth of sick children. Doctors determined that these young men’s reduced immunity was not congenital but was acquired in adulthood. That is why the disease was called AIDS – acquired immune deficiency syndrome – for the first few years after it was discovered. Only years later, it was discovered that AIDS was only a late stage of HIV infection when those infected with HIV develop serious, potentially fatal lesions.In the 1980s, no one knew for sure that HIV
could cause AIDS in 10 years or even 20 years after infection. To be sure of this, doctors had to observe patients with HIV infection for the whole 20 years. Therefore, some impatient scientists in the 1980s denied the role of HIV in the development of AIDS (Cisneros, 2021). As time has shown, their theories about the origin of AIDS were wrong. Since the beginning of the epidemic, scientists’ main goal has been to develop effective methods of preventing and treating HIV infection. However, despite the obviousness of the HIV problem, there are people who question its existence. The HIV denialism movement, which emerged almost immediately after the discovery of the disease and its identification as the cause of AIDS, actively promotes anti-scientific hypotheses about the absence of
both the virus itself and the connection between HIV and AIDS.Such misinformation can be detrimental both to the organization of prevention efforts in general and to the direct health of individuals who, given false reports, may refuse treatment. It is known that the South African government has used AIDS denialism to justify its inaction in the HIV response, which has resulted in South Africa now having the highest HIV prevalence in the world.As a result of adhering to the position of denial, patients refuse to start the antiretroviral therapy they need, stop the treatment they are already on, do not undergo the necessary examinations. The HIV infection progresses, secondary diseases develop, which in most cases end in the patient’s death. In addition, people who adopt a position of
denial ignore the need to comply with measures to prevent HIV transmission, which leads to the spread of the epidemic. During treatment, a health care practitioner may be guided by stereotypes and fail to take into account the individual course of a patient’s illness, thereby failing to provide appropriate therapy.In the 1980s, HIV infection was commonly associated with injecting drug use and promiscuity. It was more convenient for the public to say that this infection was spread only among disadvantaged populations than to acknowledge the magnitude of the problem. Certainly, this prejudice could not help but affect how effective the measures to spread the disease have been. Family members of those infected told of ruined relationships with loved ones and acquaintances. Stigmatizing patients will only worsen their recovery
process because it will be harder for them to report the illness and seek medical help (Stangl et al., 2019). Prejudice and fear of being infected with HIV in a hospital spread extremely close. The groups most at risk of getting sick are the hardest to reach for any form of prevention work, whether it be testing, treatment, or education. The stigmatization of certain populations is a serious barrier to seeking care in formal medical and other institutions (Puddifoot, 2019). Stereotypes against people with HIV hastens the progression of the disease and worsens its outcomes by making untimely medical attention available to those who are ill.Regarding the situation of HIV patients in the 1980s, it is appropriate to analyze cognitive theory according to which stereotypes are cognitive schemes
In 2020, the pandemic forced the government to pass the Families First Coronavirus Response Act (the FFCRA) and the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security Act (CARES). The policies affected the private health coverage use in the national attempt to maximize the accessibility of COVID-19 diagnostic testing and treatment. The Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) and the Departments of Labor and the Treasury developed a set of regulations to make Americans benefit from their insurance and receive essential coronavirus-related services at no cost (The 116th Congress, 2020). The policy can be viewed as beneficial for the collective good; however, tensions between the public impact and individual rights occurred. Indeed Saleh et al. (2021) claim that “to ensure a more efficient implementation of the policies produced, all
of these aspects should involve the participation of different stockholders, undertaking transparency, and taking cultural differences into account” (p. 649918). This paper aims to explain how COVID-19 healthcare policies caused tensions between individual rights and the collective good and discuss their legal and ethical considerations.The FFCRA and the CARES Acts became the earliest response of the US government to the COVID-19 outbreak as the urge to enforce the healthcare system occurred with the rapidly growing incidence. The most prominent update addressed the taxpayers’ money and private insurance revision to retrieve additional funding for hospitals and make supporting payouts for citizens (Khullar et al., 2020). Furthermore, such populations as the impoverished and the elderly were at a higher risk of facing severe consequences, enabling the legislators to create effective
diagnosis, prevention, and treatment measures (Young et al., 2020). The actions helped the administration develop the $175 billion emergency fund to serve the collective good of addressing the COVID-19 challenge (Khullar et al., 2020). The pandemic’s public health Acts caused tension between individual rights and the collective interest because legislation addressed the issues of an average citizen, while the American nation is exceptionally diverse. Consequently, multiple populations, families, and communities experienced difficulties receiving the high-quality health care they legally deserved.Public health has a greater authority over an individual’s rights in terms of national healthcare; thus, policymakers consider it the primary beneficiary. Legal considerations of the FFCRA and the CARES Acts address the groups with specific socioeconomic statuses, states, or organizations, yet no legislative regulation is developed for individuals
(Kanter et al., 2021). Consequently, in the case if, for instance, an individual with severe diabetes conditions seeks additional insurance coverage or urgent help, they might face rejection if the request disrupts the COVID-19 response program.An organization’s priority for addressing the pandemic might be legally and socially explainable; however, it disrupts the medical ethics principles. Indeed, beneficence must enable a healthcare provider to help a patient in need, and non-maleficence must allow them to do no harm and take action to decrease the possible hurting (Bodenheimer & Grumbach, 2020). Then, the concept of justice requires equally fair treatment (Bodenheimer & Grumbach, 2020). The inability of a person with severe chronic conditions to receive timely assistance during the pandemic disrupts the three ethical principles described above, making the recent
Introduction: Drug SentencingThe crack cocaine epidemic has influenced modern sentencing for drug possession or selling due to the severity of the situation at the time. However, the current conditions portray the inefficiency of the system when it comes to combating drug-related problems on a national scale. Instead, the same disparities related to over-policing still affect certain ethnicities and races, the LGBT minority, and people with a record of mental illnesses. The over-policing of vulnerable demographics leads to a dispersed system in which certain communities are more prone to being legislatively punished for the same offense. Needless to say, the crack cocaine epidemic in the 80s and 90s led to the militarization of the police since there were many counter-drug operations that needed more severe approaches.Factors Creating Inequality in
the Legal SystemThere are several factors that create such inequality in the legislative system. The inequity is evident since the people incarcerated for drugs are primarily represented by minorities such as African Americans, LGBT representatives, people with mental illnesses, and other vulnerable populations. In order for the problem to be mitigated, it is essential to consider all the aspects that lead to such outcomes. First, the legislative system itself was and still is centered around punishing drug offenses instead of preventing them. Moreover, certain groups are being marginalized from how they are being judged to how they are treated in prison. Police officers are often biased when detaining suspects, and corrections officers ignore the injustice that affects these individuals, which is why the rate of incarcerations and remissions
is so high.Marginalized GroupsIt is certain that specific demographics were targeted as primary offenders during the war on drugs. However, as the crack cocaine epidemic has mutated into an opioid epidemic, the same minorities remained the most often incarcerated for drug possession. According to researchers, communities of color are disproportionally represented in the category of people sentenced for drug offenses, which is one of the outcomes of the crack epidemic (Charity, 2017). Moreover, research examining the topic has concluded that the LGBT community is also disproportionately affected by drug use and, thus, sentences related to such offenses (Haeder et al., 2021). Last but not least, a study has shown that around 50% of all incarcerated people deal with mental illnesses (Frankham, 2018). Based on this evidence, it is
inevitable that drug-related charges have been primarily represented through the imprisonment of minorities, a factor that has not been mitigated since.Sharanda JonesA case that has been circulating in the media due to the illustration of unfair policing is Sharanda Jones’ incarceration. Jones was sentenced to life in prison in the late 90s for a non-violent first drug offense (Rosen, 2021). The situation is direct evidence of the biased policing field decision-making since Sharanda Jones, an African American woman, has not been involved in any illegal activity prior to the one in question. The life sentence is evidently an overly strict punishment for a non-violent offense. However, the racial bias may have been why Jones was incarcerated and then sentenced so harshly. It is essential to point out that
the discrimination has not been illustrated by the police officers but rather by the court system overall in this particular situation. Thus, it is vital to examine the multi-layered system, which starts with field decisions.Field DecisionsThe legislation itself primarily impacts field decisions. Thus, police officers investigate cases based on the guidelines implemented on a state and federal level. However, there is a level of bias when it comes to how the situations are dealt with. There are multiple reasons why this may be the case. One of them is the lack of diversity among law enforcement officers. A lack of diversity can lead to disproportionate incarcerations of particular groups that are not represented among police officers. Moreover, another essential factor is targeting specific populations without looking at the
broader picture. Thus, communities that are statistically less likely to have high incomes or access to high-level education are vulnerable to being involved in illegal activities. Instead of implementing prevention measures and confronting the core of the problem, the field decisions are based on the outcomes.Courts DecisionsLaw enforcement is a multi-layered entity, which is why it is crucial to address the multitude of actors within the system. Courts are the tools used to decide whether one deserves punishment and how harsh it should be. Based on Sharanda Jones’ case, it is certain that a life sentence was not only facilitated by the system itself but also the bias that has led to such results. First, it has to be mentioned that there are discrepancies when it comes to
the individual’s socioeconomic status. Jones’ financial situation did not allow her to hire a good lawyer that would perhaps be able to minimize the sentence and successfully represent the client in court. Moreover, researchers illustrate that even death sentences are predominately given to black inmates (Shestak & Goncharova, 2020). Also, courts are more likely to sentence people with mental illnesses and LGBT representatives, as mentioned prior, which also refers to the bias of the system.CorrectionsPolice officers, judges, and attorneys are not the only people affecting vulnerable populations. It is also vital to point out some of the factors that directly influence the individuals sentenced to prison times. In terms of female prisons, oftentimes, male corrections officers engage in unethical behavior (Stern, 2018). Moreover, transgender women often have to
serve their sentences in male prisons, which puts them at high risk of sexual assault (Jenness et al., 2019). Currently, prisons cannot provide the necessary care for pregnant women, disabled people, and those with mental illnesses. Moreover, since drugs are a major part of why people are being incarcerated, inmates are unable to self-medicate and cannot access adequate resources to combat phycological disorders. Such circumstances are often a result of oversight and the lack of intentions to change the situation for the better.What If?If Sharanda Jones were a white, wealthy woman without the need to provide care for a paralyzed mother, the situation would have been different. As Jones’ offense was a no-violent one, and the individual in question had no prior problems with the police, the police
officers, judges, and attorneys would undoubtedly be keen to facilitate a much less harsh sentence. The argument is not that a person willing to engage in drug use cannot impose any danger on society. However, the measures with which such people are dealt with only create a dispersed environment with a lack of equal opportunities for all. Jones’ vulnerable societal position facilitated by racial ethnicity, income, and family situation led to negative outcomes. If Sharanda was a part of the majority and the law enforcement would not have reasons for bias, it is certain that Sharanda would not have received the same punishment.DiversityWhile diversity is not evidently linked to the inequality which is suggested by the rate of people incarcerated for drug-related offenses, it has a major role.
Law enforcement is not proportionally diverse compared to society as a whole, which has several adverse outcomes. First, it may create a hostile environment in which bias is not considered a negative factor but rather an undisputed reality. Moreover, a diverse workforce may lead to an improved culture of the entity. Thus, law enforcement officers who are not operating in a diverse environment cannot achieve the same cultural will to maintain a reputation of a safe, lawful, and fair organization. Furthermore, a lack of diversity may facilitate the lack of insight when it comes to how different communities operate and the factors that have to be confronted to create equal opportunities.StatisticsStatistics show the disparities when it comes to the employees operating in the legal system. White men are
certainly the most represented in law enforcement. Specifically, out of all the males, 67% are Caucasian. Moreover, there is a major difference between the number of women and men working in law enforcement. Statistics show that out of all the workers, 700,000 are male, and 120,000 are female, which is not representative of society. Another essential difference is illustrated in the income. Men earn more than $71,000, while women make less than $64,000 (Data USA, 2021). Such a big difference in salaries illustrates that women have lower-paying jobs in law enforcement. The findings suggest why more males are willing to apply for a job in the system and how come there are such enormous disparities in numbers.Areas that Need Diversity ReformsDiversity has to become an area of focus
since law enforcement is a direct representation of society. However, the system did not effectively mirror society for the reasons highlighted earlier. There is a need for gender equality and equity since the rate of females in this particular area is much less significant compared to the number of males. Moreover, the differences in income also suggest the current lack of gender equity. Another area that needs improvement is ethnic and racial representation. By enrolling more representatives of minorities, the risk of reoccurring bias will be minimized, and the entire system will become fairer in terms of incarcerations and sentencing. Thus, diversity is a vital subject that has to be confronted in order for people such as Sharanda Jones to receive adequate punishment instead of life sentences for
courts are biased when sentencing people, and the prisons do not adequately address those serving the sentences. The whole system is designed in a way that the environment becomes negative and does not facilitate fairness but instead creates more precedents that continue the cycle. One way of mitigating the adverse outcomes is implementing a more diverse workplace. This would confront some of the challenges connected to inequality and ultimately contribute to a more equal, fair, and equitable system in which each person is treated equally.
The article discusses infection of the periprosthetic joint as one of the most devastating complications resulting from total knee arthroplasty. Prevention of PJI aims to reduce the number of complications, which is 1% of 42 cases. In this regard, the effect of the combination of vancomycin powder and dilute povidone-iodine lavage on reducing PJI in patients at high risk of arthroplasty was examined. Thus, this combination increased the success rates of successful irrigation, debridement, and liner replacement in treating wounded PJI.Although the US has a low incidence of PJI, it accounts for about half of the readmissions for all total joint arthroplasties. Moreover, the article notes that PJI significantly reduces satisfaction and life expectancy. With the further spread of the infection, significant resources must be devoted to preventing,
detecting, and treating PJI. Thus, endoprosthetic infections are an important area in which there can be no over-budgeting and new avenues of treatment.The article suggests that a study and protocol that includes topical vancomycin powder and diluted povidone-iodine lavage can significantly reduce the incidence of early PJI. Thus, the risk of early infection following a primary TKA may be reduced regardless of the identified preoperative risk. This protocol confirmed a statistically significant risk reduction when using the powder. Therefore, a clinically relevant study of relatively reduced risk in PJI should be considered when widely used, especially in centers with high infection rates.In addition, the reduced rates are economically significant for centers involved in value care. However, the data are still uncertain; the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention
(CDC) recommends applying antimicrobial powder to surgical incisions due to a lack of definitive clinical data. However, the World Health Organization (WHO) has suggested using the powder before wound closure. Thus, the study described in the article proves that the combination of vancomycin and povidone-iodine lavage may be a more effective system. This conclusion is based on the fact that the mixture is a relatively readily available antiseptic material for areas of surgical incisions. Therefore, although the powder’s effectiveness is not yet proven, the study shows a reduced risk of orthopedic arthroplasty infections.Total joint replacement can be called one of the most frequently performed procedures in the field of orthopedic surgery. Over time, the need for expected replacement increases, leading to more associated complications. The article describes the
need to reduce postoperative complications by preventing infections by involving patients in understanding and targeted action on actual and potential risk factors. Thus, there is an increased need for risk reduction for a more successful postoperative recovery.The most common modifiable risk factors are obesity, anemia, and malnutrition. These factors account for approximately 80% of patients at risk, including diabetes. To prevent these factors and prevent their impact on postoperative recovery, it is necessary to conduct preoperative screening. Other factors requiring these measures include Staphylococcus aureus, tobacco or alcohol dependence, depression, recent medication, and possibly cardiovascular disease. Moreover, elderly patients should be especially carefully examined. This is because some risk factors occur in people over 64 years of age, whose stay in the hospital is a more extended period.
A prolonged hospital stay may be an independent factor in PJI, resulting in a mortality rate five times higher than in younger patients.A prolonged hospital stay may be an independent factor in PJI, resulting in a mortality rate five times higher than in younger patients. In this case, obesity and diabetes require a more protracted intervention in the preoperative screening of the patient. To be medically effective, screenings should be performed 2-6 weeks before surgery to allow sufficient time for intervention and treatment, including antibiotics. Patients with more than one risk factor are most susceptible to the onset and development of PJI. Thus, the article considers the definition of risk factors that can be modified and eliminated before surgery.All patients who have undergone TRA are prone to complications
and are at risk; however, the article suggests predisposing factors. In-depth training and timely intervention play an essential role in optimizing patients before surgery. Moreover, patients requiring reoperation also require critical follow-up regardless of screening results before the first operation. Thus, the article confirms the importance of preoperative screening to identify risk factors before TRA. Additionally, awareness can help improve infection prevention among patients with risk factors.Joint replacement is a last resort but proven effective intervention to help people with severe osteoarthritis. The intervention restores the physical function of the joints, and people feel full. However, the risk of infections is one of the most severe complications in joint replacement. Prevention of SSI consists of multifactorial interventions that may include risks associated with the environment, the surgeon, and
the patient. The SSI organ space is hazardous and occurs in the 1 to 2.4% THA range. In this regard, infection prevention is essential for successful recovery.Factors that can be influenced include the conditions in the operating room, surgical hand-tipping before and during surgery, and the use of cemented prostheses that contain antibiotics. However, there are no reliable studies on the superiority of one factor over another. Therefore, only some measures to prevent infection are based on the solid evidence base. The article describes the results of observing the relationship between some variables and SSI risk.Infections associated with a joint replacement procedure can lead to severe morbidity and severe healthcare costs. Thus, infection control is one of the main components of prevention. This approach can reduce SSI rates
Two Uses of ICT at HomeICT has a variety of utilities, and it has proved relevant in the home environment. In the home environment, it is used for social media access. Currently, people can communicate and interact with others in the comfort of their homes. Another good use of social media is when it is used for business. ICT now enables people to order goods via e-commerce platforms, and these products are delivered to their home addresses. Similarly, people can also run their online businesses from their homes while paying their bills.Key Skills needed to use ICTThe main E-Mail management skills relevant to ICT include word processing, e-mail management, electronic media presentation, website design, database management, web navigation, spreadsheets, and camera usage skills.Three differences between a smartphone and
a tabletThe first difference is that tablets have relatively larger screens than smartphones. Secondly, smartphones are more portable than tablets because of their smaller size, which makes them easier to carry. Thirdly, the tablet is designed to offer more entertainment perks. For instance, they have larger screens to provide better capabilities for watching movies and playing mobile games.Five ways to improve the format of word-processed academic reports/essaysThe first consideration is choosing the word processor that one is most comfortable using to ensure that the written content will be presented is of superior quality. The second thing is to clearly understand what to write after a session of brainstorming relevant ideas. All ideas should be presented formally, as it is a requirement in academic writing. Thirdly, it is imperative
to understand how to utilize the preferred word processor effectively to present work that follows all the instructions of academic writing, including good grammar, punctuation, font size, and line and paragraph spacing, among others. The fourth way to improve the format of word-processed academic reports is to use the correct vocabulary and to ensure all words are used correctly.There are useful features that are availed by word processors, such as the synonym option, which can help people to use numerous variations of words. The translate feature is also relevant to help users understand the proper meaning of words. The fifth way to improve the format of academic content on word processors is to use online tools to make requisite corrections on writing and ensure that all written content
is grammatically correct.Three health problems caused by computers and how to avoid themOne of the prevalent health issues caused by computers is eye intricacies. Computers tend to emit light that tends to affect their users. Therefore, computer users should control the amount of light their computer screens emit to ensure it does not affect their optical health. Extended usage of computers has caused headaches among a significant number of computer users. The only way to prevent consistent headaches associated with computer usage is to limit the time people use computers. The third health problem caused by computer use is a pain in the back, shoulders, and neck. The remedy for this issue is for people to own proper furniture that will help to maintain the right posture when
working on their computers (Barnat, 2018).Characters that passwords should have to make them more secureOne of the fundamental things to be assertive about when creating passwords is to avoid predictable alphanumeric strings that people can easily guess. For example, some prevalent passwords are date of birth and digits like 1234 or 1111. Therefore, it is important to make sure that passwords have many characters as they tend to reduce the probability for malicious people to hack passwords and gain unauthorized access (Jančis, 2022). On that note, the optimal solution is combining uppercase letters with lowercase letters and using numbers and punctuation characters. For instance, a password such as “abyss” would be made more secure by adding extra characters to make it “The_Abyss001!”Someone in your class says they have
forgotten their password to access their university account. Why should you not let them use your credentials?It would be irrational to give such individual personal credentials because computer systems are strategically designed with security systems that enable users to change their passwords if they forget them. Therefore, this should be the solution for people who lose their passwords as opposed to borrowing these credentials. Secondly, it is a common rule of thumb in cyber security to ensure access credentials are only limited to the account user. Shared accounts are perilous because it makes it difficult to know who the responsible party is when malicious people access the account.Four sectors of society where computers are highly usedOne of the sectors in that computers have proved most useful is the
banking sector, which enables people to deposit and access their money ubiquitously. Another sector is the field of telecommunication, where people can communicate even when they are located thousands of miles away from each other. The medical field has also embraced computers through sophisticated systems that collect, store and analyze patient information. Government institutions also use computer systems to store information and to keep it safe and confidential. The corporate world also has a massive application of computer systems to carry out various tasks.The advantages and disadvantages of using zoomThe advantage of using zoom is its ability to accommodate many people, as it can handle up to 500 people (Simon, 2021). Secondly, people can be in different locations to have a successful zoom meeting. It also has a
Injury prevention is believed to be a strategy for avoiding or reducing the severity of bodily injuries caused by external factors such as collisions. Injury prevention is a part of safety and public health procedures, with the objective of improving population health by diminishing injuries and thereby enhancing the quality of life. Injury prevention tactics encompass a wide range of measures, several of which are categorized as components of injury prevention, including education, engineering improvements, and policy regulation and enactment. One of the dangerous types of general injuries that can have significant negative consequences on human health is falls. Under normal conditions, falls of varying severity are dangerous accidents that cause damage to physical health. However, the risks of complications and fatal outcomes increase in proportion to the
age of the person. This occurs since older adults, in this case, aged from 65, due to numerous health chronic diseases, have weakened immunity and body resistance. In order to resolve the relevant problem of falls in older adults, it is necessary to create educational programs for training specialists and collaborative networks for improving the effectiveness of service provision.The health results of a set of people, including the dispersion of those consequences within the group, are referred to as population health. It is considered to be a method of health care that attempts to enhance the health of a significant number of individuals (Lantz, 2019). It is possible to state that population health is compiled of three separate parts, including health outcomes, variations of health protective factors, and
policies and treatments. The population health idea shifts the focus away from the individual paradigm, which is typical of much conventional medicine. Population health attempts to supplement traditional public health initiatives by addressing a larger variety of issues that have been found to affect the health of various groups.In this situation, it is impossible to deny the existence of danger from falls among the elderly, as well as to ignore their negative consequences since statistics demonstrate the relevance of the problem. Unintentional injuries are the sixth largest cause of mortality in the elderly, with falls accounting for the majority of these deaths (Burns & Kakara, 2018). Each year, approximately one in every four United States of America citizens over the age of 65, older people, falls, and fall-related
emergency hospital appointments are reported to be over three million per year (Burns & Kakara, 2018). Therefore, it is feasible to emphasize the importance of discussing the issue of falls from the perspective of population health and governmental healthcare authorities since the effects are believed to be numerous.What concerns the state or city level, it is obligatory to depict the conditions and the statistical data in terms of the state of New Jersey. Utilizing the partially attributable proportion technique, the state of New Jersey has one of the highest projected all-payer medical cost for older adult falls (Haddad et al., 2019). Analyzing the reports from various American states, New Jersey is considered to be the state having the greatest number of older adult fall hospitalizations and subsequent complications,
losing exclusively to Florida and New York (Haddad et al., 2019). Consequently, it can be concluded that the city of New Jersey, as part of the state, is located in the risk group among the other American regions. Thus, compared to different parts of the country, people, especially older adults, possess increased chances of obtaining health-related issues due to the problem of falls. The statistics and cases from the state of New Jersey require additional examinations and decision-making procedures since the region depicts leading positions among the negative consequences of fall injuries.Evaluating the danger of falls and discussing the issue, it is essential to highlight the presence of mortality rates which illustrate the demographic situation and demonstrate the number of deadly accidents. Considering the state level of the
issue, from 2007 to 2016, the total rate of older adult fatalities due to falls increased by 31% nationwide (Burns & Kakara, 2018). Referring to the average annual percentage change, a substantial increase in mortality rates from falls in older adults was determined in the state of New Jersey (Burns & Kakara, 2018). As reported in the statistical data researchers, the mortality rates, also concerning the state of New Jersey, remain high and underline certain risks for the age group. At the same time, it is important to note that in terms of trends, both national and state data sets depict negative development due to the increasing numbers of fatal falls among the elderly.Healthy People 2020 is a declaration of public healthcare objectives aimed at identifying the most
serious avoidable health concerns and setting national targets to mitigate them. The major goal of the Healthy People 2020 program for the topic of falls in older adults can be defined as strengthening older individuals’ wellness, mobility, and quality of life ( Older Adults , 2020). What concerns the overview, the number of elderly individuals is rising at an extraordinary rate as Americans live longer; in 2014, 14.5% of the United States population was 65 or older ( Older Adults , 2020). The objectives of the program include helping millions of individuals retain their autonomy and wellbeing and assisting older adults with injuries in efficiently managing their conditions and accepting the responsibility of their health ( Older Adults , 2020). In general, Healthy People 2020 is a national
government’s preventative initiative for creating a healthy community.Considering the population level prevention and health promotion review, it is essential to mention several population-based health education interventions that will help the group of older adults. Firstly, the collaboration with the Center for Disease Control and the use of technologies and instructional resources can assist medical professionals in helping individuals reduce their chance of falling ( Older Adults , 2020). Moreover, evidence-based falls avoidance and prevention strategies performed in social settings by aging services and other local agencies are supported by the Administration for Community Living ( Older Adults , 2020). Finally, nurses or nursing assistants are being assessed as potential falls care practitioners by the National Institute on Aging and the Patient-Centered Outcomes Research Institute ( Older Adults ,
the issue of falls in older adults from the perspective of population health and governmental authorities since the effects are believed to be numerous. The statistics and cases from the state of New Jersey require additional examinations and decision-making procedures since the region depicts leading positions among the negative consequences of fall injuries. The objectives of the Healthy People 2020 program include helping millions of individuals retain their autonomy and wellbeing and assisting older adults with injuries in efficiently managing their conditions and accepting the responsibility of their health. The interventions and practical measures in the problem of falls include the elaboration of educational programs for medical specialists and the creation of professional collaborative approaches.
One of the most critical factors of breast cancer development is heredity since it causes a genetically inherent disease. If the patient’s closest relatives have been diagnosed with breast cancer, a tumor’s likelihood is high even at a young age (Coleman & Tsongalis, 2016). Since one of the patient’s close relatives had this disease, this diagnosis is indeed possible for her as well. Another significant factor in developing cancer is various diseases of the mammary glands, for example, “cystic” breasts. In the presence of such conditions, the formation of atypical cells is possible in the mammary gland (Tkaczuk et al., 2016). This can lead to their overgrowth and increase the risk of more severe diseases.The hormonal factor also has a critical influence on health. In the described case,
can be no metastasis in the patient’s organs. However, early active metastasis is characteristic of aggressive forms of cancer. There are multiple ways to determine them, and it is necessary to use some of them in any case to avoid future health problems. Histological analysis of tissue can determine the aggressiveness of the cancer type at an early stage. Breast cancer metastases detected by CT or scintigraphy indicate secondary foci in the lungs, liver, bones, and brain. It must be remembered that in breast cancer, metastases are capable of long-term existence in a latent state, even five to ten years after removal of the primary tumor.
Over the past years, the idea behind the treatment process has shifted its focus towards the holistic approach to care that encompasses both primary care, treatment intervention, management, and post-discharge follow-up. Moreover, the number of specialists simultaneously involved in the treatment process has increased drastically. A prime example of such an innovative healthcare model is the introduction of the perioperative surgical home (PSH) system. The model itself is introduced by the American Society of Anesthesiologists (ACA), and it stands for “patient-centric, team-based model of care created … to help meet the demands of a rapidly approaching health care paradigm that will emphasize value, patient satisfaction, and reduced costs” (Elhassan et al., 2019). Essentially, the model was outlined by the professional medical community as a means of reducing costs
includes surgeons, anesthesiologists, nurses, preoperative staff, pharmacists, information technology specialists, laboratory staff, and social services (Elhassan et al., 2019). Such an extensive collaboration of professionals accounts for quality patient outcomes for a number of reasons. These benefits include better pain management, a significantly lower risk of readmission, and a shorter length of stay (Bergman, 2019). On the other hand, such a model is beneficial for the providers, as timely and efficient collaboration accounts for saving treatment costs, providing better care, and securing more hospital beds due to reduced length of patient stay. For this reason, it may be concluded that the introduction of PSH is a promising approach to the renovation of health care and presenting more quality services to the community.
The Second World War (1939-1945) was a major economic disaster. However, the integration of countries and their desire to regain economic potential was strong. As a result, some countries like the USA, Japan, and Western Europe have managed to restore their economies, which significantly contributed to global economic development (Frieden, 2020). In this answer, the USA, Japan, England, and France will be discussed to revive their financial power.The USA is the only country whose economy emerged from the Second World War much stronger. Moreover, during the war years, the country’s national income doubled. After the war, the United States accounted for 60% of industrial production, two-thirds of the gold reserves, and one-third of the exports of the capitalist world (Frieden, 2020). Gross National Product (GNP) index The US
has increased, while technological superiority, the highest labor productivity, and many profits have made it possible to finance new investments both at home and abroad.Other countries occupy a special place in the post-war foreign economic policy of the United States. In its relations with this region, the United States moved from patronage to a relationship of relative equality in the post-war period. In the first post-war decades, the leading position of the United States in the global capitalist economy was indisputable (Frieden, 2020). But the economic rise of Western Europe and the industrial breakthrough of Japan have significantly changed this situation.The new challenges facing the state were reflected in the program “New Frontiers” by J. Kennedy in the early 60s. A group of neoliberal economists developed the program.
It provided a consistent course to balance the supply of goods and services and aggregate demand to ensure continuous balanced economic growth. In January 1981, Reagan became President of the United States (Frieden, 2020). His monetary policy, dubbed “Reaganomics,” was a variant of the neoconservative policy in all developed capitalist countries throughout the 80s and 90s. At the end of the 80s, the US economy entered a period of a sharp slowdown in growth. American experts have no consensus on the decline in labor productivity growth and the lag in this indicator from Japan and Western European countries. The United States is inferior to Japan and almost all Western European countries regarding GNP per capita.After the end of the war, the Japanese economy was almost destroyed. Losses amounted
to up to 20 percent of the country’s pre-war wealth. The government, however, took steps that allowed the economy to get back on track in a reasonably short time and even lay the foundation for a future Japanese miracle. Nevertheless, industrial and financial associations held significant economic and political resources in their hands. The GDP growth rate in the 50s reached 14.9%, the economy developed rapidly, and high growth rates were maintained due to a high rate of accumulation (Frieden, 2020). Hence, its GDP was better than ever before, and it was a salvation for the country.Immediately after the end of the war, agrarian reform was carried out, which eliminated large landholdings and gave impetus to developing capitalist relations in the Japanese hinterland. In addition, consumer demand has
significantly expanded. Until the 90s, it was possible to observe a gradual slowdown in economic growth, which began after the oil crises in the early 70s (Frieden, 2020). The Japanese miracle remained a memory after a one-time four-fold increase in world oil prices broke out, and a long-term downward trend of dynamics was established.During the war years, Great Britain lost its national wealth as well. Industrial production decreased by 10%, while the UK’s share of world exports declined from 11.3% in 1937 to 9.8% in 1947. The economy of the British Empire after the Second World War weakened not only because of the natural consequences for the belligerent country but also as a result of the gradual collapse of the colonial system.In the post-war period, the Labor government
developed a revival program for the future. A specific role in the economic recovery of England was played by its accession to the Marshall Plan in 1948, receiving food supplies and cash loans following it. In the 50s, the economic development of England accelerated under the influence of NTR (Frieden, 2020). In the 80s, labor productivity grew at 2.5% per year, second only to Japan. Even more convincing was the increase in the efficiency of the use of fixed capital in terms of capital return. England, apart from Japan, was the only developed country where this figure increased compared to the 70s. The economic recovery began in mid-1985, although it was not stable in the next two years (Frieden, 2020).The most dynamic factors of domestic demand were the
inflation.In 1973, a sharp rise in oil prices shocked industrialized countries, including France, which imported almost all oil. The country’s energy and oil crisis has begun, which has hit the entire economic system. In the 1980s, the privatization process unfolded in France (Frieden, 2020). At first, banking groups and industrial companies with high-profit levels were privatized. Thus, after World War II, France faced some economic and political problems. To get out of the current situation, partial nationalization was carried out in the country, and the inflow of capital investments into the national industry increased.
Nowadays, businesses must operate in a highly competitive environment where only the strongest survive. Therefore, it is critical to understand the firm’s strongest points, where it can make a profit, and its weakest points, which it has to improve on in order to stay in business. In this situation, one of the ways to determine weak and strong areas is through a SWOT analysis that covers strengths, weaknesses, opportunities, and threats. By analyzing these points, a firm will be able to benefit from the strong areas, improve the weak spots, be mindful of areas of opportunity, and plan for market threats. Thus, a SWOT analysis should highlight a firm’s fundamentals while also recognizing possibilities it cannot currently employ to its maximum owing to a deficiency in resources.As a
fact that they need such isolation in order to achieve global solidarity, where global equalization is beneficial for everyone. Therefore, one can agree that the author describes a modern version of imperialism, where one powerful nation imposes its ideals, values, and interests on other ones. In the past, it was done by the brute force of superior military, but modern technology enabled a more intricate form of imperialism through media.In conclusion, the process of commercialization of international broadcasting began with America, and the latter was the prime beneficiary of such change.
Stock market volatility and the danger of nations experiencing economic spillovers are increasing as the global financial industry grows more internationally interconnected. However, the opening of trade with emerging nations signaled the start of a new era of low-cost manufacturing based on these countries’ low wages (Samiee, 2019). They also assisted small merchants in importing overseas food and retail items into local grocery shops, and she introduced numerous Asian and Latin American products to U.S. customers. The cheap costs of items available through chains such as Walmart, which imports the majority of its inventory, are driving down the earnings of smaller retailers seeking to compete, according to the owner of a small U.S. retail store (Samiee, 2019). At the same time, international discrepancies can stimulate local markets and
policies, the availability and price of these items continue to fluctuate significantly (Samiee, 2019). Due to Iranian sanctions, the best saffron produced in the country is virtually inaccessible or excessively costly in the U.S. Natural calamities like floods and earthquakes may also impair goods supply chains like the earthquakes in Chile in 2010 and Japan in 2011, when numerous items were unavailable for months, had an impact on not just local markets but on worldwide trade.
SummaryType 2 diabetes mellitus is defined as one of the most dangerous chronic diseases in contemporary societies. It poses a significant challenge to manage for individuals, not because of a lack of treatment options but rather a population issue. Because families and patients typically accomplish managing diabetes, self-management is chosen as the best method to perform diabetes care. Nonetheless, a large number of individuals have a problem self-managing their care, necessitating new intervention measures to address the issue (Carpenter et al., 2019). Therefore, it is crucial to discern how interventions influence self-management actions for individuals with Type 2 diabetes. It is essential to consider that diabetes mellitus poses a problem for self-management because of the expenses involved in acquiring medication. These expenses pose a problem for the patient’s
well-being as they have to work longer and experience illnesses such as fatigue, anxiety, and depression.Self-management is the practice of dynamically conducting self-care actions while intending to boost an individual’s well-being and behavior. It includes measures such as planned physical activity, taking diabetes medication, meal planning, managing illness episodes, monitoring blood glucose, and determining high or low blood glucose (Carpenter et al., 2019). Treatment plans involving self-management are continually advanced in tandem with the consultation of various healthcare professionals such as pharmacists, dieticians, nurses, and doctors.An individual should maintain a regulated glycemic control using the tenets of self-management to reduce the possibility of complications related to diabetes. Nonetheless, diabetic self-management and strict glycemic controls are distinct and could be confounded by concerns connected to treatment plan adherence (Carpenter
et al., 2019). The majority of diabetes research indicates that many patients do not conduct proper self-management routines. Lack of commitment to a strict self-management process is known to derail patient progress and inhibit adequate handling of diabetes.The Necessity to Address the ProblemDiabetes Mellitus poses a significant danger due to the limited awareness of every party involved. This qualitatively influences the care and treatment care effectiveness. If a patient poorly manages their health, their diabetes may adversely affect them more than their current state. The study is also critical as it illustrates the medical system’s absence of proper communication channels. It also defines the issue of limited time as individuals should access medicine within a particular time, barring which they face physical problems (Carpenter et al., 2019). These
Nurses are the primary healthcare professionals that offer care to these patients. Lack of proper self-care prevents people from knowing they need to have a special diet, come up with an exercise routine, have drug therapy, self-monitor their blood glucose levels, and monitor the psychosocial impact. Joint decision-making is also another significant component of self-management. Patients should develop a program with their nurses and families to prevent the illness from progressing and monitor it.
The primary principle which serves as the basis of crime scene investigation is undoubtedly the Locard’s Exchange Principle. According to the principle, whenever a person or rather a living subject enters or leaves any particular environment, something of physical form is either added or taken away from the scene. The principle is summarized by the statement “Every contact leaves a trace.” (Crime Scene Investigation, n.d) This principle enables crime investigators to link suspected persons to scenes of crime, victims, and to physical objects.Objects or materials in any form that could be relevant in crime are referred to as physical evidence. However, not all types of materials qualify as evidence but only objects or materials that could provide significant probative clues related to a crime such as associative evidence.
In the modern world, despite the development of various technologies and medicine, people are still at risk of contracting many different dangerous diseases. One of these was salmonella, which is caused by a bacterium and can be quite dangerous for the population. The study of scientific literature on this topic is of particular value as it can help prevent the occurrence of cases of the disease. In this case study, two articles were analyzed for usefulness for further research.Typhoid fever becomes the most common ailment when faced with salmonella bacteria. However, at the moment, it has been replaced by other diseases, such as salmonella typhimurium and salmonella enteritidis. One of the characteristics of a dangerous cell is a high degree of stability and viable when treated with average
temperatures. Moreover, the risk is also that multiplying on products, salmonella bacteria do not affect their appearance and taste in any way.Two articles “Multistate outbreak of salmonella infections linked to raw Turkey Products” and “Salmonella outbreak linked to onions” were chosen because they can become helpful resources for conducting scientific work on the study of salmonella cases in the Caribbean. This is due to the fact that in the last few years there has been an outbreak of diseases associated with the salmonella bacterium, which affects not only the population, but also tourists.The aspect that interested me was the consideration of the issue of the occurrence of pathogenic cells in a product such as onions. Moreover, this source briefly and clearly describes possible symptoms using words from a
useful dictionary for my work, such as diarrhea, fever and abdominal pain (“Salmonella outbreak linked to onions”, 2020). In addition, for the final project, this article can be valuable, as it provides solutions that businesses and the public can take when faced with a problem and to avoid it further. The source also provides statistical data that will help give the future project more credibility.The second source also looks at the salmonella outbreak and how it was investigated. It provides information about what the disease is and the causes of its occurrence. More specifically, the scientific article provides information about how multiple patients complained about the harmful effects of various turkey products (“Multistate outbreak of salmonella infections linked to raw Turkey Products”, 2019 ) . After analyzing the
In the rapidly changing world, the significance of investing is well-known. Such finance managements enable individuals to protect their assets from inflation and enable their further growth. With respect to the recent COVID-19 pandemic, the situation in the already volatile market became even less stable. For our group, it implies the necessity of the in-detailed investment analysis to facilitate further portfolio management and evaluate its past performance.S&P 500 ETF TRUST ETF (SPY) was added to it with the purpose of diversification to complement the portfolio. Thus, the further calculations consider daily returns from SPY from October 01, 2021, to November 30, 2021. This work will present an economic analysis of the portfolio beta, mean, and Sharpe ratio based on the performance of the stock during the specified period.
The analysis of SPY will also be provided to complement understanding of the stock, discuss current values of its essential indicators, and evaluate its potential.Calculation of Key Economic IndicatorsDetermination of Portfolio BetaBefore processing to calculate portfolio beta, the overview of portfolio performance for the period taken for further analysis is due. It is possible to see in Figure 1 that there is a strong tendency for the stock (SPY) to grow. The axis Y shows the percentages indicating changes in the value of stock that occurred on a certain day. The axis X shows the exact date. The revealed pattern is similar to the one reflecting a change in prices of the stock for the period.Figure 1. Overview of Portfolio for the Period October-November.Portfolio beta or security beta
is a measure of volatility that is often referred to as systematic risk. Considering that the portfolio consists of only one stock, the change of a security’s price in percentage equals the change in the portfolio in percentage, and the mentioned two concepts are one and the same for this particular case. Beta is widely used for the determination of the relationship between systematic risk and expected return for assets.The portfolio beta was calculated using the provided Excel spreadsheet that takes into consideration stock prices and respective index levels for this security for the same period. A number of data periods equal 41, which is explained by the absence of information for price and index level for some days, which does not significantly affect the calculations. Split factor
also was considered, but because SPY wasn’t split even once during the period, all the values equal 1, as shown in Table 1. The index level is the one for S&P 500 Index (roughly 10 times more than the SPY price, as they are correlated in a certain manner).Table 1.

In this case, only one security composes a portfolio (SPY), which means that there is no necessity to consider the weight of each comprising security. However, the portfolio mean can be determined only for the portion of the year (End of September-November) as the stock was held only for this period. It is known that on September 30, 2021, the portfolio was
equal to 1000000, while on November 30, 2021, the portfolio was equal to 1011296.3. Following the formula: Mean return = (End of the period – Beginning of the period) / Beginning of the period; Mean return = (1011296.3 – 1000000) / 1000000 = 0.0112963 or toughly 1.13%. Therefore, the risk premium for stocks for the portfolio for the given period of time equals 1.13%.Determination of Sharpe RatioIt is possible to provide calculations of the Sharpe ratio for the portfolio to determine the value of the stock price based on current values of determinants. Those indicators are risk premium for stocks (portfolio mean return), risk-free rate during 2 months period (roughly 0,06%), current monthly risk-free rate (0,11%) based on the Daily Treasury Yield Curve Rates and standard deviation. Using
the formula for standard deviation in Excel(STDEV. S(A2:A10) dividing it by the mean and multiplying by 100%, it is possible to find the percentage of standard deviation for this asset, and therefore, for the entire 1-asset portfolio. The standard deviation for the portfolio equals 1.59% roughly, which implies that high risks were taken to gain a profit. According to the formula: Sharpe ratio = (return of portfolio – risk-free rate) / standard deviation; Sharpe ratio = (1.13% – 0.06%) / 1.59% = 0.673. It is possible to conclude, considering that the ratio is lower than the desired value (1), that the management of the portfolio was too risky. Simultaneously, the Sharpe ratio for the stock for the same period is much better.Stock AnalysisS&P 500 ETF TRUST ETF is
a fund that owns the stocks in the Standard & Poor’s 500 index and is considered to be the benchmark for investing. Such corporations as Microsoft, Apple, Amazon, Nvidia, Tesla, and others contribute to the value of the stock. The representation of SPY performance is presented in Figure 2 . The estimated yield equals 1.30% (which is close to the one calculated above), and the historical 52 week-range (the lowest and the heist price for the past year were $362.03 and $473.54, respectively.Figure 2. SPY Stock Performance for the Past 1 Year.10 years yield from this security equals 14.71%, and the growth is rather steady and slow than volatile and rapid, and it is shown in Figure 3.Figure 3. SPY Stock Performance for the Past 10 Years.SPY is
Technology, Health Care, Consumer Discretionary, Communication Services, Financials, Industrials, Consumer Staples, Utilities, Real Estate, Materials, and Energy.With respect to the outlined summary of SPY performance, it is possible to list several key points:  * SPY has shown steady growth for the past 2 years  * SPY volume is high and tends to rise over time  * SPY capitalization is over $40.3 trillion  * SPY consists of 500 companies and is spread across 11 sectorsIt is possible to conclude that despite the performance of the portfolio consisting of SPY shares being worse than it could have been, it is possible to recommend further long-term holding of the security. Its growth potential is high because the economy is reviving after the COVID-19 pandemic.
The expansion of cities and the creation of new jobs is a successful urbanistic development strategy, but such decisions require careful preparation in terms of the health function of the municipality. In particular, situations in which a city’s population grows significantly in a short period, while the number of beds in local hospitals remains unchanged, must be avoided not to stimulate the development of epidemics and regional quarantines. Consequently, hospital capacity must then be expanded, which raises questions about funding, sources of funding, and long-term goals. This essay attempts to answer these questions through a case study of the administrative team’s decision to expand the local hospital by an additional 150 beds while the city’s population grows.It is clear that one of the administrative team’s first questions is
to determine the type of funding that should be resorted to for the purposes of the hospital organization. The primary difference between the two types of financing, debt and equity financing, is determined by the way the company takes money from. In debt financing, for example, the hospital obtains funds by borrowing money that will need to be paid back over time. In contrast, equity financing is provided by selling a portion of the company’s equity to private investors, who, in turn, receive a stake in the company (Maverick, 2021). It is clear that in this case, the company loses part of its business by selling it to an outside entrepreneur, which creates a burden in terms of making critical decisions. Thus, it is important to understand the
advantages and disadvantages of both types of financing in order not to make a critical mistake.Based on the above, debt financing is more relevant for a municipal hospital because budget capital is extremely sensitive to third-party financing. The hospital is an important strategic facility for the city, which means losing even partial control over key decisions if part of the management is transferred to an outside investor would be the wrong decision. In addition, a 150-bed expansion and additional expansion of acute care and intensive care would ultimately require a specific amount that would be easier to borrow than to calculate in terms of selling equity. Of course, the hospital would then have to make regular debt payments with interest on the terms of the loan, but this
is not expected to be a particularly severe problem in the face of such a dramatic expansion of the city and the resulting increase in the client base. Once the type of financing has been chosen, it is necessary to determine the sources of funds that will provide the financing.Banks are the traditional providers of interest-bearing money, but it is essential to understand that they are not the only ones who can provide debt financing for a hospital. For example, bank loans do provide full use of the money during the reporting period. At that time, the hospital is indebted to the bank to pay a minimum repayment amount with interest, so the bank ends up with the upper hand for providing the hospital with the money to
expand. Private investors or sponsors who lend personal money to the hospital at interest can also use such a scheme. In addition, if the hospital is the only city hospital in the municipality, the state must provide grant funding upon request. However, if the hospital in question is of the for-profit type, an SBA loan from the U.S. government, which acts as an intermediary between lending partners and the hospital, covering risk and facilitating access to capital (SBA, 2021), can be obtained. It is this diversity of sources that should be used by the hospital’s administrative team to minimize risk.There are four fundamental principles of investment management practice that also help reduce possible risks. These concern not only how exactly to get money — in small portions from
a number of sources — but also how to spend that money wisely afterward. The first goal is to allocate assets so that the hospital will not incur severe losses (IAG, n.d.) if one area is lost. For example, this can be accomplished through the use of multiple suppliers of clinical equipment instead of a single distributor. The second goal of investment management is to structure the economic context of the company so that in the event of any errors or mistakes, it is possible to address the source of that error. Structuring allows for consistency and adherence to the original plan, which is critical in financial management. The other goals of investment management, however, cannot be ignored, which are aimed at the long term.The third goal is
long-term planning, which allows for the proper management of borrowed funds. Creating a long-term plan helps the company identify all of the critical spending points of the investment and the benefits the hospital receives over the long term. For example, an investment of tens of thousands of dollars in medical equipment now can bring the hospital triple the profit in two years through proper long-term planning. From this comes the fourth goal of investment management, which corresponds to capital growth. Through borrowed investment, the company increases equity, and after the loan is repaid, the company’s capital will be increased. However, the economic agenda is not stable, and therefore the hospital will always need cash reserves.In general, cash reserves should be defined as those cash reserves that can be
used in crisis situations when a hospital urgently needs money. This generally refers to any unplanned expenses for which finances are urgently needed for a period of several months. This can apply to any cash reserves related to natural disasters or epidemics that require urgent spending, as in the case of COVID-19. It also applies to repairs to equipment that has failed and needs to be replaced immediately. Cash reserves may also be needed for financial assistance to employees who have lost loved ones or compensation for anniversaries and holidays. Finally, it is not uncommon for a hospital to experience an economic crisis, and assets cannot be used to cover debt obligations, or any other costs associated with making the hospital functional. It is clear, however, that the
severe burden on the hospital, this type of long-term financial relationship with creditors benefits the hospital. Private investors, sponsors, or governments continue to be such sources, but the situation is more difficult for banks, which are not inclined to lend for long periods at low-interest rates (Tuovila, 2020). Nevertheless, with proper investment management, the hospital receives a regular inflow of cash that can be spent and then returned to the issuer for further expansion.
Burke’s pentad presents a simple tool for analyzing dramatic situations that can be used to examine texts and other narratives. This framework describes such elements as act, agent, scene, agency, and purpose, as well as their relations. Burke’s pentad can be used to identify an actor’s motivation in a given dramatic scene. On the example of one of Jeff Wall’s photographs, it is illustrated how the motivation of an actor in this paradigm can be described in different ways in terms of the viewer’s focus.Kenneth Burke’s life stance is based on several leading points, and their analysis contributes to an awareness of the meaning of human behavior. He drew the most significant attention to language as the basis that leads to conscious action rather than involuntary movement. Rhetor
holds that acts are related to the neurological aspect of human existence, defined as the body’s ability to master the sign system (Bonanno, 2018).Since the rhetorician models his description on the principle of drama, it consists of five elements: act, agent, scene, agency, and purpose (Hawhee & Poole, 2019). These are the basic parameters of rhetorical analysis and the foundation of the pentad, which examines human action from five interacting motivational perspectives. In this fivefold approach, the individual is an actor who acts purposefully through specific means, and he serves as the backdrop of a historical place of motion. Jensen (2018) explains that Burke was guided by the fact that every individual can influence his life by his actions, but possibilities always depend on five means. The pentad
determines how an individual acts in a certain case and what his motivation is.In addition, it is essential to prioritize the connections that the rhetorician makes in speech between these five dramatic elements. These connections are called relations, and depending on which structural elements are emphasized, the rhetor’s strategy and identification are determined (Jensen, 2018). In the communication process, there is an exchange of characters and a constant desire to identify the sender’s views and the recipient of speech (Lynch, 2017). Thus, these aspects link the actor and other elements of the dramatic situation.Analysis using Burke’s pentad also depends on what the viewer is focusing on. For example, this framework can be used to analyze paintings and photographs. In this paper, we will take for this photo taken
Social networks have significantly changed the lives of all humanity. Nowadays, people can send a message that they have bought a new chandelier on WhatsApp, share a photo of it on Instagram, and do not forget to throw off a couple of memes on Facebook. Moreover, all this without seeing their interlocutors in real life. Social networks have many advantages, such as instant communication, the ability to contact people from anywhere in the world, showing their position on a particular issue with likes and comments (Rubin and Beuk 2). However, many do not even think that several negative factors exist behind the beautiful facade of accessible communication.Social media plays a huge role in many Americans lives day to day. Many use it to keep in touch with old
friends and family that’s away, and some use it just to keep up with things that are going on in the world. It gives an insight on what is going on around the world, but in a way, people could only get if they are on social media. With Facebook being one of the most popular social media outlets where people can create profiles to interact with others, comes with problems behind it. Many people are faced with the harsh reality of criticism from users around the world, some of which they may not know.During the work of the services, tools that affect a person more than others were discovered — likes and a news feed. The article’s author defines these features of social networks as adversely affecting
users. The Like button allows users to show interest and belonging to a particular idea quickly. Nevertheless, at the same time, a universal metric is being introduced by which a person can judge the influence, the value of information within the platform, and about themselves (Rubin and Beuk 5). A button created as a simple equivalent of a minimal social action has become a digital currency.With the creation of likes, the value of the information and personality expressed can now be accurately measured. Thus, the metric of our life that has always been hidden from other people has become publicly available. A new level of frankness could not affect people’s minds; the number of insecurities, anxiety, depression, neuroses among people who could not integrate into the platform increased
dramatically (Rubin and Beuk 7). Teenagers trying their best to fit into life receive feedback in the form of likes with which they judge their importance and value. At the same time, the understanding of a person as someone suffers because such complex views that require prolonged reflection are lost in rapidly changing, stimulating information. It is worth noting that “the lower response on social network may make a person feel more dejected and it may validate his/her poor self-esteem” (Srivastava 156). Thus, such information does not receive a proper response in social media and is interpreted as unclaimed, complex, and unnecessary by the end-user.Social networks have a powerfully negative effect on the subjective well-being of people, their state of self-satisfaction, and their own life. There is another
factor that people do not pay attention to: communication on social networks has a fundamentally different emotional coloring (Rubin and Beuk 3). The fact is that people in them are forced to defend their point of view in front of a much wider audience. It includes people with whom they are not familiar in person and with whom they are unlikely to have ever made friends in real life due to too different characters and beliefs. In other words, people form their social circle based on mutual sympathy and shared beliefs in real life. It is impossible to form such a circle in a social network. Therefore, in real life, communication with friends causes positive emotions and increases self-satisfaction and life, but this does not happen on the
the case of a familiar person, the user understands that life consists not only of those aspects demonstrated on social networks.Facebook distorts our perception of reality and how other people live. By visiting a page on a social network, users constantly compare themselves with other people, and since most people prefer to post only positive, this gives them a very wrong perception of reality. Since people on Facebook talk about how they spend weekends, not gray days, that they write about their children’s achievements, and not about their whims, readers quickly get a false sense of a world filled with only bright sides.
The article Is Globalization Reducing Poverty and Inequality by Robert Hunter Wade explores the phenomenon of globalization and its influence on the poverty and inequality ratios all over the world. The author discusses the data provided by the neoliberal economies on the decreasing poverty ratios of the past two decades. The globalization-related evidence confirms the neoliberal theory on the fact that the more liberal economies are more prosperous and develop faster than those who do not share the liberal values.However, despite the fact that poverty ratios have been decreasing during the past two decades, it is yet impossible to say whether its scale is decreased as well. It happens so due to the ratio’s previous growth that lasted for a long time. Hence, though the numbers have decreased,
the issue still remains relevant as the poverty-related figures and statistics are rather unstable and may change unpredictably. In addition, the poverty numbers provided by the World’s Bank may be imprecise, so it is hard to establish the real state of things when it comes to the poverty ratio. As for the income inequality ratio, it is hard to say whether it increased or decreased because it is highly influenced by the Indian and Chinese ratios on income inequality. If these numbers are taken out from the formula, the numbers for the rest of the world change drastically. At the same time, income gaps in particular countries continue to grow as well, so it is hard to find out the real numbers of the income inequality for the
world in general.The article How to Judge Globalism by Amartya Sen explains the phenomenon of globalization and its role not only in the modern world but in the past as well. It is stressed in the writing that globalization is often regarded as global Westernization or Western dominance. Globalization is often referred to as Western imperialism due to the fact that history, in many cases, concerns only the events that happened in Europe or North America, such as the Age of Enlightenment, the Renaissance, or the Industrial Revolution. It is usually those who tend to look at the world’s history from only one angle consider globalization a Westernized process that happened and happens while the rest of the world remains unaffected.However, this point of view should be regarded
course of humankind’s history. It became the driving force for the majority of discoveries and offered a bunch of opportunities for the countries’ and worlds’ development processes. However, it is wrong to regard globalization as a thing that affects only advanced nations since it influences all people despite their income level, social status, and the country they live in. When it comes to the influence of globalization on people with lower income, it is wrong to ask if they get something from the process. The right question here is if globalization grants them a fair opportunity and fair share. However, at the same time, globalization needs further reformations that will contribute to the equal distribution of the resources and benefits granted by it to the whole world.
The never-ending debate concerning wealth and happiness has taken its place throughout history. Although the words’ wealth’ and ‘happiness’ share the same etymologies, both obtain the meaning of ‘well-being’ in Middle English; nowadays, they are perceived as different and often polarized terms (Brule & Suter, 2019). Since the modern era can be characterized as a period of serious changes in social outlooks, the perception of wealth in society has changed as well (Brule & Suter, 2019). In addition, the phenomenon of ‘philanthropy’ (in other words, charity) is becoming increasingly popular (Sellen, 2019). Therefore, happiness can be perceived as a concept that plays a bigger role in an individual’s life.There are two important aspects that prove that happiness has a more defining role in a modern person’s well-being –
of happiness; in other words, the ‘giving’ has been put over ‘receiving’ (Sellen, 2019). Thus, it can be said that in the modern era, an individual’s happiness has a tangible impact on an individual’s well-being.Modern society has shifted its outlook in favor of social equality and struggle against the unhealthy oppressing environment. Although wealth is still perceived as a desirable aspect, an individual’s virtue and, what is most importantly, well-being and happiness are valued much higher. As a result, the ethics’ shift towards the common good and total equality led to a prevalence of an individual’s mental state (e.g., happiness) over his welfare.
IntroductionFake news is information disseminated through traditional news outlets or online social media and consists of purposeful deception or hoaxes. Fake news has resurfaced and grown in popularity because of digital news. As a result, stories and opinions may spread at an unprecedented rate, allowing people all over the world to participate in a near-real-time debate about both serious and inconsequential topics.Fake News ExperienceIn early 2020, after the COVID-19 outbreak, there circulated news that the consumption of garlic would cure the illness. I found the recipe on Facebook, which recommended that one eats the garlic and drinks the water to witness improvement and healing overnight. I shared the news with friends as it claimed to have been proven effective by many patients and an old Chinese doctor. However,
it. The government should allocate money to facilitate partnerships between journalists, corporations, educational institutions, businesses, and nonprofit organizations in enhancing news literacy. Educating the public about the fact that not everything they read is accurate and that many digital sites specialize in spreading misleading information aids people in learning how to evaluate news sites and protect themselves against false information.Counteracting the fake news and disinformation scourge requires that everyone plays a role by promoting strong professional journalistic norms, encouraging investigative journalism, lowering financial incentives for fake news, and enhancing public digital literacy. These initiatives, when taken together, will promote quality conversation while weakening the environment and enhancing disinformation around the world.
Public humiliation entails a method of disciplining associated with crucial aspects such as abusing or embarrassing an individual, typically a criminal or a convict, particularly in a communal place. Notably, verbal abuse was used extensively as an approach of punishment legalized eras ago. However, it is still used in various ways in the current times. Embarrassment and verbal abuse are closely related in that they subject a person to humiliation. While guiltiness is usually associated with performing something incorrectly, embarrassment is associated with emotion like an evil person. Societies experiencing embarrassment involve shame, mainly once the disgrace is communal or includes conduct closely tangled to self-confidence. The paper will explore how public humiliation affects people and their culture.Events and feelings of humiliation can equally lead to severe psychological
The energy industry is among the sectors that are performing effectively. However, it is not immune to challenges that threaten its existence. The increasing demand for sustainable energy is one of the issues affecting the sector (Sovacool, 2019). In addition, consumers in the market are creating pressure on the industry to adopt environmentally friendly energy sources. Apart from this, the energy sector is facing the issue of price volatility. The prices of energy products constantly change, which affects their performance. Although there exist issues that affect the energy industry’s performance, there are solutions that they can use to solve the problems.Price volatility is one of the most significant concerns in the energy industry. Because of price fluctuations, forecasting oil prices has been a big concern in this industry
(Sovacool, 2019). Over the last five years, the situation has deteriorated even further. The fluctuation is caused by several factors influencing supply and demand. On the supply side, the sector has transitioned from models that rely on large-scale developments to short-term investments. On the side of demand, aspects such as the deceleration of economic growth in emerging economies and the gradual substitution of oil. Another demand factor is the increase in more effective and economically friendly buildings and public transportation.A solution to the above challenge is to promote well-regulated but broadened hedging through financial markets. The demand for oil-consuming and producing corporations to transfer price risk to those willing to bear it will increase (Sovacool, 2019). Based on this, it is important to implement reasonable changes and enforce
laws against manipulation and fraud. However, do not impose blanket limitations on financial market players on the incorrect belief that they are the source of the volatility. Instead, the prices should be harmonized by ensuring that all the stakeholders are protected in the market. As a result, effective regulation plays an integral role in controlling price volatility in the energy industry.The second problem experienced in the industry is the growing efforts to address climate change. There is increasing pressure on the need to reduce global warming. The main focus has been on the energy industry because they are known to be the main contributor to climate change (Sovacool, 2019). Based on this, the stakeholders in this sector must ensure that their operations are sustainable. However, it has been
challenging for stakeholders to shift from non-renewable energy such as petrol, which is one of the main pollutants, to renewable energy. As a result, it has been challenging for the industry to meet the demand of environmental conservation advocates; hence they have constantly lost some customers.The solution to the above challenge is to engage relevant stakeholders such as environmental conservation advocates in a discussion. The operators in the industry should inform environmentalists that they understand the impact of their products on the environment and are working on a possible solution to reduce the effect (Sovacool, 2019). In addition, they should participate in advocacy programs and awareness geared towards lowering climate change. With this initiative, firms in the energy industry will be able to retain their client base. Currently,
resources are small energy generation and storage technologies that provide electric capacity where it is needed (Sovacool, 2019). Increasing the use of these resources creates a more decentralized energy system and changes the conventional way of an energy transmission system. In addition, it creates a need to understand the effect of the transmission distribution system interface. For example, waste heat can be captured and used to meet increasing energy demands in buildings (Sovacool, 2019). Therefore, distributing energy resources is integral in solving the issue of uncertainty in the use of energy.
Formative AssessmentBackgroundThe rail industry in the U.K. has a long history and established system for changing the national rail timetable every six months, in May and December every year, with the changes varying in scale. Normally, the changes are minor and do not affect rail operations. In addition, when they are executed according to plans, passengers are unaffected and they get the benefit of accessing additional services (“British Parliament Report,” 2018). Timetable changes are important for the rail industry because they help in delivering extra capacity to meet customers’ demands. The changes also enable train companies to improve their revenue returns. However, the May 2018 changes were unprecedented in terms of the investment size and its implementation complexity. It had effects on very many sections of the British
national railway network and was four times the scale of a normal six-monthly timetable change. This led to an array of issues leading to poor operational performance and as a consequence, industry, users, and wider stakeholder dissatisfaction. The following factors were the causes of the poor performance of the Thameslink route as a result of the new timetable in May 2018. 1. Poor Planning for the changes 2. Delayed Infrastructure upgrade 3. The incompetence of Network Rail department 4. Lack of trained drivers 5. Timbale was drawn late 6. Lack of coordination 7. Poor communication of the changes to passengersLinkages between Causes of Poor PerformancesPrior to changes in the timetable in May 2018, there was engineering work of upgrading the rail network in the United Kingdom. This was
meant to greatly improve the services, but it failed to a large extent. Immediately after the new Thameslink timetable was introduced, the huge scale of cancellations, delays, confusion, and misinformation that graced the new timetable was a big shock to the commuters and the public. Firstly, the rebuilding of the London Bridge station, adding modern signaling and buying new trains and Tube-style frequency delays did not go as were planned (Topham, 2018). Fundamentally, Govia Thameslink Railway (GTR) did not have enough drivers, which affected the implementation of their plans (Topham, 2018). Despite claims by GTR that they employed more than enough drivers to run the expanded services the May timetable was due to provide, that was not the case (Topham, 2018). They lacked drivers who were trained on
the exact model of trains that were introduced and the full route they were to operate.Clearly, this pointed to shoddy planning done by GTR. Further, normally changing the timetable takes 16 months before its implementation but planning and execution of the May 2018 timetable changes took place in a matter of weeks. The lack of proper planning on the side of GTR was compounded by so many issues to do with strikes by its guards and drivers, which caused commuter despair for months. Other interrelated problems, on track and trains, were also well documented by GTR, and there was a warning for them to implement phased timetable changes. However, approval for this new plan came four months late from the Network Rail, putting pressure on planners (Topham, 2018).
Additionally, GTR’s planning team, clipped of numerous experienced staff, requested many changes months later. The net effect was poor communication with passengers on timings, cancellations, and rescheduling of routes. There was poor coordination and a lack of clarity on responsibilities among GTR, the department of Transport, and Network Rail (“Office of Rail and Road,” 2018). The industry structure as it was arranged then, did not support clarity in decision-making.Lessons LearntThe scale of work at hand and the complexity of changes in timetables were unprecedented. This placed a timetabling team together with passenger and freight operators who were under intense pressure to deliver. Under the circumstances, the teams tried to complete the work without options to mitigate the tasks later. There was a lack of coordination and cooperation among
stakeholders, which affected decision-making (“Office of Rail and Road,” 2018). GTR’s initial planning and training of drivers was inadequate in relation to the scale of the changes to the timetable. Further, GTR failed to conduct test runs for their plans before implementing the changes (“Office of Rail and Road,” 2018). Lastly, there was no sufficient contingency in place to address any challenges during the implementation of the changes. In the future, stakeholders must plan properly taking into consideration the scale of the work they intend to roll out. The plans should be drawn and piloted before actual implementation is carried out to detect and address weaknesses. All the stakeholders involved in the rail timetable changes should in the future have a well-coordinated approach with clarity on responsibilities for
teams.Summative AssessmentBackgroundSouth Western Railway’s (SWR) franchise that commenced in August ’17 included two major timetable change commitments to increased service frequencies, earlier and later trains, and extended formations. In the changes, a refurbished Class 442 EMU fleet will be introduced, enabling additional long-distance peak trains to operate and lengthening the existing services. In addition, there will be improved long-distance journey times enabled by reduced dwells, amended calling patterns, and portion working with trains splitting en-route. These proposed changes also include the introduction of newly manufactured suburban area Class 701 EMU trains using accelerated timings. Further, there will be a new method of working like train despatch providing reduced dwells; and increased passenger capacity with many 8-car suburban trains replaced by 10 car Class 701s.These changes were proposed after
witnessing a sustained period of poor performance on the intensively operated and highly infrastructure-constrained Wessex Route. There was also an assessment done on the capability of the network being undertaken by Network Rail. The report of that evaluation concluded that significant elements of these two timetable change packages could not be undertaken due to constraints within the railway system. South Western Railways (SWR) appointed a joint Train Operating Company/Infrastructure team to identify and assess the issues which are liable to block the implementation of these timetable changes. The team will then determine the optimum industry way forward for submission to the Department of Transport for approval. The task will include assessing mechanisms for evaluating risks, the parties to be involved, the interventions for issues identified, costs, limitations, dated
program of activities, deliverables, and benefits of an optimum business case.The existing Rail Network operationSeveral factors combined are making it difficult to implement the timetable changes. There is the increase in the number of passengers, the poor management of train crew, the operation of longer trains, increasing numbers of speed restrictions, and aging infrastructure are some of the issues which pose challenges to the introduction of the new changes. This assessment report will analyze and each issue, the parties required to offer solutions, and how best they can be solved.The Obsolete Timetable StructureThe existing timetable structure which SWR is using was updated last in May 2004. The number of trains running has been static since 2004 to date. Further, the public performance measure (PPM) of the trains has
been on the decline and by the 2017/18 financial year, it declined to 84.3%, s drop of 9.1% since the 2010/11 financial year (Holden et al., 2018). Service groups in which SWR operates had dropped in performance by 7% for the best performance and by 15% for the worst performance in the financial year 2017/18 (Holden et al., 2018). It means the proposed timetable changes could most likely fail to have trains can run their entire planned journey, calling at all scheduled stations and arriving at their terminating station on time.Right Time Arrival (RTA) breakdownThere has been a huge decrease in TRA performance at the franchise level from April 2011 to 2017. This goes further to give more evidence of why the new major timetable changes in the
South Western route can perform at the optimum level (Holden et al., 2018). Over the years, the fall in performance has been due to low-level delays like time loss in the running. The effect of this is the fact that many trains interact have been interacting with each other in the past, and more trains suffer delays which could generate congestion in peak periods and reactionary delay enough to bring down the trains’ PPM.Incident Count (Incidents causing attributable delay)The incident count is a measure of the input of service-impacting on events that result in poor performance. It is, therefore, a useful measure of the underlying asset and system performance and reliability. A well-maintained, efficient, and effectively operated railway should see incident count gradually improving over time. This should
be the case because of the application of continuous improvement techniques designed to eliminate repeat failures. At a bare minimum, the incident count should remain relatively static. The current state of the incident cannot support the proposed two major timetable changes by SWR, it will most likely account for the main delay if the systems are not upgraded. Along with the incident, the count is the Delay per Incident (DPI) which assesses the relative impact of every causation group in the train service at a high level. The available data points to static DPI from 2009/10 to 2015/16 (Holden et al., 2018). Pointing to what ails or has been a contributing factor to the decline in SWR performance will clearly derail the new changes.Misalignment of incentivesThe railway network
is a very complex system, and so all the elements should work together effectively and efficiently for the delivery of good results in terms of operability. Even though the organizational structure of the railway industry is split between train operations and infrastructure provision, both should align their incentives together to deliver the desired services (Holden et al., 2018). Unfortunately, this is not the case for the South Western route; the Network Rail’s (NR) objectives are set and controlled by ORR, whereas SWR is set through its franchise agreement. The two objectives do not dovetail completely, especially in the performance area and the targets RN have set for its strategic business plan and those of SWR through its financial agreement are different. This has created a serious misalignment of
functions and operations between them which affects the delivery of rail services.Performance management processThe performance process which SWR inherited that is supposed to work for the franchise and jointly with NR has weaknesses. Further, both teams are not applying it effectively as of now, which has created room for poor or insufficient information to be passed to top managers and directors by the junior staff. In addition, there are no links between the Performance Delivery Group (PGD) level and the Right Time Running Hubs (RTH), which are the places where performance analysis and reviews are conducted (Holden et al., 2018). RTH is very ineffective and is not capable of making even small changes meant to improve performance. Given the variability in performance levels by PGD and RTH, it
is not conducive to introducing major changes in the timetable. Basically, most of the performance data prepared for top managers and directors is backward and out of date.Core resilience of the timetableThe decline in core time resilience of the timetable is one of the reasons why the proposed changes will not perform optimally. This has been a big issue for the franchise since 2011, way before WST took over the management of the route (Holden et al., 2018). This Wessex railway network is big and complex, so the factors critical for its functions must be integrated for it to work efficiently. The timetable must be constructed with great care, especially on junction margins, reoccupation times, terminal turnaround times, dwell and running times, and that every train can run
accurately in its allocated path. Right Time Arrivals (RTA) have been showing for some time now the existence of problems with timetable resilience (Holden et al., 2018). A combination of factors has contributed to reduced timetable resilience which in turn affects the PPM performance. For example, trains running a couple of minutes late due to minor hitches are affected by a bigger attributed delay that pushes them over the five minutes late threshold and hence becomes a PPM failure.Increasing passenger loadings over timePassenger numbers have increased steadily over the last ten years. This has put dwell times under pressure, more so in the suburban areas and at key interchange stations such as Wimbledon, Clapham Junction, and Vauxhall. It makes the implementation of the two major timetable changes difficult
(Holden et al., 2018). Proper mechanisms of expansion of the operations in terms of the station, increasing carrying capacity and improving train dispatch routes to improve passenger access and egress.Lack of Properly Enough Trained DriversThe current WSR professional driving policy was introduced in 2012. It came along with a philosophy of progressive increase in the impact of defensive driving behavior to reduce the risk of SPADs, and TPWS interventions. Through this, drivers are trained not to exceed the intervention speed when passing over any Train Protection and Warning System (TPWS) (Holden et al., 2018). Drivers are also advised during training not to exceed 10mph over the TPWS positioned along with the platforms when approaching buffer stops. These mechanisms are meant to reduce the risks of operational safety. They
are part of drivers’ mandatory training and are also reinforced on drivers’ six months of off-track briefing days, and biennial assessments (Holden et al., 2018). Over the years, the number of drivers in the system who are properly trained and with the right experience before this policy was introduced has reduced. However, the exact proportion of drivers who follow the right method of driving has increased. While the impact on trains of this policy could be small, its collective impact could be big enough to cause time in the schedule to be lost.Operational complexity of train crew diagramsThe complexity of train crew diagrams leads to a lack of resourcing resilience and heavy dependence on a free day of working. There is a considerable variation between the required extent
of the route and traction knowledge to be compliant with the base diagrams and the actual position. This gap would require about 1400 days for the crew to be up to date with the route (Holden et al., 2018). If not solved, it could put pressure on the day-to-day diagramming and rostering activities needed to post drivers on the daily timetable. This could be a huge source of operational failure when major timetable changes are implemented. Fundamentally, in cases of disruptions, much more effort would be required in place to keep track of the resources in these circumstances. The implementation of a consistent service recovery plan during and after would be impossible.Outdated Contingency PlanA contingency plan is very crucial for the control of train movements, and the plans
in place now have not been updated since 2011. This could lead to sub-optimal decisions when responding to incidents (“Office of Rail and Road,” 2018). For instance, Raynes Park is being used to terminate trains despite the fact that it is narrower and this could lead to overcrowding when new major timetable changes are introduced. This must be reviewed in the context of the intended changes in the operations. For SWR to introduce the two major changes in the timetable, the contingency plan must be enhanced.Intervention for the issuesNR should urgently review its attribution policies, including those linked with small minutes and unexplained delays. This will enable quick investigation and fixing of problems when they arise. On their part, SWR must undertake timetable performance simulations 2 at least
two months prior to the commencement of the new timetable changes. This will create room for validation of the timetable and help them identify and learn any vital information which can be useful in the implementation of the new changes. SWR must introduce the provision of CCTV monitors to help guards with the task of dispatching trains.Both SWR and NR must, as a matter of urgency, review their combined capability and capacity for performance analysis and management and further strengthen it before introducing new changes. To help the two align their operations and functions, the Department of Transport (DfT) must create a better alignment of performance incentives between SWR and NR (“South Western Railway,” 2018). This two being under the direct control of DfT should have their operational
objectives aligned so they can deliver excellent services to the passengers. SWR should, as a priority, amend the professional driving policy for its drivers to understand the need to draw up appropriately. They must also recruit more drivers who understand the routes and are up to date with the intended changes to avoid disruptions.NR must urgently increase the permanent speed restriction on the Main Suburban lines into and out of the station; and into and out of platforms 20 to 24, from 15mph to 20mph. They should order a new and switch rail to reduce the risk of one infrastructure failure in Waterloo (“South Western Railway,” 2018). NR and SWR should carry out minor enhancements of the infrastructure as part of business-as-usual processes in the South Western route.
In the long term, NR, SWR, and DfT must cooperate to produce longer no-trains periods to facilitate improved infrastructure maintenance access.Identifying the Optimum Business SolutionThe new changes were meant to maximize the use of huge investments to improve the capacity of the South-Western Rail system. SWR should incorporate the expertise and experience of MTR, which run the busy Hong Kong metro, to deliver excellent rail transport on this network (“Department of Transport,” 2017). This will be delivered through a consistent fleet without disruptions and delays and provide more space for passengers. SWR must also deliver new car spaces, refurbished waiting rooms, and more seats for the increasing number of passengers. Further, the SWR franchise must introduce a new delay repay connection, along with delays for 15 minutes or
more. The communication within NR and SWR teams must improve so that passengers can make informed decisions about their travel arrangements (“Department of Transport,” 2017). The information must be real-time on screens, trains, stations, websites, and other applications. Station staff must be updated all the time through the use of smart devices to help passengers, mostly during disruptions. In addition, SWR must make available information about seating availability and crowd levels for passengers to know the best places to board trains.Objectives of Developing the Optimum Business CaseThe changes to the timetable are aimed more successfully in eliminating the delays and disruptions and giving reliable services to the passengers. It is also expected that the proposed changes will ease the overcrowding of passengers at the stations (“BBC,” 2019). These
changes will enable SWR to offer more peak services in and out of London. Changes will also come with more choices for passengers, speed up their journeys and offer increased travel frequencies. SWR and NR envision a situation where rail network performance in the southwestern route will improve (“BBC,” 2019). Thereby giving passengers value for money and satisfaction. The overall objective for the SWR franchise is the maximum revenue the new changes will generate due to increased passenger traffic on the southwestern network.Costs of Developing the Optimum Business CaseThe cost to develop the optimum business cost will involve the procurement of a new fleet of trains to meet the very growing number of passengers. The Network Rail will also need to install new signals, expand waiting rooms, install
new communication gadgets, and expenses for updating the entire timetable structure. SWR franchise has among the busiest routes, operating almost 1700 services per week. There are over 230 million passengers traveling to and from London Waterloo each year (“South Western Railway,” n.d.). This network route should be upgraded to increase capacity, services, and facilities. It should take about £800 million investment to create 30% increase in space for passengers during peak hours each day (“South Western Railway,” n.d.). The work should be completed in the shortest time possible but not later than December 2018 to allow for the introduction of the timetable changes after every six months easily.Limitations of Developing the Optimum Business CaseThe investments which SWR and DfT through NR in infrastructure and specific and intensive; if
this does not translate to big passenger traffic, then it will be a waste. Timetable changes cannot cure the inflexibility of train routes and timings to adjust to individual passenger needs. Even with sophistication in timetable changes, SWR will still not be able to solve the fact that trains are uneconomical for small distances and have small traffic of goods. Further, major timetable changes in the South Western route will not cure delays attributed and contributed to by natural occurrences like bad weather.The benefit of Developing Optimum Business CaseThis route is one of the busiest as it facilitates commuter, inter-urban, regional, and long-distance services in South West London and southern counties of England. It also provides linkages to the ports and airports in the United Kingdom. Its upgrading
will facilitate the transportation of tourists across the region to many tourists and heritage sites (“South Western Railway,” n.d.). It will also increase access to many sporting and social events which occur along the route. Further, so many business ventures rely on this route to facilitate the movement of people’s goods and services. An efficient and excellent network with less or no disruption will generate more revenue for the British government, franchise operators, and individual private businesses. Furthermore, effective and efficient movement of passengers, goods, and services without delays will save time which is a key factor of production.Introduction of the Class 701 Train FleetSouth Western Railway (SWR) will introduce its brand new Class 701 suburban EMUs after the issues hindering the implementation of major timetable changes are
addressed in 4 months’ time. This Bombardier-built fleet will carry passengers ‘along the arteries of the suburban network to its beating heart, London Waterloo’. SWR has ordered 60×10-car and 30×5-car of class 701 and it is planning for the whole fleet to be delivered within a period of12 months (“Modern Railways,” 2020). Initially, SWR will focus on introducing 10 – car units, followed by the delivery of the majority of five-car sets later (“Modern Railways,” 2020). However, a good number of them will arrive earlier for multiple working and coupling/uncoupling training.Infrastructure Function-Related ActivitiesSWR and conjunction with DfT through NR, will have to overhaul the South Western route into the digital age before the introduction of the class 701 EMU trains. These trains are very complex because they have
several new features which come with the integration of new signaling technology as well. Class 701 EMU comes with the benefits of onboard Wi-Fi, at-seat charging points, real-time information screens, air-conditioning, and wide gangways. Firstly, NR will need to construct more parking spaces at all stations along the route (Mellors, 2017). There is need also to construct about 60 electric car charging points along at stations along the route.NR and SWR will need to increase and stabilize the electricity supply along the South Western route to boost internet connectivity. This will be key in supporting real-time onscreen information to passengers and faster, more flexible, and more convenient online communication (Mellors, 2017). SWR should also overhaul its ticketing system to go digital before the new class 701 EMU is
introduced. They must use maximize the use of smartcards which uses pay-as-you-go functionality for flexibility of ticketing to passengers (Mellors, 2017). Along with smartcards, SWR will have to put mechanisms in place for barcode tickets on mobile phones. SWR will also have to build a new stabilizing facility before the year ends to support the new suburban fleet.Passengers are and will be interested in fast, quick, and convenient journeys. SWR, together with NR will have to draft shorter timetable speeds between adjacent stations. The timetable they come up with must ensure better connectivity across the network (Mellors, 2017). SWR should arrange to reduce journey time by providing a homogenous fleet of trains, where faster boarding and alighting will be achievable and thus decreasing dwell times. In addition, SWR
should develop a system whereby customers as compensated promptly in cases of disruption.Lastly, SWR will have to take their crew on a training programme for a period of 3 months before the introduction of the class 701 EMU trains. This induction will prepare the drivers, maintenance staff, guards, and other team members for changes in service performance and new traveling experiences the new fleet will bring to passengers. The drivers, maintenance staff, and depot staff must learn new skills in readiness for the introduction of class 701 EMU trains (Wordsworth, 2020). In the last two weeks of the training, the SWR train crew will have to perform a test run using one of the class 701 EMU trains on the route. This is very important to enable them
walking distance and maximizing the workload balance. SWR should then combine the normalized normal constraint technique with a Pareto filter algorithm to get Pareto solutions for the bi-objective optimization issue (Wang et al., 2017). After developing the schedule using this algorithm, SWR will have to run a series of tests for its management team and crew to understand how it works.Figure 1: Gantt chart of start dates and completion of deliverables
Health care reform passage is a significant aspect of the political work of states’ governors because their decisions build the voters’ trust and influence the population’s prosperity. New Jersey’s Governor Phil Murphy established programs for local clinics and enhanced the efficiency of the Affordable Care Act (ACA) use for expanding the access to medical services for diverse categories of citizens (Phil Murphy, n. d.). Programs such as allowing the clinics to get the Accountable Care Organization status help the state’s facilities to accelerate the quality of treatment; however, many of the novelties are unaffordable for the population.My experience as an AGNP revealed that many patients suffer from severe and chronic conditions that could be prevented if they could pay for advanced health care on time. Improving the affordability
of services through reforms is essential in New Jersey, and Murphy’s attention to addressing the issue would significantly impact the state’s health-related rates (Terrizi et al., 2021). One such legislative update is the state-based health exchange for the year 2021, announced by the governor in 2019 to protect the ACA’s power in insurance operations (State of New Jersey, 2020). Murphy’s campaigns addressed the demand for expanding the affordability of health care services by optimizing the industry’s taxpayers’ expenses. This paper aims to summarize and analyze the interview with New Jersey governor about the State-Based Health Exchange reform under the ACA.Health policy issues must be addressed from the organization’s and government’s perspectives, and the ACA’s update for the State-Based Health Exchange is the regulation to which Murphy paid significant
attention. The industries are being funded both publicly and privately, and although it allows the organizations to improve their services, it severely impacts treatment costs. Furthermore, New Jersey’s governor pointed out that private insurance providers develop fraud schemes that make basic healthcare expensive for the average citizen. The number of such cases increased during Trump’s administration as the ACA regulations received less support from the national Department of Health and Human Services (State of New Jersey, 2020). The threat of insurance-based fraud in the health care services providence enabled Murphy to eliminate the issue by establishing the state-based health exchange regulation. The reform redirected the assessment of premiums to localize the exchange rather than maintain it federally facilitated, making the funds more efficient for the residents (Managed Care
Executive Staff, 2021). The governor also mentioned that the reform’s beneficiaries were mainly the Medicaid program participants.Affordability of health care is a significant challenge for most American states because of the diverse populations’ socioeconomic statuses and financial options. New Jersey’s citizens’ survey conducted in 2020 revealed that “more than three-fourths (77%) adults reported being “worried” or “very worried” about affording some aspect of healthcare in the future” (Altarum, 2020). The ACA was developed and passed by Barack Obama to increase access to medical services, and the state’s governor’s mission was to help the regulations consolidate. Consequently, passing the state-based health exchange regulation became an evidence-based solution supported by the local administration (Managed Care Executive Staff, 2021). Murphy had to discuss the issues of changing the fees’ exchange with
the federal facilities; however, the governor received positive feedback because the health care industry’s problems are of high priority (Phil Murphy, n. d.). The policy update was passed in 2019, and now it helps New Jersey address the COVID-19 pandemic, which became a massive burden on the state’s health care institutions.Establishing the State-Based Health Exchange results in additional autonomy in decision-making related to expenses for insurance coverage, making it affordable for more New Jersey residents. Murphy explained that when the state was involved in the federally-facilitated programs, the individualized health insurance market was unstable, and the bureaucratic procedures made it complicated to timely address the issues (State of New Jersey, 2020). Indeed, the federal-based health exchange programs provide the states with fewer options to operate within their insurance
opportunities and make costs inappropriate for the residents of specific populations. Furthermore, Terrizi et al. (2021) claim that “states with state-based marketplaces have seen higher Medicaid enrollment when compared to states relying on the federal marketplace.” Murphy’s opinion regarding the need for the state-based health exchange in New Jersey proved itself once the COVID-19 pandemic began and forced the administration to fund the health care sector.Conversation with the governor included a discussion of the outcomes and trade-offs associated with the health care reforms passed during Murphy’s administration. Murphy noted that more than 250 thousand New Jersey residents enrolled to receive the insurance since the reform’s policies passage, making health care affordable for a broader scope of the population statewide (State of New Jersey, 2020). The administration’s trade-offs for
passing the reforming policies were related to the demand for becoming a state eligible to switch from the federal-based exchange. Furthermore, Murphy explained that ACA-developing campaigns are supported mainly by Democrats rather than the Republicans, and additional negotiations were necessary (Sances & Clinton, 2019). The outcomes for private insurance providers with political power had been discussed before the passage and included a further legislative revision to identify how the stakeholders’ rights and obligations would update.The citizens and news outlets discuss the effectiveness of the administration’s measures applied to address the COVID-19 pandemic’s outbreak, and the intensely negative opinions exist, influencing the governor’s authority. In response, Murphy mentioned the importance of priorities set and emphasized that the challenge is complicated to address due to the novel nature of the
challenge.The governor’s role in selecting and passing the health care reforms is significant, and the decisions made in the administration influence the daily life and well-being of every citizen. During the times of the COVID-19 pandemic, populations are especially concerned about their insurance and the affordability of medical services. Phil Murphy, New Jersey’s governor, discussed how the reform towards switching from the federal-based exchange to the state-based one benefited the residents and provided the state with additional funding to address the current challenges. Health care reforms were passed to support the ACA regulations and take the insurance market under the local government’s control.
Jazz musicians were not only talented people who presented humanity with a rich cultural heritage. For musicians, the blues has become an opportunity for self-expression, a way to convey their problems and thoughts through music. For some, it also helped to express their identity, their real inner world. Moreover, like many in those days, jazz musicians faced difficulties related to gender and race issues. In some cases, the musical life was accompanied by global life changes: a person lived a life that was not one’s own, being a different personality. The purpose of this work is to reflect on the topic of another identity, namely, what would be one’s own another persona.In times of the development of the blues, there was a problem related to the sexual issue.
A talented woman who wanted to connect her life with a musical career could not do it as a woman. In those times, only a man had the possibility to build a professional jazz career. Thus, there were cases when women lived the life of a man for these purposes, and this secret was revealed only after death. Thus, Joss Moody, the main character of Jackie Kay’s Trumpet, anatomically born female, lives his entire life as a man (Amideo, 2018). The book is interesting in the context of reflections on identity, gender, and race. Moreover, the writer expressed these questions against the backdrop of musical art, using an unusual narrative. In this regard, it would be interesting to reflect on the topic of another identity in the context
of one’s own life.However, the book is not as straightforward as it might seem at first glance. In fact, this is a reflection on many things in life, such as family and loved persons, private and public life, fame, and its consequences. Every public person has two worlds, one that is visible to everyone, for the press and fans, and the other is a private personal one. Sometimes these two worlds differ dramatically: a person can seem happy and careless, but in fact, be desolate. For creative people, especially jazz musicians, the differences can be even more dramatic since music usually contributes to better self-expression.Talking about what one’s other personality could be, it will be based on the life experiences. Now, I am a student, and I spend
a lot of time studying. However, I used to play sports and could probably build a career related to sports. Thus, the other person might be a famous athlete, aged 30, in the twilight of his career. Usually, I give myself entirely to the activity that I like and spend a lot of energy on becoming a professional in the chosen field. However, at the moment, my life is related to studies, and my goal is to get an education.Thereby, based on my passion for sports, my another personality could be a famous sportsman. The life associated with sports involves many challenges and difficulties, including competitions, motivation, injuries, and the end of a career. Being a 30-year-old athlete, namely a professional football player, the career is followed by
the same difficulties in terms of ambition, playing time, and club selection. One is often faced with a difficult choice: to stay in a club that has never held a championship position and try to achieve a triumph, or to move to another club. However, an attempt to move to a stronger club may result in a lack of playing time if there is not enough qualification. Besides, it formulates differences in career goals, namely, my alternative personality wants to achieve success in sport and to gain world-famous football titles. As a student, my career goals aim to develop myself in my chosen field and obtain an education.Similarly, my alternate personality faced a serious problem, as every footballer’s dream is the titles won with one’s club. However, there
The article Jihad vs. McWorld, written by Benjamin R. Barber, explores the two possible political models that may emerge in the future. Both of them are non-democratic but promote slightly different values and approaches towards the distribution of power among the countries. They are called the McWorld model and the Jihad model. They may exist separately in different societies and, at the same time, coexist in one country.McWorld is empowered by the four imperatives: a market imperative, a resource imperative, an information-technology imperative, and an ecological imperative. These four constituents of the system will enable the countries to create a universal rational society but in a homogenized, depoliticized, commercialized, and bureaucratized manner. The Jihad model regards war not as a political instrument but as an emblem of identity
and a way to express the community’s will. Though both systems have natural politics, each of them appears to have traits that are typical of antipolitics. McWorld prioritizes laissez-faire market principles as a guiding force for society. The Jihad model, however, appears to vote for the dictatorship, military government, or theocratic fundamentalism. Both models deny democracy and do not consider its guiding principles and forces appealing or beneficial for society.That is why neither of these two systems is beneficial for the democratic world of today, but there are slightly noticeable tendencies towards the transition to these models in some countries. However, if the democratic powers still have the opportunities to prevent such a dark future for the whole system and the world in general. It is possible because
the desire for self-government, expression of participation, and representation exists even in the most traditionalized and hierarchical countries and societies.The article The Clash of Civilizations by Samuel P. Huntington deals with the phenomenon of possible global conflicts that may inflame in the future, not between the countries but between the whole civilizations. The author stresses that the conflict of civilization will be the latest phase of the evolution of conflicts that exist or existed in the world throughout the course of history. However, despite the fact that the majority of the conflicts in the modern world are characterized by ideological or economic reasons, the future conflict of civilizations will inflame due to culture-related ones.There exist several reasons for this supposition. They concern the religious, cultural, historical, language, and
