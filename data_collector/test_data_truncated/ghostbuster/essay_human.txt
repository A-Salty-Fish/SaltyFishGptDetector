military invasion in years. Many people have been displaced, and many Ukrainian citizens have fled neighboring countries for peace. Gunshots and artillery fires have been raining down on residential areas in Ukraine, with several media houses and newspapers reporting the events and sharing the news with the rest of the world.Various newspapers have reported the news differently, with the difference seen in headlines, videos and images posted. The two newspapers covering the events in Ukraine are the New York Times and Le Monde, a French newspaper. While New York Times and Le Monde report the same event, the two use very different terms to describe similar activities. In the recent takeover of the city of Kharkiv by the Russian forces, for example, the NYT headline read “Russian Troops Take Over Kharkiv,” Le Monde , on the other hand, read “La Russie A Envahi Kharkiv” to mean “Russia Has Invaded Kharkiv.” Recently a video of Ukrainian citizens making Molotov cocktail Petrol bombs was shared. The headline in NYT read, “Ukraine Prepare Molotov Cocktail In Kyiv.” Le Monde ‘s headline read “Ukrainian Resistance Using Molotov Bombs.” Because headlines are the deciding factor for people to read an article, newspapers make them enticing. The New York Times uses headlines that suggest this is another world war, while Le Monde downplays the illegality of what Russia is doing. The differences seen in the headlines of the two newspapers are all for the attraction of their audiences; each magazine writes eye-catching unique topics.
Kidnapping is a crime that involves the illegal seizing and carrying away of an individual by force or trickery, as well as the unauthorized detention and imprisonment of a person against their consent. Thus, in my opinion, a felony of attempt should be punished in the same way as the underlying substantive offence. In the preceding case, for example, one may contend that if Jerry is charged with the real criminal of bank robbery, he must have planned to execute the felony (Roberson & O’Reilley, 2020). Another example is that if a defendant is unable to carry out a murder, the crime is reduced to attempted murder. Even though the suspect did not obligate to the offense, he had the objective to do so, and hence the punishment ought to be the same. Regardless, other elements might have a role in the decision. Nevertheless, below is how I feel the above case should be handled. To begin with, abduction is classified as a second (legal wrongdoing) or a first-degree crime under criminal procedure. The third level of hijacking is a permissible offense classified as a class B felony.Surprisingly, kidnapping is equivalent to grabbing to the following extent. Abduction in the first degree is also a class A-I legal violation (Roberson & O’Reilley, 2020). People are guilty of this offence if they expect an outsider to pay or transfer money or property as a payment or persuade them to stop pursuing a distinct possibility. Capturing may be a problematic criminal concept, especially given the distinctions involving snatching
on that fact, Jerry should not be convicted of the crime since he did not have transportation. Moreover, denying one’s freedom is the most significant aspect of abduction. While Jerry was able to depart the scene immediately, he compelled the cashier to follow him into the bank parking lot. When he gets to the intended area, though, he frees the hostage. As a result, Jerry does not intend to deprive the bank employee of their freedom since he later frees the individual based on the given facts.In summary, the use of force towards the bank teller cannot be one of a separate crime from what is intended by the accused in the first place. Jerry wants to rob the bank, and thus, the crime is robbery. Any wrongdoing that arises from and within this intended offense will be absorbed into the crime itself. It is worth mentioning that robbery is a criminal offense under common law since threats or force are used to take things from another person illegally. As a result, the use of aggression against the bank clerk is an intrinsic aspect of the robbery that cannot be isolated from it.
involvement. It resulted in creating an unpopular and ineffective strategy that cultivated dissatisfaction among workers. Etihad Airways ignored employees’ need for self-actualization, decreasing their motivation. The remaining workers did not feel their importance to the corporation and the power to influence its development. It demonstrates that modern workers should be provided with the chance to participate in corporate decision-making to realize their significance and become motivated.Trying to manage the wage bill, Etihad Airways accepted the wrong decision, viewing layoff as the only possible option. The choice of disability and age as criteria for decision-making infringed on the existing labor laws. Moreover, it undermined job security as employees realized their vulnerable position. Outcomes prove the low effectiveness of this strategy. Regarding the absence of available manpower, the remaining employees started to suffer from burnout because of the high level of stress. Moreover, the lack of motivation and engagement because of the processes mentioned above influenced their performance. As a result, Etihad Airways’ ability to achieve existing objectives was hindered. The case proves the critical importance of employee involvement in decision-making during the change process as it helps to motivate them and select the most acceptable options.
Painters and authors use their skills to address issues that affect their societies. It is very easy for one to understand the happenings in a community by viewing a painted work or reading a literary work established in a given society within a specific time. Looking at different pieces of literature and paintings offers the understanding that humans do not choose to fit into specific movements as often implied. For example, an author writing about social injustice mostly does that after experiencing the issue in their society. Artists living during such a period will also tend to depict images of society members in postures or situations depicting plights or sufferings. The present work delves into the paintings and literary works of Vermeer Johannes and John Steinbeck, respectively, to show that painters and literature developers mainly generate their jobs as directed by their immediate environments. Vermeer and Steinbeck’s works, lives, and choice of the realism movement and themes are worthy aspects that depict the characters’ parallels.General AnalysisThere exist numerous similarities between Vermeer and Steinbeck based on their lives and works. For example, both Vermeer and Steinbeck were their parents’ dearest children, with each set determined to see the child excel in life (Newlin, 2019). Vermeer was introduced to the art world by his father, an art dealer, who wanted the boy to inherit the family’s art business. Furthermore, Steinbeck was introduced to writing by her mother and father, who wanted him to become a scholar. Such settings thus show the role of the folks’ childhood lives and
their parents to their later careers. Similarly, Vermeer and Steinbeck’s determination in life made them make tough decisions in life. Vermeer joined Catholicism to get a wife and become a member of a wealthy family. Steinbeck further struggled with the idea of religion to the point of assuming a pagan life that insisted on human’s inability to explain the nature of God. The similarities in such occurrences make Vermeer and Steinbeck substantially similar.Vermeer’s paintings depict his immediate surroundings, just like Steinbeck’s writings. The painting of Christ in the House of Martha and Mary is influenced by Vermeer’s conversion to Catholicism, while Steinbeck’s narrative on Oklahoma immigrants to California is influenced by his real-life experiences. The desire to present their work as reality also led Vermeer and Steinbeck to choose the realism movement and themes (Wuestman, 2017). Vermeer uses expensive color to depict his painted characters as real as possible. Steinbeck also uses real location names and true historical incidents to establish his work and themes. All these concepts make Vermeer and Steinbeck very comparable. The characters’ lives and works provoke one to think that the two lived during the same time. However, the point that Vermeer lived during the seventeenth century, while Steinbeck is a twentieth century writer implies their connectedness.Specific Works’ ExaminationNothing makes the understanding of Johannes’ artistic work better than the investigation of his pieces. The Girl with the Glass Wine and the Girl with a Pearl Earring , for example, present some of his most-liked pieces of art. The two show classic female
characters in calm surroundings and a wealthy lifestyle. For instance, The Girl with the Glass Wine depicts a luxuriously cladded young woman. The character’s economic freedom allows her to interact with the wine and elite male folks, some things only known to the wealthy families during the age. Johannes also prints the girl in the image using classy paints and pigments to show her social status. Red, yellow, and blue shades are prevalent in the painting to show influence. Other items appearing in the printed work, such as cut lemon, white (costly) jug, and a large portrait of the family’s grandparent, also work together to depict the prevailing culture of then Elite Dutch society. Vermeer applies expensive warm colors and fine artistic skills to present the art as authentic as possible, giving the piece its realism aspect.On the other hand, John Steinbeck’ works mainly capture real-life familiarities directly experienced during the writer’s life in the state of California. Born in February 1902, Steinbeck encountered first-hand all the happenings of the First World War and the great depression, which made the lives of many Americans unstable. Steinbeck’s father (Ernst Steinbeck) was a Monterey County treasurer, while his mother (Olive Hamilton) served as a school teacher of English literature. The parents played a significant role in the author’s life and the eventual writing career. Having money allowed the parents to send the young John to school to have formal education. Therefore, the author’s situation is similar to that of Vermeer Johannes, whose wealthy father led him to the
times caused by the Great Depression. However, the friends, George and Lennie, fail to realize their targets as one of them ends up dying in the hands of the other, just like it happened in reality.In conclusion, the centrality of realism themes and similarities in lives depict the noteworthy connectedness between Vermeer and Steinbeck. The two belong to different ages, cultures, and social settings that would otherwise make their works very different. However, seeking to cover social issues in their respective communities makes Vermeer and Steinbeck’s works and themes very similar, one would even think they lived during the same period and in the same neighborhood. Developers of literary works and artists, especially in realism, can only depict the happenings in their communities for the work to be meaningful. That is because the surroundings serve as the field from where writers and painters gather information.
questions.Another important business principle is proper cash flow management. Healthcare facility requires renovations and innovations, meaning that there will constantly be situations when new equipment or repairs will be needed (Mason et al., 2020). In this situation, it is highly necessary to implement the needed changes to not jeopardize patients’ health and well-being. For example, as a CNO, it was my obligation to manage the replacement of power generators. As a result, generators enabled the personnel to carry out their duty without problems during a storm and power outage.The last principle is the management of employees and providing them with motivation. In the case of a healthcare facility, it is essential that the employees are rewarded and their hard work is appreciated. The employees are offered extra days off and gift cards in the given facility. This can make the workers feel heard and supported. Without these steps, the nurses and doctors will have burnout and lose the desire to provide high-quality results.Thus, the given principles were chosen due to the impact they can bring on employees and patients. The mentioned principles are being used, providing good results and leading to the satisfaction of all parties. These principles are important to me since I believe that healthcare should be based on these values. Otherwise, no facility will be able to treat their patients, and there will be no trust and respect between healthcare personnel and patients.
The nature of mythology and its persistence in culture throughout thousands of years has long fascinated scholars and thinkers. Joseph Campbell’s book entitled The hero with a thousand faces investigates this issue in detail to reveal how myth as a psychologically informed phenomenon predetermines cultural patterns of humanity. In this paper, the first chapter of the book, “Myth and dream,” will be at the center of the discussion.The thesis of this part might be projected through the following quote. The author states that myths “are dangerous because they threaten the fabric of the security into which we have built ourselves and our family. But they are fiendishly fascinating too, for they carry keys that open the whole realm of the desired and feared adventure of the discovery of the self” (Campbell, 2004, p. 7). Such a formulation implies that people’s minds intertwine myths and dreams as a mechanism of self-perception, understanding of the self in the context of the whole life cycle, and coping with developmental change.Myths lead people through the challenges of life and allow for integrating the conscious and subconscious into a single framework. Indeed, prior to presenting the idea in the above-mentioned quote, Campbell (2004) refers to the repetitive occurrence of the terrors and irrationalities from ancient mythology in contemporary people’s dreams. Indeed, the motifs of hatred, vanity, jealousy are intertwined with love, gratitude, and other feelings and motivations to action. In such a manner, these matters are dangerous to people because they unveil the psychological underpinnings of their subconscious in ways that contradict their rational or conscious decision-making and thinking.The author elaborates on this central idea by referring to the letters written by people about their myth-like dreams reflecting their concerns or subconscious struggles. Campbell (2004) presents an example of a young man’s dream about accidentally killing his father to obtain the full attention of his mother, which has been a recurring theme in mythology. Furthermore, the author refers to a dream of a woman who sees a half-horse-half-man individual in her dream despite any ideas of infidelity experienced consciously. In this regard, the connection between the experiences of early childhood and adulthood is essential for myths and their manifestation in dreams. This observation helps explain the second part of the quote, which states that through the contradictions of the myth-like dreams, people can understand their selves and the subconscious triggers of their emotions and behaviors.
Recent fad diets have suggested that carbohydrates cause harm to one’s body. However, this statement has been refuted many times for several reasons. Firstly, to get a beautiful, efficiently functioning body, one needs nutrients – fats, proteins, carbohydrates, and water (Nazario). Carbohydrate metabolism converts carbs into vital energy for the nervous system and brain, as well as for the possibility of proper metabolism of proteins and fats. Once these elements are eliminated, there is a high risk of developing continuous fatigue, which potentially leads to depressive mood.Secondly, giving up carbohydrates leads to extra pounds because after completing a carb-free diet, the body is susceptible to every gram of carbohydrates, and super-compensation occurs in the diet. In addition to an increased appetite for carbohydrate-containing foods, the assimilation of this element increases significantly (Nazario). For example, a person was on such a diet for a month and lost ten pounds, and then immediately returned to a regular diet, regaining the same weight within a week. Thirdly, even after the first day of giving up carbohydrates, a person may feel a slight malaise and headache (Nazario). Later, there is a chance of developing constant headaches leading to migraine.Ultimately, carbohydrates are the primary source of energy for the brain. All cognitive functions slowly fade away when the main “engine” ceases to receive sufficient charge. Almost every activity demands increased brain activity which is stimulated by carbs (Nazario). When a person does not consume them, primarily the level of concentration reduces. Constant burning of ketones instead of glucose can lead to impaired brain function. Therefore, it is vital to include carbs into one’s ration in order to ensure that all bodily systems function properly.
The subject of euthanasia is an extremely delicate topic of discussion which is surrounded by numerous ethical debates. Generally speaking, euthanasia as a term is used to describe deliberate action to painlessly terminate a person’s life to put an end to their pain. On the one hand, advocates of euthanasia speak about one’s right to make their own decision in regard to life and death and call the act ‘mercy killing’ due to it relieving people of suffering. On the other hand, euthanasia opponents argue about the sanctity of life and equal the act to murder. However, from the point of view of a few ethical theories – namely, teleology, deontology, and Levina’s “face of the other” – euthanasia is deeply unethical and contradicts all possible moral laws.Teleology is the study of things in terms of the purposes they serve, and it was heavily relied on by Aristotle. He believed that there was a reason for everything – including human life: he saw it as organized and directed towards the final end. As for what Aristotle considered the final end, it was “complete good” – happiness, the ultimate goal of all our activities that renders a human life “in need of nothing” (Aristotle, 2017, p. 247). Evidently, all of our activities are aimed at achieving a goal, although most of them are means to achieving other goals. Happiness is a goal in and of itself – the ultimate goal; as such, it is the highest good. The problem is that different people tend to disagree with
deemed inherently wrong. Therefore, the act of euthanasia is unethical from the perspective of Kant’s deontological theory as well.“Face of the other” is the theory of Emmanuel Lévinas – a French philosopher of the 20th century – that proposes that people are responsible for one another in face-to-face encounters. He stated that his ethical relation to loving others comes from his inability to survive alone and find meaning “within its own being-in-the-world, within the ontology of sameness” (My Jewish Learning, n.d.). According to Lévinas, another person’s right to exist takes precedence over one’s own right, and it is embodied in an ethical decree: one shall not kill, and one shall not endanger the life of another. Consequently, from this perspective, the act of euthanasia would be regarded as violence to someone else’s life.As a result, euthanasia is likely to be considered unethical from the point of view of any of these theories. From a teleological viewpoint, things that lead to one’s life being happy or good cannot be pursued – therefore, euthanasia, with its end result being death, could hardly be viewed as something positive. Moreover, in accordance with Kant’s deontological theory, there are acts that are always wrong, regardless of the outcome, which fits euthanasia – essentially, a killing that frees one of pain. Additionally, Lévinas speaks about putting someone’s life higher than his own due to the existence being meaningful only with others in it – euthanasia, from his perspective, would be deemed an infringement on another’s life.
IntroductionMarijuana has been used for several thousand years in various directions. In the West, for the first time, medical use became known thanks to the work of Professor O’Shaughnessy, who personally observed the process of her treatment in India (Cerdá et al. 167). After a series of experiments, he began to use it for patients with rabies, epilepsy and tetanus. Over the following years, the opinion of experts has constantly been changing, and discussions about the ratio of benefits and harms are still ongoing. Evidence of medical use of marijuana varies from proven clinical cases to speculative claims. Despite its long history and positive feedback from patients in various fields, one must not forget that cannabis has psychoactive properties, so its turnover should be limited. The legal status and availability of the remedy are ambiguous for many countries.Forms of Medical CannabisThe Cannabis sativa plant contains more than 100 compounds, including terpenes, flavonoids and – most importantly for medical purposes – cannabinoids (Ali 25). The most common cannabinoid is delta-9-tetrahydrocannabinol (THC), which has psychotropic properties and is capable of causing euphoria (Grassa et al. 1678). The next most common cannabinoid is cannabidiol (CBD), which is not psychotropic. THC and CBD are the most studied cannabinoids. Evidence suggests that other cannabinoids and terpenoids may also have potential medical applications and that different cannabis compounds may work synergistically, enhancing each other’s effect.Opinions on the Legalization of Medical CannabisOpponentsAmong psychiatrists, there are opponents of the use of marijuana. They warn that legal cannabis, even with limited use in medicine and
veterinary medicine, will easily get out of control and will contribute to the additional spread of drug addiction among the population (Nosarieme 293). Opinions are given about the risk of mental disorders, a decrease in long-term memory. The danger is the statement about the harmlessness of marijuana. There is concern that the burden on law enforcement agencies will sharply increase, which will have to deal with the purpose of using cannabis in detainees.Studies have shown that adolescents who use marijuana have noticed anxiety and deterioration in the educational process (Larkin and Madras 590). Colorado was the first to legalize marijuana in 2012 (Page et al. 145). Scientists at the University of Colorado stated that since legalization, the number of patients admitted to hospitals in a serious conditions caused by cannabis has tripled (Cerdá et al. 169). Opponents of legalization are also confident that legalization will lead to the emergence of a black market for marijuana. It is economically more profitable for producers to trade illegally than to pay taxes to the state and be under its control.SupportersSupporters of changing the law emphasize the need to use medical cannabis as an adjunct to pain relief for different illnesses. In addition, they refer to the results of the experience of other countries where there is no ban on marijuana, which has allowed to reduce in drug trafficking on the black market (Ali 25). A number of studies have shown that the crime rate began to drop markedly in the US states where marijuana was legalized (Grassa et al.
1677). For example, in the states bordering Mexico, the number of crimes decreased by 13% (Nosarieme 294).Results of Cannabis LegalizationThe process was initiated by Uruguay and Canada, which allowed the use of marijuana in 2001 (Larkin and Madras 579). Smoking is not prohibited for persons over the age of 18 in special places (Page et al. 138). The position of the official authorities is neutral. In some countries, the law allows to have marijuana for one’s own use and to breed from 5 to 15 bushes at home for personal needs (Nosarieme 292). In Colorado, Georgia and Washington in the USA, two years after the legalization of marijuana in 2013, there were fewer patients going to drug treatment centers (Ali 21). The suicide rate has hardly changed. According to police statistics, employees have received more opportunities to investigate serious crimes and preventative law enforcement activities. Consumption of other narcotic drugs has not increased (as shown in the graph) and alcohol consumption has decreased.However, it is also possible to highlight the negative consequences of the legalization of marijuana. The Canadian Association of Psychiatrists demands that the sale of cannabis be restricted to 25 years (Grassa et al. 1669). Doctors say that the passion of young people affects the development of thinking abilities, memory, attention, and learning ability and destroys intelligence. In addition, marijuana becomes a catalyst for people at risk for mental illness. These include people with stressful work, stress and dysfunctional heredity.The Use of Cannabis in MedicineChemotherapyChemotherapeutic drugs are administered to cancer patients in courses for
several weeks. They are effective but highly toxic; treatment is accompanied by severe side effects that worsen the quality of life of patients. One of the unpleasant consequences is severe nausea and vomiting, which are almost impossible to control. Patients try to eat less, and can not stand the sight and smell of food, which leads to exhaustion and depression. Sometimes they interrupt therapy, despite the deadly risk.Antiemetic drugs relieve the condition, but they are not always effective, and their prolonged use causes complications. Marijuana has been proposed as a less harmful alternative. Since 1985, oncologists have been allowed to use synthetic tetrahydrocannabinol in capsules, but Alfred Chang’s research has shown that bioavailability when smoking is much higher (Larkin and Madras 578). Cannabis treats nausea by increasing appetite (which prokinetics do not do), and also has an analgesic effect, which potentially allows to give up narcotic analgesics.Multiple Sclerosis and EpilepsyClinical manifestations of multiple sclerosis are diverse and depend on the localization of foci of myelin destruction. Etiotropic therapy is absent; the disease is irreversible, so combinations of expensive symptomatic drugs are used. Marijuana relieves tremors and partial loss of coordination. There have been documented cases when cannabis effectively coped with focal seizures in epilepsy (Cerdá et al. 171). Even under the condition of illegal purchase, it was cheaper than traditional treatment. Anticonvulsive properties also helped with tremors of various origins (infections, organic pathology of the central nervous system, and dystonia).Anorexia in the Treatment of HIV/AIDSTaking antiretroviral drugs can depress digestion and cause nausea, which increases the
risk of exhaustion for patients who are already losing weight due to the disease. Cannabis not only excites hunger but enhances the taste and pleasure of food. After the 1971 studies, Dronabinol was allowed to be used in the USA since it turned out to be safer and more effective in comparison with Megestrol (Page et al. 149). Cannabis treatment of anorexia with HIV infection Marinol is possible only in some foreign countries by prescription. Many patients resort to ordinary smoking marijuana. They indicate that it relieved symptoms more effectively than a synthetic analog.Chronic PainTraditionally, chronic pain was treated with opiates and synthetic analgesics. This led to dangerous complications in the form of gastrointestinal bleeding, ulcers and renal-hepatic insufficiency. The combination of sedative and analgesic action allows the use of cannabis for pathologies such as osteoarthritis and phantom pain after limb amputation. Although marijuana is inferior to opiates in the power of pain relief, smoking on demand is accompanied by fewer side effects and rarely causes addiction. Cannabis is becoming a means of choice for people suffering from migraines, as many of them simply do not help analgesics.Rare Cases of Medical UseCannabis helps only a small part of patients, so it is rather an exception to the rule. This is due to the use of pharmaceutical drugs in the treatment of fairly rare symptoms and side effects. There is reason to believe that marijuana is likely to benefit in the treatment of diseases, the list of which is presented below.GlaucomaIn an experiment at the University of
usually depend on the scale of the firm, its level of income, and its current position in the market. The easiest and most accessible way to pay for Advanced Document System is from the cash flow, especially if the company has a surplus of profit. Some companies do not possess many employees and income, and they can take a bank loan to cover the costs of the system. The bank loan can also be helpful when the service is needed for many seats that have to be united and optimized. Then, the costs spent on the system increase, and extra funding might be needed.To increase the cash flow, the company can also go to the equity market and issue the stocks. The more stocks are sold to shareholders, the more cash flow the firm receives and can use for different needs. The other way to find alternative funding sources is to issue bonds that represent a fixed-income instrument. A bond is a debt obligation meaning that the company loans from an investor a specific sum of money. Bonds are safe for investors and faster to get for the company because more people invest in bonds as a safer method. Finally, the company can use mixed funding to get the cash for the payment which means uniting several methods described above. All the funding opportunities are possible for buying and implementing the Advanced Documentation System.
Carbohydrates are energy-giving foods that enable the body to function well. Every person needs plenty of carbohydrates in their diet to remain healthy and carry out their daily tasks properly. Scientists recommend that carbohydrates form between 45% and 65% of one’s daily consumption (Wali et al., 2021). High carbohydrates uptake translates to high calories and sufficient energy for the body. The paper will discuss carbohydrate consumption and the composition of carbohydrate sources.Some of the foods that contain high contents of carbohydrates are wheat which can be consumed as wheat grain or wheat flour and differ in their functionality in the body. Wheat flour from wheat grain is obtained by milling the wheat grain to remove the outer part of the kernel, which are the bran and germ. There is a variation in the chemical composition of the bran and portions of the kernel’s endosperm. The kernel contains starch as the major carbohydrate in its endosperm. The kernel also contains free gas, pentosans, and glucofructans. The outermost layer of the wheat kernel, the bran, has starch as a contaminant of the endosperm. The bran also contains carbohydrate materials such as free gas and cellulose.Carbohydrates come from different foods, including fruits, green vegetables, roots, and legumes. Sugar types found in fruits are three in total, namely glucose, fructose, and sucrose (Ludwig et al., 2018). Glucose is utilized in the body by the brain and muscles, while fructose is used in the functioning of the liver. Sucrose is broken down into fructose and glucose to give the body energy.
activity one does. People who engage in rigorous activities must take more carbohydrate-rich foods than those who do not. One must understand the type of activity they engage in to avoid excessive consumption of carbohydrates. Carbohydrates have different functions in the body that are dependent on the types of carbohydrates. Carbohydrates primarily give the body the energy to do activities that involve muscles or just body movement. People under instructions from doctors to avoid high content carbohydrates due to underlying conditions should consume low carbohydrate foods such as vegetables and some fruits. Carbohydrates that occur naturally in fruits and vegetables are less harmful to the body than added sugars. One should consult their doctor on the kind of fruits and vegetables to consume depending on the seriousness of their condition.
IntroductionCoordination in healthcare is a critical activity supporting healthcare’s efficient and successful transmission. Healthcare regulations, ethical resource development, and many other essential aspects of healthcare should be considered while coordinating treatment for patients. Care coordination also considers a patient’s psychological requirements, cultural viewpoint, ethics, and other specific features that provide satisfaction throughout the treatment process. A selected patient’s hypertension will be examined, and a tentative care coordination plan prepared to address the patient’s needs. Hypertension is a condition in which blood pressure is greater than it should be. Nearly 50% of the US population from around 54 to 74 years has hypertension (Carey & Whelton, 2018). Thus, a coordinated care plan will benefit the patient and anybody else who may be affected by the condition. The number of instances of hypertension has risen, and the primary reason is people’s lifestyles.Patient-Centered Health InterventionsEffective interventions should place the patient at the heart of the treatment and clinical endeavors. Patient-centered care entails including the patient in the treatment process and taking an active role. Patients may make a significant difference in the quality of healthcare they get if they are adequately involved (Fowler, 2017). The patient in this study was a 65-year-old woman diagnosed with hypertension in July 2019. The important statistics are BP 141/90, HR 108 bpm, temperature 38 °C, and RR 37 bpm. When the patient learned about her illness, she became interested in care coordination and made the plan better and faster. She stated that she was eager to learn more about the disease and what
she could do to maintain a normal life despite having a disability. Her hypertension would cause several health problems; thus, it was critical to point out three of them.Stroke or Heart AttackA heart attack can occur because of the hardening and thickening of the arteries caused by hypertension (atherosclerosis). It is common knowledge that a heart attack happens when there is a blockage of blood flow to the heart, resulting in a blood clot formation. A stroke is a similar obstruction of blood flow but affects the brain (Wang et al., 2018). They do, nevertheless, follow a similar pattern, and patients with high blood pressure should be on the lookout for any of these health problems since they are more likely to occur.The best ways to prevent heart problems for the patient in question include quitting smoking and drinking alcohol, getting enough exercise, managing their blood sugar and cholesterol levels, and losing or maintaining their current weight. With the support of a medical coordination cooperation team, the patient can accomplish this. Another way to improve this is to incorporate a shared resource to provide the patient with more information about their treatment options (Wang et al., 2018). Health Partners Regional Hospital, Mayo Clinic, and University of Minnesota Medical Center are excellent community resources.DepressionLearning about hypertension might significantly affect a patient’s mental and emotional health. Because this is a long-term ailment, the patient will need to alter her lifestyle and spend a significant amount of money to guarantee that she receives the best possible treatment (Fowler, 2017).
All of these things may take a toll on the patient. Depression is a serious problem because its symptoms and indications might be mistaken for those of other medical conditions.In the treatment of depression, patient-centered interventions include ensuring that the patient maintains her daily activities, uses medication when symptoms appear, educates the patient about depression, and gets the patient’s social circle more involved in her overall health and well-being (Wang et al., 2018). The University of Minnesota Medical Center, Mayo Clinic, psychiatric hospitals, the Minnesota Department of Human Services, and other community services might be consulted if a patient suffers from depression.DementiaBlocked arteries cause vascular dementia, and constricted arteries hinder blood flow to the brain. Strokes are thought to be a contributing factor in people developing dementia. Cognitive decline is one of the hallmarks of dementia (decline in memory, problem-solving skills, and language) (Fowler, 2017). Patients with high blood pressure should know that poor health and lifestyle decisions can lead to dementia, a chronic and progressive disease.Workouts, multisensory stimulation, and medication are all examples of patient-centered therapies (pharmacology). Reminiscence, reassurance, and aromatherapy are some of the methods used to treat those with dementia (Wang et al., 2018). The Minnesota Guardians Pharmacy, the University of Minnesota Medical Center, and the Mayo Clinic are among the local community services that can assist patients in dealing with dementia.Ethical considerations in patient-centered healthcare interventionsHealthcare has a crucial role in upholding ethical standards and should be performed following moral principles. According to the Institute of Medicine (IOM), patient-centered treatment includes ethical
considerations as a core component (Fowler, 2017). This includes making sure that patients are treated with respect and consideration at all times. American Nurses Association’s (ANA) Code of Ethics encourages nurses to guarantee that they adhere to their professional standards. The ethical principles of healthcare delivery, such as benevolence, independence, nonmaleficence, and impartiality, are crucial criteria for ensuring that treatment is provided ethically. Improving care coordination is made possible by ethical and moral healthcare practices.When it comes to caring coordination, ethical questions arise and are critical, such as whether the patient’s well-being has been considered. Additionally, whether care coordination has improved patient safety and healthcare quality is another matter (Wang et al., 2018). Team members might reflect on what they would have achieved if the problem had been more personal (maybe to a family member or friend). Quality care and patient outcomes may be ensured if concerns are dealt with ethically, and the patient is given the finest treatment available.Continuity and Coordination of Care in Health PolicyHealth policies play a critical role in ensuring that healthcare is ethical and compliant with applicable laws. Health policy should also consider ethical deliberations, a critical part of the care integration strategy. The government and the organizations established to monitor and operationalize healthcare operations set health policies. They are designed to ensure that healthcare goals are met quickly and effectively (Wang et al., 2018). The Affordable Care Act (ACA), commonly known as Obamacare after President Barack Obama, who advocated for its passage, is a major healthcare policy. Regardless of how
it is perceived, the law has had a substantial influence on the process of care coordination and continuity.The Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA) is a regulation that controls patient information privacy and insurance coverage for health care services under its purview. It aims to make healthcare more accessible to more people, regardless of where they live in the country or where the federal government has authority over them at any one moment. A multidisciplinary approach, trust, and privacy in care coordination make it possible for patients to share their private medical information with a wide range of specialists (Hu et al., 2018). HIPAA guarantees that care coordination uses patient data in the most effective manner possible.Both Obamacare and HIPAA assure patient assistance in times of need. Hypertension may significantly influence patients, and they should obtain the best available care (Hu et al., 2018). Additionally, the Care Continuum and Coordination Act improves patient care by allowing them to continue receiving healthcare services for a given time. Effective health policy provisions are important tools if a patient is nearing the end of their life and cannot pay for treatment.Priorities a Care Coordinator Would IntroduceLearning sessions are essential to improve care coordination. The best method to implement a care coordination strategy is to provide patients with regular educational opportunities (Liang et al., 2017). These opportunities will assist patients in grasping the need for care coordination better. Many key aspects of the patient’s care coordination plan were emphasized. We effectively coordinated and dealt with the difficulties that developed
Rolling Stones were in the shadow of the Beatles from the very beginning, and this fact disturbed them a lot. On the other hand, most of the fame went to the Beatles, and the Rolling Stones constantly felt their superiority. To be different, they tried to become the anti-Beatles. The legendary Beatles were a pioneer of hard rock: the musical influence of the song Helter Skelter led to the emergence of heavy metal (Covach and Bell 28). The influence of The Rolling Stones on the formation and development of rock music cannot be overestimated. It was significant not only in music, like the Beatles but also in artistic and visual, image and mass media terms.In songwriting development, the Rolling Stones tried hard to keep up with their competitors, but it was not easy, and they seemed to be one step behind. A lot of what they did was a reaction to what the Beatles had already done. For example, when a sitar began to sound in the Beatles’ composition, it immediately appeared in the Rolling Stones. The Beatles, with their working-class origins in provincial Liverpool, sought to maintain an elegant image (Covach and Bell 28). They dressed in decent suits, cut their hair neatly and short, and communicated politely with everyone. The Rolling Stones did the opposite: they wore black leather clothes and looked and behaved provocatively.In 1964, when The Beatles first came to the US, it was called the British invasion (Covach and Bell 28). The Beatles took all five first places in the Billboard singles chart at once and became the only ones who were able to set such a record (Covach and Bell 28). The Rolling Stones also achieved success in the US, mainly through shocking exposure, but they did not shake the Beatles’ position. Many of the rock bands of the 60s, The Beatles and The Rolling Stones, are seen as irreconcilable rivals. The reasons to think so are quite weighty: they played different music and had different images. However, both groups have influenced music around the world and have become one of the most recognizable – this is their main similarity.
such mutations can also occur in humans. The ADRB1 gene, for example, is responsible for regulating the amount of sleep a person needs each night to function properly. Most humans need eight hours of sleep or more, but about 5% of the population enjoys a slightly different mutant version. Tests done on a mother and daughter who had the mutation revealed the ability to sleep only 4 to 6 hours each night (Servick, 2019). This mutation refers to a type of genomic mutation. The protein encoded by the mutation is a receptor for norepinephrine.This mutation is dominant, autosomal, and beneficial in its effect on the viability of individuals. Changes in the ADRB1 gene occur primarily in humans. However, they can also be in animals, although no studies have yet been conducted. Such a mutation does not affect the human population in the general world. This is mainly due to the fact that it is not dangerous and is not life-threatening to its carriers. Thus, such a mutation is only a positive addition to the life abilities of a human carrier. This mutation is sporadic and is not a dominant trend in population genome changes despite its dominance. I find this example interesting because natural changes in the human genome open up new possibilities for the population. Thus, studying such changes is essential for human development and a deeper study of human capabilities.
health facility to get treated for anxiety, but it soon turned out that he rather struggled with OCD because he strongly smelled of disinfectant and reported excessive cleaning behaviors. After being in contact with surfaces and people, Robert felt a strong urge to wash his hands with bleach. He could wash his hands up to thirty times a day, which damaged his skin dramatically. However, the fear of germs was much stronger, and he could not stand touching something without washing his hands afterward. The issue of cleanliness took a great toll on his mental health.During the pandemic, the symptoms of OCD increased significantly. Robert reported wearing a HAZMAT suit outside, afraid of contracting the virus. In his social life, Robert avoids making physical contact with people and prefers keeping his distance from them. He works remotely from home, which quite pleases him because he does not have to go anywhere and spend time with other people in a confined space. Overall, Robert does not have a dependency on other people when it comes to handling his OCD and prefers being on his own the majority of the time. In Robert’s case, the combination of behavior therapy and pharmacological treatment is possible. Cognitive-behavioral treatment can be implemented for treating Robert’s OCD, including exposure and response prevention and cognitive restructuring (Moody, 2017). It is expected that Robert will feel relief from his symptoms within several weeks.
Physical examination of the affected regions of the skin is necessary. Individuals with cellulitis are likely to have a reddened region of the skin, swelling as well as intense pain (Brown & Watson, 2022). Brant experiences pain in his right leg, in a reddened region that is swollen.The affected area should be thoroughly checked for any signs of skin disintegration. Variations in temperature in the area should be monitored along with signs of an abscess (Sutherland & Parent, 2017). Brant revealed that he was bit by a mosquito on the reddened area.This being a seemingly severe case, the physician may order complete blood count (CBC) testing. This will help measure blood count levels (Bennett et al., 2020). A CBC will allow the physician to make an accurate early diagnosis of a wide range of medical conditions.The physician may also order a C-reactive protein (CRP) test, which is a blood test for inflammation. This would be a necessity since Brant has broken skin because of a mosquito bite (Sutherland & Parent, 2017). Brant’s case is an event of major systemic disturbance since there is a manifestation of chills and acute disorientation.Priority diagnostic criteria for Brant would include assessing the occurrence of erythematous inflammation in the basal dermis and subcutaneous tissue. Redness, swelling, and pain are all signs of cellulitis (Sutherland & Parent, 2017). Erythema must be present in order to make the diagnosis.The location and nature of broken skin should also be assessed. For cellulitis to be diagnosed, the patient’s skin must be checked for micro-abrasions resulting from insect bites (Brown & Watson, 2022). Lower limbs are commonly affected.Brant’s positioning and movement should be adjusted. To reduce swelling in the areas facing downward, Brant’s feet and arms should be propped up on cushions while he lays on his back (Zariquiey-Esteva & Santa-Candela, 2017). If Brant stands for a long time, speedy blood flow to the heart may be hindered, which could cause low blood pressure.Brant may also need to be placed on his side in the recovery position, particularly whenever he feels nauseated or feels like vomiting. From the assessment, he feels nauseated and weak and has vomited on numerous occasions (Zariquiey-Esteva & Santa-Candela, 2017). This will help avoid low blood pressure.When germs break through the skin, “cytokines” and “neutrophils” are released into the bloodstream to fight them off. This causes cellulitis, which is characterized by redness, warmth, swelling, and pain (Brown & Watson, 2022, para 5). This appears to have been the case for Brant. He was bitten by a mosquito, which broke his skin, allowing bacteria (Streptococcus pyogenes) to penetrate the area. An outbreak of redness and swelling occurred when “cytokines and neutrophils” were drawn to the area of the skin to fight against the bacteria (Brown & Watson, 2022, para 5).
One of the distinct characteristics of the nursing craft is the professionals’ need to constantly adapt to the dynamic environment of health care service and approaches to patient care. In order to facilitate this process, researchers have identified a series of change theories that seek to systematize the experience of implementing new practices (Udod & Wagner, 2018). The two most widespread theories of change in the nursing practice are Lewin’s change theory and Roger’s five-step theory. In Lewin’s framework, the change process undergoes three major stages: unfreezing, change proper, and refreezing (Udod & Wagner, 2018). Thus, according to this framework, in order to introduce change, the team needs to acknowledge the existing workflow and “unfreeze” this system, actively participate in implementing change and new functional patterns, and, finally, make the change a new generally accepted standard.Unlike Lewin’s approach, Roger’s model is more oriented towards the staff’s response and acceptance of the change through the gradual shifting process. Indeed, this five-step model implies exhaustive preliminary research, gathering staff’s feedback, conducting a pilot study, and actually implementing the change proposal (Udod & Wagner, 2018). Hence, it may be concluded that while Lewin’s model addresses mostly the implementation of the evidence-proven modifications, the five-step model is designed to prove the suggested change beneficial to the clinical environment.When speaking of the change proposal for the capstone project, Roger’s approach to change implementation is more appropriate. Considering the fact that the project seeks to justify the hypothesis of the EBP training’s positive impact on nurses’ self-esteem and patient satisfaction, the data collected from the intervention will be crucial for further implementation of this change to nursing practice. This theory has also been proven advantageous by the preceptor, as she has successfully integrated changes into the staff’s scheduling patterns using Roger’s model.
Chapter 12 describes the events of the colonization of the Americas in 1450-1600, including the conquest of the southern continent and the types of trade that affected Asia, Africa, and Europe. The chapter begins by explaining why the more active and aggressive empires, the Ottoman and Chinese, were not involved in the colonization of the lands in South and North America (Adelman et al., 2015, p. 475). The authors note that the peoples of many Asian countries for centuries had only a vague idea of the scope and importance of Columbus’ discovery. This discovery, through increased trade and interaction between peoples, changed the borders of states on new continents and the ways of life of the inhabitants of European, African, and Asian countries. Interestingly, China had a particular role in international relationships as a country whose population was one-third of the world.It is noted that the expansion to the west was partly an experiment, resulting in the concepts of the New and Old Worlds. Afterward, the control of information from various parts of the world has become a source of political power (Adelman et al., 2015, p. 478). It is also described how the Ottoman Empire, which had already conquered Byzantium, the Balkans, and cut in the Venecians’ empire, conquered Syria and Egypt in 1516-1517. The Ottoman Empire failed to conquer Iran when faced with the Safavid, who established a Shia state on the Iranian plateau. Notably, the subsequent plans of the Ottoman Empire to conquer Europe coincided with the Protestant movement led by Martin Luther.
Chapter 9The two main concepts in chapter 9 of “Women in World History” are gender roles and feminism.Gender RolesGender roles (GR) are societal roles allocated to each sex, regardless of whether they are masculine or feminine. GR is learned early on in a person’s life through a process known as gender socialization. Women have been assigned feminine roles over time, which has limited women’s opportunities in society. The Turkmen women were engaged in nomadic carpet making from the comfort of their own homes (Hughes & Hughes, 1997). While men were transporting products out of the family tents, women were responsible for activities within and around the shelters. Young women who had not yet given birth to their first children wove for twelve hours a day while older women looked after the house. In the twentieth century, carpet weaving became a primary industry in Iran, as it was in high demand in other western societies. Generally, the book outlines how the division of labor made the females handle household chores and males travel and be involved in business transactions.FeminismFeminism is a phrase used to describe a western ideology that advocates for women’s rights based on political and socioeconomic equality. However, feminism’s definition and goal have evolved to include and recognize the interests of males as well. According to Hughes and Hughes (1997), feminism emerged alongside Middle Eastern nationalist movements in Western countries, motivated by European ideas of women’s education, gender equality, individualism, and pride and contempt for Islamic societies. As a result of growing international trade pushed
The 1999 movie Girl, Interrupted presented life in a psychiatric hospital from the perspective of its patients. The main character is Susanna Kaysen, a girl who has graduated from high school, decided not to go to college and attempted suicide. The last incident became the reason why her parents sent her to a mental institution, where she was diagnosed with borderline personality disorder. The way Susanna was portrayed in the movie using lighting, music, external and internal factors, messages, and relationships with others presented her as a teenager with a severe but not hopeless psychiatric condition.The protagonist is a beautiful thin girl with short hair, pale skin, and a unique sense of style. As the plot reveals, Susanna is talented in writing, painting, and music. However, this framing was created in the movie to demonstrate that even individuals like Susanna may struggle with multiple emotional issues, including low self-esteem, nonadherence to societal rules, and anxiety. Still, some elements of this character’s appearance suggest that the girl is sad and anxious. Specifically, her eyes rarely express happiness, especially at the film’s beginning.Lighting was also a critical element in Girl, Interrupted , but it was not used to highlight one character. Indeed, during night or day, the light was shed on those involved in a particular conversation or silent scene rather than on one character. This technique probably was used to show that even though this story was mainly about Susanna, she was a small part of this world, where people self-harm, starve themselves, lie to others, and
was sane or crazy.The movie creators used exterior and interior factors to build the character. For instance, although Susanna, an unconventional and dramatic name, is beautiful, her appearance, attitude, and behavior suggest that this teenage girl may have emotional problems. Indeed, she looks anxious around people and wants to make herself invisible by putting more powder on her face to make it paler and wearing clothes that can maximally cover her body. Susanna’s inner world revolves only around drawing and writing about random situations without any specific purpose. Still, her relationships with Lisa reveal that the main character is lost, but she is against cruelty. Even though her interaction with Lisa initially made her violent and rude, Susanna later realizes that she does not plan to stay in the hospital forever. Thus, her final message was that she wanted to be a part of the ordinary world despite its ambiguity, which set her path to recovery.In summary, Girl, Interrupted is not only a movie about psychiatric patients but also the story of a teenage girl who struggled to find her place in the world. Susanna was a beautiful and talented but anxious young woman. Her framing, interaction with other characters, and the film’s editing were made in such a way to show that the protagonist was aware of her mental issues. However, only true acceptance of these problems allowed her to recover.
It is necessary to fully understand the fundamental difference between the concepts of a leader and a regular employee in any field. While the head of the company is most often focused on the internal financial processes, a good leader understands the paramount importance of employees in any enterprise. The ideal leader sees the potential in every person and helps them develop to the maximum while working with them in the same direction instead of putting pressure. The policy of actions of flawed leaders can lead to more than unpleasant consequences for all sides of any business.Unfortunately, imperfect leaders in our time can be found a lot in any field. Bad experiences can happen on any level, from personal to global. It is particularly difficult to single out a specific person without personal experience and hard evidence, but statistics show an extremely high proportion of unscrupulous people in high positions. According to available data, the owner of Ali Express online retailer, Jack Ma, can be cited as an example. Plenty of evidence suggests that most of the items available to order are made by underage children from the poorest parts of the world. With the tacit consent of Jack Ma, many thousands of people are being exploited for minimal pay and terrible living conditions. It is an example of a person who is not only a bad leader but intentionally contributes to the violation of human rights. One of the biggest problems, in this case, is the lack of empathy and humanism. A bad leader always looks at people through the prism of a solid resource and cheap labor. It is difficult for an imperfect leader to hear and understand a person’s intentions through the prism of ignorance and selfishness. It is the absolute wrong approach, leading to nothing but a dead end. However, it should be noted that any statement in this vein is a serious accusation and requires additional thorough collection and analysis of data.The exploitation of people in any level of relationship, from business to politics, cannot lead to a successful and fulfilled conclusion. The best people and professionals will not tolerate such an attitude and quickly find a replacement with better conditions. The main mistake of many leaders in any business is an overly egocentric picture of the world and a tendency to immoral exploitation of people’s resources.
Most writers rely on their stories’ pivotal points to fully develop particular characters. The readers gain a vivid picture of the genuine nature of the characters by narrating their interactions with others, discussions, and actions. The authors use this methodology to bring their characters to life in their stories. Mr. Kapasi, the driver who also performs the role of a tour guide for the Das family, is divulged more via his interlinkages with Mrs. Das than any other personas in Jhumpa Lahiri’s short novel Interpreter of Maladies .In his late forties, Mr. Kapasi, a brilliant Indian man who has lost romantic values in his marriage, is the protagonist of this short narrative told in limited omniscience. Mr. Kapasi is precise in his physical appearance and possesses several qualities such as observance, hard work, modesty, dependability, and intelligence. He is well-educated, works two jobs that need him to employ his linguistic skills, and goes through life without his wife’s affection. He’s quick to point out the parallels and contrasts between tourists and himself. As a result, the paper looks at how Lahiri portrays Mr. Kapasi through his relationships with Mrs. Das and the story’s indirect depiction of Mrs. Das.It is revealed how Mr. Kapasi views himself and his love life through their connection and communication. For example, he regards his marriage as a failure and aspires to more romantic life. To do something about it, he creates a fantasy in which he imagines himself in an intimate relationship with Mrs. Das, who he believes is suffering from
the same issues. His wife has alienated him and disapproves of his second job as a doctor’s interpreter, as seen by their interactions. His wife seemed preoccupied with their son’s death, which occurred at the hospital where Mr. Kapasi works as an interpreter. Mrs. Das has similar feelings as the protagonist. She is also stuck in a loveless relationship. Mr. Kapasi fantasizes about probable similarities between himself and Mrs. Das initially, but when he learns more about Mrs. Das’s personality, he is disappointed.He chooses closeness between them as a token of his gratitude for Mrs. Das’s kindred spirit in describing his job as ‘romantic,’ believing that it is the only way suitable to escape his loneliness. Although his attitude does not substitute when he discovers that the woman is not the one he envisages in his delusion, this conversation demonstrates his grateful and empathetic character. It occurs after she tells him about her adulterous affair with her husband’s buddy, through which she produced a son. “Is it agony you’re feeling, Mrs. Das, or is it guilt?” he wonders after hearing her narrative of unfaithfulness (Lahiri 120). This inquiry expresses his sorrow for Mr. Das once he discovers how evil the woman he had thought was good has turned out to be.Mr. Kapasi realizes that he has exaggerated the depth of his troubles with his wife after listening to Mrs. Das’ confession. He realizes that considerably deteriorated cases could have made him perceive even worse than he does now if they had transpired to him. Mr. Kapasi
appears to have no genuine experience in comprehending people, regardless of his faculty, to elucidate some health and related concerns for many individuals, as seen by his wife’s incorrect view of the woman he once dreamed of.Mr. Kapasi’s character would not have been revealed explicitly without Mrs. Das in the short story Interpreter of Maladies. The other characters he meets and interacts with are unconcerned about his safety. They treat him as if he were a second-class citizen, exactly like they treat each other. Mr. Das, for example, is unconcerned about Mr. Kapasi because they have never met. As a result, it is feasible to conclude that Mrs. Das’ character is crucial since she aids in revealing and displaying Mr. Kapasi’s actual personality, which would otherwise stay underdeveloped if she had not appeared.Mrs. Das is a catalyst for story development and a medium for societal commentary in Jhumpa Lahiri’s intricately gorgeous novel The Interpreter of Maladies. Mrs. Das is a direct cultural contrast to Mr. Kapasi through her indirect portrayal, propelling the plot while providing sad social commentary. The Das family meets Mr. Kapasi as they prepare for their journey through India. It is noted that Mr. Kapasi thought it weird that “Mr. Das should refer to his wife by her first name when speaking to the small girl” (Lahiri 30). It is instantly evident that there is a cultural divide between Kapasi and the Das family. When “Mr. and Mrs. Das behaved like an elder brother and sister, not parents, the cultural divide becomes evident”
the small girl’s hand as they headed to the restroom,” we get our first impression of Mrs. Das. Mr. Kapasi has a solid basis for evaluating the family as many siblings because Mrs. Das does not concern about her children’s safety. “He couldn’t believe Mr. and Mrs. Das were in charge of anything else” (Lahiri 160). Mrs. Das’s self-absorbed personality reveals her disinterest in Mr. Kapasi, her family, and the trip; hence, Mrs. Das’s enthusiasm for Mr. Kapasi’s employment as a language interpreter is surprising. Mrs. Das compliments Mr. Kapasi by saying his employment is “very romantic” as he briefly explains the job he considers trivial (Lahiri 161). The remarks of Mrs. Das affect Mr. Kapasi, who has a misconstruing mentality, and his mind begins to magnify the expression.In conclusion, the details of the character’s personalities, the author enable the reader to understand the character. Moreover, the writer shows how the characters view certain subjects through their response to different events. The theme of love and marriage has been reflected in-between character characterization from the narrative. Their personalities, such as Mrs.das being self-centered and Mr. Kapsi’s evolution as a sympathetic character, are well developed. Through both characters, marriage has become an underage issue to be taken into interest. Their characterization has also enabled the story’s development relating to societal issues affecting us.
the associated trading concerns (“Schwab account agreement,” 2022). Outlining that Schwab is not responsible for tracking the trading process, the contract sets the key responsibilities and relations between the parties completely clearly.Incorporating the primary components of a legal contract, the brokerage agreement created by Schwab offers its customers a chance to familiarize themselves closely with the services that they will obtain and the responsibilities that they have. Similarly, the contract outlines the crucial responsibilities of Schwab, thus, creating a basis for cooperation and the successful delivery of the end product to the customer. Overall, Schwab’s approach to contract development can be considered a prime example of how a contract should be structured due to the close focus on key issues and the clear delineation of all parties’ roles and rights.
In the academic environment of chemical processes, named reactions are of particular importance because they are of applied value or solve problems of intergroup transition between compounds. Among the named processes, the Diels-Alder reaction, or diene synthesis, traditionally used to produce stereospecific six-membered carbon cycles with multiple bonds, is of excellent research popularity. Two types of reagents are used for this reaction, one being a conjugated diene and the other a dienophile. As a dienophile can be used, any substances with π-bond, including alkenes or acetylenes with activating electron acceptor groups, and diene must meet the requirements of chemical stability, conjugation of bonds, and the ability to take s-cis configuration. When they interact, the electron density is redistributed with the formation of single multiple bonds with a six-membered cycle.The double name of this reaction is due to the history of its creation. In 1927, the process was patented by German organic chemists Otto Diels and Kurt Alder (Diels & Alder, 1927). Since the synthesis of six-membered homocyclic has applications in organic chemistry, including the possibility of using them to produce aromatic rings, Diels and Alder were awarded the Nobel Prize for their development in 1950.Since then, the possibilities of diene synthesis have expanded significantly; this includes the possibility of obtaining bicyclic compounds if cyclic dienes were used as raw materials. However, the basis has remained unchanged; namely, the addition of a dienophile to a diene by 2,4-conjugation allows the preparation of non-aromatic homocyclic with one multiple bonds in them. Initially, an intermediate compound with unstably separated
It is no secret that some members of society have more privileges than others. People are marginalized based on their race, ethnicity, and social class. My experience with unjustly treated people was when I saw how an African American woman was not allowed to enter a restaurant due to some unknown reasons. This was a terrible experience as I felt anxious about what was happening in the restaurant. I think people should not be treated badly because of their race. Racial discrimination should be a problem in the modern world.This minor case suggests the greater problem that is unjustly treating people in the context of the criminal justice system. The criminal justice system in the United States is designed to protect and serve everyone. This concept should be inclusive of all races, genders, and other identifying features. It happens more than what the news channels may bring to light, although it should not. Minorities and people who do not meet society’s “norms” are frequently subjected to unequal treatment by those charged with protecting them. In the book, Stevenson writes about groups of people who are vulnerable to being victimized by the system and how he helped people in prison to bring them justice. It can be said that the system is inherently biased toward minorities, and it makes people suffer without any significant justification.A prominent example of this is the case of George Floyd. When I first viewed the footage of George Floyd’s killing, I felt a wave of pain and rage run through my body.
complement each other. Whereas primary sources offer credible evidence, secondary sources provide additional information and valuable synthesis. However, even when one possesses a primary and a secondary source, it is not enough for completing a thorough research endeavor. One needs much more than a few sources, however credible they might be. It is of utmost importance to consult a variety of sources when conducting historical research since in each new source, valuable additional evidence can be found. Also, when the same data occurs in several sources, its credibility increases. At the same time, the presence of different pieces of information gives the researcher food for thought and allows posing new questions and seeking new answers. That is why the more sources one has at one’s disposal, the better. It is crucial to consult not only a wide range of sources but also different types of them since authors of articles and books, for instance, have divergent approaches to synthesizing data.
the workforce. However, the practice of using indentured servants was ineffective because of the end date of their contracts. It meant that new sources of people to work on fields and plantations were needed. The resolution of the given problem was a matter of survival, as the inability to raise crops would mean death for the whole community (Kidd, 2019). Under these conditions, the development of slavery was inevitable as people stripped of their rights could be used to perform diverse tasks, and the term of exploitation was not limited. It created the basis for the evolution of slavery which became one of the fundamental institutions functioning on these lands.At the same time, the example of the Middle colonies proves that the enslavement of people and their use as a cheap workforce was inevitable. Although the pacific principles of Quakerism dominated these lands at the first stages of their evolution, settlers still needed people to perform complex tasks and support the evolution of colonies. Regarding the limited number of arriving settlers, slavery became the possible option to compensate for the deficit and create the basis for future expansion. The given trend was similar to the Middle and Chesapeake colonies, proving specific attitudes to slavery peculiar to people of that period (Huntley, 2019). They were ready to promote further evolution of this institution as the central way to support the development of the agricultural sector critical for survival and enrichment.
The history of humankind has witnessed several events that significantly affected large areas shared between several countries. One such incident is the explosion at the Chernobyl nuclear power station in modern Ukraine (Naoum & Spyropoulos, 2021). The accident happened in 1986 and has influenced numerous lives and regions (Naoum & Spyropoulos, 2021). The explosion at Chernobyl is a disaster with long-lasting effects that still present threats to the environment and should be remembered by the society around the globe.People’s mistakes have contributed to the nuclear tragedy, which the previous administration attempted to conceal. Chernobyl is located north of the Ukrainian capital, Kyiv, and the country is neighboring Russia, Moldova, Romania, Hungary, Slovakia, Poland, and Belarus (Mousseau, 2022). The station began to operate in 1977 in the former Soviet Union, and about 14000 people lived in the town before the explosion (Naoum & Spyropoulos, 2021). The closest city was Pripyat, with approximately 49000 residents, many of whom were Chernobyl employees and their families (Naoum & Spyropoulos, 2021). A reactor exploded on April 26, 1986, during a safety test, and the incident was due to several reasons, such as human errors, unauthorized manipulations, and design imperfections of the reactor (Naoum & Spyropoulos, 2021). The Soviet authorities had tried to hide the occurrence but failed, and the Chernobyl accident later ranked at the maximum classification on the International Nuclear Event Scale (Naoum & Spyropoulos, 2021). The fire burned for ten days, and a radioactive plume spread across Europe, with an exclusion zone remaining nearby Chernobyl (Mothersill, 2022). The disaster
at Chernobyl has impacted numerous people, especially those who lived nearby.The Chernobyl accident has caused multiple consequences, primarily because of radiation. Radioactive substances significantly contaminated more than 38000 square miles, affecting vital natural objects like the river Pripyat, which was watering the broader area of Kyiv (Naoum & Spyropoulos, 2021). The explosion harmed agricultural lands and pine trees and led to the weakening or dying of wild animals (Naoum & Spyropoulos, 2021). According to Naoum and Spyropoulos (2021), domestic animals inside and outside the Soviet Union also showed increased levels of radioactivity in the following years. Moreover, the incident had an intensive human impact, raising the number of people suffering and passing away from cancer and acute radiation sickness (Naoum & Spyropoulos, 2021). Inhabitants from nearby areas have developed mental health issues due to being worried about the risks of radiation exposure (Naoum & Spyropoulos, 2021). Despite little evidence of the accident expanding congenital disabilities, some European countries have detected a higher number of abortions (Naoum & Spyropoulos, 2021). The explosion resulted in damaging lives and the local environment.Furthermore, the nuclear power station disaster had political and socioeconomic consequences. After the incident, the international community became distrustful of the Soviet Union, and the explosion is perceived to have facilitated the fall of the Union (Naoum & Spyropoulos, 2021). Several countries, mainly European, have spent resources to inspect the amount of radioactivity in soil, water, and food, while Ukraine, Belarus, and Russia lost lands needed for agricultural and forest production (Naoum & Spyropoulos, 2021). The tragedy at
of forest fires, which, worsened by climate change and local dead trees and debris, can result in radioactive fallout (Mousseau, 2022). Such activities as thousands of soldiers passing through, eating, and building campfires near the former nuclear station increase the risk of forest fires (Mousseau, 2022). While radiation in Chernobyl presents relatively fewer hazards, the presence of Russian troops can lead to more environmental issues.To summarize, the explosion at the Chernobyl nuclear power station was a major event that affected neighboring countries, numerous people, and local flora and fauna. The incident that resulted from human errors also harmed human beings, destroying lives, causing physical and psychological traumas, and contaminating water sources and production lands. Although the accident’s aftermath is still immense, the local environment has begun to flourish with new trees and more wild animals. However, the current political conflict with the Russian army entering Ukraine from the nuclear station’s area can potentially initiate forest fires that can ruin nature. Society has to know about such disasters as the explosion at Chernobyl and its outcomes to understand the need to prevent similar events in the future, preserve the environment, and save lives.
An exhibition is a planned staging and demonstration of selected items such as attires and garments which occur in an educational or cultural setup. It may be carried out in museums, exhibition halls, art galleries, parks, or libraries. All exhibitions are short-term; hence they are scheduled to occur within a set timeframe. For an exhibition to be successful, it has to be assembled and implemented by a team of experts such as the curators whose work is to select items to be displayed and presented. It involves activities such as commercially focused trade fairs and expositions, art in major museums and smaller galleries, and interpretive shows. Christian Dior: Designer of Dreams show scheduled from September 10 th , 2021 to February 20 th , 2022 is an example of a presentation illustrating several aspects of an exhibition.Thesis and Themes of Christian Dior’s ExhibitionThe exhibition on Christian Dior sightsees the intelligence behind Dior’s theatrical creations that rejuvenated the entire Parisian haute couture industry after the desolation of the Second World War. In 1947, the revolutionary “New Look” and the establishment of the new couture house swept away the manly wartime silhouette, making Christian Dior’s postwar fashions wanted, worn, and imitated by women around the globe (Bowles). Drawn from the Royal Ontario Museum, the Christian Dior fashion design collection is perfected by a dozen attires from the McCord Museum’s fashion, dress, and textiles collection and loans from Dior Heritage, Paris. The exhibition emphasizes on the epoch from 1947 to 1957. It offers a fascinating insight into the inventive
process and the mechanism of the Parisian haute couture industry during the 1950s (Bowles). It examines Dior’s luxury textiles, romantic embroideries, and iconic lines that laid the basis for the fashion house’s international success. Presenting magnificent fashions from daytime to sunset attire for grand events, the exhibition invites guests to discover the gorgeous artistry, sophisticated feature, and brilliant luxury designs by the amount from the Golden Age of haute couture.Presented are galleries dedicated to Dior and the creative directors who thrived him: Marc Bohan, Yves Saint Laurent, John Galliano, Gianfranco Ferre, and Raf Simons. A latrine room, an acknowledgment to the Ateliers, and contiguous galleries of tailoring garments display Dior’s petite mains (Bowles). The chief foyer of our Beaux-Arts Court has been restructured as an enthralled garden, and an ending gallery reveals dresses worn by celebrities from Grace Kelly to Jennifer Lawrence. The Brooklyn Museum exhibition of Christian Dior: Designer of Dreams is curated by Denver Art Museum, Florence Muller, Avenir Foundation Curator of Textile Art, and Fashion curate Designer of Dreams, in collaboration with Brooklyn Museum.Installation view, Christian Dior: Designer of Dreams, Brooklyn Museum, September 10th, 2021–February 20th, 2022.

Fashion photography beautifies a room, plus the work of such prominent artists such as Ethan James Green, Irving Penn, Lillian Bassman, Annie Leibovitz, and Horst P. Richard Avedon takes the middle stage in this room, instantaneously displaying the most photos and also the largest. Avedon’s Dovima with Elephants
an understanding of the encryptions of the house and how they play a part in different designs. The 18 th century’s inspiration on the house is given exceptional attention, displaying how the overgenerous dress of the time prejudiced the silhouette and configurations of the designs (Bowles). Raf Simon’s work here markedly differs from his forerunners because he takes encouragement not from ladies’ current dresses but rather from men and dressing representations in traditionally manly coats.Color also plays an important portion in the brand today. Items of all kinds from the house are presented in a color slope that shows how each hue is used in context. An exclusively white room highpoint the work that goes into the garments, while the “toile-the in-process test garments” give an unparalleled insight into the course of couture’s creation (Bowles). Flowers and gardens, which held a special place in Dior’s heart, are given the largest room in the exhibit. Their influence is seen constantly throughout the show and beautiful dresses from the house’s history encircles the visitors, reaching up to the ceiling in front of garden-inspired backdrops. Christian Dior’s exhibit poses relevant question in the fashion study. It asks whether the legacy of its process has led to the progressively narrow and standardized fashion exhibitions that can harm America’s fashionable status through excluding several places and networks that make the State’s fashion culture unique.Installation view, Christian Dior: Designer of Dreams, Brooklyn Museum, September 10th, 2021–February 20th, 2022.

either logical or surreal. These people have developed a term worldview “to describe this holistic concept of learning, scholarship, experience and knowledge” (Spanjer 15). Even though sometimes they cannot agree on the solution to the problems, time helps them dissipate false beliefs.The other reading by Brad Green suggests the interconnection of words and faith. In the chapter. When transcendent realities and goals surround a language, it is magnificent, but when transcendence is taken away from it, it falls apart and loses its glory (Green). The word was sent by God to save humanity; He portrayed people through the words (Green). Hence, humans should follow God’s guidelines in the Bible because His sayings are truthful. In case the words are devoid of meaning, the speech is useless.The last reading by Dockery narrates about the Christian faith’s influence on learning. People are encouraged to think in Christian categories in order to sanctify thoughts and beliefs (Dockery 4). It is vital to seek God’s guidance and His calls that help humans contribute to the societal good (Dockery 8). Thoughtful believers are needed to revive faith-centered higher educational institutions because only such people will be able to promote gracious deeds. Hence, Christian worldview is again viewed as foundation of successful education and learning.
BackgroundBoth Christianity and postmodern relativism relate to spirituality and its influence on human life. Christianity authors the belief in the existence of a sovereign God who controls everything in the universe, allowing and disallowing life events. The theological and religious prism affects how people perceive God as the all-powerful and eternal one (Lasair, 2020). Christians’ belief systems are based on the concept of God as portrayed in the Holy Bible. They explain the purpose, truth, and meaning of human life, influencing how Christians perceive health care. Dependence on the all-powerful external force enables Christians to reach a transcendent state for health care experiences and other life events.Since they follow God’s guidance in every decision, Christians are more at peace with life outcomes. For example, they accept health care outcomes more readily than non-believers do because of the belief that God allows every fate, whether it is bad or good. Ethics are guided by biblical principles, even when related to health care (Lasair, 2020). For instance, abortion is equated to murder the unborn child and is not accepted by Christians. Therefore, healthcare decisions involving Christianity are guided by the bible.Unlike Christianity, which rejects ambiguity by adhering to biblical guidelines, postmodern relativism takes a liberal approach to spirituality and ethics. These relativists believe there is no absolute truth regarding the existence of God or adherence to ethics (Garrett, 2018). Therefore, every spiritual or ethical belief is valid, even if there are contrasting ones. As such, discarding any argument or decision about health care is not encouraged. Postmodern relativism
supports diversity and multicultural approaches to healthcare because medical professionals must embrace multiple and contradictory perceptions from patients and families (Garrett, 2018). In addition, the understanding of ethics might change from one patient to the other without affecting the quality of care.ScientismScientism argues that hard sciences provide superior scientific knowledge as the only source of genuine and absolute truths. The hard sciences, including physics and biology, rely on laws of nature or experimentation. They produce reliable results based on testable, factual, and replicable data. Scientism regards soft sciences as inferior or pseudosciences since their conjectures and guesses are not replicable or factual but subject to change (Vukov, 2021). It seeks to differentiate the two science categories based on the value of their information, with hard sciences presenting more valuable knowledge than soft sciences. The reliance on subjectivism makes soft sciences prone to influences by human nature, leading to contradictory ideas on the same topics of principles. Overall, scientism accords greater intellectual authority to hard over soft sciences in knowledge matters.There are arguments raised against scientism and its elevation of hard sciences. The first argument refutes the claim that hard sciences use factual data that does not change by asserting the restructuring of measuring instruments and fluctuations in the environment (Vukov, 2021). Therefore, the sciences cannot provide absolute facts and truths as knowledge grows with new information, creating no difference between hard and soft sciences. The second argument against scientism is the disregard hard sciences have over personal opinion to rely heavily on rationality. Since willful thoughts
are significant in new knowledge discovery, the tyrannical approach presented by scientism prevents scientific advancement. Therefore, soft sciences will perform better in advancing scientific knowledge through the discovery of new information as they support willful thoughts.Worldview QuestionsUltimate RealityUltimate reality states that individuals are the result of the exchanges they have with the environment. People are the product of their surroundings through nurture than nature. The environment includes family units, schools, religious groups, community, neighborhood, city, and state. In this view, I am the product of my interactions with parents, grandparents, and siblings at the family level. Other important exchanges are in my school, where I interact with students and teachers. I have a social life away from home and learning institutions such as at work and in other community events.My family has instilled foundational values and beliefs in me, while schools, community, and religious groups have added to the belief system or changed my perspective on some ideas. Since I was raised in a Christian family, most of my childhood was spent in Christian circles rather than Muslim ones. Therefore, I am more inclined towards conservatism in controversial public health issues abortion and polygamy. However, the school environment and knowledge acquired in learning have opened up my thinking to become a more liberal Christian. As such, I would support abortion where life is threatened and embrace LGBTQ communities in respect of equal human rights.Nature of the UniverseThe nature of the universe is to experience constant change by relying on energy and prioritizing processes through evolution, energy
conversion, extinction, and competition. Evolution entails adaptation to changes in one’s environment, while energy conversion is a shift between energy forms. Extinction occurs when components are removed from the universe due to the inability to compete, while competition is the struggle for scarce resources.While plants and animals are known to experience extinction, humans undergo competition and evolution. The nature of the universe forces us into schools to acquire the best education to become the most competitive in the job market. Without skills and experience, people can become ‘extinct’ in their areas of specialization. As technology advances, humans must evolve to adapt to the newest ways of living to avoid extinction. For example, the world is gradually shifting to paperless currency such as digital money offered by central banks. People who stick to cash payments will be unable to buy from most stores a few years into the future. The nature of the universe forces them to evolve from cash to cashless payment systems for survival.Human BeingHuman beings are animals with rationalism and can be defined as the creations of God or the products of evolution. Religion recognizes God as the creator of all universe, including human beings. For instance, Christians believe that humans have the image of God as entailed in the creation story of the Holy Bible. Therefore, they are to follow the creator’s purpose for their existence, including procreating, nurturing the earth and everything in it, and obeying his word. Humans are also defined as the products of science through the process of evolution.
This perspective argues that humans developed higher thinking capacity through selective adaptation, leading to complex vocabulary, languages, and technologies.My worldview aligns with the Christianity definition that a supreme God created humans in his likeness to accomplish his purpose on earth. In this definition, we are supposed to abide by the principles of the creator to procreate and protect the rest of the universe. Human beings are stewards on earth, positioned by God to take care of animals, birds, and the environment they live in.KnowledgeKnowledge is a combination of skills, information, and facts cognitively acquired from learning or experience. Learning might occur in formal or informal set-ups such as schools or at home. In a formal learning environment, knowledge acquisition processes are structured with clear roles between teachers and learners. Additionally, specific sets of knowledge are passed down to learners. However, informal learning environments are often social groups where knowledge is unintentionally passed from one person to another. For example, in a family setting, children learn from their parents through imitating behavior and words. Experience refers to acquiring knowledge while doing some work rather than from somebody. Therefore, learning imparts theoretical knowledge while experience gives practical know-how.Knowledge is a critical component of our lives as it enhances the quality of life for everyone. For instance, professional medical practitioners such as doctors and nurses utilize their knowledge to help us maintain bodily and mental health. Engineers in every field ensure that we achieve optimum efficiency by using functional machines, living in well-built houses, and using safe infrastructures. Teachers
does not leave, and diuresis stops. The kidneys fail, and acute renal failure develops, which leads to a deterioration in well-being. Treatment of end-stage kidney damage in adults involves taking medications.Chronic renal failure occurs in 200-500 out of one million people. Currently, the population with chronic renal failure is increasing annually by 10-12%. Morbidities with the end-stage renal disease lead to a person’s diuresis being reduced to almost zero. With advanced forms of chronic renal failure, pulmonary edema develops. At the moment, the prevalence rate of the disease includes about 759 people per million population. The incidence rate is not available for all countries globally, so it isn’t easy to analyze the information in detail. However, the average number of newly reported cases is 144 per million. The mortality rate is decreasing and currently stands at approximately 28%. Doctors prescribe a blood test to assess creatinine, potassium, and urea to determine the disease. Moreover, such a procedure as an ultrasound of the kidneys is performed. If necessary, the doctor prescribes catheterization of the renal pelvis and angiography of the kidneys.
behavior specific to their species, and the concept of circuses contradicts this shepherd.Furthermore, the phrase “animal performers” often evokes positive emotions because acting is always associated with romance. However, unlike their human counterparts, animals never voluntarily choose the profession of actor. Circus experience means losing freedom forever, spending 95% of the time alone, in a cramped cage where animals cannot stand up to the full height and turn around (Ward 131). They suffer extensively, but there is nothing they can change because humans are more thoughtful and cunningly use force.It can be concluded that introducing restrictions on the exploitation of animals in the circus is a necessary measure in the current world. Creatures must be permitted to follow their instincts and be in their natural habitat because that is their fundamental freedom. All people must comprehend that the rights of animals must be protected and, therefore, one must refuse to visit performances that have been created through violence and cruelty.
Learning history helps people draw connections between the past and present and allows making predictions for the future based on previous lessons. Climate change is one of the most significant topics of interest and research. No matter how well societies develop in terms of technology, they will inevitably face disasters if they neglect the issues of nature. The Chornobyl nuclear accident, which happened in 1986, was one of the most devastating ecological events that changed the fates of thousands of people in many countries.My prior knowledge of the topic is not ample, but I do know that the major release of radioactive materials occurred, which led to the contamination of air and water, causing numerous diseases and deaths. I have also read somewhere that the then-ruling government of the USSR kept the explosion a secret, which prevented people from saving their lives within the first few hours and days after the accident. Unfortunately, individuals living next to the nuclear plant, as well as those living farther, had no chance of survival. The accident led to the increase in radiation levels to “between ten and one hundred times normal” (Price, 2021, para. 1). I have also read about the courageousness and self-sacrifice of those who were involved in fire extinguishing processes.I would like to learn more about the reasons that led to such a disaster and to find out whether it was preventable. Also, I want to investigate the reasons behind the decision of the USSR government to conceal the truth and not let people save their
A cardiopulmonary attack happens when the heart suddenly ceases to pump blood, causing the victim to become unconscious and show no signs of blood flow and breathing. Instant death can occur if corrective steps are not implemented quickly enough. One of Australia’s leading causes of mortality and morbidity is cardiovascular arrest (Paratz et al., 2021). Each year, around 5,000 Australians under the age of 50 suffer suspected cardiovascular arrest. Ninety percent of the victims die directly as a result of the arrest (Paratz et al., 2021). Cardiac arrest can occur in anyone, regardless of age or health history, but it is more likely in people already diagnosed with heart problems (Kandasamy et al., 2019). Therefore, early defibrillation and cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) preserve a person’s life and decrease any lengthy neurological dysfunction.The chances of survival of a patient requiring resuscitation depend on the correct application of the CPR procedure and the immediate collaborative response of the medical teams. The video obtained from YouTube attempts to illustrate the basic steps for appropriate CPR and the use of a defibrillator (ChristianCare, 2011). According to the video, a nurse enters the room and observes no patient activity on the bed after calling the patient’s name and receiving no response. The nurse responds by calling out to her colleagues for assistance. When a patient fails to respond to tactile or verbal stimuli, it is best recommended that the nurse or any healthcare worker call for help (Olasveengen et al., 2020). The Australian Resuscitation Council (ARC) guideline three recommends that healthcare workers
call for help from colleagues in case of a cardiac arrest (Curtis et al., 2019). Since cardiac arrest can cause neurological dysfunction within a few minutes of its initiation, it is critical for teamwork among the medical personnel.Before making any clinical decisions or commencing CPR, it is necessary to evaluate the patient’s airway and assess whether or not CPR should be initiated. A comprehensive but quick examination of the airway is essential for managing patients who require immediate CPR. According to ARC guideline four, clearing the airway includes opening the mouth and gently lowering the head to enable any visible foreign material, such as food, blood, vomit, or fluids, to drain (Bray et al., 2021). Fingertips can be used to remove noticeable foreign material by sweeping. The finger sweep is beneficial in cases of unconscious adults and children older than one-year-old who has a foreign body airway obstruction (FBAO) (Couper et al., 2020). However, the person clearing the mouth from foreign material should be careful enough to avoid being bit and to avoid causing harm to the patient.Additionally, if the airway gets obstructed during resuscitation, the patient should immediately be turned onto their side to clear it. After clearing the airway, it is crucial to review responsiveness and regular breathing. In the video, the nurse only listens if the breath sounds are audible but misses to confirm any obstruction in the mouth (ChristianCare, 2011). The guideline also recommends that the airway be opened using the head tilt-chin maneuver (Bray et al., 2021). Furthermore, the team initiated
CPR without confirming the presence or absence of pulsation. The carotid pulse should be monitored at the beginning and during resuscitation to assess whether or not CPR should be performed.Another essential aspect of CPR is the insertion of a large-bore intravenous cannula. In emergencies such as cardiac arrest, health workers need to act quickly in obtaining intravenous access as it enhances adequate infusion of fluids at a faster rate. Additionally, it guarantees that emergency drugs, such as epinephrine, are supplied promptly to achieve peak blood concentration (Feinstein et al., 2017). Epinephrine is an emergency drug given intravenously in the video. The administration of intravenous drugs in the video aligns with ARC guideline (9.2), which needs fluid and drug administration via intravenous access, which is critical in reviving the patient (Sethi & Chalwin, 2018). Fluid infusion is vital for patients who have suffered a cardiac attack to facilitate tissue perfusion.The ability to breathe normally is critical to preserving life. Resuscitation is required for a patient who gasps or not breathing regularly and is unresponsive. According to the ARC guideline five, the medical team looks, listens, and feels while checking the patient’s breathing pattern (McLure et al., 2021). They should look for movements in the abdominal area or lower chest. They should also listen for air escaping from the mouth or nose and feel for movements in the nose and mouth (McLure et al., 2021). In the video, the nurse actively listens for the presence or absence of air moving through the nose and mouth in accordance with
the ARC recommendations.During resuscitation, breaths can be given to the patient by various methods depending on the setting or skills of the caregiver. These include mouth-to-mouth rescue breaths, mouth-to-nose, mouth-to-stoma, mouth-to-mask, and bag valve masks (BVM) (Panchal et al., 2020). In the video, breaths are given via a bag valve mask. Ventilation with a bag valve mask is another means of giving rescue breathing. An inflating bag is connected to a non-rebreather valve and a face mask to form a bag valve mask gadget. A clear airway (Guideline 4), an appropriate mask seal, and an acceptable breathing method are required for effective bag valve mask ventilation (Olasveengen et al., 2021). Continuous ventilation with the bag valve or poor technique may cause air to enter the stomach, raising the chance of gastric contents reflux (Newell et al., 2018). When BVM ventilation is utilized, it is advised that two experienced rescuers supply a ventilator for the unconscious person: one to handle the airway, seal, and mask, while the other to handle the bag valve mask.The video illustrates the use of a BVM in giving rescue breaths where the nurse adopts the jaw thrust maneuver using one hand while the other hand gives oxygen via the bag. However, the bag valve mask should have been connected to a reservoir or oxygen mask, enhancing a high oxygen concentration in the body. The use of BVM has the potential to save lives and is far less invasive than intubation.Compression of the chest is one of the most critical procedures in resuscitation
that must be performed properly. The video illustrates the compressions being given at a rate of 30 compressions followed by two rescue breaths after every two minutes. This is consistent with the ACR guideline six, which confirms a pace of 30 chest compression before giving two rescue breaths. According to some research, compression rates of fewer than 30 are linked to a reduced survival probability (Maconochie et al., 2020). Each compression should result in a downward displacement of the lower sternum, roughly making up a third of the chest’s entire depth. In adults, this corresponds to an increase of greater than 5cm in height (Garcia-Jorda et al., 2019). There is little doubt that insufficient compression depth is related to poor outcomes. It is worth noting that the chest compressions performed in the video were shallow and did not exceed 5cm, as advised by ACR.The Compression speed and depth vary significantly amongst rescuers, and the compressions may be more severe during the first few minutes of the cardiac attack. Chest compressions were ineffective after one minute in a mannequin trial of CPR, even when caregivers became aware of exhaustion after five minutes. (Cobo-Vázquez et al., 2018). If possible, rescuers should be switched every two minutes while compressions to avoid rescuer fatigue and worsening chest compression performance, particularly depth. The video illustrates that only a single person is involved in chest compressions. According to research, the rescuer’s fatigue during CPR affects the compressions’ efficiency (Cobo-Vázquez et al., 2018). Following the initiation of continuous compressions, the depth of compressions
A Rose for Emily is an excellent example of the Southern Gothic genre. The Southern Gothic is a literal tradition that came into existence in the 20 th century and became popular in European literature. The genre is rooted in mysterious secrets, supernatural events, frightening scenarios, and extreme character duress, which leaves the reader desensitized. The genre focuses on ridiculous and morbid features such as secret passages, draft castles, and laced cobwebs. The Southern Gothic genre explores the antisocial behaviors that confined against the social norms and hinged on the belief that daily life and these social customs were just imaginary. A Rose For Emily creates the theme of mental illness, murders, love-loss that ends up creating a frightening environment for the client, thus suits a Gothic Tale.Firstly, A Rose for Emily illustrates the Southern Gothic genre through the townsfolks accessorizing Homer’s murder. After Emily’s father died, she isolated herself from society, and her house began to decay to smell awful. The judge sent some township men to clean the place, but instead, they sprinkled lime over the property. The township could have helped Emily and discarded the father’s body, but rather, they worried if she needed help (Sullivan 175). It is clear that the townspeople are fond of Emily and respect her. This aspect can be seen when she purchased the rat poison “So the next day we all said, “She will kill herself”; and we said it would be the best thing.” (Faulkner 6). They were in awe of her, but they harbored feelings
of powerful aggression. The town did not want to associate with her, yet they cared for her, which pushed her to buy the arsenic to kill Homer Barron. Instead of doing the right thing, the town decided to cover the crime. Them turning a blind eye on Homer Barron’s death shows the element of the extreme character duress in the Southern Gothic genre.Secondly, A Rose for Emily contains the theme of lost love, representing Southern Gothic stories. When Emily met Homer, a foreman, marriage was possible. Still, then issues of her social status arose, and it can be seen when the town murmured, “Of course, a Grierson would not think seriously of a Northerner, a day laborer… grief could not cause a real lady to forget noblesse oblige” (Faulkner 5). Homer’s perspective on his love towards Emily was not accurate, but he spent time with her. However, it was said that Homer was gay and he liked men (Faulkner 6). Emily saw the relationship from a romantic perceptive, while Homer saw it as spiritual. It made Emily terrified of being alone as unrequited love is painful (Liu 198). It led her to purchase wedding items for her and Homer, invite him to dinner, and poison him with arsenic. Hence, A Rose for Emily portrays a romantic love skewed with dysfunctionality as described in the Southern Gothic stories.Similarly, lost love is also portrayed between Emily and her father, just as Southern Gothic themes. Emily’s father controlled her life, making it almost impossible for her to interact with
the town and also forbid her from a romantic relationship “We remembered all the young men her father had driven away” (Faulkner 4). There was a falling out between Emily’s father and the extended family due to property; hence she was only left with her father to teach her on love. He also took the role of protecting as seen in this text, “father a spraddled silhouette in the foreground, his back to her and clutching a horsewhip” (Faulkner 4). Emily leaning on her father’s back portrayed more concern about his physical well-being and protecting her. After he died, Emily was utterly lost as she did not know how to love in a normal way. It explains her behavior of not having any trace of grief and why she would tell the town that her father was not dead for almost three days. The love of an overprotective father that forbids her to interact is an example of a Southern Gothic story.In addition, Southern Gothic style is portrayed in A Rose for Emily through appropriation and transformation. The narrator transforms Emily’s innocence into a psychologically damaged spinster. At the beginning of the narration, Emily is used as a protagonist. She used to be the perfect young wealthy lady living with her father. Her privileged status causes her to be emotionally and physically isolated; she becomes erratic with characteristic behavior (Huang 205). At first, she denied the death of his father for approximately three days. The town sided with her, claiming “we knew that with nothing left,
she would have to cling to that which had robbed her, as people will.” (Faulkner 4). However, it was difficult for the town to explain how she slept and spent years with the corpse of Homer. Her erotic behavior is also seen when she is asked to pay her taxes by the Board of Abelderm. She gets mad, saying, “I have no taxes in Jefferson” (Faulkner 2). Even after being told that no public agreement excluded her from paying taxes, she continued denying it. Her mental instability is an example of a character in the Southern Gothic story.Furthermore, Faulkner uses Southern Gothic elements throughout the stories. At first, the writer’s description of Emily’s house gives the reader the impression that it contains mysterious secrets (Xiaokang 95). He describes it as “It was a big, squarish frame house that had once been white, decorated with cupolas and spires and scrolled balconies in the heavily lightsome style of the seventies” (Faulkner 1). Homer’s death took place in the same house, and his corpse was left there to rot. The story’s setting shows it was created in the Southern Gothic period. Emily was the last bloodline of his family that had stayed in that town for generations. The tax collectors went door to door collecting taxes which made him a southern gothic. Such scenes and creating a mysterious atmosphere throughout the story illustrate that A Rose for Emily was a Southern Gothic story.The story illustrates Southern Gothic literature through slavery, racism, and oppressive patriarchal forces. Southern Gothic still idolized
The Concept Of ColonialismThe term “colonialism” is used to characterize the system of domination of the developed countries of Europe (since the end of the XV century) and the USA (since the XIX century) (Cooper, 2002). It occupied vast areas of Asia, Africa, Latin America, Australia and Oceania until the early 1960s (Diop & Moschovakis, 2020). Colonialism also took place in Japan (in the 1st half of the XX century) over a number of areas of East Asia and Oceania (Diop & Moschovakis, 2020).The formation of the system of colonialism began in the era of Great Geographical Discoveries. In the XV-XX centuries there were many colonial empires (Diop & Moschovakis, 2020). The British Empire, the German Colonial Empire, the Spanish Colonial Empire, the Dutch Colonial Empire, the Portuguese Colonial Empire, the French Colonial Empire. Belgium, Denmark, Italy, the USA, Sweden, Japan, etc. had extensive colonial possessions. The system of colonialism of the XV-XIX centuries was characterized by the desire to establish a monopoly in trade with conquered territories (Diop & Moschovakis, 2020). The seizure and plundering of entire countries were often accompanied by the destruction of a significant part of their population. The use of harsh forms of exploitation of the indigenous inhabitants of colonies and slave labor were often involved. Colonial policy during this period was carried out in many cases by specially created large privileged companies, such as East India Companies.From the 2nd half of the XIX century, the exploitation of colonies through unequal trade exchange began to play an important role (Rodney &
Davis, 1972). Colonies were turned into agricultural and raw materials appendages of metropolises with a monocultural direction of agricultural development and into markets for industrial products. At the end of the XIX century, the dependent territories and colonies came under the direct state administration of the metropolises (Cooper, 2002). By 1914, colonies and dependent countries accounted for about 66.8% of the territory and 60% of the world’s population (Diop & Moschovakis, 2020). The national liberation movement in the colonies was brutally suppressed by the metropolises. The struggle between the leading powers for the redistribution of colonies was of no small importance for the beginning of the First World War.Features of ColonialismThe period of colonialism is characterized by some key features: strong states militarily seized undeveloped countries and state entities. The population of the colonies was exploited by feudal lords and slave owners. The metropolises established a monopoly on trade relations with the colonial territories. In fact, the metropolises used the colonized territories only for their enrichment. They accumulated their own capital, thereby further strengthening their positions, becoming world leaders (Diop & Moschovakis, 2020). The largest colonial empire in the history of mankind was Britain: it had colonies on every continent. Among the most famous of them are the USA, Canada, Australia, India. Many African countries were also dependent on Britain.The center of the colonial empire was the metropolis: domination was expressed either in the form of a dominion, that is, the government was carried out by governor, or in the form of a protectorate. European countries
sought not only to own large territories, but also to spread their culture. The Spaniards forcibly carried out Catholicization and Hispanization of the population, the Dutch carried out apartheid and the imprisonment of Africans in reservations (Diop & Moschovakis, 2020). There was a division of the existence of the colonists and the local population, religious communities were formed separately. The colonial administration actively supported local conflicts, for example, the clash of Hindus and Muslims in India (Rodney & Davis, 1972). Decolonization took place after the Second World War; before it, the uprising in Madagascar and the rebellion in Tunisia lasted six years (Rodney & Davis, 1972).Pursued GoalsThe established colonial regime pursued certain goals: dependent countries were used as markets for the sale of their products by Europeans as the profit received was higher there. An important factor was the supply of cheap raw materials to the European part of the continent. Due to the exploitation of colonies, the profit of the colonizers increased. This made it possible to increase the wages of their employees; criminal elements were sent to new territories (Rodney & Davis, 1972). The local population could be used for heavy work; in addition to economic interests, the colonies were used as points for the formation of military bases. This was necessary to maintain the international status and strengthen the security of each empire; the colonialism of territories here was very convenient.Key Consequences of ColonialismPositive ConsequencesIndustrial revolutions affected not only the leading powers, but also the colonial entities, which contributed to their economic and
industrial development. A local intelligentsia was formed in the dependent states (Cooper, 2002). Modernization, the growth of culture and economy in the controlled countries took place relatively rapidly. The world economic market was formed and mobilized.Negative ConsequencesThe more territories a country captured, the less competitive it became on the world stage. Expansion led to a slowdown in development. The colonies lost their natural resources, ethnic identity and partially lost their own culture. The indigenous population of the occupied territories was rapidly forcibly destroyed to reduce their numbers (Cooper, 2002). If forced extermination was not carried out, then people died due to the appearance of epidemics provoked by imported diseases. There was a complete lack of political development in the colonies, and the major powers could not allow this. Due to this fact, such countries are now going through a difficult period of formation of the political structure, accompanied by wars, repression and devastation.The metropolises had stable markets for their products, so they practically did not develop their own production, since there was no such need. A crisis of the structure and culture of traditional society has developed (Rodney & Davis, 1972). A large number of local conflicts have arisen. Empires have not solved a lot of problems in their colonies, which is why wars are still being waged in them. The former metropolises continue to try to participate in the management of the previously fully controlled states. This led to a fierce, including military confrontation between the parties for the right to conduct their own policy.
still going on, groups are fighting for power. Dictatorial regimes were established in Muslim states. In the Middle East, where the British previously ruled, military conflicts regularly flare up.A national liberation movement was formed in India, which took active actions against Britain. As a result, London had to abandon the method of colonial war, as it could result in millions of victims on both sides. There were cases of military skirmishes between the armies of the metropolises and the liberation troops of the colonies. The latter defended their own strategic resources with all their might. At the moment, almost all former colonies are experiencing serious economic difficulties. Only a few states, such as the USA, Australia and Canada, which achieved high development back in the colonial era, did not face problems. The process of formation of independent States after the fall of the colonial system continues to this day.
Commitment to health theory is a special model designed to determine the stages of development and behavior changes. This theory assumes the development of an internal state, as well as the acceptance of the desire to lead a healthy lifestyle under the conditions that any circumstances may limit a person. Moreover, with the help of this theory, the necessary level is determined, which indicates a particular stage of human health (Kelly, 2014). In addition, this theory assumes that there are no established differences, such as gender, race, and others, in order to build behavior aimed at developing a healthy lifestyle. In her research, Kelly (2008) uses the principles of the Transtheoretical Model of Behavior Change. First of all, this is done in order to demonstrate certain stages of the change process. Furthermore, the model used sets specific requirements for health. Thus, the Commitment to Health Theory uses such principles as stages of change, decisive balance, and self-efficiency (Prochaska & Velicer, 1997). In this way, Kelly uses essential principles of this theory; thus, they are interrelated.Concerning advanced nursing practice, this theory can be used as a measurement of some patient indicators. Thus, this model will help determine the goals necessary for the patient to instill the desire to lead a healthy lifestyle. In practice, this theory will also help track the process of change and how to behave with the patient (Kelly, 2008). For example, at the first stage, the task is to instill confidence, as well as to indicate the importance of the necessary changes. At the second stage, strategies are already being applied to strengthen the patient’s desire to improve the overall state of health. The third stage is the final one, and it should introduce the behavioral patterns necessary for maintaining a healthy lifestyle. As a result, health care professionals can use stages of change categories and commitment ratings to personalize therapy by employing change-specific tactics and motivating therapeutic communication techniques.
Being a knowledgeable and experienced professional in one’s professional sphere is, without a doubt, of great importance. For this reason, many students of medical education facilities seek to acquire as much theoretical and practical expertise as possible before graduation. Although such a strategy is by no means wrong, I have recently discovered that the true success in the work of healthcare providers is explained by the doctor’s ability to build relationships with one’s patients. I fully understood the advantage of this simple but often overlooked truth when observing Dr. Wang’s work.Dr. Wang is an experienced professional working in the sphere of eye surgery. Yet, it was surprising for me to discover how easily he/she is able to build close relationships with the patients. After analyzing her/his behavior, I realized that there are certain skills that allow Dr. Wang to gain the trust of the people that come to the Eye Surgery Institute. First of all, he/she is an active listener meaning that all of Dr. Wang’s patients are encouraged to fully and openly express their symptoms and feelings without being interrupted. Secondly, Dr. Wang is always polite and patient with people regardless of her/his overall mood. Finally, I noticed that Dr. Wang is friendly with regular patients as she/he is interested in their health and everyday lives. For instance, I heard Dr. Wang asking a woman regarding her daughter’s health because the patient mentioned that the latter was sick during the last session.As a result of such an attitude towards people, I saw that many treated people could share their problems openly with Dr. Wang as they trusted her/him. In turn, I saw that this allowed the professional to deliver better and more accurate treatment. Moreover, seeing the positive outcome that the ability to build a trustful relationship with the patients has on the healthcare provision, I have become determined to develop this quality. In this regard, I hope that my description of Dr. Wang’s practice will also inspire other current and future medical workers to develop their communication skills.
and food factors are critical for public health (Islam, 2019). It is not enough to identify a problem but find ways to solve it and help the population achieve improvements.A community health nurse (CHN) is responsible for promoting public health and the choice of interventions to address food security. According to Schffer and Strohschein (2019), there are 17 interventions introduced in five groups with different colors, and collaboration is a unique opportunity for all community members to promote and protect health. The main characteristics of this intervention are a high commitment level, partnership, and goal orientation (Schffer & Strohschein, 2019). Collaboration at systems levels helps CHNs reach all appropriate stakeholders, community collaboration is necessary to analyze the current state of affairs, and cooperation with families improves personal knowledge and engagement.
In the history of mankind, the computer has become one of the most important inventions. Hardly anyone can imagine a modern home or office without computers. While some people argue that the computer has provided us with additional conveniences, according to others, the computer has made our life more complex and stressful. I believe that computers, in the first place, have enriched our society with several advantages due to faster communication and easier access to information.The computer provides us with a fast way to communicate. In our time, when modern society is becoming more global, computers play an essential role in communication systems. Previously, communication was limited to means such as mail (Grudin, 2017). If a businessman traveled abroad, the sending of reports and reports, as a rule, was accompanied by significant delays. Since the competitiveness of a business depends on time, this situation was completely unacceptable. The Internet has allowed businesses to send messages instantly. Staff can send emails or instant messages to a manager anywhere in the world (Grudin, 2017). This has added efficiency to businesses and expanded business opportunities.For me, a computer is a technological necessity that makes my life more enjoyable and interesting. First of all, a computer is an excellent leisure tool. Watching movies and various sci-fi programs through my electronic companion is very convenient and comfortable. Also, my daily work, which brings me the lion’s share of my cash income, is not in the least tied to the computer, so it is not just a means of interactivity and entertainment but also a tool for making money.Physicians and other healthcare workers use computers for many essential uses. Computer hardware is widely used in making a diagnosis, conducting examinations and preventive examinations are examples of computer devices and methods of treatment and diagnosis (Farinella & Marco, 2018). Computed tomography and nuclear medical diagnostics provide accurate layered images of internal organ structures (Farinella & Marco, 2018). Ultrasound diagnostics and probing, using the effects of the interaction of incident and reflected ultrasonic waves, opens countless possibilities for obtaining images of internal organs and studying their condition. The diagnostics and treatment methods will be much easier with the help of computer intervention.
In relation to building construction, Code of Practice may be defined as a particular set of standards, procedures, and regulations to which a contractor and developer should adhere to manage potential environmental consequences caused by construction works. For large clients, local authorities, and public bodies, it is applied to new developments and sets out requirements related to the impact of construction. It aims to provide guidance within the framework of legal, administrative, and technical systems for the protection of workers, the environment, and the public and control over major hazard installations. According to the code, by arranging separation between large centers of population, including housing, shops, schools, and hospitals, and major hazard installations and developing appropriate emergency planning, major accidents that may occur at these installations will be prevented.Code of Practice is applied to major hazard installations identified on the basis of a list of hazardous substances associated with threshold quantities. They require priority attention due to the potential for causing highly serious incidents that may negatively impact the environment and people. Thus, major hazard installations include oil refineries, petrochemical and chemical works, storage of flammable liquids, gas, and liquefied petroleum gas, fertilizer works, chemical warehouses, and water treatment works connected with chlorine. Nuclear hazards, hazards of a military nature, and the transportation of potentially hazardous chemicals are excluded from the code due to the differences in their control and management. In general, the code includes a list of activities for competent authorities that should be performed in order to establish major hazard control systems for the prevention of incidents. Competent authorities include government inspectorates and safety authorities, police, local authorities, workers and their representatives, works managements, fire and health authorities, suppliers of major hazard technologies, and other involved organizations.
IntroductionThroughout the history of the United States, the country was the primary direction for out-migration from Latin America. Hispanic and Latino migrants from different countries started to come to the U.S. before the beginning of the Gold Rush. In the following centuries, the influx of Hispanic migrants to the country increased significantly. This paper will consider the conditions of Hispanic out-migration to the U.S. and the reasons that caused the migration of the discussed populations. In addition, different views on Hispanic migration and its effect on the country, including the current impact, will be examined.History of Hispanic MigrationThe Gold RushAlthough the Hispanic minority was present on the territory of the United States since the annexation of Florida and Louisiana, the first great migration started after the end of the U.S.-Mexican War. The end of the war coincided with the discovery of gold in California and led to the first significant influx of Latino migrants to the U.S. (D. Gutiérrez). In addition, the treaty of Guadalupe-Hidalgo signed in 1848 resulted in the territories of California, Arizona, New Mexico, Colorado, and Utah being surrendered by Mexico to the United States (Gregory). Thus, the Hispanic individuals living in these states were naturalized as U.S. citizens, and several thousands of Mexican migrants came to California to work in the gold mines. Overall, most Hispanic migrants to the U.S. in the second half of the 19th century were Mexican.First Half of the 20 th CenturyThe migration from Latin American countries to the United States continued during the 20th century. In the
first half of the century, Mexican comprised the majority of the Hispanic migrants to the country, with a small proportion of immigrants from the Caribbean countries. The influx of migrants can be explained by the acceleration of the agricultural sector in the U.S. and the need for seasonal farmworkers (R. Gutiérrez 3). Although many Latino immigrants were deported during this time, the government invited Mexican laborers to work in the defense industries and the agricultural sector due to the lack of workers caused by the Second World War (Gregory). Thus, the second wave of Hispanic migration was characterized by the need for workers.Second Half of the 20 th CenturyDuring the second half of the 20th century, the Hispanic migration to the U.S. became more diverse. Migrants from Puerto Rico and Cuba were granted permission to enter the country as the former were considered U.S. citizens, while the latter were granted the status of refugees due to Cuba being a Communist country (Gregory). Migrants from other Latin American countries were scarcer due to fewer quotas for the number of persons allowed in the U.S. granted to them.Reasons for Migration and Migration ConditionsThe reasons for Hispanic migrants to travel to the United States are varied. However, it can be argued that the economic reason was and remains most prominent. The country offered high wages for unskilled labor that compared favorably with the wages offered for the same work in the Latin American and Caribbean countries (Sánchez-Alonso 11). Compared to Mexico, Puerto Rico, Cuba, and other nations, the United
States offered more opportunities for migrants from those countries. In addition, various political events, such as the Mexican Revolution, contributed to many people being displaced and immigrating to a safer country (D. Gutiérrez). Most Hispanic migrants opted to move to the United States for economic reasons.It should be noted that a large percentage of immigrants moved to the U.S. as spouses or children of American citizens. In the first waves of migration, spouses often came to the country together. However, most women worked in the household, with under 20% of Hispanic female migrants obtaining positions outside it, primarily in the domestic and personal service sector (R. Gutiérrez 8). Later, the migration trend changed to male migrants coming to the country first in order to find work and establish themselves in the United States before their families could join them. Thus, legislation allowed legal spouses, minor children, and parents of adult U.S. citizens to move to the country (R. Gutiérrez 15). Overall, the conditions of Hispanic individuals migrating to the United States changed substantially throughout history.Views on Hispanic Migration to the U.S.The Hispanic migration to the country was a divisive topic, and people with distinct points of view saw the issues differently. During the Gold Rush and the first half of the 20th century, Hispanic migrants were often victimized and discriminated against due to their ethnicity (R. Gutiérrez 22). However, employers considered migrants essential to maximize profit (R. Gutiérrez 22). In 1965, the Hart-Celler Act was established to prevent discrimination and better account for immigrants coming to
the U.S. from different countries, affecting many ethnic minorities (R. Gutiérrez 14). Although the act regulates what persons are allowed to enter and remain in the country, it is often argued that the act normalizes and decriminalizes the anti-Mexican laws that are ignored when there is a need for seasonal workers (R. Gutiérrez 22). In the last two decades, views on immigration did not change substantially, with the Republicans viewing it as a critical threat, while the democrats have a milder view on it (Hammer and Kafura 2). Overall, the view on Hispanic migration remained largely negative since the first arrival of immigrants during the Californian Gold Rush.Effect of Hispanic Migration to the U.S.Effect of Migration throughout the History of the CountryThroughout the history of the United States, Hispanic migration primarily affected the country’s economy. During the Gold Rush, the Hispanic population comprised primarily Mexican migrants, who were engaged in several economic sectors, including the gold, copper, and coal industries (R. Gutiérrez 5). One of the most significant contributions of the small Hispanic populations was their work on the railroads and irrigation systems in the West of the U.S. (R. Gutiérrez 5). It should be noted that the labor of the Hispanic community was less restricted by government policies and regulations than other migrant groups. At the beginning of the 20th century, authorized and unauthorized Mexican immigrants comprised the majority of seasonal agricultural workers in the southwest of the United States (R. Gutiérrez 8). Furthermore, in the 1940s, due to the mobilization of the American population,
country today. According to Huertas and Kirkegaard, the Hispanic population of the U.S. contributes significantly to the economic growth and development of the nation and is expected to continue this contribution in the coming decades (2). Today, first, second, and third-generation Hispanic migrants achieve better living standards than migrants from other countries and actively engage in the country’s economic life. Huertas and Kirkegaard point out that the Hispanic community has higher levels of opportunity-driven business ventures that support the economy than other U.S. populations. Research shows that the Hispanic population of the United States is among the youngest ethnic minorities (Huertas and Kirkegaard 19). If the non-Hispanic labor force is aging and is less likely to contribute to the economy, the Hispanic population remains relatively young and vital. A forecast predicts that by 2048 the Latino community will account for most of the labor input in the country’s economy (Huertas and Kirkegaard 20). Thus, Hispanic migration is expected to play a crucial role in the future of the United States.ConclusionIn summary, the Hispanic migrant community has a long history in the United States. Since the Gold Rush and throughout the 20th century, migrants from Mexico, Puerto Rico, Cuba, and other Latin countries have come to the country. Their reasons for migrating to the country were primarily economic due to better wages being offered in the U.S. compared to their countries of origin. Although the views on Hispanic migration primarily remain negative, this community contributes significantly to the economy of the United States.
In the present day, the preservation of Confederate statues provokes multiple discussions. According to the official political agenda supported by former President Donald Trump, these monuments are the historical symbols of the United States that should be protected. However, more and more evidence supports the public opinion that Confederate statues should be removed as they aim to demonstrate racial disparities and the supremacy of Whites. The main argument of this claim is supported by the fact that the majority of monuments were erected not directly after the Civil War but in the 1900-the 1920s (Best, 2020). During this period, several discriminatory laws against Black people’s social rights were enacted.The construction of Confederate monuments was sponsored by the United Daughters of the Confederacy. In the present day, it was regarded as a part of the union’s long-lasting strategy that aimed to strengthen White supremacy and social inequities based on race. The connection of statues with structured racism is obvious as the second wave of Confederate monuments’ erection was in the 1920-1940s, along with “Black Americans’ fighting for civil rights and pushing back against widespread lynchings in the South” (Best, 2020, para. 4). Thus, Confederate monuments placed across Southern states, especially on courthouse grounds, aimed to demonstrate the protection of Whites by the law. The undeniable racial context of monuments’ construction has finally led to their removal or relocation during the last several years in response to discrimination against Black citizens.From a personal perspective, it is impossible to deny that Confederate statues were directly connected with efforts to strengthen White supremacy. That is why a considerable number of them may be removed – however, not all. In general, human history includes both positive and negative events. Although a considerable number of people prefer to destroy all attributes of tragic times, they should be remembered as well. In other words, mistakes of the past should be remembered for their avoidance in the future.
Conflict management at the workplace is one of the crucial elements related to the organization of work in healthcare facilities. In this regard, McKibben (2017) asserts that conflict is an inevitable part of any human interaction, especially when the collective activity is associated with physical, mental, and ethical complexity found in hospitals. Consequently, if ignored or not handled adequately, the disputes between the colleges at the workplace lead to decreased performance and satisfaction levels of the involved employees (Suifan, Alhyari, & Sweis, 2020). This, in turn, negatively impacts the overall quality of provided patient care. Therefore, it is important to resolve the conflicts as soon as they appear. However, to understand how to manage disputes effectively, one should understand the factors that cause them.In general, all the antecedents of organizational conflicts may be divided into three groups, namely individual, interpersonal, and organizational. As for the former, Kim et al. (2017) argue that the healthcare professional’s self-esteem, self-focus, emotional intelligence, prevalent responses to conflict, communication styles, and overall worldview determine the frequency and severity of the disputes. In a similar vein, Chang, Chen, and Chen (2017) found that a person’s license level, age, and previous experience of working in other collectives can all affect the behavior during conflict situations. Interpersonal conflicts, on the contrary, are caused by such factors as lack of trust and respect towards a person, power abuse, and ineffective communication (Kim et al., 2017). Finally, organizational conflicts stem from the overall structure and work arrangement. In this respect, such factors as ambiguously defined responsibilities and inadequate hierarchy can cause dissatisfaction and disputes (Kim et al., 2017; McKibben, 2017). Therefore, this type of conflict appears as a result of weak or wrongful management decisions.I have also participated in several conflicts that can be explained by the factors mentioned above. Firstly, I have a friend who is generally a good person but who is quite self-focused; thus, he often fails to recognize other people’s opinions. Due to that, we usually have to do what he wants, which eventually leads to conflict when I become tired of compromising. Secondly, I have noticed that many conflicts between me and my parents and friends are caused by my inability to control one’s emotions. Finally, once, we had a conflict with my classmates while working on the team project as we failed to discuss the responsibilities of each person before starting.
the Confucian gentleman and compare this idealistic archetype with Plato’s philosopher-king.This idea that stems from the traditional Chinese culture continues to hold its importance for society. Such a man stands above evil ideas, recognizes them, and counteracts their effects to the best of their abilities (Yu-kit 225). Moreover, the Confucian gentleman helps others to do so through the transfer of knowledge (Yu-kit 223). Yu-kit writes that a noble person, according to Confucius, must take “a dual role of an exemplar and educator” (224). Virtues are the second nature of this man, and he exhibits them daily. The Confucian gentleman is the one who lives by the highest moral standards and aims to help others achieve the realization of this goal.Plato’s philosopher-king possesses several similarities to this archetypical role. They both are set to exhibit certain positive moral qualities while addressing negative ones through reason and rationale. He is ultimately humble and stoic and continuously seeks wisdom for the sake of the betterment of society (Mark). Notably, Plato’s archetype is more leaning toward education rather than living life as a role model for others.In conclusion, both roles possess certain qualities that define a noble person following moral qualities, such as kindness, fairness, selflessness, and the striving for harmony. However, Plato’s version of an ideal person is a stoic leader who puts wisdom at the highest value, while the Confucian gentleman is set to uphold moral values first. They are both set to uplift the personal values of other people through kindness and selflessness.
The organizational strategy involves the expansion of healthcare institutions in sub-Saharan Africa. Unlike the typical medical services in the field, the institutions would comprise medical records management employees and other statistical professionals. The need for this expansion into the open offices of sub-Sahara Africa can be explained by its rising business and investment opportunities for the particular area through the past decade (Omilola & Sanogo, 2020). High demand for a group of employees to relocate to the chosen destination can then be noted. Considering the political and economic value of each country, it would be best to initially arrange the expansion to the most developed and largest countries of the area. Therefore, the targeted countries include Kenya, Nigeria, and South Africa. Moreover, additional countries and locations can be proposed to ensure adequate healthcare development once the business relocation proves successful. The total number of supported relocating employees for all three countries should not exceed thirty per office to allow maximum productivity and financial coverage.Employees with different levels of experience and expertise will receive varying bonuses and pay changes. However, it is important to establish general policies for all relocating workers. In that way, the move must not compromise the employee’s previous health state and lifestyle (Oyelere & Oyelere, 2021). Commissaries, banking, and currency exchange make up an essential part of the adjustment process and must therefore be provided by the company. The location of the offices would then be close to the leading establishments necessary for domestic purposes. Furthermore, the contrasting climate conditions are to be
considered as well, requiring both a medical checkup before the move and setting up urgent-care stations reserved for emergencies. The health of medical professionals and other employees is a particularly principal aspect to plan due to the nature of the business field.The organization should set an assignment length of one year to gain the necessary data while also building the company’s experience. Research has indicated an increasing number of short-term relocations for problem-solving purposes (Pucik et al., 2017). This statistical finding suggested higher productivity and increased work efficiency in the case of one-year assignments. Consequently, families should consider the disadvantages of traveling in favor of the company’s interests. It is possible that some employees would not choose to relocate with their families for a short period for evident reasons; the move may be inconvenient. Moreover, while a one-year-long assignment is officially recommended, additional work months can be added in specific cases. For instance, in the case of the business goals not being reached or a new project appearing.As previously mentioned, the decision to relocate along with one’s family would be reviewed by the employees themselves and financed accordingly by the organization. Depending on the structure of each family, including the number and ages of any children, particular arrangements would be necessary. Before organizing the details, each worker must fill out a form indicating the essential information on their moving family members (if any), including any children and their current level of education. One optimal option for incoming school children involves international schools, which would provide an
Consequentialism is an ethical philosophy that determines whether something is right or wrong based on its repercussions. The consequentialist view of euthanasia and physician-assisted suicide has always had opponents and supporters. While there are scholars and researchers who believe that legalizing a given activity will be a so-called slippery slope, others believe that prohibiting it is a violation of fundamental rights and disregards human autonomy.Support for independence and choice is commonly cited as a major motivation for legalizing physician-assisted suicide and euthanasia. However, Dickinson et al. state that 80% of healthcare workers find the given practice not ethically justifiable (Dickinson et al., 2002). Meanwhile, several publications have argued that this is due to a misunderstanding of autonomy’s ethical importance (Sjöstrand et al., 2011). It has been claimed that if autonomy is correctly understood as a value, then assisted suicide and euthanasia are both unethical since they damage the patient’s rights.Sjöstran et al. explore the argument of autonomy by delving into the idea of its value. Beginning with the present discussion in end-of-life healthcare, two distinct perspectives of how autonomy is valued were examined. The scholars examined one argument where euthanasia and PAS could be against the best interest of patients and a second argument where euthanasia implies a right to uphold autonomy (Sjöstrand et al., 2011). As a result, Sjöstran et al. determined that neither line of argument can be utilized since not all cases of PAS or euthanasia can be considered acceptable, and the harmful consequences outweigh these arguments.On the contrary, Weinstock perceives harm reduction
IntroductionElectronic services can be used to provide a wide range of remote services, including patient care and education, and monitoring. Telehealth is a revolutionary technology that could reform and enhance the healthcare system by lowering costs, improving quality, and increasing patient satisfaction. During the recent COVID-19 epidemic, which affected both privately insured and Medicare beneficiaries, patients increasingly received healthcare treatments from providers not situated near their doctors. There were restrictions on who may perform and where they could be reimbursed before the pandemic. Due to COVID-19, Congress and the CMS enhanced traditional Medicare’s coverage of telehealth services to make medical treatment more accessible and reduce coronavirus exposure in healthcare settings. Without legislative action, Medicare’s telehealth coverage will revert to its pre-pandemic levels when the public health emergency expires.A New Contribution-Based Incentive Model (CBI)This paper suggests a new physician compensation model that rewards productivity, quality, and community involvement. The CBI Model combines a secure base salary with configurable core incentives to give physicians more career flexibility. The CBI model basically works towards motivating the physicians based on their outcomes and quality and offers great career autonomy. The model also steers organizational stewardship and the degree of clinical and other related activities in physician fields to another level.A Flexible Formula Aligns Disparate InterestsSalary-based compensation schemes will become increasingly popular in the healthcare industry in the wake of the pandemic as physicians seek a more stable and predictable source of income. A modest yet significant part of total compensation is the goal of this model’s base wage (Kwon &
Kim, 2022). The starting wage of a doctor is indeed higher than that of an entry-level employee. However, physicians can still expect to see a rise in their pay by meeting or exceeding their employers’ vision, strategic direction, and specific goals. A modest base wage is a safety net for physicians, as it reduces the possibility of burnout or other adverse effects of financial strain. The performance will improve if incentive points are allocated openly and transparently.Many conditions have to be met before doctors can participate in the bonus structure, including regular clinical activity and productivity in line with the physician’s base salary (on a fair market value basis). Second is quality thresholds with outcomes set by the organization, and third is agreed-upon community service efforts (Brousselle et al., 2020). It is possible to influence physician behavior by varying financing for each “Core Incentive” based on the business’s goals, needs, and purposes.Increased Productivity Leads to an Increase in RevenueIn business, productivity and revenue go directly proportionally in different aspects. Revenue generation goes alongside the rate of productivity in most cases. Work relative value units are the units used to gauge physician productivity at the moment (wRVUs) (Mehrotra et al., 2020). Productivity-based incentive compensation can be provided to avoid anti-cooperative behavior and over-utilization (a suitable percentage of base pay, incentives, or compensation benchmarks. It is, therefore, evident that productivity depends directly on incentives given to employees.Quality Measures Give Top Priority to Patient TreatmentCommercial and government payers have developed quality standards to recompense providers for their services. Measures
possible leadership activities include public speaking and research publications and service on administrative boards, and media/public appearances (Smith et al., 2020). With an objective, well-defined technique, physicians and organizations can create trust in each other. The CBI Model’s success can be attributed to a structure that mandates measurable activities consistently communicated to participating general practitioners openly and transparently. Instilling a sense of fairness and healthy rivalry among peers is made possible thanks to the transparency of the process. In each Core Incentive, physicians are classified into quartiles based on their performance. For the highest performers, it is suggested that the payouts for each quartile be weighted. There is a more significant release of Core Incentive Funding since more physicians are eligible for Core Incentive payouts. To maximize the incentives, physicians are encouraged to mobilize participation among their colleagues.ConclusionIn summary, the CBI Model’s alignment models and proposed amendments to the AKS and Stark laws complement and reinforce the model’s timeliness while remaining true to its essential principles. The model is a vital feature when it comes to the motivation of the general service providers. Following the COVID-19 outbreak, healthcare practitioners have been forced to reconsider the value of cradle-to-grave care, a strategy that relies on cutting-edge technology to offer appropriate care at the appropriate time and in a suitable location.
Corporate entrepreneurship is the process by which groups inside an existing corporation build, foster, promote, and administer a new business distinct from the parent organization. However, these new entities emphasize the parent’s holdings, competitive positioning, knowledge, or other capabilities. The new groups may also be an oxymoron while again utilizing the unconventional approach to further economic growth alongside the meticulous planning, framework, and organization that several large firms have developed over time (Demirkan et al., 2019). Instead of reclining on their glories, the world’s wealthiest organizations, such as Amazon as well as Samsung, are progressively undertaking proactive innovation projects to prevent disruption.Amazon Custom is an excellent extension of an existing innovative initiative that has reaped the benefits of both evolutionary and radical tactics. As the name indicates, this ambitious new approach allows suppliers to provide customized items on Amazon for the first time (for example, custom text, customization, and so on) (Demirkan et al., 2019). Samsung’s innovative business strategy entails delegating new projects to an expert ‘creative elite,’ guaranteeing that they are prepared to include best practices and produce maximum KPIs (Demirkan et al., 2019). To achieve these objectives, the industry’s inventive elite use open innovation as well as corporate technical reconnaissance strategies.New product advocates explore ideas for new merchandise by independent strategic orientation, a bottom-up method. The iPod is an excellent example. It was built with the help of the company’s workers’ staffing and engineering knowledge. This approach adheres to the company’s existing strategies. Inspired strategic behavior is a top-down procedure in which policy is processed via the company’s pre-existing hierarchical structure (Demirkan et al., 2019). This process is consistent with the firm’s existing approaches, with the iPhone serving as an example. As a result, the most likely commercial development is induced business strategy. The focus of creative behavior strategy is on human effort rather than the technological aspect. It includes new ideas, products, and procedures into a person’s position. He subsequently becomes an expert in the field and works for the firm to generate fresh ideas.
Sociology considers social strata built according to the criteria of race, age, education, and, above all, socioeconomic status. It is precisely the strata by the socioeconomic situation that are most entrenched in modern sociology. Although, in my opinion, studies on the topic of social strata by race and medical care are the most exciting and responsive to the demands of society. Sociology shows the possible causes of the emergence of social phenomena, including inequality. Due to the correlation of certain events or properties that sociologists record in their studies, people can see these reasons.These correlations form the basis for creating charts reflecting statistical and demographic studies. Based on the results obtained, it becomes possible at one time to make sociological forecasts, including those related to public health. Having complete information about public health and inequality in this area, it is possible in the future to build a unique way of life, taking into account education and prospective job.For example, sociologists find a correlation between the level of education received at a young age and possible illnesses in maturity and old age. I would also note the specifics of education itself in correlation with the characteristics of diseases. People who are educated in programming or cybersecurity will not have the same health problems as those educated in music. Even if these people at the age of 20, during their studies, show the same health indicators and (and) have similar complaints, the gap will be noticeable in the future. At the age of 20, the probability of the
large databases, modern sociologists can describe current trends in the healthcare sector. However, not only socioeconomic status as such affects health. An important aspect that partially affects socioeconomic status is the ecology of the territory where people live. I want to touch upon this topic separately since environmental issues now occupy one of the first places in socioeconomic research. Suppose people can afford to live in ecologically clean areas while not having a high level of education or having a minimal range of skills for work. In that case, their health, in general, will not deteriorate rapidly. In comparison, people (with high status) living in polluted cities may suffer from diseases that are not typical for their class and environment. Most people with high socioeconomic status have opportunities to travel and move from city to city or country to country. Climate change most often has a positive effect on their stamina and health.
2021). Americans wanted to concentrate on domestic matters, including a threatening spread of communist ideas (Russett, 2019). It is noteworthy that the USA could hardly interfere and have a considerable impact on European affairs due to the country’s comparatively low economic might. The United States was not a financial leader at that period, so its influence was limited.Moreover, the USA alone could not prevent the world war because it was outbroken as a result of the clash between European countries. The outcomes of the Treaty of Versailles laid the ground for the new war, as almost all stakeholders were dissatisfied. Germany accumulated resources and developed alliances with other dictatorships, so any country could not play a decisive role in this conflict. No nation could prevent the start of the new war as the regimes that emerged in Europe (the communist USSR, Nazi Germany, and fascist Italy) were likely to start a new military conflict that would inevitably grow into a world war. Therefore, it is possible to assume that the USA could not have prevented the start of the Second World War even if the American government had abandoned its isolationist foreign policy. At that, the country made a tremendous contribution to stopping the war and establishing a new world order.
This paper will provide an analysis of the article “COVID-19: Impact on Nurses and Nursing” by Fauteux (2021). The abstract is supposed to be the opening of the article. It is a way to quickly introduce the reader to the results of the research. In this article, the abstract is a brief overview of the topic that will be discussed. However, it contains no information about the methods of the research or its results. On this basis, such an abstract cannot be called comprehensive.The article’s introduction is already more extensive, offering a general overview of the topic. It provides information that the times of coronavirus pandemic have affected nursing. In addition, the introduction has statistics, which introduce the reader to the subject in a tangible way. From the introduction, I learned about the general factors of COVID’s effect on nursing, including increased mortality, changes in work practices, and increased workload. This introduction can be considered extensive and adequate. The research method of this article is qualitative in that a review of a body of research draws empirical conclusions. These conclusions relate to the significant changes that have occurred in nursing and its nature. The study uses quantitative data that has already been processed and presents an overview of information previously analyzed.The result of the study is the identification of the main factors of change in nursing. These include the intensification of collaboration and innovation, the removal of practice barriers, the popularization of telemedicine, and the increased risks of burnout (Fauteux, 2021). I learned how much nursing has been affected by the pandemic. I was mostly interested in the increased risk of nurse burnout due to too much workload. I also learned about the popularization of telemedicine due to the pandemic, which was a revelation to me because the attitude of the patients to their health seems to have drastically changed after the virus outbreak. This article is beneficial in understanding how an entire division of medical practice can change under extreme conditions.
Historically, law enforcement was founded on the need to ensure citizens’ safety, possession, and health and to safeguard the people from civil disorder and crime. As such, Harris (2020) shows that law enforcement’s lawful powers included using force legitimized by the government or arrests through a monopoly on violence. In its primitive system, law enforcement clan members banded together to enforce rules of the group on rogue members. The purpose behind enforcing societal directives, conducting human control, and empowering authoritative enforcement of those rules was to safeguard the people from rogue members.The community believed that any form of violence against any of them was tantamount to an attack on the rest (Harris, 2020). Therefore, to achieve its purpose, early law enforcement employed three fundamental features, no coercion, law enforcement had a wide array of tasks. The third feature was a critical distinction between the people legally endowed with policing responsibilities and those who carried out policing duties.Peace offices have the mandate of ensuring that whether on or off duty, they shall not commit any crime knowingly under the country’s laws. In the U.S., for example, peace officers are bound by local and state jurisdiction not to commit a crime. The other responsibilities of the peace officer are to not knowingly disobey the rule of law on criminal procedures, especially in such areas as detention, arrests, evidence preservation, and the use of informants (Schroeder & Lombardo, 2018). Further, no peace officer shall exceed their authority when enforcing the law, and no individual freedom shall be restricted by peace officers (Schroeder & Lombardo, 2018). Only except the law is police officers allowed to disobey the rule of law relative to the criminal procedures.
Lawsuit TendenciesCivil lawsuits are constantly evolving and are driving new trends to emerge. For decades, filing criminal charges against police officers for excessive use of force has been extremely rare. Even if the defendants were convicted, the jury did not want to find them guilty. However, nowadays, there is a growing trend in the number of lawsuits against the police, and the percentage of successful settlements is also increasing. There are many lawsuits out of court, which causes anxiety to enforcement officials who are afraid of potential cases. Moreover, is a tendency to protect the rights of citizens and to punish any person who subjects to the deprivation of any rights, secured by the Constitution (The United States Code, 1980). Such individual shall be liable notwithstanding his job, but the requirements of a declaratory decree shall be considered.Tendencies concerning corrections lawsuits and equality among people have also been modified. Analysis of the case law enables one to conclude that although correctional facilities have broad powers, they have the primary duty to ensure equal conditions for people with disabilities. Under the Americans with Disabilities Act (2010), physical or mental disabilities should not diminish a person’s right to participate in all aspects of society. Therefore, even in justiciability lawsuits, there is a need to provide exceptional facilities and necessary assistance for everyone who requires it.Civil liability issues have a direct impact on the criminal justice system. As a result of tendencies toward equal opportunity and protection of the needy, the specifics of justice are reversing. According to the
The concept of geographic uniformity was no longer actively used, and Congress authorized the judiciary to amend and have exclusive authority over the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure. This reform has led to duplication of cases, increasing costs, and delays. The sweeping changes impacted all elements of civil litigation and gave criminal justice professionals a stimulus to be more assertive in their cases. Criminal justice professionals came under pressure for the enormous growth of issues and overhead (Horner et al., 2018). Employees became highly frustrated, making civil litigation even more frustrating and time-consuming.Civil litigation has been plagued by the many changes that have been necessary because of the crisis of the judicial system. The subjects of lawsuits, the length of the litigation process, its peculiarities, and its size have altered. Despite this, costs and delays are still high, and the system is not functioning completely. Moreover, all of the reforms directly affected criminal justice professionals. Still, they have not been favorable or effective because they have provided little encouragement to undertake meaningful activities.
The decline of the 14-15th centuries, also known as the crisis of the late Middle Ages, is a term used in Western historiography to refer to the recession processes that took place in some countries of Western Europe. Western historians, considering the socio-economic processes in some European countries in the 14-15th centuries, paid particular attention to the “crisis phenomena” in the European economy of these periods (Cole and Symes). They put in the first place the movement of prices, population, “desolation” of lands, and others as determining factors of recession (Cole and Symes). Although the Middle Ages were once seen as a time of ignorance and social oppression, it is now understood as a dynamic period during which the idea of Europe as a separate cultural unit appeared.Since the 20s of the 14th century, the economic downturn in the history of Europe has begun. The population was declining, while cultivated lands were mainly abandoned. Cities were falling into decline, agricultural and industrial products were reducing, technological progress was suspended, the development of trade, primarily foreign exchange, was slowing down, prices were falling. Additionally, the period is characterized mainly by overcoming feudal fragmentation and the formation of centralized states in France and England. Using the financial resources of the cities, the kings could constantly maintain a mercenary army to fight rebellious feudal lords. The appearance of firearms at the beginning of the XIV century reduced the importance of chivalry. Castles could not withstand artillery, and the appearance of hand-held firearms made heavy knight armor meaningless.After the period
of rapid population growth, Europe faced the depression phase. It has been traditionally believed that the late Middle Ages is vividly characterized by demographic decline. There were three significant factors for the recession: plague epidemic, famine, and numerous wars. In addition, the weather conditions were also to blame since winters became harsh at the end of the 13th century. The soil was inappropriate for planting crops which took a toll on the nutrition of European residents. At the time of the Great Famine, thousands of people died daily from lack of food, parents sold and ate their children, cannibalism was widespread. Hence, the population struggled to survive and did not focus on materialistic goals.The other reason for the decline was the plague which quickly spread around Europe and killed millions of people. It is believed that the epidemic has penetrated almost every corner of the continent, killing from 30 to 50 percent of the population (Cole and Symes). The mass fled from the cities gripped by the disease gave rise to anarchy, panic, and mob rule. For fear of getting sick, anyone who aroused even the slightest suspicion was dragged to the infirmary by force. The suicide epidemic, which intensified along with the spread of infection, forced the authorities to adopt special laws that threatened those who took their own lives to put their corpses to the public eye. Together with the sick, healthy people often got into the infirmary, who was found in the same house with the ill or dead, which forced people to
hide the sick and secretly bury the corpses. Therefore, the contemporaries again had the only goal – survival.Ultimately, the revolts created severe conditions for the Europeans in the late Middle Ages. The pressure on the poor caused peasants to rebel against the nobles. Being a peasant was viewed as something pejorative, which opposed wealth and status. While the aristocracy was accustomed to a luxurious lifestyle, the poor considered their fraud. Hence, these two classes were fighting against each other with increased violence. However, the nobles beat those from lower stratification since they had more power. In addition, the War of Roses, Hundred Years’ War, Polish-Teutonic Wars, and some others have greatly devastated the European territory leading to political, economic, and social dissonance. Consequently, the population was trying to make ends meet to survive.For all its versatility, spirituality and culture of the Middle Ages were built around one vector. Religion permeated all spheres of life in medieval society and changed their perception of crisis (Gaddy 72). The Church continued to eradicate heresy to a large extent, repressing religious sects and urging priests to punish unorthodox followers (Gaddy). Meanwhile, the peasantry practiced pagan customs and began mixing them with Catholic ones. The Church has become the center of social contradictions, weakening the political influence of the Papacy in the 14th century. It further led to the development of independent centralized states.The religious assumptions have also given rise to the progress of art and sciences, initiated by the development of universities and the spread of scholarship. The revived interest
brought to the fore ethics, the science of the formation of human personality based on a thoughtful reading of Roman authors with their ideal of human dignity. The defining feature of Italian humanism was the possession of classical instead of medieval Latin. Contemporaries appreciated Petrarch for his treatises on history and ethics, written in beautiful classical Latin. Petrarch studied the norms of elegant Latin from Cicero, whose works he tirelessly searched in the monastery libraries (Robinson 249). For his Latin writings, Petrarch was crowned with a laurel wreath in Rome.What is more, the New Testament was viewed as a source of faith formation, especially during the crisis. Since the Catholic faith was spread by people, the New Testament was the book to rely upon when praying (Luther 358). The church was gaining more power causing individuals to convert and making them serve for the sake of God (Gaddy 114). It also helped shape the concept of chivalry and contributed to the rise of women’s status in society (Luther 359). Consequently, the population was trying to find peace resorting to religion during the decline.In conclusion, the crisis of the Middle Ages caused devastating consequences on Europe; however, it gave rise to cultural formation. The recession was primarily driven by the plague, famine, and conflicts making contemporaries suffer and fight for life. Therefore, their only goal was survival and trying to find reconciliation in religion. The religious assumptions of that time have significantly impacted the development of culture and education.
of African Americans.In the history of slavery, the first population compelled to undergo the severe process of enslavement was the Indians. For instance, Spanish explorers utilized Indian labor in their colonies to convert the population to Christianity, enforcing the necessity of slave labor on the individuals who refused to accept the Christian faith (Williams 8). Similarly, Great Britain and France supported slavery in the colonial territories; however, this event was not connected to racial predispositions but to the fact that slavery served as a preventative penalty for the indigenous communities. Nevertheless, over the course of history, enslaved Negroes became a highly more important asset in the slave trade due to the economic benefits, leading to the establishment of Negro slavery as a normal condition (Williams 21). As a result, racism and racial discrimination emerged, but the initial origin for substituting other enslaved people with African Americans remained economic, not racial.To conclude, the connection between slavery and racism lies in the fact that racial predispositions towards African Americans were caused by the overwhelming use of enslaved African Americans. As such, slavery did not emerge as a result of racism; on the contrary, individuals from various races and ethnic communities were involved in the slave trade. Nevertheless, after the economic benefits of using enslaved African Americans were established, negative racial stereotypes began to emerge, leading to the occurrence of racism.
family, and this event matters more than what he experienced as a prisoner of war.The third part to analyze is Chapter 5 – “Mouse Holes.” This section shows that, for many mice, war is a series of difficult decisions that must be made in order for them to try to survive (Spiegelman, 1980). Even when parents learn about the death of their children, they need to keep a cold mind so as not to get caught by the cats.To draw a conclusion, one may say that this graphic novel is a unique literary work about World War II. In these comic drawings, Spiegelman managed to portray the horrors of the holocaust and those little but meaningful things that supported the victims and helped some of them to remain hopeful. Despite the fact that the war was full of violence and murders, the author shows the irony of the situation – the Germans are just animals who imagine they are better than others.
The only way to cope with life’s everyday complexities is by commanding your mind. In that, whatever you are doing, feel about a situation, or whichever action you want to undertake, all are determined by the quality of your thinking. Critical thinking helps one gain control over their life, deal with life’s challenging situations, and make a rational decisions for the matter. Therefore, before acting on any decision made, it is important to think critically about the situation at hand and evaluate the best solution to apply. Thus, this paper will apply the critical thinking steps in my personal experience describing what I will do at various stages to combat the problem and make a decision. Before arriving at the last carefully thought decision, I will follow up on each of the stages of critical thinking to arrive at a sound decision. According to Medeiros et. (2019), the steps of critical thinking are; identifying the problem, detaching from emotional involvement, and determining solution criteria. They also include gathering and evaluating information, considering personal values and beliefs, and choosing and evaluating the solution.On identifying the problem, I will look at the niche that exists in my family. Many times I overreact when a small dispute or rather a disagreement arises and therefore, I do not relate well with my mother since such an episode occurred ten years ago. I am sure she cannot stand me either though I have reformed and would like to go to my childhood home someday. On the same note, having separated from
The Poem of The Righteous Sufferer is a Mesopotamian poem about the unjust suffering of a suffering man. The Poem is small, consisting of nearly 500 lines, and written in Akkadian. It is relevant to its time of creation because, by the 13th century B.C., people had already begun to understand the need for moral foundations. The story is told in the first person, who honors his gods, but suffers from many illnesses. The Poem is a kind of reflection of alienation from the divine, drawing attention to injustice and the problem of morality. In this regard, the Poem of the Righteous Sufferer allows the historical community to explore ancient Mesopotamia’s cultural values and social attitudes.First and foremost, the Poem is seen as one of the beginnings of the biblical narratives of the Old Testament. The fall of man and his repentance are essential elements of the Poem. In terms of its cultural contribution, it is crucial to understand the Babylonians’ view of the divine. Awareness becomes the companion of the Poem’s protagonist, and he realizes that not all the good that happens to him is good to God. His lamentations are seen as a prayer complaint against the injustice accompanying a man, no matter how much wealth he possesses.The source demonstrates how people’s consciousness and doubts about life’s value have been transformed. This cultural heritage shows that a righteous lifestyle does not mean good treatment from the deities. Possible injustice significantly affects society, so the protagonist laments, “the persecutor persecutes me day in and day
Culture is the entirety of social norms, behaviors, and customs which distinguish a certain society from the rest of the world. Naturally, some cultures have common features, thus forming cultural clusters. At the same time, leadership is a personality trait that transcends national boundaries. This does not imply that all people with power behave in the same manner, as leaders are also influenced by cultural norms.Behavior differences are evident in the way people in different clusters view time. Middle Eastern cultures are frequently juxtaposed to Western ones, particularly American. Beehner writes that while “most Middle Eastern nations are past oriented” and uphold traditions, “many Americans believe they can control the future and embrace change for the sole purpose of changing” (72). Barak Obama is an example of a leader who gained prominence by articulating the importance of change.The list of differences in leadership behaviors is not limited to the perception of the future. Crede et al. have conducted a study in which they ascertain cultural differences in relation to transformational leadership. (23). The most peculiar finding is that “transformational leadership exhibits stronger relationships with subordinate performance in cultures with low levels of gender egalitarianism values” (Crede et al. 23). This implies that the more traditional a culture is, the more successful leaders are likely to be in transformational endeavors.Altogether, there is a definite influence of culture on the conduct of leaders. Therefore, the definition of culture should include the importance of its effect on leadership behaviors. Not only does culture distinguish a certain social group, but it also underscores the likelihood of changes driven by people who have authority. After all, these people are the ones who make the most important decisions in society.
is socially constituted, meaning that many cultures share the same visions and values. For example, my own culture is similar to the culture of my friends and the people surrounding me as we live within the same context and share similar approaches. However, at the global level, my system of beliefs and visions differs from the same framework used by people from other regions to guide their decision-making and actions. It is explained by the social nature of culture and its unique character. It includes different perspectives and attitudes shared by people from similar communities and, at the same time, it influences their mentalities and visions. For this reason, it is possible to conclude that culture is a social construct influencing social interactions and fundamental institutions vital for everyday interactions.
The process of forming states is not characterized by ease. It involves many different processes, including cultural strategies of strength. It is believed that this aspect in the form of actions of social agents is of particular importance. This is because they occupy a central place in such processes as the formation of alliances and the establishment of dominance relations. Understanding this concept can give a better understanding of the creation of Western Europe, China, the Islamic World, and India.First, it is necessary to understand what a social strategy of power is and what significance it has. Thus, it is defined as a particular area of practice where the creators of mass media have cultural influences and act as agents of social change. Thus, these sources form and influence public opinion, which may affect the formation of states. Gledhill emphasizes that the main reason for the difference between state and stateless societies is the centralization and non-centralization of power. Thus, the absence of the second aspect is expressed in inequality, and the absence of citizenship is associated with decentralization and vice versa with equality.Therefore, in conclusion, to understand the emergence of the state in the case of Western Europe, China, the Islamic World, and India, it is necessary to consider the culture strategy of power. Therefore, the author makes an attempt to distance from the generally accepted European principles and views on the role of social anthropology and factors in Chapter 3. In addition to many other political and economic factors, social influence is of significant importance. Social agents form public opinion and contribute to the formation of opinions. In this way, there is a relationship in the creation of the states of Europe, China, the Islamic World, and India and the social strategies of the authorities.
Assessments of CurriculumAssessment of curriculum is a natural and critical element of instruction, as it allows to evaluate the progress that has been in education. It can be defined as a method that is used to understand the current knowledge that a student possesses (Dikli, 2003). Assessment has always been a contentious issue due to various factors of objectivity, diversity of learning styles, and bureaucratic issues, among others. However, traditional assessments are generally tests and tools that are commonly utilized in academic settings. Some of the most popular tests are multiple-choice tests, true/false, short-answer, and sometimes even essays. These fall under what is commonly known as standardized testing, aimed at objectively test whether a student possesses knowledge of the curriculum. With the same or similar tests given to everyone in a population (classroom, grade, school), the traditional assessments of curriculum provide an insight at the broad effectiveness of instructional strategies. There are certain benefits to traditional assessments, they are easy to construct, implement, and score (often via machines), they are scored objectively providing an appearance of ‘fairness’ and they are most often associated with assessment in public perception (Dikli, 2003). This approach to evaluation is influenced by the scientific, modernist approach, with clearly stated objectives and precise indicators that students have achieved the intended objectives (Ornstein & Hunkins, 2018).Alternative assessments are also known as performance tests or authentic assesmsnts. They are commonly aimed at determining what a student can do rather what they know, measuring proficiency rather than blunt knowledge, known as action strategies (Petre, 2017).
In recent years, the computer technology field has evolved and developed gradually and has contributed to the success of many individuals and organizations. Technology has faced numerous challenges as it continues to grow tremendously. The main challenge is cyber-attack, where criminals have been targeting companies and individuals, creating great harm to the vulnerable users of technology. Some of the incidences that support this claim are information theft, malware, ransomware attack, and hacking of servers which has become a significant challenge to technology users in all parts of the world. Cyber security experts have rescued technology users by detecting and protecting computer systems from these attacks.In 2017 shock befell the globe after learning how helpless the world was after the famous wanna-cry ransomware cyber-attack targeted the Microsoft Windows operating system by encrypting the data of its users. The encrypted ransomware demanded some payments in the form of Bitcoins to decrypt the data, an incident that prompted my venture into a career in technology to help in countering these vices affecting technology. Since all technology forms and systems are vulnerable to cyber-attack and it is not always easy to identify the weak link where the cyber attackers would penetrate, relevant studies such as cyber security would solve this problem.Computer programming sessions were among the best topics back in my school, which drove my desire for this technology path. Being a recent graduate of Electronic Engineering Technology and Computer Engineering Technology from Norfolk State University, getting a chance to pursue a master’s degree in cyber security at Norfolk State
IntroductionDarren Aronofsky is an independent American filmmaker who explores various psychological themes in his movies. While all of them are different, they may be classified as psychological thrillers, with surrealism and magical realism elements. In his various films, Aronofsky shows themes of deep psychology: love, hate, addictions, genius, relationships between humans. Mysticism and surrealism are often present: paranormal phenomena and fantastical events interrupt the main realistic narrative to highlight the central ideas of each film. Archetypical plots, such as biblical legends, are used by Aronofsky as a basis for films mother! and Noah . He often changes the original plot to make it more suitable for modern realities. In other films, such as Requiem for a Dream , and Black Swan , he explores the various pathological states of human consciousness.Films AnalysisMother!The film’s main heroes are the couple living an ordinary and happy life. They both have self-describing names: a man is called Him, and a woman’s name is Mother. Him is a poet, and at the beginning of the film, he is struggling with writing block; while he is doing that, the house where he lives looks like burned remains. He places the crystal object on a pedestal, and then the remnants transform into a full and beautiful home. This fantastic scene symbolizes the power of creation, and one may already see the allegory to the creation of the world by God, and the name Him may as well be an allegory for God. Mother is his wife and muse, inspiring Him to write poems,
which are usually commercially successful: he has many fans. Then, a stranger appears in Him’s house, who presents himself as Man; he pretends to be in search of a bed, but it turns out that he is the admirer of Him’s literature (Given 117). Him is generous, and he agrees that Man may stay in his house and obtain help.Soon, he and Mother notice that Man has a deadly wound and will probably die shortly. Before that, there are several scenes of the beating heart; their meaning will be revealed at the film’s end. After some time, Man’s wife arrives, whose name is Woman, and they both stay at the Him’s house. One may see that their names symbolize manhood and womanhood in general and are allegories of biblical legend about Adam and Eve, the first people on Earth. Mother is dissatisfied by their presence and is visibly annoyed while preparing food for them (Given 117). Him, however, argues that they have the right to obtain help, as they are in a hard situation. Soon, two sons of Man and Women arrive, quarreling about their father’s will; Mother becomes even more displeased. Sons’ argument becomes brutal, and in the end, one of them kills the other.In the second part of the film, which starts the next morning after their intercourse, Mother understands that she is pregnant, and Him is inspired by that. He writes much more actively, and his poems have an enormous commercial success (Given 118). Their life with Mother becomes happy and fruitful; however,
when they organize a lunch, the mob of savage Him’s fans appears. The film ends tragically: while covering him by adulation, the mob behaves themselves as beasts and smashes Him’s house. He does not know how to stop this and is seemingly passive and disoriented (Given 118). When pregnant Mother tries to stop them, they rape and maul her, and she eventually retreats to the basement. Then, she burns out the house, leaving the burning remnants seen at the beginning of the film.mother! has many hidden meanings, connected with symbolic representations used widely throughout the film. Names of characters are chosen carefully, and scenes are designed to show the dramatism of the situation. An example is the close-up scene of bleeding Mother, which is repeated at the beginning and at the end of the film (Given 120). Aronofsky implied a strong environmentalist message in the film: the rape and killing of Mother by the crowd symbolize the terrible and unstoppable consumption of Earth resources by people; Mother refers to Mother Nature (Given 120). When she is brutally mauled at the film’s end, it is a bright metaphor to the unconscious mob of humans who maul the Earth ecosphere similarly (Given 119). Him symbolizes the God who creates the Earth and Nature again and again: at the end of the film, he asks Mother for her love. When she consents, he takes her heart and creates a new crystal object. It reveals the sense of the beating heart, shown at the beginning of the film: it is
the heart of Mother Nature, beating to support life.NoahThe biblical plot also inspires this film, but it interprets the legend more literally, unlike the previous one. While events in mother! take place in modern reality, being only an allusion to the biblical events, Noah resembles the actual ancient times of the legendary Great Deluge. Muffled lights are used to show the visions of Noah, the main hero, about the coming Deluge, at the beginning of the film (Skorin-Kapov 121). Scenes are edited to show the blunt colors and mists, emphasizing that those are the visions in Noah’s head, not the reality; then, he consults with his grandfather about his visions. After that, Noah starts to build his ark, where he, his family, and animals will survive the Deluge. Tubal-Cain, a vice young king who previously killed Noah’s father, tries to seize the ark, but Watchers stop him. They are stone angels sent by God on Earth to defend people. It is one of the film’s fantastic elements, designed by Aronofsky by using motion design (Skorin-Kapov 124). After the retreat, Tubal-Cain starts finding people and weapons to attack the ark again.Along with that, Noah travels to the closest settlements trying to find couples for Ham and Japeth, while Shem already has a girlfriend, Ila, rescued by Noah after the massacre. However, they see that people are extremely cruel and shameless; they threaten Noah, and he retreats with his family to their home. Noah is shown reflecting in various scenes, and this plotline is the main for the
film. Meanwhile, they continue to build the ark, and Noah starts to be utterly disappointed by humanity. He thinks that God wants to wipe out humanity completely, without any recovery, and that only plant and animal life are good to live.The film’s main idea is the fragile line between good and evil, nature and humanity, and reflections about the actuality of such a line. Noah, initially, tends to separate good and evil strictly and without any compromise (Skorin-Kapov 122). He condemns people, being sure that they are impure and sinister, and he is happy that the Great Deluge will wipe them out. Noah is vegetarian, as he thinks that animals are pure and innocent: only humans make them brutal and evil. He is even ready to sacrifice his granddaughters, born by Ila, to stop the line of human reproduction. However, he stops when seeing that they all sleep peacefully, full of love and not hate. Eventually, he transforms, and his last will to his descendants is to multiply and live well.Requiem for a DreamThis film is not focused on divine and biblical plots; it shows ordinary people who suffered from drug addiction and all the hardships connected with it. Main heroes want only to live their lives happily and realize their dreams but cannot do that; they all become drug addicts, ending up with that in different ways. One of the main characters, Sara, spends her time watching TV while her son Harry is taking heroin along with his girlfriend Marion and friend Tyrone. The name
of this film is connected with the broken dreams caused by drug addiction. Aronofsky uses scenes with close-ups and split screens to show the feeling of despair and hopelessness, typical for this extremely dark film (Skorin-Kapov 22). Various characters described there are all connected by a similar problem. They all want to realize their dreams: Sara wants to look good, Harry and Marion wish to open the cloth shop, and Tyrone to break free from the ghetto he is living in. They try to substitute their problems by taking heroin and methamphetamines; however, drugs only bring them to the bitter end when their dreams are shattered completely.Black SwanThis film is the story of Nina Sayers, a dancer with good prospects, and is focused on her inner experience. In the ballet company where she works, there are two roles: White Swan and Black Swan, and both of them symbolize two aspects of female sexuality. While White Swan is focused on purity and innocence, Black Swan refers to dark sensuality and the power of seduction. Nina wants to take both roles, but she fails to perform the Black Swan, focused on seduction and dark sensuality. (Skorin-Kapov 95). Her mother, Erica, is overprotective and greatly influences all aspects of Nina’s life; thus, she is oversensitive and insecure, usually unable to organize her life as she wants. Then, she meets Lily, another ballerina who comes to dance in the ballet company, and two women quickly become rivals. As the film continues, Nina starts to experience hallucinations, seeing images of Lily
For example, in the already mentioned film mother! the film is ended by the fantastic transformation of the main heroine’s heart into the new house where she lives peacefully with her husband. They are also used to show the “divine interference” into human lives or depict the deep areas of the character’s psyche. An example of the latter is present in Black Swan , when Nina confronts her main rival, Lily. The film shows that Lily transforms into Nina, and thus, she is confronting herself.ConclusionIn that way, Aronofsky’s films, while being different in plots, are dedicated to the same subject: the human soul and its elements. He uses allusions and interpretations of biblical myths to show human nature’s strong and weak sides, such as in mother! and Noah . He also shows people in drug addictions and psychical disorders, analyzing reasons which brought them to such conditions, such as in Black Swan and Requiem for a Dream . As one can see, Darren Aronofsky uses various cinematographic technics and plot twists to show the viewer how good and how bad may be a human.
Modification of personal computers required the development of more complex hardware and software. For example, buses, which are the communication channels between different internal components and peripheral devices, have become more advanced. Such three types of buses as address, control, and data are known (Farret et al., 2017). The latter is utilized for data exchange between the Central Processing Unit (CPU) and peripherals (Farret et al., 2017). The significance of the address bus is to assist the CPU in locating specific information in the memory, while the control bus regulates data processing. Data buses are represented as a multiple of two and currently include five types: 4, 8, 16, 32, and 64 (Farret et al., 2017). These numbers indicate the bits of data that can be delivered simultaneously, and the larger ones allow for a more significant amount of information to be processed at a time.The number of parallel lines in a processor defines how many electrical signals can be exchanged between peripherals and the CPU. The most common operating systems on modern computers are 32 and 64-bit microprocessors. A 32-bit data bus contains thirty-two parallel lines between different structures. In contrast, a 64-bit data bus consists of sixty-four lines, allowing it to run twice as many data exchange processes (Farret et al., 2017). Hence, the fundamental difference between these two types of data buses is the speed at which they can process information. Similarly, the pace at which older versions run data depends on the number of paralleled copper wires between the CPU and other internal parts. Indeed, all these buses have one common function of interchanging data, but they vary in the rate at which operations are transferred due to their structural differences.
Data collection used to determine how to improve the conditions within a specific setting is very important. In the community health care setting, the use of real-life experience with patients and supervision of a preceptor, as the case manager, will apply. The data from treating the members of this community is to apply to assess the needs of the health sector. This will include; assessing the current information using the patient data in the emergency room and applying the data to improve the health sectors. One chief function of caregivers is to help prevent disease, and intervention methods should be focused on prevention and not treatment. This paper describes how a practicum agency can use assessment data to improve health conditions.The need assessment data includes data on the record of diseases report, preparedness of the health facility, and measures of prevention by the community. This data should help identify the most common illness, improve the readiness within the health facility, and increase disease prevention in the community. However, patients’ needs vary from each other. A good example is a patient who comes to the emergency room with asthma and expects their condition to be maintained and provided with drugs that will help stabilize (Stefaniak et al., 2018). This differs from a patient with malaria who will be treated and taught prevention measures after that. Individual patient assessment desires differ from the community’s wants. The data on health needs include patient illness with specific diseases and the patients’ progress.To prioritize the health needs of patients, it may
be essential to have information on patients’ behavior, environment, and genetic predisposition. A good example is the asthma patient; the environmental conditions of the patient should be taken into consideration to avoid subsequent attacks (Iriarte‐Roteta et al., 2020). Another example is a diabetic patient would benefit from data on lifestyle as their condition can easily be managed through their lifestyle.The data from the practicum can establish a support program, increase screening facilities, and offer health education to the patients. The support program helps patients suffering from addiction, makes them feel accepted by the community, and helps them overcome their habits. Screening facilities allow for early detection and management of disease at a primary or early secondary stage (Gillies & Schabath, 2020). Moreover, health education benefits the entire community in the prevention is better than cure campaign. Health workers should prioritize the prevention of disease rather than treatment.The practicum agency used the available data to improve the outcome of their programs. First, they collaborated with some health providers to form an online platform where patients could interact with health providers and ask them questions about their health status (Yang et al., 2019). This helped in the prevention of disease and reducing the crowding in consultation. Moreover, it also reduced the consultation fee for those who could not meet the expenses since the consultation on this platform was free. Second, the agency focused on promoting health equity by championing for provision of health services for the less fortunate. This was done by agitating for the construction of more
this through an incident where my preceptor treated an insured patient against the hospital policy, claiming that the administration would deal with the rest of the processes. His work was to ensure his patient was treated and not determine whether the patient was insured. Patients trust healthcare providers to take good care of them and lead them to good health.In conclusion, working with the practicum agency and my preceptor provided me with an experience that would be useful for me in my clinical practice and for the achievement of the needs of society. I learned how to assess community needs from individual to community-based assessment. Moreover, I understood how assessment needs data can achieve health care goals and better the healthcare provider of a population. I look forward to more of such opportunities as they not only shape your academic life but change your all perspective of life.
I visited the Museum on Saturday 12 February this year from 9 am to 5 pm. The Holocaust Museum Houston serves as a monument and strives to teach people about the consequences of cruelty and prejudice, as its motto and tagline “Stop Hate.” “Let’s begin here”(Holocaust Museum Houston, 2022). The museum emphasizes the perils of intolerance, bigotry, and apathy by drawing on the lessons of the Holocaust and other massive genocides. There is fear that if these sins are ever allowed to get out of hand, another mass massacre on a scale much bigger than the Holocaust could occur. “Bearing Witness: A Community Remembers,” a permanent display at the museum, conveys the Holocaust story directly from the source. The exhibition revolves around the lives and encounters of Holocaust survivors who eventually settled in the Houston Area. This museum allows tourists to study the life of the Jews in a chronology like fashion, starting with Pre-War Europe and concluding at the end of World Conflict. Upon entering the show, the management offered an image of Jewish art and society in pre-war Europe.The museum is very young, and it features several intriguing and unusual displays. The museum’s interactive aspect was one of my favorites since it offered depictions of natural occurrences. The museum included several additional sections where one could learn unique parts of African American culture, and a traditional African American dance was among the new things known. I spent much time in the Sports exhibit, which featured mementos from players like Gabby Douglas, Serena Williams, and
others and the music exhibit demonstrated the uniqueness of this museum.The Holocaust Museum was the most significant stop, and I learned a lot. It gave everyone present a genuine representation of what transpired during the era of the Holocaust. Apart from being the most sensitive of the visitors to this museum, I gained more information and expertise. Through the drawings, I learned about how the two Holocaust survivors, among other things. It was incredible to hear from those who had been there and witnessed it firsthand. The Holocaust was a period of prejudice against people of many races and beliefs and a terrible time for tens of thousands of people.It felt like back to the 1944 era during World War II while walking around the room looking at all the numerous relics and documents related to the Holocaust. During the way to the rail car, the sorrow of the casualties of this horrible period hit me hard. There was a confined and uneasy atmosphere in the car, with only eight individuals onboard. An instruction stand indicated that the management would put 50 people in there for travels that would last days at a time.The Holocaust Museum was informative, but I hoped to see more stuff. The highlight for me is a full-size train car, which gives you an impression of the dread victims experienced on their journey to a much worse destination. I spent most of the time in the museum reading literature on the walls; that is why I was disappointed. I would expect museums
Data science is the discipline that studies the life cycle of digital data from appearance to use in other fields of knowledge. It involves researching and analyzing substantial amounts of information and is focused primarily on obtaining practical results. The definition suggested by Os Keyes presumes that this science is the reduction of humanity to something that can be counted. This perspective is engaging in a way that Keyes’s perspective opposes the standard definition of data science. Perhaps, her expression implies that everything in this world could be measured since the discipline is concerned with countable objects and quantitative analysis. There is also an assumption that data science systems want to devour everything possible, including a human’s life, and quantify it. Finally, when it comes to the decision-making process, the systems eliminate the human factor, excluding individuals, thus making it inhumane.Numerous standardized tests are based on an algorithm that does not allow people to express their opinions. Typically, they are multiple-choice credits where one should choose the right answer. One mistake and one is at a point of no return. It means that systems only accept correct data, not allowing a human to err. As a result, humanity is accustomed to giving the right answers when necessary and at the same time being afraid to say something that will not be automatically approved.On the other hand, data science is vital in areas where mistakes should be avoided. For example, in healthcare, workers use different electronic systems that assist them in choosing the proper treatment and its dosage. Medication errors occur due to human factors mainly, for instance, when professionals forget to check the expiration date of a drug. Meanwhile, the system will suggest which pharmaceutical is better for the patient and ensure it is not expired.
sexual domination, assault or rape – therefore, the culture forms around this, being far removed from the egalitarianism and harmony of the Dayak.As shocking as that perspective may be, I agree that it reflects accurately the social element that has been created conservatively around rape for centuries. As mentioned earlier, rape is often attributed to natural biology, while in reality it reflects more the concepts of society. I think this perspective touches on both, it emphasizes the natural characteristics of the genders (strength for men, femininity for women) while highlighting its social features (men are praised, women are viewed as used and broken). It can be argued that it is built within our society, as there are certain connotations and stereotypes associated with sexual violence. For example, in a UK study, the label victim was associated with passive femininity. The feminization hypothesis holds true when it comes to rape, as victims, that are most commonly women (but can be men) are attributed feminine characteristics and greater judgment (men would not be seen as men anymore). Meanwhile the accused of committing the rape is given trait dimension of prescriptive masculinity.
With thrombosis of the lower extremities’ veins, blood clots or blood clots form cavities, which interfere with the normal movement of blood. Over time, they can clog the venous lumen and even come off, ending in the heart, lungs, and other organs (Dalen, 2016). Unfortunately, it is often impossible to timely determine the initial symptoms of thrombosis of the leg vessels. However, if the skin changes color and swelling occurs where the blood clot is located, these are signs of vascular disease.When thrombosis progresses, its symptoms appear: acute pain and heaviness in the patient’s legs. These symptoms are provoked by the venous congestion below the site of thrombosis. The main causes of the disease’s development are blood clotting and damage to the vein wall (Thachil & Bagot, 2018). In addition, long journeys and old age exacerbate the risk of serious problems. It is also possible that the patient is taking medications that increase blood clotting, so it is necessary to ask him about this to be sure of the diagnosis.Ways to make an accurate diagnosis include duplex scanning, radiopaque phlebography, MRI, or CT. The combination of these methods will most accurately determine the severity and nature of the disease. After that, a doctor can prescribe a suitable treatment. Of the drugs, it can be injections of heparin and capsules of anticoagulants. If these methods do not help, then thrombolysis is necessary, which promotes resorption of blood clots. With the most severe outcome, surgery will be required. Undoubtedly, this is the last thing to do since it is always important to use all the other methods before making it. It may also be dangerous in the age of the considered patient. Thus, it is vital to use other methods and try to avoid any harmful consequences. Not only this will help cure thrombosis, but also save patient’s life.
A Western scholarship has distorted the long history of African culture for centuries, and many of its basic principles have been viewed through the lens of colonization. As a result, the ideas and tenets of African philosophy have been appropriated and changed in value from the inherent parts of people’s nature into commodities. In their works, p’Bitek and Marimba discuss such concepts as culture, spirituality, and philosophy of African nations and how Western ideology has reshaped their presentation without fully understanding their meaning. The commodification of African culture and the imposition of European views on the distinction between culture and philosophy, religion and spirituality have disrupted African people’s ability to self-identify.The ideas by scholars show that African culture does not distinguish itself from philosophy or drive a line between reality and the spiritual nature of one’s being. European culture is presented as pragmatical and commodifying – it turns pieces of life that are meant to be used into objects for observation. p’Bitek writes that culture turns from “the way of life of a people” into “something that is bought and sold” (“What is Culture?” 14). As a result, younger generations of Africans, especially those living in Western countries, see their culture as a collection of souvenirs, not parts of everyday life. At the same time, they are subjected to the Western religions praising poverty and individualism (p’Bitek, “Man Born Unfree” 21). Ani notes that African-Americans suffer as they do not feel connected enough to traditional African society but feel a divide between themselves and European identity (49). Such disconnect leads to people losing their communal and generational identification.The readings discussed above show that African and European ideologies clash in many ways, and the latter assumes control over the presentation of the former. As a result, generations of people are removed from their culture, losing it or seeing through the distorted lens of commodification. African culture is inherently linked to philosophy, spirituality, living in the moment, and seeing the richness of life. However, it is turned into a tourist attraction, and its people are forced to perceive it through the eyes of foreigners, losing their inherent link to history and nature.
regardless of their race, which provoked a backlash from the white residents. As a result, cities preferred to close or privatize the public facilities instead of allowing people of different races to use them freely. This is an example of the destruction of public goods and a massive cost increase for the whole population due to the “zero-sum” mindset.Another negative example demonstrated by McGhee is political in nature – many white people stopped pushing for social governmental policies regarding jobs and social benefits after the Black community joined the agenda. In the end, this means less social justice and social benefits for the whole country because the adherents of the “zero-sum” paradigm do not want other races to benefit from these policies. The arguments provided by McGhee seem reasonable and fair to me – they describe the past and current state of affairs in the United States well. The main reason I think so is the factual and statistical support of her position – it is very hard to argue that the US has significant social and economic problems due to racism.
Chronic pain is still considered to be an extreme issue among at least 8% of the residents of progressive countries. The introduction of the study describes the apparent link between pain and demoralization. Chronic pain is always accompanied by negative emotional experiences and blocks a person’s ability to receive joy and satisfaction from life. The research investigates the development of depression and anxiety among patients receiving pharmaceutical opioids and medical marijuana (MM) as severe painkillers. It compares the efficacy of prescriptions and examines the possibility of post-treatment depression.There is currently a severe lack of information about the effects of opiates. They manage pain successfully, but the past few decades indicated the growing concern regarding opiate abuse in forms of overdose and addiction. A more manageable and safer alternative might be medical marijuana. However, the legal status and novelty of this drug do not allow finding a large number of studies on its effectiveness. Specifically, it concerns the emotional condition of patients experiencing chronic pain. This research paper aims to analyze levels of depression and anxiety among people receiving therapy by comparing the effects of pharmaceutical opioids and MM.The study was conducted in the form of collection and analysis of statistical data. Participants were recruited for six months at two major pain relief centers in Israel. The researchers used The Depression Module of the Patient Health Questionnaire and the Generalized Anxiety Disorder Scale to interview participants, evaluate their answers, and conduct the study. To specifically evaluate and compare the probabilities of depression or anxiety among the diverse
groups, the study used multiple logistic regression analysis and chose medical marijuana as the control group.This type of study is the most revealing and inclusive, as it contains direct responses from a large number of participants. All tools in the form of questionnaires and scales have already been used and proved their efficacy for collecting analytical data. It helps to systematize and classify distinct kinds of information for subsequent uncomplicated services. Thus, researchers can compare the effects of medications on patients of diverse age groups, backgrounds, physical conditions, emotional states, and so on.The analysis of any human reaction has a high potential of subjectiveness and bias, especially regarding people in severe pain and unstable emotional condition. Perhaps some patients tend to exaggerate their depressive state or vice versa, de-emphasize serious difficulties. Because the survey responses were thoroughly anonymous, the researchers were unable to carefully analyze each patient’s reaction and compare it to the actual states of condition. More accurate answers could be obtained by professional psychologists via personal communication and behavioral analysis. However, this method of research is way more resource-intensive and energy-consuming.Participants were recruited for six months at two major pain relief centers in Israel. All patients experienced chronic pain for at least 3 months. The study included 890 participants, of which 474 (59%) were treated solely with opioids, 329 (41%) were treated with MM, and 77 (8.6%) acquired both (Feingold et al., 2017). The remaining ten participants who did not receive pharmaceutical opioids and medical marijuana were withdrawn from the analysis in the research.
the opiates, medical marijuana, and mixed OPMM groups numbered 57.1%, 22.3%, and 51.4%, respectively. The plurality of anxiety contained 48.4% among OP patients, 21.5% among MM patients, and 38.7% among OPMM participants. Patients who took strong opiates were tended to place their pain on a scale of 9 to 10 (Feingold et al., 2017). They were also anguished emotionally and reacted radically negatively to almost all survey questions. Patients who took only MM or mixed medications course had a significantly more stable emotional state and coped with pain more manageable.One of the major limitations is the insufficiently high response rate, 57% instead of 70% (Feingold et al., 2017). It can be fairly explained by the weak focus of respondents who have overcome severe pain sensations and depressive episodes. It is not clear how to use these statistics, as they still may be relevant for the overall analysis.
IntroductionDescartes’ philosophy is called dualistic, which implies the equality of the material and the ideal but allows the existence of these two phenomena separately from each other. In one of his main theses devoted to the study of the interaction between the mind and body, the philosopher, while comparing bodily and spiritual substances, speaks of their opposition (Thibaut, 2018). Descartes deals with the question of what is true in the content of the mind, in other words, in representations: ideas, affects, and judgments. He speaks of the complete difference between the mind and body, which implies that the body is divisible and the mind is not because the activity of the latter cannot be explained by mechanical principles (Dika, 2020). In his explanations, Descartes offers an adequate solution to the mind-body problem. The argument that the connection of the body and mind is an empirical fact given to a person in everyday experience is logical, and their difference is directly determined in the act of philosophical reflection.The Problem and SolutionTo solve the mind-body problem, Descartes sorts out the content of consciousness in order for clarity and distinctness. In the mind of a thinking subject, in addition to the idea of ​​oneself, there are ideas about inanimate bodies, other living beings, people, and God. According to Dika (2020), the conception of oneself is clear and distinct and, therefore, true. Ideas about other living beings can be formed from available experience. Descartes guarantees the truth of the original principle as clear and distinct knowledge by the existence of
God, who has put the natural light of reason into humans (Dika, 2020). Self-consciousness in Descartes is not closed on itself but is open to God, acting as a source of the objective significance of human thinking.This proof, which can be called epistemological, is decisive for the entire system of the philosopher. As Urban (2018) argues, according to Descartes, the mind is a thinking thing, unextended, indivisible, capable of knowing the truth and striving for it, and also endowed with absolute free will. The body, conversely, is an extended and non-thinking thing; moreover, it acts automatically (Urban, 2018). Thus, Descartes believes that the human is indeed separate from the body and can exist independently of it. Theoretically, there can be no connection between these two substances, but in actual experience, a person is their inseparable unity.Cogito is Descartes’ first reliable judgment and, at the same time, the first object directly given to the mind – a thinking substance. It is open to people directly, while the existence of the other substance, material, is given indirectly (Urban, 2018). Descartes views a substance as a thing that needs nothing but itself to exist. Analyzing this position provides the idea that only God can be called a substance. Among created things, the philosopher conventionally calls substances only those that need divine assistance for their existence. The thinking substance as an attribute is unextended and, therefore, indivisible. The substance of the body has an extension in length, width, and depth; thus, it is divisible into parts, has a figure, movement,
and a certain arrangement of parts. Only these qualities are really inherent in bodily substance, and all the rest, including color, taste, smell, warmth, and others, Descartes calls secondary. Such features owe their existence to the impact of primary qualities on the body.Ideas inherent in the thinking substance from the very beginning and not acquired through experience are innate. These include the idea of ​​God as an all-perfect being, the ideas of numbers and figures, as well as some general concepts, or axioms (Macbeth, 2017). These eternal truths are the embodiment of the natural light of the mind. Thus, Descartes draws a clear distinction between the concepts of mind and body and argues for clear differences between their functions, which is one of the main premises of his theory of transcendental idealism. The concept of substantial or Cartesian dualism proposed by him formed the basis of the philosopher’s works, who proved his ideas empirically.Criticism Against Cartesian Substance Dualism and Descartes’ ResponsesDespite his rationale for dualism in the theory of body and mind, Descartes faced objections from some other philosophers who refuted his concept. For instance, as cited in Dong (2020), Thomas Hobbes argued that the nature of the identity between thought and thinking did not allow applying a similar interpretation algorithm to other phenomena or states. According to him, Descartes identifies the subject and its abilities, and only a material subject is capable of thinking since thinking itself cannot think because this is an endless contradiction (Dong, 2020). To this, Descartes replies that he understands thinking
insulin at its average concentration in the blood. Insulin resistance produces the inability of insulin-dependent tissues to absorb blood plasma glucose and disrupts glycogen synthesis in the hepatic.Persons with diabetes should eat according to a structured regimen and receive their medications with meals. For type 1 diabetes, a recommended diet includes carbohydrates from fruits, vegetables, whole grains, legumes, and skim milk. Patients with type 2 diabetes, complex carbohydrates such as brown rice, whole wheat, fruits, vegetables, and beans should be included in the rations (Sinclair et al., 2019). At the same time, for both types of disease should be avoided, consumption of simple carbohydrates such as sugar, pasta, white bread, flour, cookies, pastries. During the first type of diabetes, insulin Degludec (Tresiba) is required together with the diet. It is suitable to confound hypoglycemia in patients over 18 years of age. In addition, Zynquista is an oral medication intended to be combined with insulin (Sinclair et al., 2019). Besides, individuals with type 2 diabetes may require insulin if their diet plan, weight loss, exercise, and anti-diabetic medications are not achieving their target blood glucose levels. In that case, Insulin Degludec may also be appropriate; the oral drug is Metformin.
Americans with heart failure diseases. However, the focus on patients’ cultural backgrounds should not lead to ignoring a broader context. This statement refers to the findings by Cajiita et al. (2017), who stipulate that the use of mobile technology in healthcare (mHealth) can promote better knowledge. These scholars focused on 129 older adults, and almost 25% were African Americans, to analyze whether mHealth leads to improved care (Cajiita et al., 2017). The use of mobile technologies can be as effective as face-to-face interventions because modern people spend more time online. That is why it is reasonable to rely on mHealth opportunities to improve access to care among African Americans. Finally, it is possible to suggest that combining mobile technologies and face-to-face educational sessions can result in the best outcomes.
Brand name: Glumetza. Initially, it is administered at 500mg daily with meals and later adjusted to 1000mg, 500mg XR, or 1000mg XR. It acts by suppressing gluconeogenesis in the liver and reducing glucose absorption in the small intestines, reducing insulin resistance. Common side effects: bloating, lactic acidosis, nausea, gastrointestinal upset, loss of weight, and deficiency of vitamin B12. Furthermore, the initiation of metformin is associated with the development of hemolytic anemia (Miller & Fortun, 2018). It should be cautiously administered in pregnant and alcoholic patients. In conditions such as renal insufficiency, there is reduced medication clearance, thus leading to toxicity.To reduce side effects related to the gastrointestinal system during the first treatment, metformin should be taken with meals. Once treatment has been initiated with metformin, it should not be discontinued unless the patient develops contraindication (Miller & Fortun, 2018). For individuals with renal failure, myocardial infarction, diabetic ketoacidosis, and heart failure, metformin should not be initiated or stopped if the patient develops these conditions while undergoing treatment.Metformin should not be administered to patients with glomerular filtration rates (GFR) of thirty or below. Patients with a glomerular filtration rate of forty-five or more can safely use metformin (Miller & Fortun, 2018). Therefore, patients with GFR lower than forty-five on this medication should be closely monitored. Additionally, the patients’ prescriber should assess the risk and the merits of the continued drug therapy for patients with GFR lower than forty-five. It is essential to monitor the kidney function of the patients. It is considered first-line therapy in addition to
of one to four and act up to twenty-four hours. They have a reduced risk of nocturnal hypoglycemia as compared to NPH. Basal insulin acts by suppressing the production of glucose in the liver. Basal prandial: includes Regular U 500. Its onset is at half an hour, reaching its peak after two to three hours. It should be administered half an hour before meals (Gupta, 2022). These agents provide a long duration of action. Basal prandial is highly recommended for individuals who have high insulin resistance.  * Prandial: includes regular human insulin, which acts up to 8 hours and starts its action after one hour. It should be given thirty minutes before meals because otherwise, there is an increased risk of hypoglycemia. Another agent is aspart, glulisine, and lispro. Prandial insulins act rapidly. They have a reduced risk of postprandial hypoglycemia as compared to regular insulin. Human insulin can either be short-acting, intermediate-acting, or pre-mixed. Short-acting insulin includes human R and Novolin R (Gupta, 2022). They have an onset of thirty to one hour and reach their peak at two to four hours. The intermediate-acting acts for 12-16 hours and begins from one to three hours. Examples are Humulin N and Novolin N. The pre-mixed insulin has a varying peak but begins acting from 30 minutes to one hour.
in the feasibility report. Using the standard risk evaluation process, it is possible to differentiate the risks into two large groups. These are risks to the continuation and completion of the project and risks to the end product’s performance after the project has been completed.The risks to the continuation and completion of the project are as follows:  * Unforeseen delays and time expenditures. It is possible that the project’s implementation will be more complex than anticipated, requiring more time;  * Individuals participating in the project might become sick and slow down production;  * The available hardware and software may malfunction.The risks for the performance of the end product are as follows:  * The product might not be secure enough to be allowed to work with personal student data;  * The product would be economically unfeasible to run;  * The product would not perform adequately to the university’s requirements.Time-related problems could be identified by comparing the progress made with the timeline developed before starting the project. Functionality and requirements risks can be discovered by matching the product against its requirements for it, as well as through testing during specific project milestones. Potential time constraints and personnel/hardware breakages can be accounted for by allocating more time to the project than initially estimated to allow for replacements to be made. Countering the risks associated with site performance would be more difficult and largely have a reactionary nature, should some of them not be discovered and remedied during the product testing phase.
have a considerable cancer prevention capacity (“American Cancer Society”).Moreover, the society advises people to eat foods high in fiber, such as legumes and whole grains, while avoiding red meats and added sugar. Finally, American Diabetes Association recommends eating more non-starchy vegetables, including broccoli, carrots, cauliflower which need to constitute one-half of each meal (“Eat Good”). The association also highlights the significance of consuming foods high in protein, such as beans, hummus, and lentils, as well as fruits and monounsaturated and polyunsaturated fats.The recommendations to prevent the three previously mentioned conditions are, to a large extent, similar. Essentially, all organizations state that it is important to avoid consuming added sugar and saturated and trans fat. Additionally, people wanting to prevent heart disease, cancer, and diabetes also need to eat more fruits, vegetables, and chicken meat. At the same time, red meat is strictly prohibited for cancer patients while generally available for people with diabetes and heart disease. Individuals with diabetes should consume more non-starchy vegetables than people with the other two conditions. Finally, to prevent heart disease, people must particularly be careful about consuming any type of fats.
One is watching the news or reading the latest article from Forbes, and you see the terms “business” and “economics” used interchangeably; one may wonder about the differences. Business and economics are similar in that they are supplements to each other, both dealing with the process of creating products and services and selling them to generate output. These are fields of study that are closely related and include a range of shared subtopics, such as enterprises, marketing, finance, manufacturing, and banking. Both are social sciences that focus on financial measurement and analysis, focusing on variables that impact the market and also focus on short- and long-term projections, as well as the inner workings of various industries. Finally, both business and economics tend to focus on various problems facing the nation, its citizens, government, and private enterprises (Vaidya). However, there are some differences between economics and business, which are based on their conceptual purpose.Economics is a study focusing on understanding human behavior and, in turn, how that reflects on the broader economic elements of whole nations. Meanwhile, business is aimed at studying the process of the exchange of goods and money specifically, and all the related elements starting from production to the final sale, and how a specific enterprise fulfills this process. It can be argued that business is a subset of economics, as the human behavior in that exchange of goods is a point of focus (Casson). A major difference is in concepts, economics deals with theories and broad elements of the economy, such as supply and demand, interest rate, and international trade. While these undoubtedly impact business, both individual entities and as a field of study, business focuses on the process of wealth creation within the context of the economy and typically applies practical theories.Economics focuses on and attempts to maximize the welfare of society, while business is centered on its shareholders. Both face different issues, with economics encompassing poverty, unemployment, taxation, and federal expenditure, while business focuses on product positioning and differentiation, marketing, growth or lack thereof of profitability, and individual or industry performance (Gitman et al.). While business and economics share many commonalities, their conceptual and practical differences make them distinct sciences.
The difference between a doctor approaching a patient in comparison with nursing practice on the same subject can be an excellent topic due to the highlighted features that are emphasized when parallel. Thus, medical practice using one’s physiological status while nursing also implementing psychological responses is an effective way in making the difference between the two clear while operating based on PICOT. The points to be included are the difference in the research approach. Since medical practice is more objective due to the fact that it relies on specific outcomes and facts, the research is quantitative. On the other hand, the PICOT question included in the nursing practice implies mixed research that considers both opinions and data.Topic presents the differentiation between nursing and medical practice in terms of approach to diagnosis. The vital factor that is being brought up is the PICOT in relation to lab results versus assessment based on symptoms. The research can highlight the outcomes in terms of the accuracy of the findings while focusing on the comparison between the two concepts. The aspect that illustrates its importance is the overall parallel between the two models that may have similar results depending on how the research will be conducted and its findings.The potential research focusing on the nursing practice of preventing certain injuries and providing more patient-centered and personalized care can emphasize the importance of decision-making in the field. Decision-making is an essential concept in the nursing care field (Nibbelink & Brewer, 2018). Hence, a PICOT question on the topic of providing specialized care in terms of preventing falls versus solely treating them can be an effective way of discussing nursing from a personalized perspective.
A digital engagement policy determines how the organization intends to position itself online. The regulation also covers the company’s brand qualities and its vision and mission objectives. It also directs how employees can communicate digitally, both internally and externally, with suppliers and clients (Brown, 2019). In addition, the above guidelines also target social media interaction practices that may affect the business, either negatively or positively.Our organization has a digital engagement policy that it utilizes to protect the reputation of its brand. Moreover, the above strategy has enabled the business to increase employees’ commitment while boosting the levels of their obligation. Hence, workers share more about the organization online, thus, contributing to more sales and profit. Additionally, with the above rules in place, the firm’s private information is secure since it is not shared online.My professional presence online is aligned with the organization because it entails displaying the company’s products and services and connecting with all stakeholders. My existence online builds a good relationship with clients, friends, and followers, which is advantageous to the business since the company image has improved. This has helped the organization become relevant because it has offered its clients a ‘human face.’I use media platforms to promote my brand by focusing on different social networks. I also create informative and engaging content about the company’s products and ensure all the information is up-to-date and accurate before uploading. It is critical to do regular online marketing while avoiding over-posting not to look desperate. All the updates of accomplishments and newsworthy developments are done 3 to 4 times a week.The topics that I frequently post on social media to market my brand are about the pricing of the products. I also emphasize the benefits of using our merchandise and services while comparing with others in the market. I always comment more on the developments and accomplishments achieved but avoid posting any negative comments made by an individual or a dissatisfied customer because this could cause a destructive online discussion, which may diminish the brand.After completing the course, I plan to change how to respond to any negativity, and I will not ignore any undesirable feedback because it enlightens me about the buyer’s experience. In addition, I will also start to market strategically, for instance, to develop a procedure of targeting my audience depending on the social media network, have schedules for my content, and change the communication methods.
The approach and thought process underlying the thesis is explained in this chapter. This section aims to provide enough information for other researchers conducting studies relating to the digitalization of the management accounting sector. As a result, the scholar begins by describing the research design, which includes a description of the study’s actual procedures. This paper then explores the researcher’s methodology, findings, recommendations and offers limitations and future research.Research DesignThe research design is a broad strategy for addressing the study issues. A well-organized research design ensures that the research methods match the research goals, quality data collection, and appropriate analysis to answer the research questions using reliable sources. Good designs allow researchers to draw valid, trustworthy conclusions. The design connects the conceptual research challenge to relevant and doable empirical research. The researcher will adopt the experimental research design, which entails posing open-ended questions to get a new understanding of the subject under investigation. The design was chosen based on what was best suited to answer the following research questions: 1. ” How will digitalization change the management accounting profession? “ 2. “What skills will a management accountant need in the future to address future challenges of digitalization? “An experimental design is an excellent strategy for acquiring a new perspective or elucidating your thoughts on a theme. It will further broaden the understanding of the subject, allowing the investigator to understand better why and how things occur. The researcher applies exploratory research to clarify concepts, create priorities, and generate operational definitions. According to the scholar, this field
of research is relatively new after searching for literature on the subject. As a result, few scientists have looked at these topics. There is research on the impact of digitization on accounting businesses. However, there is a scarcity of information about accountants’ perceptions about how digitalization would affect their profession. The researcher looked forward to comprehending how digitalization has impacted the managing accounting sector. The ability to convey and obtain new information about the subject benefits from employing this type of study. It allows the writer to take an open approach to data gathering and analysis.Data CollectionResearchers can use both primary and secondary sources to acquire data. The scholar used primary data in the thesis to obtain material pertinent to the study challenge. Personal interviews played crucial roles in information collection by the researcher. An interview is an excellent way to get information and ensure the writer acquires more information about the participant’s self-awareness, motivation, and personal views on digitalization. The researcher collected secondary facts from the accounting businesses’ websites to learn how digitalization has affected management accounting.Assortment of businesses and participantsInterviews with five accounting firms provided the basis for the research. The respondents are equally diverse in terms of experience, age, and gender. They have worked anywhere from 9 months to 25 years of experience. All firms were free to select who would be questioned. Interviewing the manager provided an opportunity to examine the company’s entire picture. By interviewing a management accountant, the scholar obtained firsthand information and vision of how digitization has impacted their
profession and their skills to attain organizational goals. Random sampling strategy played a significant role in giving each participant equal chances of selection.Interview methodAs previously noted, the researcher primarily collected data through interviews, which would be an excellent method to gather information about digitalization impacts. An interview is a method of gathering more extensive and comprehensive information about a person’s experience, viewpoint, and views about a subject. Interviews provided accurate and consistent data relevant to the research questions. Interviews comprise semi-structured, organized, and unstructured (in-depth) interviews. The investigator applied semi-structured interviews to focus the conversation in one direction while allowing the subject to express themselves freely and clarify any ambiguities.Interview preparations and guideAn interview guide provided a systematic framework for the interviews. An interview guide lists topics and questions that the researcher wants the interviewee to respond to. The researcher was not required to follow the rules of the letter when conducting a semi-structured interview; hence the researcher used the guide to help in remembering essential subjects and questions. The interview started with a brief overview of the issue and ourselves, followed by a series of straightforward questions. These methods would help the interviewee get off to a good start, such as, “What is your employment position?” and “How long have you been in the accounting industry?” were some of the first questions we asked regarding their background and education. “What problems and opportunities do you connect with the digitization of the accounting industry?” and “What attributes are needed to take advantage of digitalization?” were two
of the questions posed. These were open-ended questions so that the reply might offer extra information about the subject.Interview CompletionQualitative interviews can be conducted in person, over the phone, via chat, or by email. The researcher considered in-person interviews since they fostered a sense of trust and transparency. This strategy allowed for a smooth dialogue with few interruptions. We were also able to keep an eye on the issue and control it. The researcher utilized a voice recorder during the interview, which all participants agreed to, both writing and oral records. Voice recorders helped the researcher be present throughout the interview to enhance effective communication.Data AnalysisThe researcher used thematic analysis, which entails compiling, dissecting, recombining, analyzing, and closing. The investigator utilized codes to indicate the themes from the data gathering during a thematic analysis. The scholar further used theme analysis for the thesis since it facilitated a rigorous methodology of depth interview data while also providing a more open route for study. This strategy aided the research, which allowed the writer to identify central themes, study critical themes, and notice new difficulties that arose during data collecting and evaluation that the researcher previously overlooked.Findings: Digitalization of Management Accounting RoleManagement accounting digitalization changes the profession significantly in various ways. For instance, IT solutions, particularly automation, increase resource availability due to a significant reduction in the required capacity for repetitive tasks, enabling management accountants to assist with strategic decisions. New business models, a shift in the focus of management accountants, and real-time performance data and reactions are all
aspects in support of innovative value-adding operations. Overall, organizations can gain a competitive advantage by effectively managing the data and information made available through digitalization (Puhovichova et al. 140). Due to numerous laws, it is challenging to use all of these benefits. Any significant change to be executed in a firm requires a well-thought-out strategy and overall plan. The development of a performance management approach requires open communication and constructive feedback. Change drivers will struggle to implement changes without strong employee participation. A trial-and-error culture must be established in addition to changing the culture. In an environment where less stability is unavoidable and more uncertainty must be managed, disruptive developments add stress.Digitalization plays a significant function in allowing workers to try new things, which is critical in dealing with environmental changes but challenging because it contradicts another strategic goal that prioritizes safety through defect avoidance. As a result, digitalization in the management accounting industry is critical for keeping personnel up to date on new technologies, such as artificial intelligence and ERP deployments, to eliminate complications and guarantee that work is completed quickly. Before automating anything, it’s essential to figure out which actions and responsibilities are appropriate and then rate them. Another problem brought up is the expensive expense of building sound IT systems. However, good data management is required to get the most out of any technology. One of the most critical problems is that management accountants’ abilities must be updated to utilize digitization fully.Artificial intelligenceLearning ability, often known as machine learning in AI, is a
common requirement. In actuality, the term “artificial intelligence” was coined in 1956, but it has only recently acquired attention due to a few other factors. Big Data is one of them since when AI confronts new scenarios that necessitate decisions, it consults large amounts of high-quality data. The second wave of digitization is Artificial Intelligence. As a result, it emphasizes how new the technology is in management accounting applications. Several academics stress the importance of AI, predicting that it will undoubtedly become a critical component of business in the future. In the future, AI might make precise decision-making recommendations to the management accountant, or systems could make sovereign judgments and design steering measures based on management practices.A well-known Artificial Intelligence software example is IBM Watson Analytics. This tool could be cooperative in MA, particularly for reporting and risk management processes, where data collection, correlations, visualization, and forecasting are obliging. Artificial neural connections are a powerful technology that replicates human-machine learning in today’s AI. These networks learn from processed data by looking for patterns, adjusting connection strength, and taking into account terrible outcomes to find solutions to previously unforeseen situations. As a result, the foundation for machine learning is artificial neural networks. As a result, as the amount of data being studied rises, it helps apps enhance the quality of their analysis and discoveries since the algorithm can constantly comprehend the magnitude of elements and how they are related. BA models, for example, can be updated and enhanced regularly to achieve the highest level of analytical quality;
DataRobot, BigML, and PredictionIO all provide IT solutions. The storage and processing of data and applications on the cloud are called “cloud computing.”Artificial Intelligence tools help management accounting institutions raise the visibility of organizational plans, a dream of total control in which distance is eliminated, and databases and analytical algorithms know people better than they know themselves. It also increases the number of misleading connections and the necessity to choose from vast amounts of data and alternatives. Furthermore, AI assists management accounting managers in addressing various complicated issues that their companies encounter. Management accounting is one of the most valuable tools accessible to a manager, who may use it to assess opportunities, situate action directions, and develop the corporate strategy. Thus, management accountants add significant value to firms by identifying and eliminating parts of the issue.AI plays a significant role in management accounting actions, including processing large amounts of data for policymaking, improving speed and timeliness in decision-making; thus, allowing for time and money savings, capability to monitor overarching business practices, enabling planning due to intuitions created by higher data volumes, productivity gains, reducing operating costs because of better data quality, and possible new sources of income as a result of connecting ability of data quality and improving interactions with customers due to the open nature of data. Fundamentally, artificial intelligence (AI) promotes the horizontality of financial organizations, allowing companies to benefit from it at both intra- and inter-organizational levels. The corporation becomes a collection of social networks connecting various stakeholders within and without the enterprise.
Management accounting firms may utilize AI in managing their accounting data; thus, it may be transformed into actionable insights that drive company decisions and help improve every customer engagement and increase operational improvements.AI is more than a support function; it is a crucial component of value generation and a competitive advantage. It helps firms operate better with streamlined business processes, increased efficiency, better operational planning, and the ability to respond swiftly to unforeseen events. AI and the rapid utilization of information and communication technologies have accelerated financial institutions’ Big Data growth and effect. It allows for new management accounting data and forecasts based on existing data. On top of that, AI also assists accountants in creating precise forecasts based on extensive comprehension of the macro environment, permitting them to identify the fundamentals that may affect a firm’s incomes and more accurate prices. Therefore, AI implementation provides a strategic edge for management accounting firms in the future, essentially putting rivals out of business.Blockchain and data analyticsBlockchain technology, a machine recording system that uses bitcoin in a customer network, is another trend that may alter the demand for accountants. While bitcoin, a virtual currency that keeps track of transactions and enables the construction of new currency systems without the use of a bank, has raised blockchain’s popularity, the technology has progressed significantly. The application of blockchain in management accounting stems from “the promise of a new form of a holistic approach – one that can be updated and confirmed regularly without fear of being changed or damaged.” Accountants
are naturally interested in blockchain since it allows for real-time access to books and records and the establishment of intelligent contracts and recordkeeping. Blockchain has already been adopted by some accounting firms, including the Big Four — EY, PwC, Deloitte, and KPMG. While blockchain data can verify an asset’s ownership, its condition, location, and genuine value must be confirmed.By lowering the expenses of storing and maintaining ledgers and enabling complete transparency into financial assets and history, blockchain can help enhance audits. When combined with other automation technologies such as machine learning, Cryptocurrency will enhance transaction processing accounting, but only for experts. Instead, competent accountants will look into the real-world economic consequences of blockchain records, linking them to economic reality and valuation. A debtor’s existence, for example, can be validated using blockchain, but the debtor’s recoverable valuation and financial value are still up for argument. The value of a company’s data, for example, could widen the scope of accounting by allowing more aspects to be included that are currently judged complex or untrustworthy to assess.ReportingEach decision should be centered on accurate and relevant information obtained from a credible and secure database. Data scientists and other departments like IT are increasingly challenging controllers’ primary role of building and enhancing such a “single source of truth.” New information procedures may likewise contribute to an additional self-service, decentralized-based broadcasting and decision-making setting, affecting the kind of control and the responsibility of controllers. Conversation bots and additional robotic mechanism automation tools can save time and money for businesses, but they need
to be managed carefully.The Management Accountants’ Exposure to DigitalizationSeveral businesses are still at an early stage of digital transformation. Specific organizations have numerous information about their customers, products, and transactions. As a result, those polled are enthused about the potential of big data. The respondents appear more interested in the subject matter, including the use of modern technologies like AI and RPA (Robotics Process Automation) (RPA). Every company that uses RPA also employs AI; most respondents use ERP systems hosted in the cloud. According to the research, those polled are happy with the cloud solution and feel that the data is safe and secure, and accessible at all times and in all places. Several clients Find ERP fascinating and amusing since they can utilize it on mobile apps and track the progress on their mobile devices. Cloud-based accounting systems have numerous advantages; traditional systems take longer to implement than cloud-based systems.Businesses are implementing digitization, and most of them are adopting artificial intelligence and robots to ease their work; they are just starting their journey to Robotic process automation (RPA) technology. Automated processes are becoming more commonplace since it is a tool that countless companies have long-term plans. Robots are not the most important technology for companies since they are programmed to execute a limited number of simple, repetitive activities. Appropriate advancements must be in place to automate the repetitious tasks, and the government needs to support and encourage new ideas. Most management accountants are aware that robots are utilized on less than ideal systems to save
money; hence companies only use AI when necessary because accountants have to deal with it in a complicated manner. Companies that have been using AI for a long time are finally seeing results because they realize the advantages and are optimistic about their potential.Challenges of Digitization and OpportunitiesArtificial Intelligence, which may be incorporated into auditing and accounting activities, can reduce the need for human labor considerably. Artificial intelligence can help with more structured, programmed, and repetitive jobs, where getting human intelligence and expertise is not time-wasting. Innovative technologies are not being designed to take the place of human intellect; instead, they are being integrated to aid accountants become restored strategic consultants by offering crucial firm visions. Machine learning and AI will offer accountants more access to real-time data from more sources. Though AI is in its early phases still, most companies apply it mainly for intelligent document OCR (“Optical Character Recognition”) and funds transfer automation. Software development leads to a knowledge of invoices rather than just matching order numbers and invoice amounts.Businesses may utilize the blockchain to get real-time data from several sources. Most organizations opt for this distribution method to protect sensitive financial data and streamline complex operations. The term “blockchain” should not be used to describe the technology. Blockchain can replace traditional auditing, compliance, and reconciliation chores due to its unwavering security and transparency. Technology advancements open up new avenues for delivering information regularly. Accounting is still based on the evaluation and analysis of financial data regularly, but stakeholders, auditors, and others expect more
detailed and real-time reporting. A transition period and implementation processes will be required to move from an episodic basis of bookkeeping and reportage positioned exclusively on financial information to an additional complete view of accounting reporting. Current jobs will be displaced and disrupted due to implementing and transitioning to a more comprehensive accounting function.Higher performance and greater efficiency can be achieved by accounting experts through the usage of digital systems while reducing waste and increasing competence. Accountants will be looking for new methods to do things when working electronically, developing more complex accounting tools, which will aid in the efficient flow of accounting work. Accountants will have to learn to use new accounting systems and technologies to work digitally, advancing the accounting industry. Digital working allows us to work from any comfortable and safe location while keeping the COVID-19 scenario in mind. It is more cost-effective to conduct business via digital means because it reduces the need for actual office space and other expenses such as stationery travel. Therefore, accountants can complete clients’ data presentations in a specific time frame and low cost.Technology provides a plethora of options and assists individuals in doing various tasks. The electronic working environment, among other things, will make full use of various technology. The digital world uncovers talented people by allowing them to accomplish tasks from anywhere in the world and give a surprise, high-quality results. Customers would have more faith that their administrative job is automatically done because it is more evidence that their chosen accounting specialists will perform
it. It will also make the expert more accountable, ensuring that the work is precise and reliable. The electronic performance of financial work will aid in the proper record of information, evading the damage of data information in traditional paperwork systems. It will also assure the security of the data by applying many layers of protection. Another advantage of digital platforms in accounting and artificial intelligence is that they provide 100 percent accuracy and automatically detect faults, preventing human error. The various accounting programs give high accuracy and error detection technologies, ensuring that the financial work is relevant.ChallengesAccountants’ tasks and actions include critical intellectual and imagination, thus mechanizing the errands and actions that would be problematic, impacting the accounting occupation’s development. Auditors must be ready for computerization, which requires specific and new information and assistance. Automation is on the horizon for accountants who perform tedious, repetitive, and standardized tasks. Data mining, experience and understanding systems, and a more comprehensive network of facts are potent tools to manage a firm effectively. Because of automation, there will be a reduction in the need for human data input and an increase in speed, reliability, and correctness through digital technologies like artificial intelligence and cryptocurrency.In the future, bookkeepers and auditors will be supplanted by consultants, counselors, and accountants’ technologists. Because of this, accountants must seize the opportunity presented by technological improvements that make their work more accessible and more efficient. Large firms must spend substantial money digitizing their operations and incorporating new technologies to implement expertise management. Investing decisions, especially
for small shareholders, could be significantly impacted by widespread accounting and auditing automation concerning capital markets. In the modern digital financial accounting and reporting context, a regular balance sheet is provided to readers of the income statement. Lastly, human intellect will always trump machine learning, even though various tasks done by auditors can be mechanized.Future SituationThe accounting industry is undergoing a fast transformation due to advancements in technology. It is becoming increasingly commonplace for the financial department to use technology, machine learning, micro-robots, and various other technologies. Intelligent technology has only recently become available to organizations; therefore, they continue to employ automated accounting methods that are decades old. Computers may assist with accounting tasks, including supplier interaction, audits, account payables, purchasing procurement, cost control, closure procedures, and client questions. The prospective availability of accounting jobs is influenced by advances in technology (Rijanto et al., 3079). Automated systems take over tedious activities and link data and consumers, doing more analysis. Thus, the tasks and responsibilities of accountants will change shortly due to innovationStudents will learn data analytics, management accounting, complicated financial reporting abilities, and a deeper understanding of modern accounting technologies and advanced analytical procedures with an online master’s degree in accounting. In general, artificial intelligence (AI) will offer attempts for learners to simulate cognitive capacities in computers so that they can solve problems on their own and improve their solutions over time (Hassan et al. 143). “Strong AI” and “weak AI” or “narrow AI” are the two categories of AI that scholars will learn in future.
Strong AI refers to ideas aiming to emulate and imitate human brain functions, whereas narrow AI refers to systems that merely demonstrate intelligent behavior in limited domains. Artificial General Intelligence (AGI) will offer a software that can handle complex problems in a variety of fields while also directing itself. Weak AI is currently more widely used and is included in modern AI software.Artificial intelligence will provide real-time information about financial matters because it can generate brochures using natural linguistic dispensation and computer ideas faster, making daily reportage possible and cheap. The accounting industry is rapidly evolving due to technological advancements. Automation, adaptive intelligence, machine learning, and mini-bots will become integral components of the finance team. Even though intelligent technology is still in its early stages, countless organizations rely on manual accounting systems. Accounting duties that computers will assist with include supplier engagement, audits, accounts payable, purchasing, procurement, cost optimization, closure procedures, and customer questions. The kinds of accounting jobs that will be accessible in the future will be influenced by intelligent technology. As intelligent technologies take over repetitive jobs, humans conduct more analysis, making them the crucial link between data and people. As a result, technology will impact the duties and expectations of accountants in the future.Blockchain and data analyticsBlockchain technology, a machine recording system that uses bitcoin in a customer network, is another trend that may alter the demand for accountants. While bitcoin, a virtual currency that keeps track of transactions and enables the construction of new currency systems without the use of a bank,
has raised blockchain’s popularity, the technology has progressed significantly. The demand for blockchain in accounting stems from “the promise of a new form of a holistic approach – one that can be updated and confirmed regularly without fear of being changed or damaged.” Accountants are naturally interested in blockchain since it allows for real-time access to books and records and the establishment of intelligent contracts and recordkeeping. Blockchain has already been adopted by some accounting firms, including the Big Four — EY, PwC, Deloitte, and KPMG. While blockchain data can verify an asset’s ownership, its condition, location, and genuine value must be confirmed.By lowering the expenses of storing and maintaining ledgers and enabling complete transparency into financial assets and history, blockchain can help enhance audits. Accounting firms could use blockchain to obtain visibility into their firms’ available assets and liabilities, allowing them to concentrate on strategy and valuation rather than recordkeeping. When combined with other automation technologies such as machine learning, Cryptocurrency will enhance transaction processing accounting, but only for experts. Instead, competent accountants will look into the real-world economic consequences of blockchain records, linking them to economic reality and valuation. A debtor’s existence, for example, can be validated using blockchain, but the debtor’s recoverable valuation and financial value are still up for argument. The value of a company’s data, for example, could widen the scope of accounting by allowing more aspects to be included that are currently judged complex or untrustworthy to assess.Skills Needed for Management Accountants in The FutureAs big data becomes more complex,
accounting professionals will have to be conversant with information extraction methods to harvest organized and unstructured information. Using data analysis techniques skills, they will need to gather and maintain this knowledge and then evaluate and present stories. Industry analysis, planning, budgeting, operating decision analysis, risk assessment, and invention fall under the “strategic management” umbrella. Automated accounting operations will necessitate that accounting professionals examine the quality and productivity of accounting systems and provide recommendations for improvement. Advanced costing methodologies and procedures will also be required to ensure data security, protect assets and meet the legal and disclosure requirements. Skills in activities and business strategy include knowledge of the company’s industry and understanding operational processes, quality control, and program management.Future Challenges and OpportunitiesLack of specialized IT skills, a lack of organizational change management, changing consumer expectations, a lack of a clear strategy, financial worries and limits, security concerns, and inadequate data management are all issues that need to be addressed. The achievement of any effective digital transformation depends on a group of dedicated and highly qualified IT professionals. However, it is becoming increasingly hard to unite this team. Increasing investment in new technology is creating a lack of skilled workers. Organizational structures that are antiquated, ineffective, and inflexible may hinder the success of the transformation, which was not clearer when firms struggled to migrate to a distant design explicitly in 2020 quickly. Currently, people have realized what they may do on their laptops and smartphones. As an outcome, customers have never been choosier or demanding. For instance, it
is no more prolonged anxiety to have touchless purchasing options. Therefore, firms are forced to navigate rough waters, sure of their need to move forward but unclear of how. If a business does not have a strategy, its change will not get off the ground.OpportunitiesDigitalization will provide various opportunities, such as the utilization of Artificial intelligence. Future utilization of technology will generate digital management accounting solutions, new digitalization series, new possibilities, and fragmented firms. Most firms will utilize digitalization to attain their goals, attract more clients, or enhance efficiency. AI will help businesses perform standardized responsibilities that contribute to a repetitive effort that can be robotic. Companies would have no problem taking over their clients’ financial activities since technology allowed businesses to become more effective and discerning. The fragmented business would be competitive and more likely to merge with other industries. According to the survey respondents, competition with other firms in a similar sector and competitors from other fields.Management Accountants’ Role in The FutureAccounting professionals will need to be familiar with data visualization techniques and tools to assist clients and executives in making sense of the data. Accounting specialists use predictive analytics and estimating to deliver tactical advice to consumers or administrations. Because computerization frees up spells spent on additional ordinary tasks, accountants may devote more time honing their analytical skills. The accounting will undoubtedly need to be technically advanced to stay up with the evolving business. As more innovative technologies advance and more institutions migrate their data to cloud-based platforms, accountants must become skilled in
Case SummaryCharita Chalmers, a supervisory employee at the Tulon Company in Richmond, was terminated after sending several letters to other employees’ houses, targeting their religious beliefs and life choices. Chalmers, a devoted Christian, saw it her duty to share her Lord’s gospel, and thought it her duty to inform her coworkers of their “improper conduct” in the face of God. By sending the letters to their homes, she disturbed them and their privacy, which eventually led to termination. Although Chalmers claimed to have the best intentions, she lost her religious discrimination claim against the company.Chalmers attempted to inform two coworkers, Mr. LaMantia and Ms. Combs, that they need to rectify and strengthen their relationships with God. In the case of LaMantia, Chalmers claimed that he was being untruthful to customers about job turnaround times. However, she failed to explicitly mention his shortcoming in the letter that was sent to his household, which led to a miscommunication. Since Mr. LaMantia was working at a different branch that day, his wife opened the letter and assumed that Chalmers was talking about an affair Mr. LaMantia was having. Although during a call later that day Chalmers explained her intentions, the letter still highly disturbed Mrs. LaMantia and put a strain in the relationship with her husband.The letter intended for Ms. Combs described “God of Wrath” as someone who dislikes adultery, implying that the illness Ms. Combs was experiencing was a punishment from God for giving birth out of wedlock. The letter highly distressed Ms. Combs, which she related to
Craig A. Faber, Vice President of Administration at Tulon, who was in the process of investigating the incident. Faber found that the letters Chalmers was sending were inappropriate in their invasion of privacy, and disruptive to the work relationships, and overall an example of bad judgement from Chalmers’ part. The plaintiff was terminated as a result, causing her to question whether the company’s actions were based on religious discrimination.Nevertheless, Chalmers did not have a sufficient claim to her religious accommodation case, since she could not satisfy the requirements of the prima facie test. More specifically, the court agreed that Chalmers had enough evidence to prove that her religious beliefs were genuine and that she did get a disciplinary punishment. However, she could not prove that she had warned the company of the letter sending as an element of her faith, which made it impossible for it to accommodate her. Therefore, the plaintiff’s claim was deemed a failure and Tulon Company was affirmed as not responsible.Case QuestionsThe employer’s action to avoid this situationIt would be difficult to avoid this situation since it is impossible for the employer to be explicit about every single type of behavior that is frowned upon in the office. The employer could not have known that Chalmers was planning on sending the letters or predicted their contents. Therefore, there was no way for the employer to protect himself from the confusion and miscommunication that occurred, or the other employees from the discomfort they experienced. Furthermore, it would be impossible for the employer to
an employee, if a complaint is made about one of my employees, I would be forced to act. It would require an investigation of the incident, in order to establish the culpability and intentions of everyone involved. According to Business Wire, companies today strive to prioritize their employees (McCarty, 2020), which in the case of Mrs. LaMartia’s call would be Chalmers. Therefore, as the employer I would attempt to find a compromising solution that would allow for a peaceful resolution while protecting my employee. However, once Mr. LaMartia, who is also an employee of Tulon, expresses his discontent with the situation and with Chalmers, then the incident becomes more complicated. Since favoritism is generally an unfair strategy in the workplace, the situation would have to be resolved in a way that does not prioritize just one of the parties. In this case, I would reassign Chalmers to a different department so that there is no workplace crisis.
The case under consideration, Bostock v. Clayton County, 590 U.S., was significant for developing measures to avoid discrimination in the workplace. More specifically, it was primarily related to diversity in terms of sex and age since this combination frequently evokes the concerns of the population (King, 2021). The examination of the issue by relying on the example of Gerald Bostock was advantageous for establishing proper employment practices in this respect.In this lawsuit filed by the plaintiff, the main factor was his unjustified dismissal from the company in which he had otherwise positive reputation. This event was caused by the man’s interest in a gay softball league which he expressed while being in the workplace while neglecting the provisions of Title VII (Mallory et al., 2020). This part of the Civil Rights Act, confirming the violation, was relied on by Bostock when initiating legal action, but it was initially dismissed by the district court due to its allegedly erroneous interpretation (“Bostock v. Clayton County, 590 U.S.,” 2019). The appeal, including the claim to include sexual discrimination in consideration, was successful as Bostock managed to support his position with the opposing statements of Massachusetts law, Chapter 151B (“Bostock v. Clayton County, 590 U.S.,” 2019). In this way, the meaning of the previously used provisions regulating such cases was modified accordingly.To summarize, the examined court case based on employment law and, more specifically, discrimination against workers happened to be crucial for making adjustments. The previous evidence, as per Title VII of the Civil Rights Act did not include the particular considerations of sex and age. Hence, this gap was compensated for by this decision, and the consequent change in the legal provisions helped guarantee the equality of people in the workplace in the context of their diversity.
Case SummaryThe case concerns Christopher Lee Peterson, at the time of events an employee of Wilmur Communications and a follower of the World Church of the Creator. In 2000, Peterson gave an interview to the local paper on WCC, expressing his racist views, which included the support of a known shooter that targeted African-American, Jewish and Asian people. After finding out about the interview, the company president suspended Peterson without pay and later demoted him to a lower pay and responsibility role. Since according to Title VII it is unlawful to discriminate based on religious views, the plaintiff sued the organization for the demotion.Creativity, or the World Church of the Creator, is a self-proclaimed religion with its beliefs centered around white supremacy and the maintenance of racial purity. The extremist group was established in 1973 by Ben Klassen, and after he committed suicide in 1993 Matt Hale took on the role of the leader (“Creativity Movement”, n.d.). According to the founder, Klassen, the organization and its members strive towards a “total war” against all “goddamned mud races” (“Creativity Movement”, n.d.), as he thought of the White Race as elite and superior to the other races. Although the group believes itself to be a religion, it did not endorse any gods, and considered race to be the most sacred truth (“Creativity Movement”, n.d.). Furthermore, the followers of WCC claimed that Holocaust did not exist, and that a utopian world consists of white people only. Throughout the years, the neo-Nazi organization attracted several violently inclined individuals, which allegedly
resulted in numerous attacks.Peterson, who was a member of the organization, supervised a team of both white and non-white subordinates. In March 2000, the plaintiff appeared in the local newspaper, which was doing a segment on the WCC. The article included the confirmation of Peterson’s views and beliefs as those concordant with the views of the WCC, as well as a photograph of Peterson showing respect to a mass shooter. Although Peterson’s believes were similar to those of the KKK and arguably unethical, his termination was still judged to be unlawful and religiously discriminatory by the court.Case QuestionsAn employer’s reaction to the news articleIf I was the employer that saw this news article, I would find a legal way to terminate the employee. As an employer, it would be my duty to maintain a functioning and safe workplace. Therefore, seeing an article that could potentially disturb some of the employees would cause me to question whether the person making these claims is a good fit for the company. If the employees are unable to feel safe in the working environment, then as the employer I would be liable for creating such environment. Although, to the best of my knowledge in the scenario, the employee had not acted on his beliefs and had just been expressing them, I would not want to be responsible in the case that he did. Furthermore, the fact that the employee had non-white people in his subordination makes the open support of the racist mass shooter in the paper a relatively explicit
Case SummaryThe case of Trans World Airlines, Inc. v. Hardison is concerned with the failure of the employer to accommodate the employee’s religious observance day. The plaintiff, Hardison, was an employee at Trans World Airlines and a devoted Jew who observed Sabbath every Saturday. According to the Jewish traditions, the seventh day of the week, Saturday, is a rest day during which the followers of Judaism are not allowed to do any work. As Sabbath, or Shabbat, is a holy day in Judaism, it was important for Hardison to be able to work shifts that would allow him to be free on Saturdays.Trans World Airlines maintained a seniority system that would allow each worker to have a certain level of priority when choosing his or her shifts. For some years, Hardison worked at a department of TWA which presented him with a level of seniority enough to choose the shifts that allowed his observance of Shabbat. However, after willingly changing jobs, his seniority level was no longer enough to give him the necessary freedom to not schedule shifts on Saturdays. Although the company sought to accommodate Hardison’s religious needs, it was unable to accept his proposal to only work 4 days a week. Hardison’s refusal to work on Saturdays eventually caused him to be terminated.The plaintiff claimed that the company failed to accommodate him and violated Title VII that protects individuals from religious discrimination. However, the court concluded that TWA made a reasonable effort at accommodating Hardison and granting him the request to work four days
a week would detriment the function of his department due to them being short-staffed. Nevertheless, the Court of Appeals claimed that TWA did not make sufficient effort of offering alternative solutions to Hardison’s scheduling problem and rejected three reasonable alternatives. Regardless of the apparent potential hardships the company claimed, it could have offered Hardison’s Saturday shift to another employee for an overtime pay. Nevertheless, breaking the seniority rules for one employee, no matter the little individual cost, would set a precedent for future cases. Therefore, granting Hardison special treatment would have led to TWA having large costs in the long-run. Regardless, the Court of Appeals deemed TWA liable for not having made a sufficient effort to accommodate Hardison.Case QuestionsThe alternatives suggested by the court of appealsThere were a few alternatives that were offered by the Court of Appeals for the TWA in the case of Hardison’s scheduling conflict. However, for several reasons none of these alternatives were viable in the long-run and therefore, TWA should not have been held accountable for its decision to terminate Hardison. Firstly, allowing the plaintiff to work four days a week would have caused a short-staffing situation and would put unnecessary strains on the other workers at the organization. Furthermore, allowing Hardison to overlook the seniority system and to have more freedom to choose his hours would also be unfair on other workers. Lastly, forcing another employee to take on more hours as a result would not only be unfair on the other staff but would put a strain on the
a result, critical thinking and research are essential.It’s crucial to examine a few choices when spotting disinformation, recognizing fake news sites, and double-checking before sharing or posting a comment. First and foremost, double-check the source of the news or information. Fake news sites frequently employ addresses that sound like legitimate newspaper locations, but they lack authentic stories on various themes. If the website appears to be unsteady, go to the “About” page and seek a detailed description of the company. Second, look into the author. Check them out to see whether they’re reliable – do they have a strong reputation, and do they write about their field of expertise? Furthermore, the motivation of the author may be essential in the dissemination of forgeries. Third, fact-checking is necessary since trustworthy news reports will include numerous facts such as data, figures, and expert statements. If they aren’t there, inquire as to why. Reports containing misleading information sometimes contain wrong dates or time periods, so it’s a good idea to double-check the article’s publication date.
The computation of the three ratiosReturn on Assets (RoA)Return on Equity (RoE)Profit MarginThe purpose and information conveyed by each ratiosThe three ratios presented and computed in the previous section represent vital profit generation indicators for a modern commercial organization. The return on assets (RoA) shows how well the company utilizes the entirety of its assets, including the borrowed ones, to generate financial returns. The return on equity is largely similar to this metric, but it does not consider the debt of the company (Gallo, 2016). Finally, the profit margin is one of the most important indicators of financial health, as it draws a direct comparison between sales and profits, showing how much the company actually earns from its operations.ABC Company review on three ratiosFirst of all, the ABC Company’s business model can be deemed successful, as it generates adequate profits. Optimal returns on equity and assets show that the investors can reasonably expect returns on their participation in the company’s financing. The profit margin is also considerable, which means that this aspect of the firm is handled well.The profitability of the companyOverall, the ABC Company remains a profitable enterprise that successfully converts its assets into revenues. The profit margin is over 50%, which is commendable, even though the overall turnover is below $1 million. Therefore, the business model on its own functions well, allowing the ABC Company to retain a stable position on the market. However, it may not suffice for the sustained growth in the long-term.ABC Company financial successfulWhile the ABC Company’s financial statement may present positive indicators, it would be unwise to consider the company in isolation. Instead, it appears to interesting to compare the entity’s performance against the industry’s leaders to identify the areas in which it excels or where the improvements are needed. First of all, the return on assets is provided by Rose (2022), indicating that the industry’s average was set at 9.1-9.3% across the past four years. The ABC Company’s figures are considerably higher at the moment with 28.3%, but it is important to note that its absolute cash flows are not on par with the industry’s leaders. Thus, it is possible that the ABC Company’s ratios will become lower as the entity continues to grow.This difference becomes particularly evident when the income levels are compared with the industry’s average figures. As far as net income is concerned, the industry has averaged at $4.7 million in 2020. The ABC Company is far from this level, as its net income is only $77,000, which implies that it still has a long growth phase ahead. Furthermore, the industry’s leaders, such as Williams-Sonoma, have hundreds of millions of sales, whereas the ABC Company only has half-a-million. As the total assets of the company increase, there is no guarantee that its profit margins and returns on investment will remain equally high. Under these circumstances, the emphasis will be on maintaining the profitability of operations above the average level across the industry.
Africa.Spatial DistributionLarge supply growth in top exporting nations Ecuador and the Philippines, as well as strong rises in import demand, particularly from China and the European Union, are key drivers of trade (MacKinnon & Cumbers, 2019). Large retail chains from key importing nations are now operating directly in the global banana value chain. These networks buy bananas directly from growers and distributors rather than via typical fruit corporations (MacKinnon & Cumbers, 2019). The intricate web of interactions involved in the production, distribution, and trade of any given commodity may lead to genuine conflicts of interest among groups of individuals over who benefits the most from a product. Cheap bananas are frequently passed on to small farmers and plantation employees down the supply chain, resulting in lower salaries and working conditions (MacKinnon & Cumbers, 2019). Currently, the main issue in terms of spatial distribution is that large-scale banana production may negatively affect the environment, worker health and safety, and local populations. This occurs due to the frequently harsh techniques employed to regulate irrigation and plant diseases.SourcesMacKinnon, D., & Cumbers, A. (2019). An introduction to economic geography .

Blues-inspired poetry reflects the interaction between literary art and musical tradition that originates from the early 20 th century. Most researchers of this area, including Tracy (1981), state that blues-inspired poetry stems from the struggle and culture of African Americans. These people expressed their views and concerns through the music of blues, which quickly found a warm reception from the audience. Naturally, these aspects found their way into poetry, creating a unique style that combines the thematic elements of blues with the poetic tradition of literature. Blues poetry is stylistically similar to blues music in that it does not attempt to incorporate a variety of complex language forms and sophisticated rhymes. Instead, blues poetry is characterized by repetitive lines that emphasize the emotional burden of the author, as well as often simplified grammatic and lexical construction. Importantly, these attributes do not imply that blues poetry is simple or primitive by any means. On the contrary, these works are characterized by an extreme level of emotional depth, which is further multiplied by the realistic nature of the narration.Blues poetry is a common feature of the first decades of the 20 th century and it is closely connected to the names of renowned authors of the time. More specifically, Tracy (1981) and other researchers highlight the contribution made by Langston Hughes and Sterling Brown who virtually defined the genre as it is. Nevertheless, blues poetry is not limited to their literary works, as a number of other authors contributed to the development of this style. Furthermore, blues poetry
that is titled Go Down, Death . As the name suggests, the piece thematically addresses the grief of a person over a beloved one. The recurring element of the poem goes like this:“Weep not, weep not,She is not dead;She’s resting in the bosom of Jesus.”Johnson mourns the death of a woman, attempting to console himself by searching divine meaning in the tragedy. He tells a story of how God himself sent Death after sister Caroline who was “tired” and “weary”. Apparently, the woman had her share of struggle in life, and now Johnson implies that God has decide to alleviate her of the burden. This piece is filled with tragedy and bittersweet hopefulness, conveying strong feelings through rather simple language. It is a highly interesting and recommended piece of blues poetry that reflects the depth of the genre.You ain’t gonna see it coming, noNo one’s gonna see it comingIt comes unannounced in day or at nightAll you can do is just sit here real tightHe wants to your granny, yeahHe wants to take your neighborDon’t think that you’re too cunningDon’t think that you’re too cleverI saw him once and it was scaryI saw him once, yes, it was scaryHe got me mumbling like I never did‘What’s your name?’, I askedand he said, ‘COVID’
AbstractThe research involved finding the difference between men and women about body image concerns. The research was developed to resolve the limitations of previous researchers. In the current research, it was suggested that men scored higher on DMS and women on BSQS. The research also established associations between masculinity or femininity and drive for muscularity or body shape concerns and understanding if masculinity correlated with a drive for muscularity. It was suggested that DFM and masculinity showed a positive correlation as described by previous research to understand this association. The research included 700 participants from Princeton University who completed survey questionnaires. 64% of the participants were women, and 36% were men allowed to complete various measures such as the DMS, BSQ, and BSRI for a personality trait. The research used ANOVA and correlation to analyze data, and the results showed that men recorded higher on DMS, while women indicated higher scores on BSQS.BackgroundResearch on gender differences in body image concerns and their results solely relied on the adiposity viewpoint. As a result, there has been the belief that men are less dissatisfied or concerned with their tendency of body fat than women who are less likely to diet to lose weight (McCreary et al., 2005). DMS and gender role measures showed men with significantly higher personality traits and the drive for muscularity in the previous study. Contrary to women who showed significant communal traits and acted in a more female-typed manner. In determining the degree for predicting drive for muscularity, men scored higher on the DMS
than women on controlling gender behaviors (Gattario et al., 2015). Therefore, higher levels of male gender roles were closely related to the desire to become muscular. Femininity was not associated with the drive for muscularity as there was a lack of interrelation amid feminine-typed behaviors and traits and DMS scores (McCreary et al., 2005). Another finding showed that both men and women showed a similar association between gender-typed behaviors and traits and the drive for muscularity.Similarly, men with more traditional attitudes desired to become more muscular. Men who wanted to be muscular experienced conflict about societal expectations, as they wanted to be competitive, powerful, and successful (Radwan et al., 2019). Previous research had limitations such that the research involved was correlational, which determined only significant relationships’ direction and presence. Another limitation was that the study samples were restricted based on ethnicity and age. Therefore, the current study was designed to address the limitations of McCreary et al. (2005). The study explores the direction of causality in the interrelations amid masculinity perceptions and drive for muscularity and uses different populations and measures. A previous study contacted by McCreary et al. (2005) used BSQ for body image measure and drive for muscularity scale (DMS) and BSQS. However, the current study uses measures geared toward body fat and muscularity. Based on gender personality measures, BSRI is employed to explore different aspects of gender role socialization.The research questions for the current study entail finding if there is a difference between men and women in body image amid concern with muscle
mass and body fat or shape. The hypothesis for this research question predicted that men would score higher on DMS and women higher on BSQS, as found by McCreary’s theory and research findings. The second research question involved finding the relationships between masculinity/femininity and drive for muscularity/body shape concerns and understanding if masculinity correlated with a drive for muscularity. Based on this research question, it was hypothesized that there would be a positive correlation between masculinity and drive for muscularity (DFM), as stated in the theory and prior research. For DFM and FEM, McCreary theorized a relationship but did not find it. Hence, the current study wants to replicate and confirm or disprove original findings and investigate correlations for BSQS.MethodsParticipantsA total of 700 participants completed surveys, of which 64% were women, and 36% were men. The participants’ age range was between 18 to 35 years with a mean age of 20.8 years, men SD = 3.2 while women SD = 2.5, and only 2.3% of the participants were older than 24 years. Most of the participants were European American, accounting for 90%, working-class was 65%, middle-class 17%, upper-middle-class 15%, and upper class 3%. The majority of participants were individuals who were employed in their professionals. Out of the total participants, 78 were lesbian, 79 bisexual, and 176 heterosexual.ProcedureThe research was conducted at Princeton University, containing a large student and staff population. Relevant research authorities in the college approved the study, and all participating research students were permitted to research body image concerns. For participants to be
recruited into the research process, they must fulfill the exclusion and inclusion criteria. A survey was used to collect data where each participant was given Likert-questionnaires to complete that included questions about personality traits and demographics. Participants were allowed to complete all the DMS, BSQ, and BSRI, after which the collected data was analyzed to ascertain each trait. Informed consent for the research involved assessing the ability of participants to comprehend and present relevant research information and make a voluntary decision. Filled informed consent was documented and included in the research record.Every participant completed DMS that measured their desire for a muscular body. The item on this scale presented behaviors and attitudes, and no reverse coding was performed. Sample items entailed participants wishing to be muscular and feeling guilty for missing training sessions. All the participants answered similar survey questionnaires administered with various self-report instruments as part of the research. The questionnaires were conducted voluntarily, and the participants were invited to answer the questions. Participants were allowed to fill out consent forms willingly without manipulation after being told what the research entails, including its benefit.Measures  * Survey. A survey was performed by asking participants about their opinion on their body shape, including rating themselves on a 6-point Likert scale, with 60 traits related to personality. In addition, a question on the participant’s background and personal demographics was included. The participants were not required to put their names on the survey, and all responses were kept with high confidentiality and anonymity. The survey questions were to
be answered freely by the participants without penalizing those who submitted an incomplete survey.  * Drive for Muscularity Scale (DMS). DMS is a 15-item measure of the degree to which individuals desire to have a more muscular body. Each item on the DMS represents a combination of behaviors and attitudes scored on a 6-point scale ranging from 1, which implies ”very much like me” to 6, which indicates ”not at all like me.” There is good construct validity with DMS about-face, discriminant, and convergent validity. The Cronbach’s alphas for men are.91 and women’s.83.  * Body Shape Questionnaire Scale (BSQS). BSQS is a 34-item questionnaire that measures how people feel about their body shape. BSQ is scored on a 1-6 scale (with 1=Never and 6=Always), with some of the items being calculated from the total scale score and scores ranging from 34 to 204. A higher score indicates more discomfort and dissatisfaction with body concerns.  * Bem Sex-Role Inventory (BSRI). BSRI measures femininity and masculinity used to research gender roles by assessing how individuals recognize themselves psychologically. The test has 60 diverse personality traits where participants rate themselves on a 7-point Likert scale. Personality traits are equally dispersed with 20 gender-neutral traits, 20 feminine, and 20 masculines. BSRI has shown high test-retest reliability and validity with coefficient alphas of.87 for masculinity scale and.78 for femininity scales, and no androgynous scale was used for analysis.ResultsParticipants recorded different measures of central tendency for both scales such that for DMS men mean=2.42, SD=0.79, BSQS M=2.48, SD=1.30, BSRI
masculinity M=2.28, SD=0.57, and femininity M=2.44, SD=0.45. For women DMS M=1.99, SD=0.61, BSQS M=2.85, SD=1.40, BSRI Masculinity M=2.82, SD=0.70, Femininity M=1.88, SD=1.75. One-way ANOVA was used to ascertain DMS, BSQS, and BSRI measures, as shown in table 1. The results for ANOVA F-ratio indicated a big difference between the two genders. To evaluate how the study variables correlated and whether they related differently based on sexual orientation, correlations were performed for DMS and MAS, DMS and FEM, BSQS and MAS, and BSQS and FEM.Table 1.

Based on DMS and FEM, the findings showed a positive correlation between DMS and femininity, such that drive for masculinity was directly related to femininity. Women who are attracted to muscular individuals influenced men to gain weight. However, women had no association with DMS as they diet to lose more weight. There was no significant correlation between BSQS and MAS; however, BSQS and FEM showed a significant correlation.DiscussionTo determine the difference among men and women in body image concern with muscle mass and body shape or fat, ANOVA and correlation were used to analyze the results. Men recorded higher scores on DMS, while women indicated higher scores on BSQS, which conformed with the theory of McCreary and previous research findings. It was also found that masculinity correlated with a drive for muscularity, unlike femininity, which showed a relationship with a drive for body shape. Studies show that most men experience the drive for gaining muscles to avoid risking depression symptoms and poorer self-esteem. Men also become muscular because women feel more attracted to muscular body shape than ideal body size, thereby posing the urge to want more prominent shoulders, biceps, and pectorals.
Chinas Food Culture and Table EtiquetteChina is a country that focuses on courtesy with a deep history in its food culture. In China, it is essential to observe table manners as both guests and natives have a precise placement on the table during meal times. It is admirable that the Chinese stress taking care of the elders and children before others during meals. In a domestic setup, it is the norm to place the main dish, consisting of grain or rice, at the center. Rice is an essential part of the meal since it has some religious value to society. Since China leads in rice cultivation, the people believe it is their source of wealth and show reverence to it by making it the main meal in every dish. Elders sit at the head of the table and serve first. Chinese receive rice bowls with both hands to show respect regardless of the age of the person serving. So, when in China, it is advisable to like rice and teat it religiously during meal times.Another distinct aspect in Chinese food cultures is with eating chopsticks. I found it interesting that Chines have a unique way of holding chopsticks according to the meal. I find it hard to eat noodles with chopsticks, but the Chinese make it sound and feel easy to eat rice with chopsticks. It is incredible how people rip meat and fish with chopsticks when I do not know how to hold them in the first place. I did find out that chopsticks have
well integrated. Budgets for individuals should be harmonized with each other. Budgets must be reviewed on a regular basis to avoid them from devolving into a license to spend the entire authorized amount even when it is not necessary. According to Dauda (2019), “business organizations of all types must engage in financial planning at whatever level to ensure judicious deployment of resources for achieving organisational goals.” Workers should be appropriately compensated for performance in accordance with the budget. Sloppy staff, on the other hand, should not go condemned.Behavioral Aspects of Budgetary ControlBudgetary control is a crucial instrument for performance evaluation. Nevertheless, findings take time to appear. Those in charge of fiscal control should have extensive knowledge and expertise in the subject. Workers are modifying their working practices, routines, and even their inter-relationships based on finances. As a result, workers may exhibit reluctance to change. It leads to the creation of each budget with the backing of top leadership. Each employee’s requirements are fully described and distributed in a formal structure. If this is the case, they will be aware of their power and responsibilities, which will be valuable for budgetary management. A financial management program’s effectiveness depends on the organization’s defined objectives. As a result, when establishing targets, management should exercise caution. Furthermore, the aims are explicit.
Gendered behavior denotes fundamental expressions of gender socialization and identity through an individual’s various developmental phases. Thus, gendered behaviors refer to the ways persons behave according to their respective male or female genders (Au & Rudolfsdottir, 2021). One of the prominent gendered behaviors instilled in me during childhood was that women are the primary cooks in the home. Hence, from childhood, I learned how to prepare food for the family, unlike most male relatives around. Even the movies mostly depicted women as the cooks in the home.Perhaps the gendered role that I quickly adopted/ accepted from childhood was the idea that women are natural caregivers. The function depicted women as noble people who consider the plight of others in the home and society and consistently seek to alleviate suffering. Women are warm, nurturing, and caring. Thus, many regarded professions that require empathy like nursing and teaching to the women’s domain.The idea that women are more humane and caring appealed to me and caused me to accept the role. In my mind, the part admitted what many would prefer to ignore/ deny: women play critical roles in retaining sanity in the world. For me, the role meant that women could play vital functions in stemming the tide of oppression, suffering, and cruelty evident even from childhood. Therefore, the idea that women are more caring and naturally nurturing appealed to me because it placed the gender on a nobler pedestal.Despite the perceived nobility of the gendered role that women are more nurturing and caring, specific adverse consequences emerged regarding employment opportunities, as previously highlighted. In many ways, many subsequently considered women to be unfit for specific job descriptions like piloting, engineering, and doctors, which were better paying (Samidha, 2019). On the other hand, societies restricted women to courses like nursing and teaching. Most patients assume women caregivers to be nurses rather than doctors in the care centers. Hence, the role may cause conflicts when deciding on career opportunities.
The guilty but mentally ill (GBMI) verdict may be regarded as a highly controversial phenomenon that has been nonetheless adopted by a considerable number of states regardless of little empirical support and sound criticism. In general, it is a particular verdict option that authorizes both psychiatric treatment and conventional criminal sanctions for defendants whose criminal offense was determined by their insanity (Bartol & Bartol, 2020). In other words, in the case of the GBMI verdict, juries and judges formally acknowledge a perpetrator’s mental illness and find him guilty of criminal violation at the same time.The GBMI verdict was introduced due to the increased number of crimes committed by defendants who had been previously released as not guilty by reason of insanity (NGRI). At the same time, the GBMI verdict was introduced as an option for a judge to define a sentence on the basis of an individual’s guilt and insanity. Its purpose is to minimize the cases of NGRI acquittees’ early release based on the GBMI verdict’s peculiarities. Thus, a perpetrator who receives it is sentenced as any other defendant found guilty (Bartol & Bartol, 2020). At the same time, he receives mental treatment to the extent determined by the court. The main peculiarity of the GBMI verdict is the offender’s serving out the rest of his sentence if and after his mental health is defined as stabilized (Bartol & Bartol, 2020). This fact is a major difference from the conditions of the NGRI verdict that presupposes the release of the insanity-defense acquittee from psychiatric commitment
A lot of historical events and time periods have specific names. The renaissance, the enlightenment, the stone age – all of these were called such for a particular reason, and signify a way to differentiate one era from another. One prime example of that trend is the industrial revolution. Also called the industrialization, it was an important part of history and a big step in both technological and social development. Happening at a never-before seen speed, the process has begun and ended in less than a 100 years. The word “revolution” in “industrial revolution” is used to emphasize that fact, and note that the process is regarded as both an extreme and quick advancement in society ( Industrial revolution ). Like a real revolution, it also had a variety of effects on people and their lives. By changing the way work is performed and understood, it fundamentally shifted the people’s understanding of the economy, labor, and the world itself, driving both positive and negative change.For entrepreneurs and people starting their own businesses, the industrialization became a central source of focus and income, replacing the manual labor of people. It also created opportunities for new types of production and large scale manufacturing to be performed. The introduction of complex machinery profoundly affected the workers as well, driving the unskilled labor out of fashion and requiring a higher degree of both education and proficiency. Industrial revolution has made many lose their jobs, while a number of other people have gained new possibilities of employment via migrating into cities (Thompson). Industrialization drove urban development, and contributed to the establishment of the city as a central hub for human interaction. On a larger scale, the ability to mass produce goods and services has allowed countries to establish larger economies, expand trade, and start more thorough relationships with their neighbors. Overall, the industrialization age has had its ups and downs, but the significance of the process is hard to overlook, as it remains the basis for the society people see today.
be a major violation of this fundamental law. Rogers and Drogin (2019) state that it would be a misconception to believe that every resident is fully informed of their rights by default. Furthermore, a failure to provide a notification of rights may render the defendant’s testimony inadmissible in court, as it can be dismissed due to possible coercion. This way, Miranda warnings align with the interests of both defendants and prosecutors.On the other hand, it appears possible to argue for the redundancy of rights in some special cases. For example, the arrest of a dangerous criminal or a person responsible for major terrorist threats is often deemed as not requiring a Miranda warning. In such cases, the situation may develop in a matter of seconds, making it necessary to incapacitate the perpetrator before starting legal procedures. From this perspective, it may be contextually appropriate to postpone Miranda warnings until the public safety is secured. In other words, the possibility of a direct, immediate threat to people’s lives outweighs legal formalities (Rogers & Drogin, 2019). Nevertheless, Miranda warnings should not be ignored completely, as they form the core of a transparent trial. Therefore, even if they are not presented at the moment of an arrest, Miranda rights will be given later once the situation is secured and prior to launching formal legal procedures.
The doctor’s job is to follow ethical standards, including loyalty to patients and respect for their choice. However, the profession concentrates on philosophical, religious, and cultural traditions and beliefs. Physician-assisted suicide can be seen as voluntary death by a medical professional. At the same time, the doctor provides all the necessary means and information regarding the patient’s desires for the end of life. However, such cooperation on the part of a doctor cannot be ethically conditioned.Allowing euthanasia can cause irreparable harm to the patient if done incorrectly. Thus, a person can be left without the possibility of a habitual existence. Even though many patients who decide to die to suffer from incurable diseases voluntarily, the doctor cannot assist them. In this case, the moral commandment that a person cannot take someone else’s life is violated (Clarke et al., 2021). Moreover, doctor-assisted suicide is wholly opposed to the definition of a profession aimed at helping people. The doctor is seen as a healer, while physician-assisted suicide does not seem to control and calculate the risks, which can be a threat to many patients.The dilemma lies in the Hippocratic oath given by all doctors, one of the points of which is not to harm. Thus, helping a patient with a death wish can be seen as a deliberate wish to injure the person. Moreover, it may reduce the level of trust between patients and medical staff since taking a life cannot be ethically justified. In addition, the religious view forbids doctors to help patients at the end of life, referring to the commandment not to kill a person. Furthermore, killing may be considered offensive due to society’s moral attitude. The patient’s pain can be alleviated with the help of available medicines, while the loss of life is an irreversible action.
of mortals’ protection, which is central both to “Iliad” and “Metamorphosis,” remains essential nowadays as well. Namely, a range of contemporary leaders appear to have tremendous amounts of power due to their political influence, their economic one, or a combination of both (Homer, 762 B. C.; Ovid, 8 B. C.). For instance, the disregard for human rights in countries such as China, where leaders attain the status of god-like creatures, can be seen as similar to the one in the “Iliad” and “Metamorphosis.” However, what makes “Metamorphosis” slightly less effective in this regard is the comedic manner in which it portrays the abuse of mortals. In turn, “Iliad,” being a more serious work, produces a much greater impact by condemning the violence of omnipotent gods toward humans, which is more in line with the current concept of power abuse. Nevertheless, both the “Iliad” and “Metamorphosis” carry an important message and a deep meaning. Providing an insight into power dynamics within Ancient Greek society, they also help recognize similar patterns in the modern community.
The project aims to explore the questions behind people’s sexual orientation identification and the reasons behind it. Some people consider sexuality a subject of choice; others argue that the environment cannot dictate a person what sex attracts them. The latter group proceeds with the argument that sexuality is determined biologically, making it an aspect of one’s identity, which should be protected by the government (Sheldon et al., 2017). To further explore people’s perspectives on the matter, the project’s topic can be phrased as the following research question: does the environment affect people’s sexual orientation?While exploring the subject of the research, the following dependant and independent variables related to the topic were identified with the help of the GSS database. The dependent variable is sexort, which stands for respondent’s sexual orientation. The question related to this variable is: which of the following best describes you? This variable was chosen due to the fact that it allows determining what environment has surrounded the respondent. The independent variable related to the topic of the project is sexbirth, which stands for the sex assigned at birth. The GSS question for this variable is: What sex were you assigned at birth (for example, on your birth certificate)? The sexbirth variable was chosen since it is necessary to identify respondents’ sexuality and homosexual individuals for the research. There is an essential correlation between the two variables that can facilitate the project’s research. People’s sex identification significantly affects their lives and experiences. For example, the environments surrounding a male and a female can differ critically. As a result, such differences in the environment’s impact can affect people’s identification with sexual orientation.
One of the main purposes of a leader of a business is to select the best course of action out of the available alternatives when it comes to the process of decision-making. Clearly enough, it is impossible without a thorough understanding of a company’s business environment. When it comes to entering the market with the goods for the purchasers’ consumption, the one theory that specialists often take to is the supply and demand theory. This theory is utilized to understand the customers’ buying behaviors and help managers strategize the product in the market in accordance with them. For instance, a lack of demand for the product signifies that supply needs to be shortened – and vice versa: when there is an increase of demand, it is reasonable to enhance supply of goods as well. Additionally, a supply and demand analysis helps in pricing: if the demand for the product is high, buyers are more likely to accept price increases an keep on purchasing it. With the low demand, however, prices should be sufficiently affordable; otherwise, the producer will suffer losses.There are various strategies to make the supply and demand model work to one’s advantage. Dayton cites an example of De Beers – a company specializing in creating diamond jewelry. Their vaults are filled with diamonds – but they manage to maintain high prices for gems by limiting supply. Thus, diamonds keep staying a rare commodity, for the acquisition of which as a status symbol purchasers willingly pay. Another organization using the supply and demand theory to their advantage is Zappo. Dayton states that the company’s primary idea of selling shoes online – that is, with no option of trying them on beforehand – did not seem like a good one. However, Zappo became a success story by having gained control over supply – their enormous assortment, excellent customer service, and a favorable return policy make buyers choose them time and time again. Finally, there is Apple – a renowned giant of the technology market. Their building of anticipation for the release of a service or a product is a manufacturing demand that makes purchasers feel like they are a part of something bigger than simply another gadget’s market entry. In conclusion, a supply and demand theory can definitely be used as a tool for navigating the market – one only has to search for appropriate ways to use it to their product’s advantage.
The influence of social networks is increasing, pushing traditional media to second place. In particular, Twitter platform has become an influential tool for obtaining current information and even conducting debates on various topics. However, tweets can also be different and may or not impact society. This paper examines the Australian politician Bill Shorten’s tweet concerning the National Disability Insurance Scheme (NDIS). Although the politician reports a joyful event in his message, he also expressed regrets about the current policy, limiting the NDIS activity.This tweet is meant to be both informative and grievance. At the same time, the author reports that the girl received assistance thanks to NDIS funding but also regrets that this was possible only after public coverage of the situation. As a result, Shorten deplores the current policy of the Australian government because of which NDIS has limited capacity to help people. While his tweet simultaneously has both negative and positive messages, it can have a positive impact. Criticism from an influential politician can draw attention to the problem and call on society and government to solve it.Several signs indicate the impact of the investigated tweet is. According to Casero-Ripollés (2020), activity, popularity, and authority are the main signs of influence. This post received 209 retweets, 50 comments, and 858 likes – such activity for a poorly discussed topic is quite a significant influence. However, the popularity of the issue is low, and in relation to the population of Australia, such indicators are small. Assessing authority, one can say that Shorten as a politician, is aware and concerned about the topic and has experience and knowledge to express an authoritative opinion. Thus, the tweet may be influential in discussing the activities of NDIS but not on the national scale.
SWOT AnalysisSWOT analysis plays a pivotal role in the strategic planning process for organizations operating in various industries. This framework allows for evaluating the company’s strengths, weaknesses, opportunities, and threats, which in turn provides foundations for establishing relevant strategic goals and developing a coherent business plan. Diversicare Healthcare Services, Inc. is a healthcare provider focusing on the field of post-acute care (Diversicare, 2020). The organization continuously provides high-quality medical services and therapies to its patients.Thesis StatementThis paper aims to conduct a SWOT analysis of Diversicare Healthcare, including its strengths, weaknesses, opportunities, and threats, in order to develop appropriate strategic goals for the company.Strengths  * A broad range of high-quality acute care services. As stated in the most recent annual report of Diversicare (2020), the company has a strong reputation as a provider of high-quality, cost-effective services due to its pursuit of excellence. The organization implements an evidence-based approach and a quality assurance system to provide patients with effective and safe treatment and therapy options.  * A total of 61 operating locations across eight states. As Diversicare (2020) reports, the “continuing operations consist of 61 nursing centers with 7,250 licensed skilled nursing beds … in Alabama, Indiana, Kansas, Mississippi, Missouri, Ohio, Tennessee, and Texas” (p. 2). Therefore, the organization addresses the needs of an expanded population base.  * Strong corporate culture. Diversicare emphasizes the importance of connectedness, compassion, trust, respect, and communication as core values shaping the workplace environment and interaction with patients (“A name you can trust,” n. d.). As a result, Diversicare’s
company culture is considered its distinguishing feature compared to other post-acute care providers in the United States.  * The loyalty of customers and employees. Diversicare is recognized for excellent experience by its customers and for its unique culture by its employees through respective 2020 awards (“A name you can trust,” n. d.). The medical staff is provided with training and tools for obtaining and enhancing necessary skills. Customer satisfaction is ensured through effective communication, support, and continuous improvement.Weaknesses  * Decreased revenue and high operating expenses due to the COVID-19 pandemic. According to Stulick (2021), Diversicare reported: “a net loss from continuing operations at -$2.9 million, or -43 cents per share in the third quarter” of 2020 (para. 1).  * Employee turnover rate due to overwork. One of the major challenges the organization faces is the problem of retaining qualified medical staff in the context of high demand and longer or irregular hours (Diversicare, 2020). The pandemic and competition aggravate increased workload and the associated employee shortage.  * Lack of communication between employees and management. Diversicare has a problem with ensuring effective internal communication among its staff, which results in weak leadership (Diversicare, 2020).  * A limited supply of licensed skilled nursing center beds. As Diversicare (2020) indicates in the annual report, “high construction costs … and start-up expenses also act to restrict growth in the supply for such centers” (p. 6).Opportunities  * Increasing the number of nursing centers. Diversicare (2020) can “acquire and lease new centers, focusing primarily on opportunities
IntroductionDiversicare Medical Care (formerly Advocat) offers a variety of health and living services to the elderly through care facilities and assisted-living facilities, most of which are situated in the southern and southwestern United States. This company is a health center that specializes in post-acute care. It was established in 1994 on a culture of passionate service. Recollection care, short-term restoration care, protracted care, and medical treatment are among the services provided. It is located in Brentwood, Tennessee, and its mission is to better the lives of all of its caregivers by surpassing their expectations and delivering exceptional health care services. Integrity, sympathy, greatness, teamwork, and stewardship are its core values. It employs over 6,800 people in more than 60 separate areas across nine states (Diversicare, n.d.).Workers’ pensions include life insurance, a 401k plan with a match, continuing professional education, short break, holiday, sick time prepayments, career path intending short and long-term disability insurance, and healthcare, dental, and aspiration plans (Diversicare, n.d.). This essay will analyze the swot analysis, financial analysis and budget, strategy, implementation, and strategic evaluation respectively of Diversicare healthcare. The strategic initiative is to expand this company’s resources by increasing funding and leveraging opportunities to diversify the services provided with high professionalism and ethics.Swot AnalysisStrengthsDiversicare Primary care has a solid reputation for providing its clients with high-quality services. Furthermore, medical care ensures the long-term loyalty of both Staff and clients. There is a professional and competent bi-cultural team bi-lingual and, as well as receptive Staff eager to improve their skills. Nonetheless, the Ethnic Society
Council Queensland’s (ECCQ) Public Compassionate Institute (PBI) Co-payment Gift Recipient (DGR) strives to enhance corporate practices and essential facilities.WeaknessesOne of Diversicare’s weaknesses is a lack of technical skills and abilities among its Staff. The company’s aging workforce is also a drawback to growth. What is more, a proportion of skilled colleagues are nearing the end of their careers. Two government-funded programs account for 85 percent of the corporation’s total revenue (Diversicare, 2021). As a result, Diversicare healthcare faces another challenge due to the lack of a long-term plan for panel members and senior leaders. As an ECCQ division, this company lacks legal status, which presents a threat to the institution. Subsequently, Diversicare’s structure has too many implementers for the present level of activity/business, which is a problem for healthcare.OpportunitiesThe clamor for Aged Care CALD Sector has increased, particularly for high-level care services like EACH, EACH-D, and Transition Care. In addition, existing User Pay Services are being expanded, as is the use of advanced technologies to ensure the quality-of-service delivery, especially with their in-home facilities. There are also plans to expand geographic reach to the Gold Coast and principal cities and CALD regions in Queensland (Stapleton et al., 2018). Demographic trends show that an increasing number of CALD working-age people are relocating to Queensland. Existing HACC and CACPS operations can be expanded, and proposals for capital and economic expansion funding can be developed for submission to the government.ThreatsOne of the risks to Diversicare healthcare is the conflict problems federal political environment. Significant competition from domestically and internationally
for-profit and non-profit institutions is also a potential danger now and in the future. The other hazard is sector consolidation through mergers, amalgamations, and takeovers. Constant public influence on the ECCQ – the industry’s peak body – investigating the causes for delivering aged care and public support facilities is also a potential danger to healthcare. Eventually, the technical skills, training, and knowledge necessary to provide future aged care services pose a serious risk.Financial Analysis and BudgetDiversicare has indeed been capable of providing post-acute and donor care worldwide. However, their client traffic has increased, even more, forcing them to place patients on a standby list until space becomes available. After financial analysis, more beds are proposed to be opened to accept more clients. This healthcare aims to provide nursing, home healthcare, and interpersonal services to patients and residents.Furthermore, the firm’s nursing centers provide a variety of services, including nutritional support services and comprehensive rehabilitation services.The corporation of Diversicare owns more than 75 healthcare and assisted-living facilities, totaling approximately 8,500 beds (Ginthotavidana & Waidyasekara, 2021). The medical Centre is planning to increase the number of beds to accommodate more clients. Diversicare, which concentrates on rural areas, provides a variety of health care services, such as residential care, leisure activity therapy, welfare care, and clinical, cardiovascular, rehabilitative, and other customized ancillary services. Table 1 shows the simple budget for the strategic initiative.Table 1. Budget for Strategic Initiative.Budget Items

The total net income of the planned hospital has been $356210. Based on the projected balance sheet, the hospital will acquire $1500000 debt and $500000 equity to fund the current assets and purchase the land and equipment for the hospital to be constructed. Table 2 shows the ratio of assets and liabilities, considering the adopted strategy. It should be noted that the current revenue current ratio will be close
to one, which demonstrates the potential for growth in the company’s liquidity and relevancy.Table 2. Financial Statement.Expenses             Income        2000000 $            2143790 $     Current Liabilities  Current Assets1000000 $            856210 $      Total Liabilities    Total Assets  3000000 $            3000000 $     StrategyStrategic planning assists in assessing an institution by capturing its mission, aspiration, and virtues to achieve long goals and use relevant plans to reach them. A perfect corporate strategy is critical to a firm’s progress and profitability because it offers a new picture of how to reply to various advantages and threats faced by employees and the management. It provides an idea of the endeavors to be made and the routes to be taken by concentrating on the aims and priorities. Analyzing the strategic plan reveals the strengths as well as the regions that need to be enhanced.Countless specific goals must be established to obtain more beds. One target is to schedule the expansion or construction of a new facility with an additional 78 beds to allow more patients to be cared for. Cash flow has to be analyzed the resources required to meet the hospital goals in a
reasonable amount of time. Once the budgetary funds are endorsed, a location has to be looked near the agency or the university to build the expanded facility. Another goal will be to find more healthcare workers to care for the extended facility. Diversicare will be one lot closer to providing care to more service users once all the goals are met. With all these supplementary beds, Diversicare will reduce their wait time and cure more clients.This significant development will provide the most job positions for healthcare professionals in the city and resources for the company. A valid contract is required to ensure interactions with all sides involved in procuring a new location for the new beds. Having everybody in the same section can help this operation run smoothly and efficiently, allowing the beds to be built in a reasonable amount of time. The hospital employs geographic segmentation to ensure that its patients receive accessible services, for example, treating and researching a wide range of diseases to provide better care to all patients. The funding of Diversicare is accounted for by American Lebanese Syrian Charities, which ensures that there are available funds to help the organization perform its duties (Reinsberg et al., 2017). The organization makes this possible through donations organized by St. Jude throughout the year.Implementation ScheduleTable 3. Phase Schedule.Phase 1           Phase2

First, the issue should be addressed at the level of senior management on providing more beds. The second step is to create a tactical plan and goals for modern growth. Third, talk to the accounting department about the financial plan for the new beds that will be installed. The fourth step is to consult with Human Resources or hire new medical personnel. Then, the next step is to plan for recent changes
the patients feel at ease should be identified and implemented. As a result, to implement an effective initiative, team members must be willing to modify and accomplish their capability to make it a successful strategy. The prompt action and endorsement of all those responsible can aid in assessing the tactic and deciding on the necessary changes in the field.ConclusionThis business strategy serves as a sound learning management system for other facilities to begin charging for services. Every organization’s success is determined by how well the business model is aligned with the facility’s strategic long- and short-term goals. It demonstrates that there were many unfulfilled potential corporate areas in the medical sector that, if properly explored, would aid in improving care quality. The hospital’s long-term and short-term strategies will guarantee a commitment to self to identify new strengths and opportunities to reduce its weaknesses and address threats.
regulations. From the side of conspiracy law, it is possible to assume that the agreement of Dr. W is equal to the participation in the crime. As she is aware of the crime and did not report it but helped in its realization, the court’s decision can be not in her favor. From the point of view of human rights, prostitution is illegal in the US. Even more, if the minors are employed in the firm, the case falls under the mandatory reported law (Todres, 2016). Ethical considerations here also imply helping a child by breaching confidentiality.To conclude, the decision in the case of an encounter with human trafficking should be equivocal. By facilitating the activity of an enterprise engaged with human trafficking, a physician is partly responsible for the crimes and exploitation of women and children. Therefore, following the legal frameworks and ethical considerations, such cases should be reported.
used until the late 1970s or early 1980s (Vaughn, 2019). Traditional ethics, feminists speculated, was more thoroughly male-biased and required more radical reconsideration.Moreover, feminism is continuously engaged in ethical thought and discussion. According to Vaughn (2019), feminism is primarily a normative viewpoint, and feminists themselves regularly challenge its meaning. Lack of care for women’s interests, disregard for women’s concerns, rejection of women’s moral agency, devaluation of feminine ideals, and depreciation of women’s experience are all manifestations of feminist obstacles. Putting women’s interests first, considering women as ethical experts or authorities, exchanging male for female values, or extrapolating directly from women’s moral experience are all illustrations of how feminist ethics has been stereotyped and viewed. Essentially, these stereotypes are widespread and inaccurate; feminist ethics is significantly more extensive and more open than the misinterpretations suggest. To summarize, modern feminists are experimenting with new methods of thinking about moral themes that are attentive to their specific particularity and inherent shared worth, such as shared humanity, fairness, and impartiality.
The concepts of domestic violence and abuse refer to psychologically or physically aggressive behavior of one family member towards another. This aggression could take the form of beating, rape, screaming, and humiliation. Unfortunately, in the modern world, these are common phenomena. According to statics provided by Huecker et al. (2021), 10 million Americans per year suffer from violence and abuse. The victims of domestic violence and abuse feel depressed and helpless, and their self-esteem is also extremely low.Fear of the aggressor might force a victim to keep calm about the experience of being abused. Nonetheless, there are signs via which a provider could suspect domestic violence, child abuse, or elder abuse. If a woman arrives at the emergency room with bruises or fractures that do not as she slipped on the wet floor, a nurse could suspect that her partner beats her. In addition to that, victims are highly likely to be depressed and anxious even though they might try to hide these emotions (Lloyd, 2018). A provider has a reason to be concerned with child abuse if a young patient is underweighted without objective reason and is afraid of other adults. In addition to that, a child might get severely scared with a loud sound or sudden movement.As for older adults, a nurse could suspect abuse if they have bruises, broken glasses, or walking stick, show signs of depression, and fails to take medications properly. Another warning sign is the refusal of a caregiver to leave an older person alone with a nurse. Undoubtedly, caregivers might not be willing to leave in some cases because they worry about missing information on an older adults health. However, a strict refusal to follow the requests of the medical staff and negotiate is a bad sign.In every health facility, a nurse who notices the signs of abuse and domestic violence must report them to the relevant authorities. More precisely, in the case of child abuse, medical staff contacts social services via hotlines or a written statement. The fact of elder abuse should be reported to the agencies on adult protective services. Finally, a nurse should inform the local law enforcement of the case of domestic violence. Still, before informing the related agencies, a nurse should discuss the case with a physician or a nurse practitioner and exam the patient without the potential abuser in the room.
OverviewIn this research paper, drug addiction will be analyzed as the only type of personal addiction to facilitate the analysis process and give consistent study-level treatment recommendations. Firstly, many scientists define the term drug addiction differently. On the one hand, the term’ drug addiction is specifically defined by NIDA (1) as “characterized by intense and, at times, uncontrollable drug craving, along with compulsive drug seeking and use that persist even in the face of devastating consequences (2020). On the other hand, Liu and Li (1823) define drug addiction as “a complex disorder that involves complicated neural mechanisms and psychological processes; this mental disorder is treatable and may be curable by therapies such as gene modulation in the future” (2018). As a result, one may observe scientists defining the term from different scientific perspectives by emphasizing some of the facets of drug addiction disease. Statistically, the most prevailed drug usage was observed for cannabis (3,8%) among people from 15 to 64 years old, amphetamines (0,77%), opioids (0,37%), and cocaine (0,35%) (Peacock et al., 1909). Based on this information, it is crucial to admit that drug addiction is a widespread and complex disease that might influence different aspects of individuals’ functioning possibilities.More specifically, drug dependence is an intellectual disease powerfully affected by surroundings and psychosocial factors. The psychosocial environments at which point it has grown provoke numerous debates around the country (Cheron & Kerchove D’Exaerde, 2021). Exposure to analyzed suggestions can be a principal issue in precipitating drug cravings and relapses. Even afterward a successful cure, they should
be minimized accordingly. As with many other mental disorders, drug inclination is deeply influenced by fervor, knowledge, and cognition (Cheron & Kerchove D’Exaerde, 2021). Besides medical interferences, behavioral actions are more promising for acting drug addiction. To some extent, non-pharmacological situations grant permission and have greater benefits by way of their limited aftereffects.Despite the numerous reasons for obtaining drug addiction after drug abuse, there are no specific factors that can conclude if one will enhance compulsive to rugs. Moreover, a blend of determinants influences risk for inclination (Kumar et al., 2019). Changes in the intelligence that support material and emotional reliance on amazing essences are the direct cause of dependence, but those changes do not happen accidentally. As a result, the individual might have a certain factor of influence that becomes dangerous in case of direct contact. For instance, this might be a close person with strictly negative exposure to the cured individual.When it comes to the main differences between drug addiction and other addiction types, it is critical to understand that they have nearly the same symptoms and short-term effects on the brain but significantly differ in the long-term perspective. More specifically, Lindesmith (4) states that “While alcohol is addicting in approximately, the same sense that heroin is, it will also be referred to only incidentally” (2017). Consequently, cannabis is unlike heroin or morphine addiction, and alcohol is not covered by anti-narcotic legislation, but it shares many features with opiate addiction.As a result, drug addiction campaigns might unintentionally be not focused on lowering the rate
of addicted people in the US. Instead, the substance-addicted become excluded from society, which creates a distinct class of people that are united by the same situation (Cheron & Kerchove D’Exaerde, 2021). Some theoretical applications also provide evidence that drug addiction is usually supported by overall depression, while in other addiction types, such as alcohol or sexual addiction, individuals activate themselves, which may even have some dangerous consequences (Zou et al., 2017). The whole relocation of recreation affecting the mind so as to produce vivid visions entities from people is the pair impractical and hopeless. There has never in record existed a drug-free association, and it is unlikely that skilled always will be individual. In spite of this reality, law enforcement condemning the unenviable task of completing activity restraining relating to sports drug-use policies that stress frugality.Another important aspect of drug addiction treatment is the correct medication process. In fact, medication might be considered a regular vaccination since it is focused on giving a small dose of the same drug that causes addiction, but in medically calculated amounts so that the body might adapt to the new regime of this drug consumption. For instance, famous psychologist Freud believed that cocaine would manage to help his friend to escape significant addiction to morphine. This attempt was abandoned, and eventually, von Fleischl-Marxov withered from cocaine addiction (Loose, 2018). However, nowadays, most medical professionals in the US are able to correctly calculate the needed dose for a proper medication so that the possibility of receiving the additional drug addiction
is extremely low.Finally, when it comes to treatment possibilities, drug addiction curing depends on the type and scope of the patient’s problems and needs. Research signifies that most compulsive things need not completely three months of treatment to stop their dependence on the illegal substance considerably and that best choice consequences accompany longer durations of the situation (NIDA, 2020). Recovery from drug cravings is an unending process and repeatedly requires diversified adventures of cases. As with additional incessant sicknesses, relapses to dependence on illegal substances can occur and concede the possibility signal a need for the situation expected to be reinstated or regulated. In fact, treatment changes consistently on the type of drug and the traits of the subjects (NIDA, 2020). Matching situation backgrounds, interventions, and aids to an individual’s particular questions and needs detracts from welcoming or her best benefit in responding to beneficial functioning ancestral, institution, and society.Recovery PlanLogisticsIn the case of group consultation, all the patients will pass both general and specialized treatment processes depending on their physical and psychological health conditions. As one of the main psychological remedies, a group would exercise behavioral therapies that would be prescribed during the first consultation. In fact, treatments with a behavioral focus may address a patient’s motivation to change, provide encouragement for abstinence, enhance skills to resist drug abuse, replace drug-using activities with more constructive and rewarding activities, and improve interpersonal relationships (NIDA, 2020). Nevertheless, patients should primarily receive a medical treatment plan. More specifically, they will receive an individualized list of special drugs that
would help to cure the addiction effects. Gradually, combined with constant help from consultants, patients will disclose the opportunity for psychologists to cure the addiction from a mental health perspective entirely. Some mental diseases might be interconnected with drug addiction. Consequently, medical professionals should be vigilant with patient interaction dynamics and psychological exposure to the treatment process. Finally, participating in peer support programs during and after treatment can assist in maintaining abstinence.When it comes to the individual consulting process, the patient should have a determined medical professional who has a specialization in drug addiction treatment. Primarily, the patient would attend nearly three general consultations where a medical professional would define the key characteristics of actual addiction (Grenfell & Hart, 2018). After that, a person would certainly follow a prescribed medical course to cure substance addiction physically. Simultaneously, the patient should receive regular medication sessions. More specifically, medications are the main aspect of treatment for many cases, particularly when combined with accompanying advising and different behavioral healings. For example, methadone, buprenorphine, and naltrexone (containing a new long-acting expression) are effective in meal things addicted to dope or added opioids maintain their lives and reduce their illegal dependence on a banned substance (NIDA, 2020). Acamprosate, disulfiram, and naltrexone are drugs approved for curing alcohol abuse. For persons compulsive to nicotine, a nicotine substitute output or oral pill is.Since drug addiction and abuse are considered mental disorders, and they coexist with different mental diseases, many patients who represent multi-disease should be correctly evaluated for the existence of parallel issues.
The article in question addresses the correlation between the duration of a vowel and the type of focus or stress. De Jong and Zawaydeh (2002) address this phonetic issue on the basis of the Arabic language, attempting to observe a potential effect of quantity and voicing duration on the vowel duration and describe this influence. The authors refer to the concept of hyperarticulation that is used to describe transformations in speech style condition by an intention to realize stressed material by more intense articulatory activity. Similar effects have been described by them in the English language, which provided a solid foundation for this subsequent investigation into the patterns of Arabic. De Jong and Zawaydeh (2002) equally rely on prior observations, suggesting a speaker’s ability to create specific phonological contrasts through hyperarticulation to attract the listener’s attention to a specific segment. Hence, the article in question elaborates on a phonetic phenomenon that has been at the center of academic research for some time.This piece of research aims to explore the relationship between stress, focus, and segmental contrast, resulting in modified vowel durations. At the same time, De Jong and Zawaydeh (2002) acknowledge the fact that the dynamic characteristics of durational lengthening are not universal. The authors refer to a number of previous studies that confirm this information, elaborating that hyperarticulation is more commonly observed within the final portion of a vowel. Nevertheless, most of these previous pieces of research are centered around the trends of the English language. De Jong and Zawaydeh (2002) note that Arabic is
recorder with a portable cassette recorder and later analyzed with the use of SoundScope.The findings of the article support the initially advanced hypothesis of the theorized effect of stress, lexical focus, and segmental focus on the durations of vowels. First of all, the findings reveal a 20 ms increase of stressed syllable duration as compared to their unstressed counterparts on average. On the other hand, focus did not yield an observable effect in this regard, not interacting with either quantity or voicing. Second, the effect of quantity was even more considerable with an average of 70 ms of difference between long and short vowels.From one perspective, the article provides accurate research data that relies on prior findings in this regard. The emphasis on Arabic is another strength of this study, as it takes the subject matter into a new direction. The course of research is thoroughly document, which supports the validity of the findings, which, however, are only applicable to the discussed setting. The relatively small sample of four participants does not allow for generalized conclusions regarding the entirety of the dialect. Furthermore, the results may be different in the case of other Arabic dialects, which limits the contribution of the findings to the overall understanding of this language’s patterns.
Charles Schwab is a for-profit Corporation whose main business is savings and loans. The company provides banking and asset management services, and financial advisory. It has several subsidiaries – Charles Schwab & Co., Inc., Charles Schwab Investment Management, Inc., TD Ameritrade, Inc., and TD Ameritrade Clearing, Inc., which are all limited liability companies (“The Charles Schwab Corporation,” 2021). This paper aims to analyze the form of business in Charles Schwab Corporation (CSC).Charles Schwab is a corporation, which is a form of business with some distinctive features. Firstly, its officers are agents, unlike its directors and shareholders, which means that the latter are not involved in the company’s current strategic, managerial and other business decisions (“Corporation,” 2022). Secondly, the corporation is managed by the board of directors who have the right to appoint the officers. This approach creates a balance of managerial forces, since CEOs and CFOs are directly involved in the work processes, and the board of directors, in extreme cases, has the right to dismiss them by voting.In the corporation, shareholders are free to transfer ownership, which means that in critical situations such as bankruptcy, the corporation can be sold to another owner. This outcome is possible because the corporation is an organization that creates an opportunity for investors to profit by investing, unlike an LLC (“Forming a corporation,” 2022). Finally, in corporations, the income is taxed twice: the first time at the corporate level, and a second time if dividends are distributed to shareholders.Thus, the form of business in Charles Schwab Corporation was analyzed. The CSC is a corporation with several subsidiaries and conducts business following the requirements for a corporation form of organization. A distinctive feature of corporations is the board of directors, which has an indirect influence on daily decision-making. Still, in critical cases, it can appoint new officers to manage the company. Corporations can also transfer property rights in the event of bankruptcy or other cases.
AbstractThis report starts with stating and discussing the stakeholders in the given case study, the shareholders, Management, and employees, to mention a few. It will also focus on the directions given to Zoe, who is in charge of the organization’s accounting books, to adjust some entries in the book. This report states that those actions by Zoe are not only unethical but also illegal. It further proceeds to point out scenarios where the adjustment of figures in the accounting books can be ethical and legal. The conclusion of this report points out who can quickly discover the adjustment on the accounting books, which is the organization’s auditor.Information Systems ReportA stakeholder is a person in a business entity or an organization who has an interest in the proceeding of the organization. Stakeholders are directly or indirectly involved in the organization, either running or benefiting from its activities. In the given case study, the stakeholders are the organization’s shareholders, who are the people who have invested their money in the organization and stand to benefit from the organization in terms of dividends due to the sales made by the organization in a year. In our case study, the shareholders will be affected by a decision to change the organization’s profitability since the change directly affects the company’s stock prices. A drop or a rise in stock prices will affect the shareholders directly as their dividends will rise or fall, respectively.The Management of the organization in our case study is also a part of the stakeholders as they are
involved in the decision-making of matters concerning the day-to-day running of the organization. The Management also makes account-related decisions which include adjustments in the accounting books. Finally, secondary stakeholders in the organization are the employees; their daily work enables the company to run smoothly and achieve its goals and expectations. The vendors in this organization are parties in the supply chain that avail goods and services to the final consumers and companies. A vendor is a person or organization that makes the goods available to the consumers and not necessarily the manufacturer. The last category of stakeholders is the lenders. They are individuals or groups, both public and private, who makes funds available to persons or business with the sole expectation that the money will be repaid with interest hence making a profit through it.In our case study, the president requests Zoe Baas, the controller of the company accounting books, to accrue every possible revenue. To forego as many expenses as possible and preserve the current year’s revenues so that the following year can easily absorb the costs foregone in the current year. In this scenario, the presidents’ requests go against prudent accounting policies. They can be seen as an attempt by the Management to window dress by manipulating the organization’s accounting books entry and posting better profit numbers than the actual ones (Weygandt et al., 2018). Concerning accounting policies, this action is unethical, as well as the acts by Zoe to date the entries in the accounting books to December 31 of the previous year
are legal (Weygandt et al., 2018). Another example of an unethical case is when a customer pays for goods in advance and will be shipped the following year, recording such sales as accrued.Another issue from the case study where the manager asks Zoe to defer expenses and accrue revenues is that those actions can be illegal. In this case study, Zoe can still be legal if the deferring of the company’s costs and accruing of the company’s revenues are done as provided in the accounting policies and following the GAAP and IFRS framework. It is also legal only when Zoe does not violate federal and IRS regulations (Weygandt et al., 2018). In any case, if those adjustments in the accounting books violate these regulations, they will be illegal. In our case study, the adjustments the manager instructed Zoe to make in the accounting books do not follow these regulations; hence they will be unlawful.
stock a variety of fashionable clothes, they do not capture the clients’ personality and individual needs because the designs are premade. Most stores such as Zara and H&M invest significant funds into identifying the unique needs of their clients. However, their reach in identifying these needs is not yet global, and this implies that a significant section of the target market buys what is available. Therefore, bridging the gap between what the clients want from their preferred clothes stores and what the stores are offering is crucial in promoting customer satisfaction.Our project, Be-Unique , intends to solve this problem by leveraging technology to bring the services closer to the clients. The purpose of the project is to provide a highly integrative platform through which customers can digitally access their favorite clothing stores. The platform intends to revolutionize the fashion industry by offering clients an opportunity to present their unique designs for customization. Online clothes from stores such as Zara and H&M are made using standard sizes that may not fit all body sizes within the standard measurements. Our online stores’ mandate is to ensure that clients have easy access to thigh-quality fashionable items that can be customized to fit their unique sizes. Therefore, our mandate will include offering the clients an opportunity to submit their sizes to our platform, whereby their clothes can be tailor-made to fit their unique sizes. Our highly skilled team will be on standby to take clients’ measurements and submit them to the famous clothes stores for customization.
Eat Lancet recommendations are developed to integrate healthy eating habits with the practices that minimize the harm to the planet Earth resulting from some foods’ manufacturing or farming approaches. The goal is to ensure that the biodiversity of the planet is preserved while people continue to eat delicious and healthy foods. This paper will examine Lancet’s EAT recommendations, compare this diet to personal eating habits, and discuss whether modifications can be made.My current diet is different from the EAT recommendations provided by Lancet.Firstly, my diet mostly consists of prepackaged or takeout foods, although I add fruits to my daily food intake. However, I do not consume a lot of vegetables, nuts, and legumes, as recommended in the EAT article. Also, EAT recommendations emphasize the need to limit the consumption of red meat and dairy products, which I typically consume as well (“EAT-Lancet Commission Brief for Everyone”). I am accustomed to having dairy products, especially milk and yogurt, on a daily, and based on the EAT recommendations, and I should limit this consumption to smaller portions.It would be difficult to modify my diet to match the EAT-Lancet recommendations. Mainly, this is because I would need to change my eating habits, meaning I would need to get used to eating and shopping for foods that are different from what I consume daily. Additionally, with the EAT diet, many of the products need to be cooked or prepared; for example, vegetables taste better if they are in a salad, which would require more time for preparation. Currently, I do
my shopping habits since I often tend to buy too many fresh products that I do not eat before they perish, and thus I have to throw these away. According to Lancet, with food, “the amounts wasted or lost have major impacts on human health and environmental sustainability.” Hence, I need to pay more attention to the way I shop for fresh produce to minimize waste, which I can achieve by shopping more often but buying less produce to ensure that perishable items are eaten in time.Moreover, this article emphasizes the impact of food on one’s health, especially due to the increasing cases of obesity in developed states. In parallel to this, many people, and children, in particular, experience acute hunger on a daily basis (Lancet). This terrific contrast prompts me to change my eating habits and ensure that I only buy the foods I can consume to ensure that there is no waste and harm to the environment. In general, this article has prompted me to rethink my eating habits and my approach to food consumption and to make small modifications that will be helpful both for my health and for the well-being of the environment. In summary, my current diet is very different from the recommendations provided by Lancet, and there are several challenges linked to modifying it to suit these recommendations.
IntroductionWith the contemporary global concerns about sustainable development, the issues of food waste and environmental protection have become more visible and better tackled. With prevalent problems of insufficient nutrition and food insecurity due to the disruption of conventional food consumption traditions, sustainable eating is threatened (Huambachano, 2019). Indeed, human eating habits and the overall culture of food consumption are subject to analysis to identify patterns that might yield an impact (positive or negative) on the environment from both short- and long-term perspectives. Daily practices of consuming food, cooking, grocery shopping, and managing leftovers and waste comprise the whole behavior of individuals in relation to food. They are commonly associated with the environmental worldview that prevails in a person’s overall outlook. Thus, it is relevant to revise and alter the environmental worldview to revise harmful or unsustainable eating habits by engaging in spiritual practices for better sustainable outcomes. This paper presents a reflective analysis of the author’s eating habit-informed environmental worldview, the health of their connection with nature, and probable spiritual practices to improve sustainable food consumption.Environmental Worldview AnalysisThe analysis of one’s environmental worldview should be based on the observation of practices and behaviors rather than assessed theoretically. In such a manner, the identification of a particular paradigm is more objective and realistic. For that matter, the basis for this analysis is the record of a seven-day eating habit journal that I have completed for the purposes of this project. The information recorder in the food habit spreadsheet allows for categorizing my environmental worldview as stewardship. This
conclusion is validated by the limited waste I produce after each meal, which helps protect the environment from pollution and eliminates the threat of overproduction in the long-term perspective within food systems. Indeed, most days, I did not produce any waste, while on other days, no edible food was thrown away apart from some fries. Moreover, the stewardship environmental worldview entails caring for the planet by managing the consumption of resources. In this regard, my combining of occasional home-cooked meals with ordered food contributes to the balanced consumption of food.In order to conduct a proper analysis of the environmental worldview based on my food consumption patterns, it is relevant to review my attitude from three core perspectives, namely philosophy, religion, and ethics. Within the philosophical continuum, my records of eating habits indicate that I am more inclined to materialistic philosophy. In particular, the review of the food habit worksheet demonstrates that the majority of my meals are taken when I am alone, with occasionally shared dinners with my family. Moreover, I often order food from fast-food restaurants to obtain food quickly and to my liking without putting in much effort. I do not spend too much money on meals, which validates my materialistic motivation toward food consumption.When tackled from the point of view of religion, my eating habits indicate my alignment with pantheism, which implies the unity of the world and God. As evidenced by my food consumption patterns and the activities associated with them, I do not differentiate between the external world and God. I
do not actively apply religious consideration to the validation of my food habits. However, when eating, I perceive this time-spending as a spiritual practice of connecting my body with the world. From the perspective of ethics, I most closely relate to anthropocentrism. I limit my worries about buying groceries and cooking food or selecting food that is guaranteed to be sustainably produced. Instead, I choose easily accessible food items to satisfy my immediate needs. In addition, I engage in parallel activities, such as watching TV, responding to emails, playing on the phone, and others while eating, which indicates my prioritization of my feelings and satisfaction of my needs.Evaluation of the Relation to NatureAs my food habits imply, my relationship with nature is characterized by distancing and insufficient concern. In the majority of my meal records, I do not know where the food comes from, where the ingredients for the meals were produced, or what the production methods are. I am not concerned with these issues when I make my daily food choices. The information that I obtain about some of the food items on my menu comes primarily from the official websites of the companies from which I order. It might not be objective and does not provide any indication of the impact of my food choice on nature. Moreover, I am more concerned with the diversity of my diet, which is evident from the different choices I make, although within the limited range of cuisines. Thus, the environmental footprint of my eating habits is not
a priority for me on a daily basis.However, the identified stewardship environmental worldview encourages me to pay more attention to the sustainable use of natural resources when consuming food. In particular, the stewardship environmental worldview implies integrating the knowledge about the consequences of particular production methods for the planet and the reduction of harm through habit improvement. This approach allows for shifting the priority from an egocentric attitude toward eating habits to a more nature-centered one. In such a manner, the choice of places to eat and the items on the menu (or ingredients for home-cooked meals) should be aligned with the maximum benefit for humans and minimum harm to the planet.Spiritual Eating-Related Practices for Healthier Relationship with NatureFirstly, one of the spiritual practices related to my eating habits might be the initiation of family cooking evenings. There is much information online and on social media on cooking and promoting a healthy and nutritious diet with sustainable food management (Choudhary et al., 2019). Spending time on cooking will allow my family and me to connect, learn, and appreciate the nutritious food cooked ourselves. Moreover, I will have a chance to teach children about sustainable food consumption, thus making my contribution to the longevity of future generations. When selecting recipes and ingredients, I will be aware of the natural resources that are used to produce them and evaluate the threat to the planet. In such a manner, I will unite with nature and raise awareness about ingredients, their origin, nutrients, and health benefits. Moreover, this practice will
The prioritization of organic food will be a significant contribution to sustainable food consumption with potential benefits in the long-term perspective of the planet and nature. I will apply rational thinking and informed decision-making when making food choices to make sure that the products I buy and consume are of zero harm to nature. Such a practice will promote sustainable consumption, support organic farming, and eliminate the harm of non-sustainable production in the long run.ConclusionIn summation, the presented discussion was aimed at analyzing my environmental worldview, its implications for my relation to nature, and the generation of some spiritual practices to improve it. Overall, based on the worksheet records of my eating habits, it was determined that I most certainly align with the stewardship environmental worldview. This worldview allows for a certain degree of unawareness about sustainability issues with limited harm to nature. The limited waste I produce, partial concern about the place and practices of ingredient production I exhibit, and my use of both home-cooked and ordered food validate the selection of the environmental worldview. Within this perspective, my relations with nature are inconsistent and characterized by limited knowledge and limited contribution to environmental protection and sustainability issues despite the lack of harm to nature on my side. To improve my relationship with nature, I will use such spiritual practices as family cooking evenings, transitioning to a vegetarian diet, and buying from farmers with obtaining information about sustainable production methods.
The emergence of new infectious diseases such as the Ebola virus has always put pressure on the health care systems resulting in high fatality rates. This disease is contagious and whose transmission depends on the interaction between the human host and an agent (CDC, 2021). This virus is classified in the filioviridae family and is responsible for destroying the blood clotting cells and weakening the immune system when someone is infected. Ebola was a contagious epidemic that affected many nations, including the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC), Sierra Leone, Gabon, and Italy (CDC, 2021). Therefore, Ebola’s pathophysiology, its negative impact on the community and remediation are elaborated.Analysis of the Ebola Virus DiseaseEbola is a deadly disease that exhibits symptoms such as fever, body aches, diarrhea, external and internal bleeding. The infection is transmissible through direct contact with body fluids such as saliva, sweat, and blood. The virus was traced in the Ebola River in DRC after natives consumed the African fruit bat, which was identified as a reservoir for the virus (CDC, 2021). Considering the fact that the disease is contagious, it spread rapidly to other nations in that year, such as England and later on to Cote D’Ivoire, Senegal, Mali and Nigeria. This data indicates that this outbreak was a global pandemic that put pressure on the health system.Various epidemiological and risk factors contributed to the spread of this virus. Among them was a lack of preparedness to counter an emergency and public health literacy on the best preventative measures. When Ebola hit the DRC,
the country was underdeveloped and lacked the specialized equipment and infrastructure to contain the spread of infection (CDC, 2021). For instance, the traditional prevention method such as holistic care was practiced, making the tracing process impossible. For example, during the initial outbreak of the virus, nurses in one of the hospitals known as Yambuku mission hospital reused needles when the numbers of infected people kept surging due to a lack of equipment to contain its spread (CDC, 2021). Additionally, the treatment, management and evidence-based interventions to maintain safety were unknown.Public health literacy was also a significant challenge considering that citizens did not know the transmission channels and were overly exposed to the transmitters. For example, even after the fatality rate increased, people still hunted for wild meat for consumption and fulfilled cultural ceremonies and rituals (CDC, 2021). This interaction still exposed them to the infection resulting in more deaths and infections. In addition, cultural practices such as burials exposed the people to the virus since many bathed their dead by hand and dressed them for burial without putting on protective clothes (CDC, 2021). The international health organizations quickly disregarded such practices, but the new measures were not observed.Ebola virus disease’s transmission route was the African fruit bat which carried the host, and when consumed, it caused the infection. Another transmission channel was the dead infected animal corpse which exposed the people to the virus when they came into contact with secretions, body fluids, and organs (CDC, 2021). Humans also transmitted the disease through direct contact with
items that will become an essential part of the narrative. For example, one can see the ringing phone before it is picked up. Moreover, the show uses rapid editing with close-ups and the use of objects that identify characters – guns, money, and other items that show one’s motives or their identifying trait.The characters’ close-ups are dynamic, often using dolly shots to slowly expose the background or move with the character. This way, the camera does not stop as long as the characters move or the whole room is exposed. When they stop, the editing is as rapid as the conversation between people. In monologues, the dolly is used again to keep the tension as the series requires a serious tone in many scenes dealing with life-or-death scenarios. Notably, the character in a close-up is rarely placed in the center of the screen. The shot is divided into thirds vertically – and the characters stay in the first or third part.Hand-held shots are also used, and they are consistent with scenes where characters feel insecure, aggressive, scared, or exposed. Moreover, when the characters are walking, the camera moves at the same speed. The change between steady dolly movements and hand-held “shaky” shots is needed to juxtapose moments focused on action and interpersonal drama. Moreover, tension is the primary source of emotion, and the editing keeps enough suspense by using close-ups of characters rather than an overview of the whole room.
Electric cars have only recently begun to compete with the internal combustion engine, but they have been actively used by drivers for more than a century. These cars were especially popular at the turn of the 20th century but lost their popularity when Ford’s moving assembly line increased the availability of passenger cars (Simpson 2021). The use of electric vehicles has several advantages, including their environmental friendliness, service cost, and interesting history of the emergence of exciting technology.The structure of an electric car is not inferior to ordinary passenger cars and may even be considered safer than the usual models. The main structural elements of an electric vehicle are battery, electric motor, transmission, on-board charger, inverter, DC converter, and electronic control system. The device of an electric car implies the absence of a clutch and gearbox, which is why they accelerate more smoothly and climb the slope easier (Magnusson 2017). Such a car does not contain engine oil and spark plugs, which reduces maintenance costs. Electric cars also don’t make much noise, drive quietly, and don’t produce noise pollution. The engine also consumes no energy when the vehicle is stationary. The transmission of an electric car is quite simple. Thanks to the onboard charger, the vehicle can be charged from the household electrical network. Thus, a simple and understandable car device can serve as one of the reasons for their ubiquity.Climate scientists claim the electrification of vehicles is one of the best ways to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. Fully electric cars move with the help of
the power system in which the car is charged.Electric cars enjoy less popularity than gas-powered vehicles due to their higher initial cost. The battery capacity price should also be considered since a car that can last longer on its charge will cost more. Nevertheless, actual research shows that electric cars help drivers save money in the long run. The Massachusetts Institute of Technology team calculated the cost of the vehicle’s full life (including the purchase price, maintenance, fuel) and found that electric cars cost their owners much cheaper (Penney 2021). Today, electric vehicles are becoming safe, affordable and, produced by major brands, are starting to be sold in large volumes. The world leader in sales of such cars is Norway, which has a plan to stop selling fuel cars by 2025. A similar policy is followed by New Zealand, which is concerned about the state of the environment. The dissemination of such research would help reduce the financial costs of using cars.The spread of electric vehicles requires infrastructure development and increased accessibility. Despite the fact that electric cars are already becoming more common on the roads, only some countries are close to their widespread use. Nevertheless, electric machines will be an excellent replacement for traditional gas and will improve the situation of the environment.
Darwin’s evolution theory of natural selection explains how different organisms came to being and how others got extinct. In the theory, evolution occurred from one generation to another as they inherited physical and behavioral traits that allowed them to thrive in rapidly changing environments. This theory starts by indicating that in the olden days, there existed organisms with opposing traits i.e., either strong or weak traits. Geological and other environmental changes impacted the need for the survival of the species. As a result, the organisms with stronger particular traits would remain alive and end up passing the traits to their next generations as they breed. The organisms with weaker traits would get wiped out naturally resulting in the extinction of their generation (Flew 28). Darwin’s theory of evolution was fundamental in discussing the unique occurrences and developments in human sciences. The theory in itself explains genetics despite the lack of its knowledge at the time of its formation.When relating the theory to the concept of human, life and the science surrounding it, it is clear to note how humans have made significant advancements in science with the intent of developing their world, remaining dominant, and understanding every concept of life to keep them ahead of anything that may want to wipe them out of the face of the world. Understanding the working of the human brain gives a clear indication of how the brain is so developed as compared to other organisms and why humans remain superior to other organisms. This explains why in every century,
Through the process of obtaining answers, one can understand how evolution has contributed to changes in the life of different organisms as well as humans and how humans have gone to a great extent to dig deeper into the existence and development of life. The other scientific questions include: 1. In what way has the secret of life been unravelled through time? (How different people have tried to study and sustain life). 2. How unique is the human brain and what is its role in the human body? (History of the study of the human brain and how the obtained information has been used in the development of the field of psychology and neuroanatomy). 3. How does the brain impact our lives? (This explains the variation in brain development at different ages and among different individuals).Proof of the Existence of A Link Between Science and SocietyThe videos indicate how information grew from one century to another and was built on the inventions of key researchers and enthusiasts. All the information was used as guiding principles in the different scientific fields and new information was added to the existing data. The changes observed from one century to another are majorly contributed by scientific advancement. Countries such as Britain that took science seriously rapidly advanced and adapted to the rapidly changing environments as compared to other countries and this is an indicator of the link of science and the society.
The organizational task entrusted with developing a structure within the population to decrease exposure to risks and cope with catastrophes is known as emergency management. Regular training, simulations, equipment evaluation, and community coordination in a crisis are essential aspects of emergency preparedness (Oliver et al., 2015). Forest fires, tremors, hurricanes, accidents, bombings, dangerous chemicals events, snowstorms, and flooding are just a few of the typical calamities that come under emergency management (Oliver et al., 2015). Mitigation, readiness, reaction, and restoration are the four primary stages in the above framework (Oliver et al., 2015). During the mitigation phase, management ensures that quick action is taken to resolve concerns before a significant tragedy (Oliver et al., 2015). This is an essential step since it aids society in minimizing human as well as financial costs.In order to respond to a crisis in the quickest period feasible, the preparation stage encompasses planning, administering, coordinating, training, equipping, regulating, evaluating, and improving operations. As a result, the reaction stage entails organizing all relevant emergency services as well as planning for first responders (Oliver et al., 2015). It is crucial to determine the resources required and how to deploy them efficiently at this step. The population will attempt to rehabilitate the impacted region during the recovery period.Emergency Management and its DevelopmentA Congress Legislation was enacted in order to offer monetary support to a municipality in New Hampshire after a wild fire had decimated the area. Thus, the legislation mentioned above was signed into law in 1803, marking the first time the federal government
catastrophic situations and restore critical services and property in an assault. Civil defense, also known as civil protection, is an endeavor to protect non-combatants in a state against natural calamities. It employs disaster management principles such as prevention, abatement, preparedness, reaction, evacuation procedures and reintegration (Huang et al., 2021). A state’s attempt to protect its people (typically non-combatants) against natural catastrophes is known as disaster defense.The goal of emergency management, on the other hand, is to safeguard people, property, and governments from any threats. For instance, as the danger of war and aerial bombardment loomed, plans such as the above were considered as early as the 1920s, and several countries executed them throughout the 1930s (Oliver et al., 2015). Once nuclear weapons were identified as a threat, they became all-pervasive. Currently, the civil defense has changed its attention from military assault to widespread tragedies and crises after the conclusion of the Cold War. Some of the terms used to describe the new concept include crisis response, disaster prevention, emergency preparedness, recovery plans, civil aid, and public security.
Equine influenza is a respiratory disease that is highly contagious to horses and other animals in the horse family. It is caused by numerous influenza subtypes, a virus comparable to but distinct from influenza viruses seen in other animals. Contact with sick horses and infected clothing, equipment, brushes, gear, and so on transmits the virus swiftly. When the illness strikes horses, it is known to cause considerable losses. Horses may not display the corresponding signs when affected by the disease. However, it is possible to prevent the spread of the virus by vaccinating the horses, treating the sick horses, and using any other preventive measure. The essay will discuss the effects, ways of transmission, and how to treat and prevent equine influenza.Horses are affected by two varieties of influenza viruses that steadily circulate and produce seasonal flu waves, influenza A and influenza B with two varieties of influenza viruses that steadily circulate and produce seasonal flu waves, influenza A and influenza B. Influenza stresses the letters H and N are used to categorize viruses. Letters H and N stand for hemagglutinin and neuraminidase, correspondingly. These are both proteins on the worm’s external that help in the virus’s raid of cells (Oladunni et al., 1657). Occasionally the bacteria exchange genetic data, acquiring original traits that human immune mechanisms have never seen before.Equine fever is a viral infectious respiratory illness that spreads quickly among horses and has a short incubation period (1-3 days). It is transmitted by diseased horses coughing, filthy buckets, brushes, gear, and so on. Coughing
In the modern world, the nurse’s role is changing dramatically: From being a resident assistant to the treating physician, the registered nurse (RN) is becoming the critical link in the clinic. RNs help provide a continuum of communication between patients, their families, and medical staff, which means that treatment and recovery outcomes depend on the effectiveness of their work. Given the structural changes in the professional role of the registered nurse, I could not help but take an interest in this field. Thus, my career goal is to pursue a bachelor’s degree in nursing as the first step to becoming a professional nurse.Nursing has become particularly important in recent years and became especially important to the clinical system during the COVID-19 pandemic. By now, there are over 4.2 million registered nurses in the United States (USAHS). This large number represents about 1.3 percent of the nation’s total population, which means about one in 100 Americans is a registered nurse. This data shows how critical this role is to society, as a large number of people from various states would not choose the profession if it were not in demand. The Rafferty study indicates that “nurses can realise their potential as change agents in building a better future for health care” (Rafferty 475). Additionally, USAHS reports that the number of male nurses has tripled over the past 50 years, which also reflects a positive trend in this professional role and rapid removal of stigma.There has historically been a bias against nurses regarding their importance. Although the nurse’s
is likely that I will want to continue my studies after the BSN, in which case I will need additional time. To be specific, I will say that four years is the minimum I wish to cover, to begin with. The cost also depends on the state and university, but the average cost is about $40,000 (NJ). Hence, my plan is to continue to make savings at a compound interest rate that will help me have financial protection. I plan to study all four years carefully and do my homework and tests to get the solid knowledge I will need in the future.To emphasize the bottom line, my central career goal is to earn a bachelor’s degree in registered nursing. This is the most specific and pressing goal I have set for myself in terms of career advancement. However, once I receive my BSN, I have no plans to graduate, as I want to advance my knowledge continually. Professional development requires careful academic work on myself, but in addition, I will also need to save up some money. To put it another way, in the next four years, I plan to work hard on my education in order to fulfill my personal career goal.
Environmental sustainability refers to the point where renewable resource harvesting rate should not surpass that of regeneration and that the decline of non-renewable resources should require the same growth of renewable alternatives. The utilization of natural resources has increased significantly over the past few decades. Environmental sustainability is essential for the preservation of resources by the global community for the future generation (Ostad-Ali et al.). This entails the lowering of economic impacts that might be unfavorable to the environment, as well as designing a business that reduces the use of carbon. The production of cheap and clean energy that is available for all is the primary objective of sustainable development. In her article “The Obligation to Endure,” Carson warns the public about the consequences of modern industrial pollution. Since environmental climate became adverse due to rising economic stability, variants of achieving environmental sustainability emerged, namely human contribution to the ecosystem by removing harmful substances from agriculture and the use of rainwater harvesting systems.The environmental climate has changed from being conducive to causing many adverse effects on the ecosystems. Manufacturing, which is commonly considered to be continuous development in different types of industries, tends to affect the environment in various ways, which results to change in the atmospheric climatic conditions. These, in turn, affect agriculture; for example, in the regions with manufacturing factories, “the farmers complained that they were unable to raise any pigs” (Carson 123). Both the manufacturing and processing sectors rely on the environment to attain their raw materials. Industries such as the papermaking industries
depend on trees as a source of raw material for their products (Oláh et al.). Consequently, it causes a tremendous decline in the number of trees available globally, and the trees are viewed to be of significance towards the reduction of the amount of carbon dioxide available in the atmosphere. Moreover, the attempts to return the trees and plants are unsuccessful, and their result is “animals have almost invariably gone along with the plants” (Carson 128). Subsequently, there will be developments of harsh environment and climatic change such as heavy rainfall and drought.The rate of development has increased within various countries to establish a stable economic background. It enables the creation of employment opportunities for individuals, which encourages capitalism to establish firms in various sectors of the globe. The industries mostly dispose of their waste products into large water bodies. Consequently, it results in the existence of chemicals and other metals, which causes tremendous effects on marine creatures. The accumulation of chemicals in the oceans results in oceanic acidification, thus, making the sea inhabitable to marine animals. Yet, “future generations are unlikely to condone our lack of prudent concern for the integrity of the natural world that supports all life” (Carson 129). Hence, humans should develop some solutions for this problem to preserve economic stability and ecological integrity.One of the approaches in achieving environmental sustainability is by viewing people as a part of the ecosystem, which does not only use natural resources but contributes to the system. For instance, nitrogen is essential for the growth of
(Singh and Bhakar). With the introduction of drill technology, people started to abandon Johads and make wells as deep as possible. By doing that, the underground water level decreased and dehydrated the ecosystem in the area. The situation changed with reintroducing the practice of rainwater harvesting in Johads. After seven months, the first monsoon season came and refilled the new pond. This inspired the community to continue the restoration of their abandoned rainwater harvesting system. Johads ended a vicious cycle of lowering levels of groundwater (Singh and Bhakar). Serving the ecosystem is a strategy that can help humanity achieve environmental sustainability and ensure its long-term well-being.In conclusion, integration into the natural ecosystem is a vital step in nature preservation. The high rate of environmental degradation that is being experienced globally is caused by capitalist activities, which are continuously conducted in various sectors of the globe. Preferably, the government and various ecological authorities need to come together and formulate environmental policies and laws and ensure their implementation. Through this, they will be able to curb the effects of capitalism on the environment and hence decreasing environmental destruction.
limited to the plaintiff whose injuries arise from the proximate cause of the violation of the statute. For example, in the case of Holmes v. Securities Investor Protection Corporation, 503 U.S. 258-270, the statutory cause of action bars suits from damages that are remote from the defendant’s unlawful conduct (Jones, 2019). However, since the Lanham Act only allows commercial injury lawsuits, the proximate cause of the consumer deception is not fatal as required by the statute.The principles act as guidance than the direct-competitor test, reasonable interest by the Sixth Circuit, or multifactor balancing test recommended by Lexmark. The principle also outlines that the claims by Static Control fall under plaintiffs authorized to sue under §1125(a). Static Control can sufficiently allege that it lost sales and suffered injuries in its business reputation within the zone of interest caused by Lexmark’s misrepresentation.
Ethics is an indispensable component of the criminal justice system. That is because ethics is needed to define a criminal act and determine a proper punishment, and guide decisions and actions of judges, juries, police officers, and lawyers. More precisely, strict adherence to the principles of ethics ensures impartiality and protection of the rights of victims and criminals. The present essay addresses the issue of public corruption from individual, organizational, and societal perspectives.The concept of public corruption refers to the misuse of power by a public official to gain some personal benefits. The theory of ethical formalism that is represented in the works of Immanuel Kant and John Rawls argues that “the only thing truly good is goodwill, and that what is good is that which conforms to the categorical imperative” (Pollock, 2018, p. 33). A categorical imperative, in its turn, could be understood as a rule of conduct that is ethically and morally right and obligatory with no exceptions. From this, it could be inferred that public corruption results from the breach of laws or rules that all members of a society should follow.Public corruption could be explained on individual, societal, and organizational levels. According to Pollock (2018), the most popular explanation of public corruption conducted by an individual police officer is the rotten-apple argument. This argument defends the position that an officer who misconducted is deviant and “it was simply a mistake to hire him or her” (Pollock, 2018). Gorsira et al. (2018) study reveal that public officials moral conviction on whether they should
refrain from corruption makes them more or less inclined to abuse power. When criminologists investigate cases of public corruption, they might use the individual explanation to claim that a police officer or a public official committed a crime since he or she has low self-control, poor education, a high sense of entitlement, or is cynical (Pollock, 2018). Therefore, the essence of individual explanation is that the society and an organization where a corrupted employee works are unrelated to the crime committed.An individual explanation of a case of corruption can be found in Luc Besson’s movie Leon: The professional . The entire story between Leon, the killer, and a 12-years-old girl Mathilda starts with the death of her family. Mathilda’s parents and siblings were killed by the corrupt agents of the Drug Enforcement Administration with which her father cooperated. The police officers were interested in gaining benefits from selling the drugs by accessing them via Mathilda’s father. This way, from the perspective of individual explanations of public corruption, the officers misconducted because they wanted to retrieve personal benefits from the situation.The organizational explanation of public corruption argues that a person committed wrongdoing because of the micro-climate within his or her organization that contradicts the principles of ethics. As Pollock (2018) puts it, it is common for small workgroups to develop a culture that contradicts ethical norms and provokes corrupted behavior. In addition to that, organizational culture per se, both formal and informal, could cause corruption (Pollock, 2018). For instance, officers might not be trained to successfully detect
ethical dilemmas and solve them.Another feature that could cause public corruption on the organizational level is mistrust between employees and a lack of understanding and cooperation in a team. Pollock (2018) cites a study conducted by Elizabeth Reuss-Ianni on the issue of public corruption. The author has discovered that in the 1970s, in New York, there were tense relations between street cops and management cops (Pollock, 2018). The subculture of street cops was based on the fact that they cherished loyalties and commitments more than laws (Pollock, 2018). Hence, even though a decision to commit an act of corruption could be made only by an individual, the culture and climate within his or her organization could affect this decision.An organizational explanation of public corruption could be found in Stephen King’s novel The Green Mile which was later filmed by Ferenc Darabont. Overall, The Green Mile is a story about prison wardens who had no chance to prevent the death penalty of John Coffey even though they knew that he was innocent. This novel contains numerous ethical dilemmas and is an excellent food for thought. One of the examples of public corruption conducted by the wardens is when they brought the prisoner, John Coffey, into the house of their boss, Hal Moores. They committed this act to help the boss and his wife, who was dying of cancer since Coffey had the gift of healing people. Even though it is strictly forbidden for wardens to take prisoners out of jail, three wardens cooperated and implemented their risky
Marketing is one of the most critical aspects of every business, which makes organizations look for effective ways to attract new customers. However, not all marketing activities are fair or ethical, and targeting uninformed consumers is among them. One should explain that uninformed consumers are individuals who lack the psychological or mental maturity to make reasonable decisions and purchases. Examples of these people are children, the elderly, and individuals with psychological conditions. Consequently, it is unethical to target such consumers because this practice can provide these people with adverse outcomes.Many factors explain why it is unethical to target uninformed consumers. The first robust argument comes from the definition presented above. Since these people do not have psychological or mental maturity, target marketing can force them to purchase unneeded items. Consequently, this marketing approach is a form of manipulation of unprotected populations. The second reason refers to the fact that it is challenging for uninformed consumers to locate sellers’ lying. As a result, organizations can provide customers with false information to stimulate their buying behaviors.Irrespective of this information, some people claim that there is nothing wrong with targeting uninformed consumers. This point of view relies on the belief that such customers represent new markets, and organizations are free to enter and benefit from them. However, it is challenging to deny that these consumers are vulnerable populations, meaning that they deserve a specific attitude. That is why it is unethical to target uninformed customers.In conclusion, the essay has presented robust arguments of why organizations should refrain from targeting children, the elderly, and people with mental conditions. Even though some people and businesses stipulate that these populations are suitable for marketing, it is better to avoid them. The rationale behind this statement is that uninformed consumers do not have psychological maturity, meaning that target marketing can force them to make unreasonable decisions and purchases.
The European powers had taken major parts of the world, including the Caribbean. In the 15 th century, the Europeans claimed the region following the establishment of Spanish settlements and conquest of the Aztec and Inca empires (Horne, 2018). Due to the conquest, it was easy for the Spanish to invade Mexico and Peru through exploration in strategic points of the Caribbean region. Following the Spanish invasion of the Caribbean in the 17th century, other European powers such as the British and French started settling in pivotal points such as the island of Tortuga and later moved to Jamaica (Horne, 2018). By mid-century, many non-Hispanic privateers had established permanent colonies and trading zones in Caribbean islands.The profitability in terms of wealth enabled rise of conquest to Caribbean region. First, it was easy to obtain gold, which was among the region’s key aspects of the scramble. The existence of Christopher Columbus in the region had shown the way for other leaders to set colonies (Horne, 2018). Second, there was the availability of a labor force drawn from the African continent as black people were used as slaves to work in the industrial openings in the area.Due to the decline of Spanish power in the region, majorly as a result of reduced native population of the area, the other European powers boosted their presence in areas that Columbus had covered. For example, Francis Drake, a privateer from England, attacked many Spanish settlements (Horne, 2018). The collaborative base between the French, British and Dutch made it possible for European powers to conquer the significant area of the Caribbean. After start of the competitive nature of colonies, sovereign battles emerged that led to stiff wars that made it hard for the Caribbean islands to unite against European rule (Horne, 2018). Because of the emergence of agricultural activities, the Atlantic slave trade saw many Africans work for the Europeans in the Caribbean, strengthening their colonialism in the area hence conquering the region significantly.
IntroductionBack to the Future is a unique film of its time, which has become a cult film thanks to its gripping plot and attention to detail. Screenwriter Robert Zemeckis created a movie about travel, pitting opposing personalities against each other who later became perfect partners.Thesis: Robert Zemeckis created an award-winning film that changed views on cause and effect and interactions through plot structure, character development, and setting.Body Paragraphs  * The plot structure of Back to the Future keeps the viewer interested in the film through logical cause-and-effect relationships.      + Each moment in the film is connected to the last moment and the next, weaving them into a unified structure.      + The scene begins with a ticking clock, then shifts to the theft of the plutonium and a focus on Marty, who is unaware of what was stolen under his bed.      + Marty ignores the safety of the clock tower, but later it turns out that he was around when the tower stopped.  * Character development in the story is built on the opposites of Marty and Doc, who elusively turn out to be people with similar histories.      + Marty is relatively quick and restless, though Doc seems judicious and prone to over-analyzing the situation: together, their work is coherent and efficient.      + Marty uses teenage slang while Doc uses proper speech: their different characters allow them to see the best in each other and develop as individuals.  * The film’s setting is new and unusual for the time of its creation, so the viewer’s eye is drawn to the screenwriter’s love of detail and desire to fill the film with characters from different eras.      + The differences in road construction quickly determine the time difference: in the ’50s, some were dirt roads.      + The film revisits the clock tower, which was in operation in the ’50s and stopped in the ’80s.ConclusionBack to the Future reveals to the viewer a new reality in which everything is interconnected: logical connections, people, and places. Zemeckis has created a unique story that amazes audiences with its details, developments, and shifting eras.
The topic of the project in question addresses the implications evidence-based practice (EBP) training among nurses can have on the scope of patient satisfaction with health care services. Essentially, the project seeks to meet five major objectives that tackle both the nurses’ and patients’ well-being in the hospital setting:  * The first objective of the project is to explore how nurses’ level of EBP knowledge and implementation affects the quality of services they provide to the patients. Since studies demonstrate that EBP implementation in the workplace contributes positively to the nurses’ sense of personal achievement, it is reasonable to assume that such an improvement will affect their motivation to perform work due diligence (Rodríguez-Nogueira et al., 2021). Hence, this project will help clinical specialists to explore the peculiarities of this connection.  * The second objective of the project is to improve the overall level of EBP knowledge and implementation among nurses in general hospitals. Even if the intervention of the project does not present the expected results in terms of correlation between patient satisfaction and EBP training, the latter is still an asset for the clinical setting. Indeed, the EBP implementation remains one of the objectives for many general hospitals.  * The third objective is to explore the connection between the EBP training programs and nurses’ job satisfaction. Job satisfaction and motivation are some of the pillars of meaningful and efficient nursing practice and community outreach. For this reason, this project seeks to identify the extent to which improving nurses’ level of expertise
aforementioned objectives for the project are focused on the integrity of services provided to the patients. The right to receive quality health care is one of the fundamental aspects of social justice, as it presupposes equal access to high-quality nursing care regardless of the individuals’ personal beliefs and qualities and the nurses’ subjective attitude. Although many nurses realize the importance of pursuing social justice, excessive workload and lack of personal accomplishment sometimes let them extrapolate their fatigue and job dissatisfaction to the attitude towards the patients (Sultana et al., 2020). Moreover, burnout and lack of expertise among nurses affect patient autonomy or the patients’ right to participate in the decision-making process and treatment. In order to ensure autonomy, nurses are to pay attention to the patients’ concerns and non-medical factors. Since lack of EBP expertise and the prevalence of burnout contribute to poor interaction with patients, this project will help reinstate patient autonomy in the workplace. Hence, the present project seeks to explore the options to minimize the level of personal concerns and their potential effect on the socially equal and respectful treatment of the patients.
The study showed that bibliometric analysis of evidence gathered from integrative reviews and analytical studies had substantial implications for nurse-related and evidence based policy changes. Primarily, this is possible through the use of integrative reviews in designing new programs (Benton et al., 2020). The collective database of the synthesized studies as suggested by the authors of the study, can be utilized by nurses to be empowered through evidence-based materials in the formulation of changes in universal health coverage. As such, the applicability of this information has a number of benefits for working nurses, as they will be able to employ concise and trusted resources when advocating or implementing changes to policy. I think that nursing practice can be vastly improved with the use of well-managed databases that employ evidence-based research. This is because such a database will be able to illustrate gaps in knowledge of overarching issues as well as daily medical practices in the sphere of nursing (Houser, 2016). Similarly, it allows for insight into nurse-specific fields such as nurse education, care for the lederly, emergency care, and more.Currently, accessibility to extensive and complete information that is formed through evidence-based research is limited due to a number of factors. In order to better provide such informative materials among working nurses it is essential to reduce bureaucratic processes and integrate technology into the process. Modern technology allows for low-cost and time-saving methods of information sharing, which will be largely beneficial for nursing. As mentioned prior, evidence-based research has the potential to reveal gaps in information in nurse-specific practices that would otherwise be unseen. I believe it is essential to make such knowledge accesibile and cohesive to promote better nursing care and work quality.
Early positioning and image problems encountered by Stella Artois in the UK market can be used as prominent examples of contradiction between the sale price and advertisement campaign. Although the brand was intended to be an expensive premium product, combining the high percentage of alcohol and lowering the cost created an impression that this product was designed for mainstream use. Considering that other reputable brands tended to diminish alcohol content and increase the prices, in comparison to them, Stella Artois gained a low-quality reputation. In this regard, it can be concluded that it is essential to analyze the entry market and potential competitors, examining the customers’ expectations and evaluating whether product differences might prompt the emergence of unexpected impressions.The market development model is an excellent guide for industry growth, which allows for increasing the sales of beer. Considering the audience’s characteristics and the product’s attributes, following the suggested advice for the current maturity level might offer relevant insights into the elevation of category volume and brand sales. For instance, remaining aware of the customers’ preferred method of beer consumption can aid in understanding the market segment and providing the exact product that the target population expects to receive. In addition, it becomes possible to avoid failures connected to the presentation of irrelevant beer segments and product categories. Furthermore, as different social groups begin to consume beer, the brand can be adapted to fit their requirements, establishing new segments, promoting consumption changes, and compelling the market development to advance to the next level.From my perspective, the complication
a new product, which openly addressed a serious issue rather than promoting its qualities. Considering that tremendous amounts of water are used for brewing beer, marketing water access through beer consumption could have resonated with the consumers, creating a negative disposition towards the brand.Introducing Stella Artois into the South African market included several considerable advantages for the company. Given that the water access in Cape Town was recently restricted due to the water crisis, providing the customers with an opportunity to receive an extra water supply tremendously increased the possibility of success. Moreover, as the South African beer market was steadily growing, this was a perfect opportunity to enter it. However, a significant disadvantage of centering the South Africa launch on the Water.org sponsorship concerns the use of a highly prominent water complication as a marketing tool. Furthermore, South Africa remained at the first level of market maturity, meaning that introducing a premium brand contradicted the customers’ expectations.From my perspective, it would be essential to shift the focus on the additional access to water, attempting to mitigate the ethical conflict between water access and beer promotion. Furthermore, changing the usual approach could be highly beneficial for the South Africa campaign, as it would allow presenting the Stella Artois beer as suitable for bar consumption rather than a high-priced premium brand. In the future, as the audience becomes more familiar with the product, it would be possible to expand the span of the marketing campaign.
The paper contains a raft of expressions by 19 th and early 20th-century artists whereby they conveyed what was in their hearts rather than the reality of their art. On that note, expressionism is conveyed through intense feelings through the works done by paintings or sculptures. That period was characterized by treasuring of emotionalism in artworks, such as the romanticism period, which was characterized by drawings that represented the intimate aspects of human beings (Arnason & Mansfield, 2012). The spread of secularism widely in the regions of Germany and Austria.Several artworks in the chapter help the reader understand the extent to which artists would convey emotions. For example, The Lion Hunt by Delacroix shows the violence and robustness in society as depicted in the art (Arnason & Mansfield, 2012). Additionally, Munch’s The Scream reveals expressionism as the artist conveys the theme of desperation and alienation in society. Also, fierce expressionism was popular due to the representation of women’s sexuality, such as Nude Girl by Lovis Corinth in 1886, as shown in Figure 1 (Arnason & Mansfield, 2012). Thus, through the chapter, a reader can gain knowledge and interpretation of expressionism in arts.Figure 1: Nude Girl by Lovis Corinth in 1886There was a revolution in art in the early 20 th century, where young painters took a new turn in art. Painting groups creation of what was known as Die Brucke or ‘The Bridge’ association that was used to link all fermenting elements in art (Arnason & Mansfield, 2012). Some of the painters in the association, such
1912Sculptures translated various elements into the world, mostly during the romanticism period. For example, the Kneeling Woman by Wilhelm Lehmbruck in 1911 expresses women’s melancholy and loss when they face struggles in relationships with men (Arnason & Mansfield, 2012). The sculpture revealed the trauma and sadness that Lehmbruck had gone through during World War I, which eventually led him to commit suicide. Self-examination was also a broad theme in Austria, as shown in Portrait of Paris von Guterslah, drawn by Egon Schiele in the 1890s (Arnason & Mansfield, 2012). The art shows a disgruntled man who appears to be harmful, an expression of inhumanity that the society had, more so to people who had no power or knowledge over issues. From chapter 6, the reader understands artwork was characterized by transitional values in both Germany and Austria.
Sterile products for patient care are dependent on the effectiveness of sterilization and the unit design. Central processing aims to process medical and surgical equipment in an organized manner. They are also designed to safeguard patients from infection while reducing hazards to employees and keeping the value of the objects being recycled. Sterile processing facilities differ in size and complexity from huge, very sophisticated production settings that reprocess dozens of instrument combinations and devices to small, specialized facilities that reprocess a restricted quantity and variety of instruments (Swanson 245). In certain instances, sterile processing may occur wholly from where the equipment is used; alternatively, tiny remote clean production plants may be integrated within or next to a surgical suite’s semi-restricted zone. Irrespective of the location or kind of reprocessing treatments performed in these areas, the fundamental operational principles and workflow remains the same.If someone is contemplating the construction of their ideal kitchen, design is sure to play a significant influence. Perhaps this means positioning the dishwasher adjacent to the sink for faster loading and placing the pull-out trash in an area preparing food or installing practical drawers to store goods that might otherwise accumulate on the counter. The argument is that design is critical. It is crucial that the Sterile Processing Department (SPD), where surgical instruments are processed and reprocessed every day, adhere to company standards set by organizations. These organizations include the Association for the Advancement of Medical Instrumentation (AAMI), the National Association of periOperative Nursing (APON), and the American Society for Quality (ASQ) (Neue).
One needs an SPD department, whether you’re treating patients at an academic medical center or an outpatient surgery center. The placement of an SPD department is crucial in building a workflow that enables an SPD department to turn over, handle, and supply instruments efficiently.Fig. 1. Nadeau Kara, “Experience is power”; Salary Survey confirms education, certification key to SPD recognition and career success.Before designing an SPD environment, it is a good idea to familiarize yourself with industry standards issued by associations like AAMI and AORN. They may assist with anything from the room’s layout to the amount of light and water required in the space. An SPD should have a distinct separation of dirty, clean, and sterilized tools with physical barriers, irrespective of the magnitude of your SPD (See fig. 1). Having a process that is as predictable as feasible might be beneficial.The design of a sterile processing space is built on a dirty-to-clean workflow. Moving things from a contaminated to a decontaminated condition necessitates a one-way traffic arrangement for instruments and equipment. While the objects go through the process, this one-way movement is critical to preventing cross-contamination. To facilitate workflow, air circulation systems are intended to limit pollutants. In dirty work areas, it is done by providing negative airflow compared to clean spaces while also protecting clean work areas by providing positive airflow. There are several processes involved in cleaning specialized devices, making these operations very error-prone even if they seem straightforward on the surface. Complete separation from dirty and clean sections, proper ventilation, and the
space, counters, sinks, or other equipment required to support the optimal workflow are all critical in a sterile processing room. As a result of the FGI Health Guidelines Revision Committee’s (HGRC) goal to “support supportive places for patients and employees wherever services are provided” (Damien, 229). Reprocessing practices are critical to preventing health give a damn infection, and thus patient safety is supported by the revised requirements.Instruments and gadgets that may be reused must be disinfected or sterilized before being reprocessed as high-level disinfected or sterilized. The Spaulding categorization method classifies items as semicritical or critical based on whether or not they require high-level disinfection or sterilization. A “sterile” product has been sterilized to remove all microbiological life (Ninomura). Sterilized things are only regarded as sterile when all defined conditions for confirmation of the sterilization procedure have been satisfied. Sanitary items are handled and kept in a way that does not undermine their sterility. The “event-related sterility maintenance” criterion determines whether the sterility of stored sterile items has been maintained.Cleaning removes bioburden (live germs left on a device’s surface after usage). Residual bioburden can spread germs or infections to the next patient who uses the device. Unclean instruments cannot be sterilized or efficiently high-level disinfected; hence the efficiency of any sterilization or elevated disinfection method depends on consistent protocols for removing or considerably lowering bioburden before processing. After cleaning, disinfecting instruments (William), cleaning via chemical (disinfectant) or thermal (washer-decontaminator) implies disinfecting devices to make them safe for employees to touch while processing continues. Inspected and packed
for sterilization after decontamination, high-level disinfected items are reprocessed without filling and must be dried before storing (see fig.2).Fig.2. William Anthony; “Guideline for disinfection and sterilization in healthcare facilities, 2008.”To comprehend the changes in sterile processing facility requirements in the 2018 FGI Guidelines (Stanton), it is necessary first to understand the history of sterile processing in the surgical suite. In 2010 and previous editions, the Guidelines mandated one “sub sterile” chamber with a sink and a thermal sterilizer in between each two operating rooms. Unwrapped tools were exposed to a reduced sterilization cycle so that they may be reused right away according to a technique known as flash sterilization. The instruments were brought into the operation room wet in an open pan after being hand-washed and flash-sterilized. One or two unique instruments or an instrument that was accidentally infected during a process were the targets of this activity. Overuse of sterilization as a convenience or an alternative to acquiring different instrument sets emerged when sterilization procedures evolved. There were also severe worries about the growing size and complexity of flash sterilized instrument sets, and the capacity to maintain the sterility of instruments carried wet in an open pan.Traditional flash sterilization was eventually deemed unacceptable due to these concerns. With a strategy that combines social media, advertising, and traditional media outreach it is possible to make your website easier to find. The committee said that the phrase flash sterilization was obsolete and replaced with Immediate Use Steam Sterilization (IUSS). Substerile rooms were no longer necessary in the
2010 FGI Guidelines, but the design criteria were preserved for use when a project’s functional program required them. Unwrapped products intended for use in the surgery room were traditionally referred to be “flash sterilized” in medical jargon (Salabasheva). When using flash or emergent sterilization, a sterilization cycle would typically last between three and ten minutes with no or little dry time or cooling phase, making the sterilization cycle quicker than that required to produce wrap or terminally sterilized products.Open baskets were used in steam sterilizer chambers for flash sterilization, which put the target object into the sterilizer while it was still wet. The sterilized items were exposed to the outside world when the room door was opened, and they may be contaminated by poor treatment. When the sterile object was being transported, the open basket didn’t shield it from ambient pollutants (Berg 229). In order to do this, it was common practice to place numerous steam sterilizers around the surgical suite, usually one between every two operating rooms, to keep the sterilizer as near as possible to the operating room.As a way to address concerns about only one sterile processing center, the infection facilities on-site on the 2018 HGRC and other domain experts looked at this requirement again. They wanted to make sure that the design of sterile production plants encourages clinical staff to follow professional standards and guidelines for cleaning, disinfecting, and sterilizing surgical equipment (Paul,48). When it came to sterile processing facilities, they took the dirty-to-clean workflow into account. They found that two rooms
were the minimal requirement: a decontamination chamber and a clean workroom. Specifically, according to the 2018 Guidelines, a two-room sterile processing center must comprise a chemical cleaning room and a spotless small office. These are kept separate by an interior wall with a door or roll window that can be closed and secured or a constructed laundry with a pass-through window or door.Fig. 3. Stanton Madeleine; “3-zone sterile processing” Harms the productivity and value of this modern workflow.There is wording in the 2018 Hospital and Clinic Guidelines outlining the minimal physical criteria for the disinfection room and the sterile workroom. As a result, a three-basin sink and counter, appropriate counter space are necessary for sophisticated equipment to be cleaned, rinsed, and sanitized safely and efficiently. Sterile storage must be provided, whether in the clean place of work or a dedicated storage area. At first, the notion of a single-room sanitary processing unit to service the surgery suite seemed to be the solution. However, time and experience have shown that this approach is not the optimum design for supporting sterile processing best practices, and it was modified as part of the 2018 Guidelines editing process.Decontamination aims to prevent the preparation and packaging personnel from obtaining infections caused by bacteria on medical devices during the decontamination procedure. Inanimate objects exposed to potentially hazardous microorganisms can be made safe for continuing use by applying physical or chemical methods of decontamination. According to FGI, specific steps are to be followed during decontamination. Sterile Processing Department’s Decontamination Area should be used
to transport used equipment and supplies to avoid contamination of staff or the hospital (Rose). Closed containers, totes, or plastic bags should transport supplies and equipment, and equipment should be protected from the elements. Workers in the decontamination area must wear protective clothing, including a scrub jumpsuit wrapped by a humidity barrier, shoe coverings, latex or plastic gloves, and a hair covering (see fig 4). The face mask is recommended while doing manual cleaning activities when splashing is possible.Seavey, Rose. ” Sterile & Materials Processing Department.” Basics on Processing & Sterilization 4.2. 2016.The process of sorting starts at the place of usage. Handling contaminated materials should be avoided unless the device’s operator is already wearing complete personal protective equipment, such as while doing care inside the operating room. Sorting should solely consist of eliminating throwaway sharps and disposing of other single-use goods in places where employees are not wearing any or minimum protective clothing. It is only essential to soak lumens, or different intricate patterns clogged with dirt or are incredibly bloody and cannot be washed or cleaned at the point of application (Rose). The detergent used should be compatible with the device’s components and appropriate for the soil it will be washing. Consult the manufacturer’s instructions. Many cleaning tools are available, but the most frequent include washer/decontaminator, ultrasonic, cart washers, and tunnel washers. All instruments should be inspected after cleaning before being packed for reuse or storage. The cleanliness of box locks, serrations, and crevices must be thoroughly examined.After objects have been cleaned, dried, and
Understaffing is one of the most widespread issues in the healthcare setting in the USA and many other countries. This is also one of the most burning issues in the healthcare facility under consideration. Being a certified nurse assistant, I have acknowledged the negative impact of understaffing on employees’ performance and their overall well-being, as well as patient outcomes. Nurses are exhausted, which tends to lead to medical errors and adverse effects on patients’ health or their satisfaction with the services they receive. Understaffing had been a serious issue before the outbreak of the COVID pandemic, but it became an unpreceded burden for the system during the pandemic (Lasater et al., 2020). To improve the situation, it is possible to apply the five-step process suggested by Cox et al. (2014). This paper includes a brief description of the implementation of the five-step process to address understaffing in the hospital in question.The first step implies the identification of the constraint (the issue that deteriorates the quality of provided care). As mentioned above, understaffing is the most burning constraint to address as it leads to an increased number of medical errors, overall dissatisfaction and low morale of the staff, and inappropriate performance. As a result, patients do not receive high-quality care as nurses often have insufficient time to discuss the necessary issues with patients and families, conduct clinical procedures properly, and fulfill their tasks.Step 2 of the process described by Cox et al. (2014) encompasses the identification of the exact ways to address the constraint. Seasonality is one
Company’s Background InformationFarcargo is a business-to-business online-based logistics service company. The company conducts national wide and international goods delivery for its clients. The company was established in 2006 as a local delivery company where it conducts deliveries in the Seattle locality. In the beginning, the employees would do home and office deliveries for our clients for goods such as groceries, food, and shopping items, among others. However, in 2009 the company changed from local deliveries to national wide and international deliveries. The business operations also change from business to customer to business to business. Most of the company’s services, such as booking, billing, payment, and monitoring, are conducted online.The company was founded by Adams Johnsons, the Chief Executive Officer, who was assisted by five other senior management staff as follows: 1. Chief Finance Officer – Janet Smith 2. Chief Marketing Officer- Peter Calgary 3. Chief Operations Manager- Susan Milles 4. Chief Human Resource Manager- Diana Jones 5. Chief Information Technology Officer- Steve WilsonFarcargo is an e-commerce business and thus does not require numerous brick-and-mortar stores to conduct its operations. The company has a main office in Seattle, its headquarters where it has centralized its processes. The company has well-established online and social media platforms where it connects with its existing and potential clients. E-commerce businesses use this platform to advertise its services and inform clients of their offers and discounts (Chung et al., 2018). Moreover, Farcargo has a website where its clients can log in using their registration details to monitor their goods in transit or
previous business deals. Farcargo prides itself in excellent customer service.Farcargo Current StatusAs of December 2021, Farcargo had a total of 18 fully contracted employees and two part-time staff. The company is worth $258 million as its 31st December 2021 financial reports. The company realized a revenue of $27 million in the year. Farcargo has experienced a 5% growth rate in the past three years and expects to exceed this rate by 2% in the next two years. The company is planning to relocate to a new facility, a two-story standalone building.The Company’s MissionFarcargo aims to transform global business operations by delivering reliable, affordable, and timely cargo transport services. The company aims to be a leading online delivery cargo company that encourages regional and international trade hence economic growth and stability to our clients. Farcargo focuses on improving the courier industry to exceed global standards.The Company’s VisionThe company’s vision is to be a reliable and flexible business partner to its clients. Farcargo is determined to be available and offer flexibility in terms of operations, delivery hours, payment methods, mode of transportation, types of goods in transit, and location, among others. It aims at establishing flexible services to suit our diverse clients’ needs.Company’s Business TypeFarcargo is a business-to-business online cargo courier services provider. The company transports goods within the boundaries of a particular country or beyond its borders. Farcargo deals in road, air, and water transport. For each mode of transport, courier service companies use a variety of equipment in terms of size and shape to suit the
kind of goods being transported (Gramatikova, 2020). For instance, for road transport, the company owns four types of trucks of different sizes which enables it to transport different amounts and types of goods. This business is online-based, meaning that its customers conduct their booking, monitoring, billing, payments, and signing-off using an online platform.Farcargo CustomersFarcargo deals with different types of companies who wish to transport their products or any goods. It has one-time clients and regular or repeat customers. A significant number of the company’s clients are companies whereby that require us to take goods from one location to another. For example, manufacturing companies require it to transport raw materials from the provider to their firms and later hire courier services to transport their output to wholesalers or other clients (Gramatikova, 2020). It also has individual clients who would like to transport personal goods such as cars or other products. Farcargo Company also gets government contracts regularly where it is hired by a government to conduct a delivery.Demographic InformationThe company’s headquarters are located in Seattle but have other regional offices in 40 countries globally. Farcargo conducts its operations in all seven continents but has most of its clients in the U.S.A, Asia, and Europe. In the three regions, Farcargo transports goods within the borders and across to other countries.Company’s Information Systems InfrastructureThe company’s information system infrastructure comprises four parts; the user interface, applications, business processes, and a database. This infrastructure is supported by hardware, system software, networking, storage, and data centers.User interfaceThis is the first and outer
view a user interacts with when working with a system (Gramatikova, 2020). The Farcargo interface is rich in color and graphics which guide the user to different functions. For example, the user interface has registration or login buttons, about us, Contact us, Our Services, and Enquiry buttons. The registration or log-in button assists users in easily key in their details for registration to the system or access to their account. The About us button leads a user to more information about the company, such as the company’s history, management, projects, and plans. Moreover, the contact us button allows the user to access the company’s contact information, such as telephone number, email address, and phone number. The user can also make inquiries from this interface which allows them to do so through the inquiry button. The user interface is blue and has images of our transportation equipment, our staff, and the company’s logo.ApplicationsAfter accessing their account, users can then interact with different applications to perform different functions in the system. Some of the functions include booking, cargo monitoring, and retrieval of past business records. The application is also attached to a payment system that allows the client to pay for their services. The booking application is linked to an external calendar which assists clients in keying in the date of their cargo collection. The booking application allows the client to describe the type of cargo with words and pictures so that our team can choose the right equipment to use. Cargo monitoring is done through the application
distance to be transported for billing. The system automatically generates a bill according to the information keyed in. If a customer is unsatisfied with the billing, they can reach out to our staff for more information. After the client pays for their services, a receipt is generated through the system to verify the payment and it is recorded in the database. The client then signs off on the project and has an opportunity to comment on the quality of service delivered.DatabaseCritical information is stored in the company’s database. Such information includes customer information, business process information, financial data, billing and payments, staff remuneration information, and equipment data, among others. Information stored in a company’s database is very crucial and requires high-security standards to prevent malicious access and use (Izzah et al., 2021). For this reason, only authorized access is given to a few information system officers in most e-commerce businesses to monitor and maintain the database (Mahamad et al., 2018). The Farcargo database is protected by a security layer developed by the information system team.A High-level Information System Block Diagram
uses cameras and microphones to ensure easy communication with the staff. Finally, our clients are required to use their personal computers, mobile phones, or tablets to access the company’s information system.The company’s software consists of the application and operating system. Farcargo uses the Linux operating system to manage its system resources. The info system also has a strong storage system backed up by cloud storage. Cloud storage enables companies to respond to changes in hardware, software, or other resources confidently (Beynon-Davies, 2019). The software also consists of web servers and systems to manage content.Farcargo’s information system should have a simple interface where clients with minimal information technology expertise can operate. The company also emphasizes on speed and agility of the system to serve its high number of clients. The information system is designed to be highly confidential and utilizes quality system security systems for its protection. Other design considerations include reliability, accessibility, and flexibility. Having based most of its operations on the online platform, Farcargo considers the highest quality information system infrastructure for effective operations.
SummaryThis paper documents Farcargo’s information system implementation plan. It is divided into various segments, which include an overview of the information system, a description of the primary tasks undertaken during implementation, and a list of the resources required (such as personnel, hardware, software, and other materials and facilities). This document has been developed continuously since the system design phase. It was later updated in the development phase, and the ultimate copy was produced during the testing and integration phase. This document will act as a guide during the implementation of Farcargo’s information system.PurposeThe primary purpose of this document is to provide an outline of events and steps that the project team will follow during Farcargo’s system implementation. It also provides major tasks and how each should be carried out to achieve the best. An implementation plan sets the dates for the accomplishment of various tasks and acts as a communication and training plan.System OverviewBeing an online-based organization, Farcargo requires a system that acts as its virtual office. Farcargo is a virtually based logistics company that has spread its operations globally. The company’s system should have a virtual assistant who acts as the receptionist, a billing department, a data keeping and retrieval section, operations and monitoring, and senior management. Farcargo aims at having an information system that allows users to interact with them as in a real physical office.System DescriptionThe Farcargo information system can be divided into three main parts, the user interface, application, and database. At the user interface, the system should allow the client to
register an account with the company where they can access their data. The system saves the clients’ data into a database where they can only be accessed by authorized personnel. The client is then able to access the organization’s services and make inquiries on various products offered. When satisfied, the client can book logistic service and the system automatically generates their bill. The client is required to make a payment through the platform using a special code generated during billing. The system then issues the client with a receipt and their booking is automatically scheduled on the system. The staff in charge of the delivery and the client can view the scheduled date and is sent a reminder by the system two days before the actual date.After our staff has received the goods to be delivered, the employee should change the status of the schedule on the system to ‘in transit. The system detects this change and sends an alert message to the client. The client and the management can monitor the goods in transit by use of GPS technology and cameras inserted in the company’s transport equipment. The employee carrying the goods can communicate with the management and client in case there is a need to do so. Upon the arrival of goods to their destination, the employee updates the status of the contract to “delivered” and uploads a few pictures as evidence. The client should confirm the delivery and then change the status to “completed”. The company requests clients to make comments about the
services offered to ensure they are offered the best.System OrganizationThe Farcargo system structure is made up of hardware, software, and databases. Every user needs the hardware components to access the system. They include computers, mobile phones or tablets, and peripheral devices.Company’s Information Systems Infrastructure.A High-level Information System Block Diagram.Farcargo’s Business logic diagram.Farcargo’s Physical Layout Diagram.Key Network Infrastructure Elements.Description of ImplementationThe Farcargo information system shall require the development of a website, a desktop application, and an android application.

Security is an essential element to maintain during the system implementation process (Mahamad et al., 2018). Some features such as encryption, authentication, SSL secure communication, and authorization should be observed to ensure that the cluster is secure. Some of Farcargo’s system security features are1.
The system will provide one interface where a client will access all the components. To access their information, clients will be required to provide authorization and authentication on one interface. This will ensure the security implementation is simplified as all components will be viewed and interacted with in a consistent manner.2. SSL secure communication; this connection allows the configuration of connections to each end-user. For instance, SSL connection can be enabled for the client, peer-to-peer, HTTP connection, gateway senders and receivers, and JMX.Regional data post-processing; the system should allow for the formatting of return values for the operations that provide access to region values. During implementation, the security of the components shall also be enhanced. For instance, when installing servers with sensitive data at the new office, maximum security from the company’s guards shall be placed during transportation and installation. The theft of such devices could lead to a great loss to the company while compromising sensitive information.Implementation SupportDuring the implementation of the Farcargo information system, support from elements such as software, hardware, facilities, materials, equipment, and personnel shall be required. This section does not provide site-specific information as it describes the support elements.Hardware, Software, Facilities, and MaterialsSoftware tools  * Operating System:      + Microsoft Windows 10 Professionals.  * Development Platforms:      + Sublime text IDE (Integrated Development Environment);      + GitHub for Version Control;      + Android Studio to be used as a platform for development.

One of the facilities required is a physical workspace, such as an office where they can assemble and test the hardware tools to be used. They will also need a desk for software installers and a hall or classroom space for training their staff and users. These facilities will be used mostly during the planning, coding, testing, and training phases.MaterialsThese are minor but essential components to be used in the system development
and implementation process. Some materials needed include charts, magnetic tapes, pens, a projector, disk packs, and a whiteboard among others.A List of Materials and EquipmentITEM                DESCRIPTION                                         COST($)Laptop              Core i5                                             600    Android Smartphone  Version 6.0                                         250    Hard Disk Space     at least 500 GB, upgradeable                        155    Printer             600 DPI qualities

The project manager’s services shall be required from the initiation to the termination period which is about 9 months. A project manager acts as the
is that the characters see themselves as “a generation of men raised by women” (270). In their life there is not enough male education for the formation of their masculinity. It confirms the idea of phallocentrism, which is based on the image of castrated women. Women raise children so that they can enter into the symbolic order.Fight Club is a wicked satire about finding, nurturing, and destroying yourself. It challenges ideas of masculinity, adding to the image of a real man several features that can be called associative and setting self-destruction and a destructive impact on society as one of life’s goals. The victory of Jack’s subpersonality over Tyler on the roof of a skyscraper shows that the good in a real man can overcome the destructive element. The ability to self-sacrifice and responsibility for his actions in Jack, who has gone through the evolution of masculinity, inspires some optimism, but the finale remains open.
IntroductionThere are numerous problems in the world that continue to undermine all the benefits that the rapid social evolution and technological progress bring. One of the issues that should be addressed immediately by all governments is extreme inequality. Despite the successful implementation of a wide range of measures that helped fight such disparities in most Western societies, Latin American nations continue to struggle from a plethora of problems that are rooted in inequality. Nevertheless, recently some governments in the region have been particularly enthusiastic in developing new ingenious strategies to help the poor. I strongly believe that a dedicated analysis of such measures can ensure increased living standards in one of the world’s most diverse regions.The Global Importance of the IssueWhy does fighting inequality in Latin America matter to the rest of the world? First, the region’s political life has been extremely turbulent for several decades. It means that some of the vital social institutions in various states are not efficient enough to ensure rapid and sustainable development. Such a situation leads to a wide range of social problems, including discrimination, drug trafficking, street crime, high levels of violence. All the above-mentioned troubles directly affect the well-being of millions of Americans. Drugs and illegal migration have been devasting various neighborhoods across the US. It is just one of the examples, as Europe and even some Asian countries also experience difficulties that are rooted in social issues in Latin America.What is more important, Latin American nations have high chances of successfully and quickly overcoming many of the
above-mentioned challenges. Governments in the region are generally enthusiastic about developing and implementing new strategies, as political parties constantly face severe competition. Thus, just like in the 20 th century, numerous social experiments (this time, predominantly positive) can change societies there in a due manner. Latin American nations that manage to find the efficient means to enhance the living standards of millions of citizens will become role models for numerous developing countries that currently experience rapid population growth (most of them in Africa). Therefore, the ability of Latin American nations to overcome difficulties and get rid of numerous constraints will ensure the successful implementation of similarly efficient strategies in countries where billions of people live.The Core of the ProblemMaybe the fact that few nations in the region are high-income economies is the cause of many issues? It can not be so, as there are numerous nations in the world that are not rich but do not struggle with such a wide range of social problems. Therefore, there must be something unique about Latin America that hinders its development and does not allow it to reach the level of prosperity and well-being of other Western societies. It is undoubtedly the extreme levels of inequality that deprives millions of people living in poor neighborhoods of access to high-quality education, medical services, and cheap credit.Figure 1: LAC countries are some of the most unequal in the world Gini indices on the distribution of household consumption per capita by region, circa 2017.Despite the gradual decreases in income inequality that take
place due to multiple changes in taxation and legislation, there are other problems that underline social issues. Wealth inequality has always been a feature of most Latin American nations, as a few aristocratic families usually owned the most fertile land in the 19 th century. Therefore, unlike in the 19 th -century US, new migrants could not easily acquire free land and had to toil for the rich. Such disparities from the outstart hindered the development of a large middle-class that is instrumental in creating a free and prosperous society.Simply raising the taxes and redistributing the money to the poor is not an optimal solution. A much more complex and scientific, data-driven approach should be utilized in order to address the issue efficiently. New frameworks should be developed and established that will seek to help people truly realize their potential by incentivizing them to use their strengths and talents.Fighting extreme poverty implies the utilization of a unique set of urgent measures and a wide range of strategies. Cheap credit or interest-free loans have already proven to be beneficial when they are granted to hard-working families that desperately need resources, such as tools, land, materials, or money to pay the rent. Once dedicated institutions or charities realize that a family will spend a substantial amount of money in an efficient way, it should ensure rapid transit of the low-interest or interest-free loan. Moreover, it is highly desirable to establish or encourage the creation of organizations that ask for money back only in case a poor family’s enterprise
is successful and starts generating income.Covid-19One of the factors that further exacerbates the inequality problem in Latin America is the Covid-19 pandemic and the numerous measures that seek to stop the spread of the virus. Therefore, all the above mentioned has substantially widened the income gap. According to Regional Human Development Report (2021), in these unprecedented circumstances, 22 million more people have fallen below the poverty line in the region, returning to 2008 levels. Moreover, lower commodity prices and slower growth in China, however, have reduced Latin America’s growth prospects (Messina & Silva, 2018). What is more, due to the fact that the middle-class is relatively small, few people have the opportunity to work from home, which is in sharp contrast with the situation in more prosperous Western countries.Moreover, the Covid-19 pandemic hinders the chances of millions of pupils and students to continue the education process online. According to Delaporte et al. (2021), social distancing measures have led to an increase in inequality in Latin America. A large portion of families in the region have more than two children, which makes it hard for any family with income levels below average to provide each child with a laptop. Furthermore, there are numerous areas even within the city boundaries where the speed of Internet connection is not sufficient enough to ensure proper conditions for working or learning from home.The successful cases from the 2000s that featured the improved living standards of millions of workers in Latin America include Argentina, Uruguay, and Brazil. In the first two examples,
labor unions managed to contribute to the establishment of a safety net that helped many professionals finally get decent salaries. In Brazil’s scenario, the substantial rises in minimal wage helped fight the situation where millions of people living in the cities with high living costs had to toil for a few dollars a day. Therefore, there are multiple success stories that can be repeated despite the disastrous effect both the Covid-19 pandemic and the consequent economic repercussions had on the region.Figure 2: Despite declining in the 2000s, income inequality remains high in LAC. Income inequality (Gini index 1992–2018).Various Types of InequalityIncome inequality, wealth inequality, and extreme poverty are not the only types of inequality that people in Latin American struggle with. Various types of horizontal inequalities (based on differences in sex, ethnicity, or race, just to name a few) are still a major issue. Women continue to earn much less than men and frequently face a “glass ceiling” due to numerous stereotypes. Ethnic minorities still lack recognition as active political and economic agents. Moreover, they are sometimes left behind in access to various social services.Governments in the regions do not allocate enough resources to the development of various facilities in remote rural areas, while, in fact, it is the most crucial measure that can really ensure the rapid enhancement of living standards. There seems to be a lack of truly independent politicians that are capable of staying determined to achieve long-term goals. Thus, the political systems in many countries in the region seem to lack the
real opportunity to represent large portions of the population. Sometimes even certain multinational corporations seem to understand more in the importance of creating proper living standards and working conditions that rapidly enhance productivity.Governments and technocrats have to fight numerous imbalances that do not allow for a more equal distribution of access to basic services and resources. The extreme riches that a minor portion of the population possess deprive them of the chance to employ a much more efficient investment-oriented approach to their numerous assets. It is difficult to realize what stands behind the lack of compassion that the rich show to the millions of poor people living in their countries. In many Latin American cities neighborhoods for the extremely rich are located just next to poor communities.Trust is instrumental in the creation of a properly functioning state and creating a harmonious society. Walking along the streets in Latin American cities makes it vivid that the rich do not trust the poor and are willing to distance themselves as far as possible from everything associated with poverty. In many cases, the motivation behind such measures seems to go far beyond safety concerns. Therefore, in the 21 st century, it is crucial for every nation to find something that brings people together.States that used to have socialist governments provide a unique example. Despite the fact that after the fall of the Soviet Union inequality rates skyrocketed in many countries, it is clear that most of them did not encounter many of the issues that Latin American nations face.
In states that used to be socialist, people have relatively equal access to free or cheap health services and education. Despite the income inequality that can be extremely high, the poor and the rich continue to go to the same hospitals and to study at the same schools. The frequent opportunities (or necessities) to interact with people from all walks of life allow for much higher compassion levels.When each member of a diverse society can understand all the hardships that others have to go through, it makes a nation tolerant and cooperative. Consequently, it leads to rapid accumulation of wealth that can be then redistributed evenly. The success story of the US economy is not based solely on strong work ethics and efficient levels of market regulations. It is also based on meritocracy, meaning that children of recent immigrants could become wealthy due to equality of opportunity.EducationEducation has always been considered instrumental in ensuring future success. Despite the numerous attempts to claim that the rich always enjoy better educational opportunities due to their parents’ financial resources, I strongly believe that it is definitely not the case in the 21 st century. The access to enormous amounts of free online information that people enjoy can ensure that they can become valued professionals in the labor market. Moreover, the free-market economy implies that numerous companies are in a constant struggle to enhance their profitability by various means, including the reduction of costs. Labor is still an important factor that influences prices for goods and services. Therefore, even small
and medium-sized companies are willing to hire professionals from countries with lower living costs.One important example concerning the change in the government’s attitude to education includes the numerous social programs in Brazil that helped incentivize school pupils from poor families to actually go to schools. In fact, their parents were paid if children attended the classes. According to Clifton et al. (2020), public spending on education, personal income taxes and social contributions are especially instrumental in reducing income inequality. Thus, sums that are insufficient for a federal government help motivate a large number of children to acquire knowledge and make the first steps that can lead to a successful career in a country where industrious professionals enjoy truly high living standards.Tourism and City EnvironmentThere are plentiful strategies that governments can employ in order to fight inequality and all the numerous issues that are associated with it. One of the easiest and, at the same time, one of the most efficient options is bringing people together. Modern cities that feature great architecture, nice infrastructure, and a wide range of cultural sites, social institutions are all relatively safe all around the world. Once pleasant changes take place in a city that makes millions of tourists from different parts of the world go there, locals in most cases rapidly change their own perception of the place they live in.Although such strategies seem to be extraordinary and insufficient to address various social issues, they actually work great in the 21 st century. Especially in the case of Latin America, where
amazing climate, bright unique nature, and the proximity to warm oceans and seas allows for room for maneuver concerning the above-mentioned approaches. Tourists always bring a lot of dollars to the places they find exotic. That alone can be extremely beneficial for a struggling economy, as worldwide popularity as a tourist destination ensures higher incomes, enhanced infrastructure, and the creation of millions of new jobs.Figure 3: One of the most popular landmarks in Buenos Aires. The Floralis Genérica sculpture.Moreover, the rich that suddenly begin to enjoy the improved environment around them also start to invest in local real estate, purchase local products, go on vacation to places in their own countries. In the case of Latin America, it can help keep enormous sums of money in the country that will boost various sectors of the economy. In any case, such a scenario is much more preferable than all of those dollars going to a handful of luxury brands and well-known resorts.What is more important, people in the 21 st century do not use the Internet on a daily basis just to perform daily tasks in a more efficient way. They actually rely on the thousands of opinions and images that are thoroughly processed by social media algorithms. One post of a truly influential blogger is enough to draw the attention of millions of people worldwide to any product, service, destination.Creating a truly appealing image of a neighborhood, a city, a country has become an extremely important goal of governments and local municipalities. People living in a
place that is admired globally are far more satisfied with their lives, even if the economy struggles. Thus, building new infrastructure that everyone can access, enhancing public space design, redevelopment and landscaping can help increase the living standards of millions of people substantially in a rapid and cost-efficient manner. The above-mentioned strategy is especially beneficial to Latin America with its pleasant climate, which will allow to later employ it in India and African countries.TransportTransportation is also an extremely important tool that can encourage people of all walks of life to finally meet each other and start interacting. Efficient and comfortable public transport has proven to be one of the greatest methods to fight inequality. Once the rich realize that they do not necessarily have to use their cars all the time and occasionally use various other options in the city centers, it quickly enhances the perception of public transport in general.Even if extremely rich businessmen lack the motivation to actually start using it, there is another rapidly growing part of the population that is considered to be privileged in Latin America. Just like in Europe, numerous officials and other public sector workers can be incentivized to use public transport more often. Given the importance and current popularity of green technologies, technocrats and officials should jump at the opportunity and create a highly efficient public transit network.One of the greatest and brightest examples of the importance of new city infrastructure projects for society is the construction of aerial cable car urban transit systems that have recently become
As a rule, the concepts of counterfeiting and terrorism are not seen as quite compatible, mostly due to the drastic difference in the end goals of each type of criminal activity. However, some terrorist organizations have sought to venture into counterfeiting, effectively expanding into massive illegal yet tremendously lucrative businesses. The notorious Italian Mafia has been particularly infamous for its efforts to capture the Italian market and seeking to divert the revenue stream to fund its nefarious activities (Beqiraj et al., 2020). Although Mafia’s activities can hardly be restricted due to the overwhelming power that it has already established in Italy, accurate tools for detecting counterfeits and preventing them from entering the European market must be incorporated into the current measures.Italian Mafia’s involvement in counterfeiting has been quite prominent., mostly due to the overwhelming power that Mafia holds in Italy as its infamous organized crime institution. Among the key counterfeit-related activities in which Mafia has been engaged, manufacturing fake products for sale has been the main one (Beqiraj et al., 2020). For instance, in 2017, Mafia was involved in manufacturing fake olive oil for selling to EU countries (Bacchi, 2017). Though the described counterfeit endeavor might seem as insignificant, especially given the range and severity of crimes for which the Italian Mafia has been known, the specified incident has produced a rather ample impact on the trade between Italy and other European states. According to the reports issued in response to the specified event, cheap oil was “re-labeled as the more expensive “extra virgin” variety, prized
Dances with Wolves , directed by Kevin Costner, was based on the book of the same name by Michael Blake, who thereafter wrote the screenplay for the film. The plot takes place during the American Civil War when a brave lieutenant John Dunbar finds himself in an abandoned fort and infiltrates Native American society. Even though the director’s crew extensively obtained guidance from historical consultants, for example, Doris Leader Charge, Lakota language instructor, it did not save the film from historical criticism. Dances with Wolves can be considered as ambitious and outstanding debut work of an inexperienced director who treated the image of indigenous Indians carefully and competently conveyed it in his project.The communal life of indigenous Indians has been portrayed accurately enough for a film not based on real events. The film was actively praised for the fact that Costner managed to resist the typical portrayal of Native Americans and not limit the characters to simplified caricature. Most of the minor inaccuracies presented in the film did not significantly impact the understanding of the overall picture. Russell Means noticed mistakes in the use of the Lakota language when some of the male-Natives were speaking in the feminine way. Historian Joseph Roquemore also noted that the Sioux tribe’s attitude to weapons was misinterpreted to emphasize people’s traditional way of life (StudyMoose 2020). The movie’s historical inaccuracies were caused not only by the difficulty of portraying the Lakota culture but also by the biases of Costner and his desire to convey a certain image of the tribe.
a cinematographer shot the film in color and actively used lighting to add opposite tones to the overall mood. In the scene where the main character is preparing to leave the tribe, the general mood is sad, but the bright light hints at the possibility of a happy future. The main musical theme is a straightforward trumpet-led melody, quite pretentious and anticipating, though fading against the background of brighter musical pieces, such as the bass-heavy The Death of Timmons or The Buffalo Hunt written for the film specifically (D’Amata 2020). In general, the cinematic picture had a huge impact on the film’s overall impression, making it so memorable and stand out.On a scale of one to five, I would rate the film 4 points on the scale of historical value and 4 points on the scale of entertainment value. The historical component expanded the understanding of the average person about Native Americans. Nevertheless, some minor inaccuracies, sometimes even made to create a certain image of the tribes, do not allow me to rate the film at 5. The entertaining component of the film can also be appreciated highly because the film has gained great popularity and received critical acclaim. Nevertheless, I would dare to withdraw the score for the timing, which could spoil the impression for some viewers.
Over the past years, the paradigm of medical care has embraced a patient-centered approach that prioritizes and anticipates one’s needs and prompts clinical intervention. Such a proactive attitude, however, has not yet become a pattern due to several financial and organizational barriers. Many hospitals claim to have limited resources for the implementation of preventive health care regularly, especially when it comes to the financial coverage of preventive interventions.The controversy, in this case, is the fact that the overwhelming amount of EBP research points to the socio-economic benefits of the anticipatory approach to health care. For example, in an article by Jennings and Eng (2020), the authors clearly indicate that “Increasing preventive cancer screenings in the U.S. is an effective strategy to reduce health care costs” (p. 245). Another study concludes that the personalized preventive approach “is statistically associated with reductions in outpatient expenditures, Medicare expenditures in year 5, emergency department (ED) utilization, and unplanned inpatient admissions, accompanied by significant increases in evaluation and management visits and expenditures” (Morefield, Tomai, Slanchev, & Klemes, 2020, p. 75). Based on this evidence, it is reasonable to ask why the economic systems of health care overlook such a beneficial opportunity.In my opinion, the answer to this question addresses two major aspects: heavy reliance on patient autonomy in health decisions and the unwillingness to invest in telemedicine and digital solutions to preventive health. This reflection was, in fact, inspired by one of my patients who is receiving treatment for type 2 diabetes. This patient is a 68-year-old man, so the majority
Organizational structure is an essential notion that brings the team together to manage the objective successfully. Five structural configurations help people to achieve team goals. Depending on the purposes of the group, it is essential to choose the appropriate structure. For instance, there are variations: One Boss, Dual Authority, Simple Hierarchy, Circle Network, and All-Channel Network. These structures are different by their nature, and it is vital to examine each of the five to determine the most effective structure for the team to accomplish its goals.One Boss structure is a situation where the leader charges responsibilities of all people. This structure is classic, and many companies apply it because of its simplicity and clearness. Indeed, it can have some substantial disadvantages, for example, slow communication, delays, and single decision-making. The second structure is Dual Authority, where two individuals have the power to execute control over the group of people. Information flows through these people and reduces a boss’s control degree. This structure allows to free up time, but the added layer might slow the communication.Simple Hierarchy is another classic structure that suggests a middle manager reporting to the boss. In this case, the boss is responsible for communication with other team members through the middle man. This option limits access to authority; indeed, it is more effective than the previous structure of Dual Authority. Circle Network suggests the information flow from one team member to another; everyone can add to or change the process. This structural configuration might simplify communication, as every group member interacts directly
In the development of nursing in Europe in the 19th century, the activities of an outstanding personality, the Englishwoman Florence Nightingale, played an important role. Florence was looking for an opportunity to help the poor and the sick. At that distant time, activities related to mercy, helping those in need, were considered an occupation not worthy of a noblewoman. The young woman sacrificed personal life expensive relationships with her parents but remained faithful to her calling. Furthermore, her values and commitment allowed Florence to become a historical figure in modern nursing, to whose leadership people owe accolades for paving the way of nursing’s place in our societies.Thanks to perseverance and perseverance, in 1851, Florence entered the community of the sisters of pastor F. Flender in Germany, where she received a nursing education. Subsequently, Florence made a considerable contribution not only to the treatment of cholera help in wars but to the development of leadership and the reformation of nursing (Kim, 2020) The selfless woman became an example of service to people and a prototype of international mercy. Moreover, Florence managed to change a common thought about nobility of nursing, her leadership allowed to reestablish pivotal understanding of nursing practice. Her significance can easily be depicted on a medal with her image, which is awarded for special merits to distinguished nurses.A large role in the development of nursing abroad belongs to the international society of the Red Cross. The International Committee for Relief of the Wounded, headed by A. Dunant, convened a conference in Geneva in October 1863 with the participation of representatives of 13 countries, at which the charter of the International Organization of the Red Cross was developed, and the emblem of the society was adopted. The United States achieved tremendous success in the development of nursing in the 19th-20th centuries, when the American Medical Association was first established. (AMA) (Kim, 2020) In 1873, the first three nursing schools were opened in the USA according to the model of the F. Nightingale schools in London (Kim, 2020) Thus, the further formation of international humanitarian organizations was also primarily made possible by leaders such as Florence.
To analyze current policies aimed at addressing the opioid crisis, describe examples of the crisis, and suggest a few options to help solve the problem to the community. A stakeholder group of people in the community, including local policymakers, leaders, and concerned citizens. The United States of America is experiencing a severe crisis of opioid abuse. In 2019 alone, opioids took the lives of 50,000 Americans, and the economic burden from the problem is about $78.5 billion a year (National Institute on Drug Abuse, 2021). This issue concerns many stakeholders, from society and medical staff to individual policymakers and representatives of various structures like the Center for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) or the National Institute on Drug Abuse (NIDA). Although different structures and organizations are making many efforts to stop the crisis, communities can also significantly contribute to solving the problem. Everyone present here can learn and do more than now, and then together community will save more lives. Today, I will present a description and analysis of policies against the opioid crisis, consider examples of the crisis, and propose several measures and actions that communities can take in this fight.It is important to say that there are several main directions for political action in the fight against the opioid crisis. Key actors such as the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) and National Institutes of Health (NIH) prioritize the following:  * Improved access to treatment, prevention, and recovery services;  * Promote the availability and use of drugs that prevent overdoses;
 * Healthcare surveillance for transparent reporting and collection of data to better understand the situation;  * Support research in understanding pain and safe methods of its management;  * Promoting different pain reduction methods (Collins, 2017; NIDA, 2021).Most organizations involved in the fight against the crisis are focused on the mentioned goals. Organizations include Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration (SAMHSA), CDC, Food and Drug Administration (FDA), and other entities. Some organizations add their own goals; for instance, the Healthcare Fraud Prevention Partnership (HFPP) also seeks to identify and stop fraud and other dishonest opioid activities (Healthcare Fraud Prevention Partnership, 2017). Programs in the States, in turn, monitor drug prescriptions and the work of pain management specialists (CDC, 2019). Thus, all measures aim to reduce the chances of opioid abuse and maintain the nation’s health.The analysis aims to understand and evaluate policy effectiveness to provide informed advice for new policy decisions and actions. Analyzing the existing medical policy, it is worth paying attention to its successes. Some successes include:  * State programs in Ohio, Kentucky, Florida, New York, Tennessee, and other states, have helped reduce opioid abuse and mortality rates (CDC, 2019);  * SAMHSA provides professional training grants and Medication-Assisted Treatment (MAT) for vulnerable populations;  * The CDC conducts and supports studies that bring new knowledge on risk factors and other influential aspects and offer solutions.However, it is worth noting that the problem continues to exist. In particular, policies may have unintended consequences of using drugs other than opioids due
drugs that prevent overdoses, and other measures;  * The creation of support groups in various areas help those who suffer from addiction, help those who suffer from chronic pain and similar issues connected with risk factors.The evaluation criteria for proposed policy options include:  * Community awareness of the dangers of opioids, laws related to the crisis, and people’s ability to take action and provide assistance;  * Help members of the community that suffer from opioid use disorders;  * Availability of overdose prevention drugs and treatment to those members of the community who need them;  * Activities of support groups aimed at mitigating risk factors and social support.In summary, it is essential to note that the opioid crisis poses a significant danger to Americans. It began after erroneous information that opioid-based drugs are not addictive spread. However, the use of such drugs carries a high risk of developing addiction and other disorders associated with opioid use. Various organizations and public bodies have taken many actions to combat the crisis. Key measures are drug prescription control aimed at reducing opioid use, finding other pain management methods, and similar efforts. Societies can be critical participants in the struggle by providing information, helping those who suffer from addiction or severe pain, and taking other measures. Thus, everyone present here can take some actions and help save lives.
Perishable food products can be preserved for a long time by applying a preservation method to them. Boiling fruits and berries with honey or sugars, urinating, pickling, pickling, and other methods have been used by people for a long time. Food preservation has become ecologically important with difficult economic times, including the COVID-19 pandemic (Sridhar et al. 1715). Various methods of influencing microorganisms have been widely studied and have found practical use, making it possible to preserve food products without spoilage for a long time. There are several classifications of food preservation based on microbiological and spoilage mechanisms, on which it is possible to describe the main methods of preserving products.The first group includes storage methods based on the basic principle: they aim at maintaining life processes at a reduced level but with the preservation of natural immunity. This principle is based on the storage of fresh fruits and vegetables and live fish storage (Sridhar et al. 1718). In the second group are storage methods based on the principle of abiosis, which aims to destroy microbes in the product. These include pasteurization, sterilization, the use of antiseptics, antibiotics, and sonication.Storage methods based on the principle of anabiosis aim to suspend the vital activity of microbes in products. At the same time, such conditions are created under which microorganisms can remain alive but not viable. These include: creating low temperatures, removing water from the product – drying, creating a high osmotic pressure with salt sugar, increasing acidity, and creating anaerobic conditions (Sridhar et al. 1719). Finally, storage
methods based on the principle of cenoanabiosis are aimed at using antagonistic relationships between microorganisms that make up the microflora of the product. At the same time, conditions are created for the development of microorganisms, which change the properties of the product in the course of their life activity to improve its nutritional and taste qualities. The waste products of these microorganisms inhibit the development of spoilage pathogens (Sridhar et al. 1726). The pickling of fruits and vegetables in fermented milk products is based on this principle.However, more innovative approaches are available today since the ones listed above have been known to history for a long time. Ultrasonic technology and ozone treatment are applied to products sensitive to heat. Even nanotechnology for food preservation is also being considered (Sridhar et al. 1726). Nanoparticles are used as antimicrobial agents or in the fight against foodborne pathogens. Ultrasound, in turn, increases the efficiency of proteins, reduces aging time, and is used for sterilization and pasteurization (Sridhar et al., 1723). Moreover, an impulsive electric field is one of the newest methods of processing products. Typically, it is applied in drying, using less time to process products (Sridhar et al. 1727). Unlike thermal drying, this method is less energy-intensive but requires more control.In addition to classifying methods according to microbiological mechanisms of action on products for their preservation, several other classifications are also distinguished in the food industry. First, each product is evaluated by its spoilage mechanism; secondly, conservation is limited to technologies related to the processing of products and
upper class contains individuals that should be emulated, comprised of caring and generous people, and those with criminal records have remarkably good lives (Kendall 10). On the other hand, the lower class is framed as homeless, poor, largely ignored by the media, and often discussed as abstract statistics. As such, when casting a human face, the demographics of the poor determine how they are framed.The quality of life may deteriorate from the understanding that as the media focuses on the upper class’s viewpoints and gives voice to their concerns, it neglects the concerns of lower-class members. The conveyed class discourses by the media, including constructions of the homeless and the poor, portrays a lifestyle inflicted by laziness, diseases, crime, and substance abuse (Kendall 94). The dehumanized statistics associated with personalized suffering portray people detached from the broader contributing factors like unemployment, ignorance, laziness, or otherwise responsible people for their misfortunes (Kendall 94). Therefore, courtesy of the detachment, the life quality of the low-class individuals continues to deteriorate since the uneducated and the poor’s needs are overlooked. With attention given to upper-class individuals, the needs of the poor are not voiced; therefore, their lives continue to be exposed to deterioration risks.
It should be noted that the Undercover Boss episode of Rita’s Ice showcases the interaction of the company CEO, Linda L. Chadwick, with several of her franchisees. The selected job positions for the analysis are franchisee owner and treat team member. The first job position is franchisee owner based on the example of Hezrron, and the second one is a treat team member position based on the example of Pastiche.The analysis shows that the first job position requires a wide range of entrepreneurial skills and abilities since the franchise owner is practically a business owner who needs to adhere to the corporate standards. The second position is solely focused on cashier responsibilities, which puts an emphasis on human interactions as well as the ability to conduct financial transactions. The similarity of the two positions is manifested in the fact that financial competence and communication skills are critical in both cases. However, the first position also requires additional operational and organizational management capabilities. The data collection for each job position analysis utilizes one-on-one interviews on-site, which means that both practical observations and additional questioning can be done. The key challenges and issues can also be derived on site since the interview is being conducted while the job positions are being performed.Job Description 1Job title: Franchise ownerLocation: Toms River, New JerseyTerms: Full timeAbout us: Rita’s Ice is a restaurant chain based in Bensalem, Pennsylvania, which was founded in 1984.

Although the Monster can be considered a bad character due to murdering people, the creature has good traits as well. The Monster is described as ugly and strong but at the same time, inexperienced. Firstly, Frankenstein’s creature is described as “its gigantic structure and the deformity of its aspect … instantly informed me that it was the wretch” (Shelley). Despite his ugly and terrifying appearance, the subject did not have the intention to kill people. The creature can be compared to a baby who tries to examine the world it lives in, and its actions are just contractions to the cruelty of the world. Frankenstein’s monster is not a real monster; it just seeks love and attention that the world cannot give him. The creature’s emotionalism is a positive feature as it allows it to understand people’s feelings and share them.The “Gothic” elements of the novel include supernatural motives, the architecture from the Middle Ages, and the spiritual aspects of human nature. Other “Gothic” elements consist of the strive for knowledge, the Monster, and the probable moral fall of men. I like that genre because I like looking at diverse issues from various perspectives. This novel allows me to look at the actions of Victor Frankenstein and the Monster and understand their motives and feelings. I also appreciate novels that aim to show moral aspects of society with the utilization of different symbols, such as the Monster.Mary Shelley’s husband believed that inappropriate social relationships are the result of people becoming evil. To make people bad, other representatives of society should reject them and make them feel useless or bad. I agree with this opinion, as people’s intentions are generally based on their experience of social interactions. If society treats people as if they were misconducts, there is no reason to try to be good or fit in.I believe that one of the integral themes of the novel is loneliness. The Monster aimed to integrate into society; however, people met him with disgust, fear, hatred, and all the spectrum of negative emotions. Hence, the creature turned to evil because of the feeling of loneliness. Nowadays, society often tries to isolate individuals who do not view the world the same as most people do. This feature often leads to the feeling of being lost and lonely.
Press freedom is an essential part of the right that communities enjoy in the modern world. It gives the people the ability to understand the insight of the government and other crucial activities happening within the country. Liberty of media through forms such as electronics and social media promotes transparency in the government’s operations and also creates a criticism of the roles it plays in ensuring it serves citizens accordingly. Despite the advantages of having reporters, some nations have policies and constitutions that limit what they are supposed to cover and report. If the media goes against the regulations, their freedom is withdrawn and the respective individual subjected to the court of law. In the United Arabs Emirates (UAE), the free will of publication and expression is connected to some limitation that makes it sensitive. To be able to unveil the truth on significant matters, journalism liberty should be expressed freely.In UAE, the freedom of opinion expression and other forms of communications are subject to the law, making it challenging for the media to publish some information that the regulation prohibits. The country does not allow any form of media to criticize the government and other allied nations. The restriction makes it difficult for journalists to report some critical affairs the nation is undertaking or expose unlawful actions in practice. This makes the government have restrictive measures to protect its interest from the though stipulated laws.Federal law No. 15 of 1980 does not allow any individual to publish and share anything before obtaining permission from the
authority. Article 14 of the law concerning publication does not allow the printing media to publish any material for any party that does not bear UAE nationality (Younies & Na, 2020). It is mandatory to seek authorization from responsible bodies to produce the documents. Furthermore, the authority decides what type of journal to be printed for selling in the country. Similarly, the law does not allow anybody to distribute the newspapers and other forms of publications within public settings or along main roads without approval from proper authority.The law permits the authority to perform editing to the printed materials through deleting or covering the sensitive parts that are not allowed to be published. Before distributing the materials to the public, both at the national and international level, print houses are required to present a sample of the journals to the authority for verification (Shishkina & Issaev, 2018). In case the media house produces a journal and its content contain what is not allowed to be printed, the authorization will be denied, or immediate censorship is performed to remove the section.Even though the UAE constitution allows freedom of expression where it links it with the country’s law, the regulation does not permit the liberty of communication. Media can publish any material but with adherence to the requirements (“UA E’s Constitution of 1971 with Amendments through 2004”, 2017). In UAE, the only publication the print houses and journalists are free to share is pro-government documents and voices. Anything that goes against the authority needs approval and possible editing
before airing or sharing through social platforms.In 2012, UAE formulated a law to help in combating the effect of cybercrime in the country. In relation to the Federal Decree No.5 of 2012, the legislature has taken advantage of the bylaw to enhance its restrictive measures on the freedom of media (Younies & Na, 2020). The regulation limits the liberty of expression and publication of documents that are against the religion, ruling authority, and other sensitive aspects that the government protects. This makes the decree have negative impacts on the country’s print houses and journalism practices. Dissemination of information and images that are perceived to put in danger the security and interrupt the public order attracts heavy punishment to the respective reporter.Various news reporters in the country have been arrested and persecuted concerning violation of the penal codes set by the UAE authorities. This practice makes the journalists lose their rights and freedoms in the country (Zayadin, 2021). Both local and international correspondents who go against the requirement can be charged and sentenced to prison for violating the regulations. The oppression media receives makes it difficult to exercise their freedom of the press, which results in the publication of distorted information for public consumption.In the country, journalists are not allowed to publish information about private individuals. According to federal law No. 3, media is only allowed to print any information with the consent of the targeted person. This regulation is aimed at preventing damage to the reputation of people in the country (“Supervision Policy,” 2022). It, therefore,
and reputation of the government and other persons.The practice is important in limiting cybercrime activities that can harm the victims mentally and financially. Increased technology exposes citizens to various dangers from preys willing to extort innocent citizens their rights. Keeping in check what is happening in the media platform would reduce possible exploitation such as blackmail through accessing images and sensitive information of someone. Therefore, government intervention plays a significant role in managing the threats making the public have a private life.In summary, UAE’s constitution has not provided firm ground for the rights and freedom of journalists. The lack of clarity makes it challenging for print houses to operate and offer their services effectively in the country. Limiting the freedom of the press reduces access to vital information and promotes the secrecy of the government from reaching the people. Such federal laws as Federal Decree No. 5 of 2012 deny the media freedom of publishing materials about individuals without their consent. Similarly, the constitution guarantees the liberty to communicate using any form of media but subjects the freedom to the law. The country’s authorities are allowed to exercise censorship of the published materials before their distribution to the public. Violation of the penal regulations may attract heavy punishment on the journalists and media houses. In this age of technology, repressive measures are essential in ensuring the protection of the citizens from the effects of cybercrime activities that might destroy reputations.
The jurisdiction of the journalism operations is dictated by the constitution of the United Arab Emirates (UAE). According to Öztunc & Pierre (2021), the UAE is ranked 119 in the global press freedom data, classifying the country as one of the most suppressive regarding the liberty of expression. Activities such as government censorship, bad press, limitation of journalistic opinions, and sanction threats are examples of oppressive measures to freedom.Various agencies, including the Universal Declaration of Human Rights (UDHR) and the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and International Cooperation (MoFAIC), have created proactive measures to portray press freedom (United Nations, 2021). However, the restrictions such as judicial harassment and censorship indicate a significant gap (Constitution, 2004). The reason is that the constitution is the only major directive that is binding, offering no absolute rights. Therefore, the advantages of giving partial liberty to journalistic activities are to maintain peace, control the media, and protect the repressive regime’s interests.The freedom of independent reporting is the first indicator of press rights. The UAE’s rank in the global mark index portrays a system afraid of journalistic independence. This factor indicates that freedom is suppressed to ensure that the government controls everything on communication and information sharing (Öztunc & Pierre, 2021). According to Momen et al. (2020), half of the media fatalities occur in countries not at war. The UAE is known for business establishment and unmatched infrastructure, indicating high levels of peace and prosperity (Öztunc & Pierre, 2021). However, the right to expression is limited by the constitution that is ironically supposed
to protect their freedom.A story published by the Canberra Times news coverage depicts the level of repressive legislation against the media. Prosecutors in the UAE charged a sports journalist for leaking pre-match comments before the match between the country’s team and Iraq commenced (The Canberra Times, 2021). The journalist was then imprisoned after being convicted of hate speech and disruption of public peace. It remains unclear how his reporting was a hate speech considering the fact that he was reporting about the probability of a win, lose or draw in that world cup qualifier match. Through this incident, other broadcasters were also fired as punishment for disloyalty to the nation (The Canberra Times, 2021).Article 30 of the UAE constitution indicates that freedom of expression shall be granted verbally, in writing, or within the limits of the law (Constitution, 2004). It is accurate to argue that the sports journalist had not defied the law since they were giving their opinion considering the description of this law. However, federal law no. 5 of 2012 indicates that sarcasm, defamation, and upsetting the public order through sensitive expression is illegal and can attract a jail term (Constitution, 2004). This statute creates a thin line between what is legal or unethical since the basis of judgment will depend on who is offended.The constitution’s provisions have created a leeway for oppression by justifying censorship, bad press, and limiting opinions to protect individual interests. The importance of this system is to fake justice through the partial implementation of the mandate prescribed (Öztunc &
Pierre, 2021). Such fragmented provisions enable the government to falsify, distort or conceal information concerning matters directly affecting its citizens for political mileage (Constitution, 2004). For instance, most media platforms in the UAE have not intensively addressed the issue of journalists’ unfair imprisonment, judicial executions, and deportation for fear of being punished, as indicated in the law (Momen, 2020). Such patterns have enabled the killings, torture, and harassment of media personnel’s an underreported plaque resulting in the surging number of deaths and imprisonment reported in the country.It is illegal to criticize the government, its affiliates, or any constitutional monarch or governing authorities. The Federal Law Code, no. 15 of 1980, is a statute governing privacy to journalistic commentaries and Publication and is one of the most stringent laws in the Arab world (Constitution, 2004). The regulation allows for censorship and the prior distribution of national and international periodicals. The code justifies the reason for the scanty resources available addressing the extrajudicial killings occurring in this country. Through this censorship, harassment thrives, making it easier for the government to popularize propaganda and sustain authority.Ideally, freedom of the press should include the right to publish articles without being monitored and provide journalistic commentaries. The importance of such a system is to support better governance, eradicate impunity, and promote factual knowledge. When the media depicts information with accurate data, citizens can identify issues in government and communicate them for overall societal change (Momen, 2020). They can also use accurate information to promote justice by calling offenders to face the
law (Momen, 2020).Moreover, the constitution protects them by imposing lethal sanctions on those who defy federal law no. 3, amended in 1987 (Constitution, 2004). This penal code law prohibits the press from publishing any information about the country’s rulers without consent. This limitation indicates that even if a ruler is involved in a graft case, the public will only get to know this crime if the ruler agrees that the allegations be published. Therefore, citizens have been left in the dark considering that commenting or publishing information concerning the rulers could attract a defamation lawsuit, which has promoted peace.The advantage of partial freedom of the press is promoting governance and peace within the country. The reason is that, in the contemporary world, people understand their rights and would push for reform in case they notice any misappropriations in their governing systems. Therefore, censorship and judicial threats have controlled how the media portray certain individuals considering that the constitution protects them. Laws such as federal law code no. 15 of 1980 require that all public publications pass through a government editing system to ensure that none of the things written tarnishes their image. Many other laws protect the rulers’ interest, including federal law no. 5 of 2012, which threatens those who slander the government’s image. This situation raises curiosity about whether the constitution is for the people or an extension to protect the government.
Improper management and decision-making by Enron led to great problems. Because of this, it is particularly necessary to study the fundamental principles of company management. They emphasize three most important aspect such as the planning, organization, and control of activities. Based on this information, management planning is a valuable part of the functioning of the organization. However, it may change the fact that not all changes and decisions of the company can be met without resistance from employees. Another performance indicator is the relationship between management’s performance and employees’ perception and organization.This aspect plays a unique role for the organization since good employee relationships and diversity in the workplace are critical for making the most profit. Communication and various barriers associated with multiculturalism can affect the inability to increase the performance indicators of employees. This may manifest itself in the impossibility of adequate and correct communication of people among themselves, which requires the introduction of special measures to unite the team. Among them, the first may be the creation of a favorable atmosphere in the workplace (Lan et al., 2020). This measure implies the introduction of various team-building practices and the division of work tasks between groups.Management Plan RecommendationsFirst of all, it should be emphasized that with the help of the fundamental principles of management, the company can not only improve its key performance indicators and profits but also gain a leading position in the market. In addition, it will help in creating comfortable conditions for employees and will have a positive impact on the decision-making
Future DirectionsBased on a detailed review of the corporation, it is worth identifying clear vectors for future development. First of all, Automatic Data Processing makes software for managing the HR side of enterprises. This includes outsourcing of personnel management through the ADP TotalSource cloud platform, payment of salaries. In both segments, the company receives revenue from interest from the placement of client money in the bank. The company manages the payroll of clients, and until the employees of the serviced enterprises receive a salary, Automatic Data Processing can dispose of this money, this brings 3.7% of the company’s revenue. The latest report does not provide information on overseas sales (Bauer et al., 2019, p. 77). The Fiscal Year 2019 report indicated that overseas sales accounted for 14.2% of the company’s revenue, with the remainder being done in the US. The combination of the above facts suggests that the company needs to move towards attracting customers and investors.At the same time, it should be noted that Automatic Data Processing has extremely effective tools for fulfilling such goals. Given that the company is tied to HR, investors expected a powerful drop in profits and revenues in the second, coronavirus quarter, when most of the economy was quarantined. According to the annual report, the company has approximately 810,000 customers, none of which contribute more than 2% of its revenue (Bauer et al., 2019, p. 98). This is an essential key because it strengthens ADP’s bargaining position: big clients like to haggle and demand big discounts.In addition, there is another
vital vector for the development of a corporation, namely technology. The bottom line is that at the moment the atmosphere in our country is favorable for the potential of corporations working remotely. The same affects Automatic Data Processing, which needs to be given maximum attention in modernization. In addition, technology allows not only to improve existing products but also to create new ones (Wolters Kluwer Editorial Staf, 2021). However, it is worth emphasizing that it is expensive and unprofitable to do it yourself, therefore it is intertwined with the previous goal. Finally, companies should pay attention to the process of connecting organizations, that is, combining them into common databases. In this case, the quality of the services provided by the organization will not suffer, but the costs of maintaining Internet resources will significantly decrease.Potential Problems and RecommendationsDespite the stability and growth of the company, it is worth noting that it is worth considering potential problems that you may encounter. It’s important to note that while the company doesn’t disclose what percentage of SMB revenue it generates, it’s easy to assume it’s very high. Of the company’s 810,000 clients, 640,000 are small businesses, 70,000 are medium and large, and 500 are large corporations (Allman-Ward & Allman-Ward, 2018, p. 64). Another 65 thousand are companies outside the United States, probably quite large. In general, Automatic Data Processing certainly earns the main money in small enterprises. According to a survey by the American National Federation of Independent Enterprises (NFIB), American entrepreneurs need help. 22% of entrepreneurs plan to start
An outstanding history concerning India touches on its moral icon, Mahatma Gandhi. Also called Bapu, Gandhi was India’s first prime minister after helping the nation attain independence through non-violence actions. Instead of using armies, Indians used fasting to compel Britons to leave the country, making it (India) very unique. Studies on ethics never proceed without mentioning Gandhi. Bapu holds almost the same respect as Aristotle on morality and the need for social stability. Bearing an association with Gandhi thus makes Indians very happy. Many people and organizations in the republic purpose to promote the first primer’s morality standards, with some attaining significant success. However, Gandhi’s philosophy on the nation’s social, economic, and political realms is highly corrupted. Therefore, the following discussion reviews the leader’s principles on morality, inter-religious relations, and long-term influence. Covering the leader’s canons on the different aspects helps differentiate Bapu’s real stands from today’s tarnished interpretations.Morality has several meanings, including the system of standards and values differentiating good and ill. Ethics is the philosophical brand under which character is studied. Aristotle and Mahatma Gandhi are the two renowned morality leaders in history. The former was a Greek scholar with profound influence on global ethics, while Gandhi’s inspiration mainly thrives in India. Mahatma was India’s first prime minister after helping the nation realize independence through non-violent means. Several literary sources contain the leader’s values for the Indian and global citizens. However, Tushar Gandhi stands out as a reliable primary source for those seeking Gandhi’s philosophy on morality. The author is the great-grandson of India’s
first prime minister and provides straightforward narratives bearing the reality on the icon’s stands.Gandhi’s morality covers several subjects, including politics, parenting, integrity, social interactions, and the use of fasting as a tool. Bapu views political leadership as an opportunity to serve, not exploit people. The leader also maintains the need for politicians to remain below the law to protect its (the law’s) sanctity (144). Gandhi starts his speech by apologizing to the audience concerning the family’s inability to provide another icon. According to the author, almost all the individuals in the Indian government and political arena go against Bapu’s morality principles. Gandhi (142) refers to the current public insults among the Indian leaders in fighting corruption as a significant deviation from Mahatma’s principles. Anna is a public icon who thinks that calling the other leaders names amounts to cleansing oneself. Instead of tarnishing the other party’s reputation, the speaker maintains that the best way is to ensure that one is clean and then use the proper channels to bring the corrupt folks to account.The use of fasting in contemporary India also goes against Mahatma Gandhi’s principles of morality. Gandhi (142) says that Bapu’s mission thrives on making the means and the ends equally important. Accordingly, the fasting public figures must know why they are doing that to cause the appropriate effects. To reiterate this account, Gandhi (141) provides a narrative featuring Bibi Amutussalam, one of the nation’s renowned female public figures. Bibi was a social worker in Noakhali and a disciple of Bapu. A social conflict
involving the destruction of an Indian temple in the village and the stealing of liturgical swords from the worship center by Muslims takes place during Bibi’s days, according to Gandhi (142). The disciple then tries retrieving the swords by going into the Islamic villages but fails. She then results to fasting to force the two conflicting communities to come together and the Muslims to return all the three stolen swords. The community returns two swords until the twenty-first day of Bibi fasting, during which society members seek her to take something.Bapu’s response on learning about Bibi’s actions implies the need for considerate fasting. Bibi refuses to eat until all the three swords taken from the destroyed temple are back. Coupled with the disciple’s importance in society, Bibi’s many days of fasting make many people afraid. The two rifting communities also come together to take care of Bibi, who remains adamant. On learning about the incident, Mahatma Gandhi writes to Bibi, asking her to be clear on whether her fasting is to bring Muslims and Indians together or is meant for personal destruction (Gandhi 142). However, Bibi decides to maintain the fast against Bapu’s advice. Consequently, Gandhi responds with the following words, which show the need for consideration when fasting for the public good.“She is unyielding. And if she wishes to die, then let her pass on. She does not comprehend or recognize that the intention is to bring together the hearts and not retrieve the weapons. Let us not discard our time on her…” (Gandhi 142).Mahatma
Gandhi’s moral principles on the judiciary demand that the government’s arm remains fair to all the people regardless of the political class or social status. According to Gandhi (145), India’s judicial system lives significantly contrary to Bapu’s moral requirements. The author notes that many poor people go to prison for minor offenses, while the powerful operate over the law. Furthermore, even the acquitted low-class Indians continue staying in jail because no lawyers will help them get out. Many acquitted fellows need someone to deliver their exoneration letters from the courts to the prisons, but no one is ready to undertake the job. Instead, almost all the attorneys in India cherish working for the wealthy individuals exhibiting corruption cases. The lawyers use their influence and law knowledge to secure the corrupt elite group’s freedom (Gandhi 145). Accordingly, India’s courts and lawyers fail to live by Gandhi’s moral philosophy and should change.Mahatma Gandhi’s ethics on parenting also want parents to control the amount of freedom granted to children. Gandhi (144) provides a narrative involving Bapu and Arun, his beloved grandson. According to the author, Arun wants to take his grandfather’s photograph after securing a camera. He requests the senior Gandhi to take the snap, but Bapu denies requiring Arun to pay five rupees for the photo (Gandhi 144). The requirement comes from the fact that Gandhi charges public members interested in acquiring his signed autobiography, a project that Arun manages. The Arun one day takes his grandfather’s photo when the icon is busy. On learning about the grandson’s
action, Mahatma confiscates the camera until Arun’s parents pay five rupees to the prime minister. The matter makes the great-grandson very hungry because he believes he should never pay for something he owns; the grandfather. Gandhi realizes Arun’s madness, after which he softly tells Arun that failing to do to his grandson what he does to the public denies him the moral authority to exercise the policy on others.Mahatma Gandhi’s moral principles object to the “eye for an eye” practice in Indian politics today. Gandhi (145) compares Anna and Manish and Mahatma, Hitler, and Winston Churchill to show the difference. According to the speaker, Anna and Manish present a mistaken version of Indian politics by engaging each other on the stage. Instead of retaliating, Gandhi (145) insists on turning the other cheek to the oppressor for the sake of peace and morality. Nonetheless, the speaker notes that ignoring the accuser forms the best way to turn the other cheek and not give up one’s face for buttering (Gandhi 146). Consequently, the account reiterates Mahatma Gandhi’s non-violence actions, which Indians need to re-introduce for real ethicalness. Other moral values from Bapu’s ways include perseverance, moral victory, and conservation, which are lacking in contemporary Indian and global societies.Mahatma Gandhi’s ethics on inter-religious associations maintain the need to quit dogma-based religion and faith to a belief system that appreciates humanity and its shared origin. The former prime minister thus disregards violent religious systems that brand people and other religious groups as “others”. Other than taking religion as an alien
of literary material concerning the movement shortly after Gandhi’s death explains the bulging void (Weber 247). However, the absence of adequate literature regarding Gandhism rhymes with the leader’s sentiments that his life should be his story (Weber 248). The argument leads to noteworthy reviews and bibliographies on Gandhi’s work and deeds in the twentieth century, with some writers viewing him as an influential figure over the period. Consequently, Mahatma Gandhi continues to influence people differently, including politically and religiously, as per Weber (253). Nonetheless, reviving the works about the leader promises to cause more impact relative to today, thus transforming the world.In conclusion, Mahatma Gandhi remains one of the most outstanding leaders worldwide. The fellow’s moral teachings and life serve as adequate influencers towards morality. Gandhi is specially credited with the non-violence demonstrations using fasting and hunger strikes. The leader utilized this strategy to secure India’s independence, which he calls moral victory. India continuously shifts away from Gandhi’s ethical principles in several aspects. For example, the nation’s current politicians engage in corruption and public insults against Gandhi’s “cheek philosophy.” Other issues covered in this work concern Gandhi’s stands on interreligious links and his long-term significance.
queen of the Swedes was given no name, her identity being secondary to her status as the king’s wife, Onela. The males, such as Hrothgar, Beowulf, Wiglaf, and Unferth, occupied the majority of the storyline of the poem. As a result, mentions of women are few and far between in comparison. “…the Helming woman went on her rounds…treating the family and the collected troop,” the poem says of a woman who fulfills traditional gender responsibilities as a character Beowulf (Heaney 620). The passage represents the expectation of women in the eleventh century, that they should look after males and be gentle. Queen Modthryth was presented later in the tale as the antithesis to Queen Hygd, who was autonomous and despised by men. “Even a queen of great beauty must not overstep like that,” they said dismissively. (Beowulf 1940-1941), until she married Offa, who rewarded her for her self-control. Queen Modthryth was only considered acceptable by society once she married, implying that women had less value unless they were married.
2021. Zulaika (2022) examine to what extent the pandemic affected sexual and reproductive health of adolescents in Rarieda subcounty. The study shows there was a limited involvement of health administrators on the issue of pregnancy among school girls. Teenagers lack sexual education and are not aware of different methods of protection. Health administrators should find this issue important as early pregnancy can be dangerous for girls’ health and lead to various socio-economic problems in the future. Moreover, if such a rate of adolescent pregnancy continues to increase, there would be less educated females in Kenya. Zulaika (2022) also mentions that stress level of pregnant teenagers is high, affecting mental as well as physical health of young future mothers. To tackle this issue, Zulaika (2022) suggests implementing population-level emergencies on girls that are going to school. Students should be educated for the basics of sexual education and for the side effects of sexual life. Furthermore, the article points out that infectious diseases can be spread rapidly if school girls do not know the importance of contraceptives. As such, there is a need to the national project of informing school students and their parents about sexual and reproductive issues. The effects of COVID-19 on teenage pregnancy are negative, causing additional social and economic problems not only for the pregnant girls and their families but also for the whole country.
In the prehistoric and ancient works of art, the representation of women and men reveals a massive imbalance in gender equity that favors men over women. The males were presumed superior and of great salience in the community, while the females were viewed as subordinates (Seejarim). The Venus of Willendorf is the first prehistoric art that presented women in art, and it was discovered in Austria. Perceptions of gender have been transformed into visual arts and representations. During the Old stage, men and women played different roles and responsibilities in the family (Seejarim). While men were assigned hunting, women were responsible for gathering, caring for children, and preserving racial conformity.Unlike most women’s artistic depictions, the Venus of Willendorf, found in Austria, celebrates the female body without sexualization. The woman of Willendorf was seen as a fertility figure for recreation, fetish of good luck, and a representation of motherhood made by men for the appreciation of men (Seejarim). This is evident through the characteristics of Venus; she is soft, and round, her breasts are large, and her hips full.The Kouros statue represents the male gender, and it depicts them as powerful and muscular, suiting their dominating roles over the female gender. This artistic work represents the society that has been taken over by the boychild in the importance of leadership and supremacy in the community (Uçar). The Venus of Willendorf portrays the role women have been assigned in society based on their features like large breasts, enlarged hips, and round, signifying that women are responsible for giving
IntroductionThe patient is a 32-year-old woman who has missed her menstrual cycle over three weeks and continues visiting a tanning salon weekly. She does not take a folic acid supplement because she has no concerns about her pregnancy. The decision to have a maternal serum marker test is recommended to check the mother’s blood. It helps identify any birth defects or chromosomal disorders known as genetic pathology that could provoke developmental or cognitive delays in a baby (Wojcik et al., 2020). The primary care provider offers a plan of care, including 600 mg of folic acid daily and education on the risk of skin cancer.Pathology: Explanation and Plan of CareThe plan of care does not contain serious steps but taking supportive supplements and education on the possible tanning-related risks like skin cancer. Ultraviolet radiation (UV) from human-made sources may affect the fetus’ birth weight due to nitric oxide exposure and the mother’s overall health (UVA reduces blood pressure and challenges the immune system (Botyar & Khoramroudi, 2018). The patient should consider the relationship between oncogenesis and pregnancy and consider folic acid to maintain birth defects.Teratogenic Effect of Not Taking a Folic Acid SupplementPregnancy is a period when a woman experiences many changes in her health and basic needs, and the task is to make sure the fetus receives enough vitamins. Folic acid is a common supplement during pregnancy to make new cells and prevent the development of the teratogenic effect. Folate deficiency leads to increased neural tube defects observed in 5 to 20 per 10,000 births
qualities as possible.I would use the principles of utilitarianism to support my claim. This theory is based on the view that everything is ethical if it contributes to as much good for as many people as possible. GMOs can help people overcome one of the major problems that is famine. GMOs are resistant to harsh environmental conditions, so people may grow more crops and other important plants. Millions of people still starve and are in need of food, so the production of more food is beneficial for all. Of course, some use the deontological approach and state that it is simply wrong to interfere with genetic codes as it is the divine domain. GMOs are seen as people’s attempts to play God, which is morally wrong. However, I would stress that even according to the Bible, humans were given the planet to take care of it, so using innovative tools is another way to follow the Christian postulates and take care of all creatures.
IntroductionGenetics and genomics refer to two concepts that keenly study genes which are the basic operational unit of a living organism. Both genetics and genomics offer invaluable insights into the structure and function of the human body. The knowledge acquired from these two fields is vital in dictating the development of medicine and other health sciences. This essay is an analysis of these two fields and consists of six crucial sections. The first part differentiates genetics from genomics, enabling the distinction between the two disciplines. The second section offers invaluable insight into the role of nursing in the two fields. The third section highlights the ethical consideration in research into the two fields. The fourth dwells on the global utilization of genetics and genomics research while the fifth is an analysis of the influence of various factors on the utilization of genomics and genetics in healthcare. The final section is the conclusion that pieces together the knowledge from all the sections and offers direction. Genetics and genomics are amongst the fastest-growing fields that highlight the next crucial stage in healthcare development hence their value is undeniable.Differences Between Genetics and GenomicsGenetics refers to study of genes and their functions in the inheritance of various traits amongst humans. This field analyzes how human beings pass down various characteristics to their offspring and the processes involved in the transfer (Marchant et al., 2020). This study also analyzes the impact of the genes transferred to various people. Genes are the primary unit studied in genetics and this term refers to
basic units of heredity. Genes carry instructions that direct the manufacture of various proteins within the body. These instructions coordinate the manufacture of proteins such as hormones, enzymes, cells, and muscles.These proteins are crucial in regulating various biological functions including sleep, growth and reproduction, breathing, digestion, and cognitive activity amongst others (Marchant et al., 2020). Genetics also identifies the diseases that can occur whenever an error is encountered in the ability of genes to direct the activity of the body. These diseases include cystic fibrosis, Huntington’s disease, and phenylketonuria and exhibit heredity (Marchant et al., 2020). This implies that the study of genetics can identify people at a high risk of developing these diseases and predict whether offspring can have them.Genomics on the other hand is a recent terminology that describes the analysis of all of a human’s genes, referred to as the genome. It investigates the interaction of these genes with each other and the person’s environment. Genomics also studies complex diseases such as heart disease, asthma, diabetes, and cancer since these diseases are caused by genetic variation. Genomics aims to offer new possibilities for therapy, diagnostic procedures, and treatment for some complex diseases (Marchant et al., 2020). One of the most remarkable contributions of genomics is stem cell therapy that enables the replacement of the faultiest cells in the body using cells referred to as stem cells. These stem cells can develop into any human cell and are therefore cultured with this sole purpose. Once ripe, these cells are used to replace injured body
organs and ensure healing.The Role of Nursing in Genetics and GenomicsNursing ensures the role of genetics and genomics through its involvement in research. The nursing profession encourages the involvement of professionals in research initiatives that enable the growth of this field (Beery et al., 2018). Additional research enables the discovery of new knowledge that is vital in ensuring disease is combated. Nursing also contributes to genomics through the popularization of the alternatives presented by these specialties. Nurses are some of the most exposed healthcare professionals, dealing with many patients. Their widespread interaction provides them with an opportunity to impact knowledge to millions of people whenever healthcare scenarios befitting the genomics alternatives are presented. Nursing also provides nurses with an opportunity to venture into a specialty of genetics called genetic nursing.The professionals within this field are called genetic nurses. The involvement of specialists within this specific field ensures that the specialty is accorded the serious focus it deserves. Genetic nurses are availed with ample time to focus on this field and propagate its growth through research and experimentation. The implementation of the techniques with a genetic background ensures that treatments with this base are fast-tracked and approved.Nursing ensures that the fields of genetics and genomics achieve practice and approval through the various nursing organizations. Global and national nursing associations have been at the forefront of ensuring that genetics and genomics are approved by the governments and global associations such as the WHO. This involves implementing their advisory mandate to the leaders in the healthcare fields and directing
them to approve genetics and genomics (Hickey et al., 2018). These efforts have put adequate pressure on these organizations to offer sufficient funding to this research and also approve clinical trials of the various suggested genetics methods. The increased attention by governments and healthcare organizations has in turn caused an increase in the usage of these services in general and the growth of this field. Accessibility for more people has also been made possible with developing nations also embracing this revolution in healthcare.Ethical Considerations with Research Involving Genetics and GenomicsWhen genetic and genomic research occurs, the data on the genomic sequence of individuals is required to be accessible to these participants. When this data is availed, it may reveal disturbing discoveries such as the possibility of developing cancer within the next few years. This is worrying for a patient who was previously unaware of the possibility and may cause anxiety in the patient and their families (Coughlin, 2020). The ethical issue of whether human beings want to be aware of what is happening in their bodies arises here. Additionally, the individual may be informed of the possibility of the occurrence of a chronic illness such as diabetes from genetic research. This disease may fail to occur and cause unnecessary worry and panic for the individual and their family, causing widespread mistrust in genetics and genomics.Alternatively, the information about an individual may be discovered and withheld by the researchers. The aftermath of this is that a patient may develop the discovered condition and succumb to the disease
partly due to late discovery and inadequate preparation. In this situation, the researcher is seen to have committed ethical injustice to the participant and harm public trust (Coughlin, 2020). In other scenarios, the researcher may be required to reveal the data collected on the genetic differences between the individuals participating. The variations may display some individuals negatively with a myriad of conditions likely to affect them in the future. In the unanticipated circumstances when employers or health insurance companies access this information, they are likely to discriminate against people.Employers are likely to offer opportunities to individuals unlikely to develop a chronic disease that would be unprofitable due to sick leaves. Insurance companies are also likely to charge people with the likelihood of developing chronic diseases differently from others. This creates the issue of inequality and possible discrimination based on genetic predisposition.How Genetics and Genomics Research is Conducted and Utilized GloballyGenetic and genomics research is conducted in willing individuals whenever the researchers have a specific hypothesis to test. The research requires the necessary approval from all the organizations involved including the government institutions involved. This research requires the involvement of high-level technology that enables the analysis of the data. Additionally, researchers must collect samples from their participants or patients, extract the genetic information, and carry out the tests required (Stark et al., 2019). Genetic research is conducted whenever researchers want to establish the impact of certain environmental factors on various human aspects. This research is also conducted whenever there is a need to establish the possibility of
certain individuals developing certain conditions. This is mainly guided by heredity whereby one family member contracts a certain disease and there is a need to rule out the possibility of others having the same disease.Genetics and genomics research has been vital in advancing cloning, a technique that replicates exact copies of desired organisms or cells. Cloning is vital in developing identical cells for a certain organ and replacing the damaged cells in that specific organ (Brown, 2020). Cloning identifies the exact genetic composition of the damaged cells and initiates protocols that generate replicas. This includes the generation of cells for a damaged liver where a researcher acquires cells from the victim.They sequence these cells and grow replicates of the liver cells before replacing them to ensure the patient has a functional liver. Genetics and genomics have also been vital in the development of medicines for the treatment of various conditions. The study of the genes and the various processes involved has been crucial in enabling researchers to identify certain pathways that can be manipulated (Morrell et al., 2019). Upon identification of a pathway that is affected in the occurrence of a certain disease, researchers develop medicines that target this mechanism. The drugs rectify the error and prevent the occurrence of the anticipated disease or reverse the damage to assure health for the victim.Impact of Culture on Genetic/GenomicsGenetics and genomics are well-advanced fields in healthcare that have achieved massive challenges in usage due to cultural and religious beliefs. Some people may have access to these services but
western medicine oppressed their ancestors are apprehensive towards genetics and genomics.ConclusionIn conclusion, genetics and genomics are crucial healthcare fields and promise to revolutionize the handling of disease and health. Genetics deals with the study of genes and their influence in inheritance while genomics prioritizes the entire human genome with an aim of combating genetic diseases. There is a surge of healthcare professionals oriented to prioritize these fields, including nurses. Nurses play a key role in familiarizing genetics and genomics with most of their patients while contributing to research that increases available knowledge. Genetics and genomics encounter ethical challenges due to the impact of the knowledge discovered during genetic research.The research acquired from genetics and genomics has been vital in bettering cloning and pharmacokinetics. This is essential as it promises to combat more diseases through prevention before their occurrence and cure before their deterioration. Genetics and genomics also encounter difficulties arising from family differences and religious differences. There is a need for widespread sensitization amongst all people on the importance of genetics and genomics. Further research into the two is also paramount to ensure more alternative treatment protocols are discovered and perfected for the sake of the patients.
The first farewell address to the nation in US history was made by the country’s first elected president, George Washington. In the fall of 1796, a letter of 32 handwritten pages was published in the Philadelphia Daily Advertiser. This address, which became Washington’s real political testament, is still considered one of the most important documents in American history. Washington’s address contained many ideas that for more than two hundred years continue to have a direct impact on US foreign and domestic policy, as well as on the process of formation of the American nation. The main thing that Washington did was that he refused to hold the presidency for more than two terms, although he had the right to do so: the amendment to the US Constitution that legalized this rule was adopted only in 1947.Analyzing Washington’s farewell speech, it should be noted that the president not only said goodbye, but also gave instructions to the entire nation. He considered the most important element of the success of the state and society to be the preservation and promotion of peaceful coexistence with all forces. Such forces include not only neighboring states, but also different races and religions. Washington himself repeatedly refers to God’s laws, believing that they condemn any discord or disrespect (Sands, 2019). Just as in the Bible there is a ban on the creation of an idol, so the president did not advise becoming attached to any strong players in the political arena; instead, he insists on America’s independent incremental development.However, Washington’s position on
despot will be fueled by turmoil and suffering which will eventually push the citizens to seek security in the form of absolute power of one person (Sands, 2019). Thus, Washington most of all warned the nation against possible mistakes leading to the modification or destruction of the democratic system of the state.Based on the foregoing, Washington is not only a president who said goodbye to the nation for the first time before leaving, but also a kind of visionary. He repeatedly reminds society of the importance and uniqueness of democracy, the essence of which is to ensure a better quality of life. At the same time, the president warns citizens about potential mistakes that could lead to radical negative changes. Finally, modern history shows that some of Washington’s words were prescient.
Ghalib is an Indo-Persian poet that was writing in the Urdu language and became popular and influential in the XIX century. The lifestyle and conduct of Ghalib were inspiring people, saving faith and belief in their hearts during harsh times. The poem chosen for this assignment is “The “Godless” Lover.” The name of this work refers to the Islamic government dubbing Ghalib godless. Still, in many lines of the poet, one can find Koranic characters and reflections about the relationship between a human and the Creator. Ghalib, in this poem, emphasizes the meaning of God to his soul and puts special stress on the initial presence of God. All the people, according to Ghalib, are the result of creation that would not have mattered if they existed or not without God. It is especially evident in the following lines:When there was nothing, there was GodIf nothing had been, God would have beenMy very being has been my downfallIf I hadn’t been, what would it have mattered?Various tones come across in the poem: negative and positive, and it might depend on the reader and his current condition. Ghalib states that God has always been there for a human, and even if there is no hope and it seems that the world has ended, God will be there to help each soul. The tone of the narrator depends on the perceptions of the reader, his experience, and his current state. The author of this paper tends to believe the poem’s tone is positive, and it reminds of eternal
Things such as trees, streets, people, and clouds all belong to Non-Existence: they are only shadows thrown by a genuinely existent sun.” The genuinely existent sun here is God, and all the people, nature, and other inevitable items of human life are shadows. Staying close to the sun is staying close to God and self. Then all the other aspects will have meaning in each soul’s lifespan.Indian culture is unique and many-sided, and after hearing the poems sung, the impression from the artwork becomes more meaningful. Some parts of the human soul answer more actively when they hear music. Songs in Indian manner have various qualities of tone hypnotizing and relaxing the listener. The major impression after watching the videos can be described with words calmness, belief, honesty, and truth. Listening to the poems discloses the meaning of the poem deeper and differs significantly from reading the text.Ghalib is a central figure in Indo-Persian culture as he transferred faith via his poems, raising essential questions for a human. The most important items for an individual are hope and the connection to it, seeking the answers to the initial existence of things, and staying devoted to it. Ghalib was an example of a strong person who never lost hope even after harsh moments of his life. The poem “The “Godless” Lover” underlines the attitude of Ghalib to God and God’s connection to human beings.
The issue of the internationalization of companies is a phenomenon that has consistently attracted the attention of researchers in the field of management. In the last decade, the focus has shifted from considering the benefits and risks of internationalization to studying the strategies of international companies operating and developing. However, it should be remembered that globalization acts as a kind of institutional environment for global companies, characterized by high uncertainty and risks and a non-monotonous, dynamic nature.The main incentive for the globalization and internationalization of the company is a significant expansion of market opportunities, both production, and trade.This is also connected with the benefits gained from implementing an international strategy, namely the growth of the company’s market, economies of scale and learning, and, of course, the advantages of new locations. Many companies from developing countries such as China, India, and Taiwan are active in global value chains in high-tech sectors of the economy (Stallkamp & Schotter, 2019).However, this fact leads to the fact that there is the broadest range of problems inherent in international companies in these countries. For example, emerging markets often have inadequate government oversight and regulation levels, leading to global companies’ unethical and criminal trading practices. For example, a typical example of this is the exploitation of cheap local labor to make production more affordable for international businesses (Mashan, 2021). This is morally and ethically appalling in the extreme but will have dire consequences for the company in the future.Given the benefits of international diversification, some firms choose not to expand internationally for several reasons. The most common of these is the reluctance to go beyond the domestic market of their homeland (Paul & Mas, 2019). This suggests either an unwillingness to face the risks of globalization or an initial calculation of opportunities, taking into account only the company’s home market factors. Moreover, an important reason for the rejection of globalization may be the awareness of problems faced with a foreign market, its characteristics, and potential consumers’ culture, religion, and customs. Thus, the global strategy has its colossal advantages and disadvantages that can push the company away from this approach.
sales to reduce the forecasting error. Specifically, the mean absolute deviation and mean standard error for the initial weights (0.1, 0.2, 0.3, and 0.4) was 6.27 and 47.29. In contrast, when the new weights that give more importance to the recent performance (0, 0, 0.4, and 0.6) are applied, the mean absolute deviation declined to 4.81, and the mean standard error declines to 27.28. This performance is better than the simple moving average.Gnomial Functions Inc. should use the weighted moving average to determine the likely level of sales in the next year. This method is simple, effective, and reliable. In addition, it can be adjusted to reflect the changes in sales trend by adjusting the weights to give the requisite importance to the recent months. Therefore, the company should use weighted moving average to estimate the likely performance in the coming year.
layoffs, which means many people will have live on the state allowance. The inability to find a job is the next cause of the crisis. What is more, the level of poverty will raise making people abandon their homes. Individuals will not be able to afford necessary items as well as paying rent. Hence, I consider a recession as an undesirable event for myself due to its damaging nature.When considering the crisis from a professional point of view, the crisis affects the national economy as a whole, affecting not individual enterprises, but the entire sector of the economy. There is an increase in the cost of credit resources and the difficulty of attracting them. In addition, there is a threat of deterioration of relations with international partner organizations. In general, the crisis is an undesirable phenomenon due to its devastating effects and unpredictable consequences.
ArgumentPrivate companies have dominated the United States freight transportation system for a long time. They also control passenger transportation systems, but the control is shared with the government, unlike freight transport. Through fees, tools, and taxes, government transport departments can safeguard the public best interests in the passenger transportation industry. In contrast, government departments do not have a means to directly control or foster innovation in intermodal freight transport partly because of the resistance by trackers. In their book, Konings et al. (2008) suggest that the US government should be the catalyst for innovations in intermodal transportation. This argument can be justified by looking at a historical example of how a government-supported initiative has outperformed the free market-driven industry.Why the US Government Should Be a Catalyst for Innovations in Intermodal Transport SystemsI agree with the author that the government should act as a catalyst for intermodal transport. The government brings tremendous benefits in transport and regulates limitations posed by the free market economy. This type of economy brings a problem of lack of interconnectivity and interoperability. This challenge is evidenced in intermodal road-rail transport because different parties use different resources. Private-owned intermodal transportation systems are different because they lack a centralized control unit that regulates the designs. Transportation is an essential aspect of the lives of Americans, and the time wasted when interconnecting problems occur leads to massive losses. For effectively centralized control to be achieved in such centers, the US government needs to step in and assist in innovation, ensuring uniform standards and compatible systems
of intermodal transport principles.JustificationThe days of the US Department of Defense (DOD) being the global leader in defense technology are over. This is despite being the most funded defense department in the world. The declining dominance is attributed to the department’s public-private partnerships to procure technological resources. On the other hand, the nuclear power production industry, which for unavoidable reasons, is left in the control of the government, continues to prosper. The state’s role in the mode of governance of the nuclear power socio-technical system is very central to its success (Borrás & Edler, 2020). It offers transformative, innovative, and responsible leadership in a conflict-filled field. One of the conditions for the development of intermodal transport is better access to intermodal logistics networks offering appropriate line and point infrastructure (Przybylska & Dohn, 2019). This can only be achieved by the government as private investors seek to maximize profit at the expense of productivity, as observed in the case of the DOD.
Historical BackgroundAn area of almost 653 thousand square meters, located in the territories of Southwest Asia, historically belongs to the state of Afghanistan. Afghanistan has no access to the sea or the ocean and is adjacent to other states from all sides. Thus, the country’s western borders are connected with Iran and Turkmenistan; to the north, it is adjacent to Uzbekistan and Tajikistan. On the southeastern side, Afghanistan is entirely bordered by Pakistan from the Gulf of Oman. Notably, the entire area of the state is located in the Iranian highlands, so much of the region is represented by mountainous and hilly terrain (Allchin, 2021). The Hindu Kush mountain system is the most represented there, as its hills, up to 7708 meters high, extend from east to west of the country. However, this does not mean that there are no plains there. On the contrary, to the north of the country, close to Tajikistan, Afghanistan has the Bactrian Plain, which contains a unique geographic area in the form of an extension of the clay-sandy Karakum desert. There are also mountainous depressions and valleys along other borders of the country, representing valuable clay and sand resources for the population.Geographical reasons fully determine the local climatic conditions, the impact of which is clearly visible in the Afghan vegetation. Thus, the climate there is typical subtropical continental, with the predominance of monsoon winds. In the summertime, the weather is usually hot and dry, but the local conditions rarely become cold with the onset of winter. Afghan summer temperatures can
reach 122 ℉ while temperatures rarely drop below freezing in January (Allchin, 2021). While winters on the eastern side of Afghanistan are primarily cold, closer to the north and south, temperatures tend to be more comfortable and warmer. Most of the rainfall occurs during the winter and spring. At the same time, all river systems and lakes present in Afghanistan are brainless. This means that there is no system of underwater connections, and any flow of water is mainly related to its surface evaporation. As a consequence of a combination of climatic and geographic factors, the local flora is mainly characterized by aridity. Desert landscapes of the country, uniquely combined with mountainous terrain, give the country a large number of herbaceous plants, including cereals, legumes, and other flowering crops.Afghanistan is, first of all, a country with rich ancient history. Paleontological discoveries suggest that Afghanistan appears to be more than five thousand years old, and some argue that it was inhabited as far back as the late Paleolithic period (Allchin, 2021). The extended history becomes the reason for the wide variety of nationalities that inhabit Afghanistan. The largest populations here include Pashtuns (42%), Tajiks (28%), Hazaras (10%), Uzbeks (8%), Charaimaks (2.6%), Turkmen (2%), and other underrepresented nationalities, including Arabs, Mongols, and Kazakhs (AFP, 2021). Multi-ethnicity is the reason for the bilingual and trilingual nature of the local population: Afghans are generally fluent in Afghan and Persian, both of which belong to the Indo-European family of languages. As of 2021, Afghanistan’s population was 40 million before the events
of the Afghan August (WPR, 2021). This diversity of multi-ethnic communities is reflected in the cultural and religious code.For example, most Afghans are typical Sunni orthodox Islamists. Among such followers, militancy, and bloody revenge, uniquely combined with hospitality, is often prevalent. The classical role of women as submissive mothers and faithful wives is also derived from this (Onsutti, 2019). In a sense, we can point out that Islam for contemporary Afghanistan is the bridge that connects disparate nationalities and smoothes out conflicts. Alternative religions are poorly represented and discouraged there: conversion to Christianity is punishable by death, and both Hinduism and Protestantism are prosecuted.Groups Represented in AfghanistanAfghanistan’s political life is associated with American and Soviet intervention, jihad, and terrorism. It might seem that the territory is the home of all terrorists, but that is not the case. By now, the fundamental religious and political groups fighting for power in Afghanistan are the Taliban, ISIS, al-Qaeda, and the Northern Resistance, which have weakened noticeably since the American withdrawal from Afghanistan (Wolf, 2021). It should be said that until August 15, 2021, when the country finally came under Taliban rule, Afghanistan professed a republican way with its president and constitution. Although there was an ongoing civil war in the country, Afghanistan was gradually moving away from the vector of Islamic radicalism and allowing more civil rights to the population.With the arrival of the Taliban, most of the reforms and gains of the last decade had already been reversed, and the progress made toward recognizing women’s rights and minorities
had been erased. The classical Taliban movement is fundamentalist: their primary function is to inculcate in the Afghan people the formerly rigid order of Islam, with a strong recognition of clan ties and the five pillars of Islam. The Taliban has extreme political ambitions, as the seizure of power and the restructuring of the state require severe political initiatives from the group. ISIS may appear to be an ally of the Taliban since, from the outside, it gives the impression that the two groups have similar goals. Some similarities in functions do not guarantee a partnership, as the Taliban and ISIS are officially considered adversaries. The first mission of ISIS supporters apparently began in 2014 with Pakistan, when representatives promoted joining (Nazish, 2014). A year later, having reached the peak of their geopolitical influence, ISIS leaders officially announced their entry into Afghanistan as an adapted Wilayat Khorasan movement (Paybarah, 2021). ISIS’s Afghan representation was based on refugees and migrants from Pakistan who took advantage of the hospitality of the Afghan people. Over time, ISIS Afghanistan grew in political and religious power, and the U.S., then still present in Afghanistan, facilitated the removal of key figures in the movement (Morgan, 2020). Unofficially, but in fact, it was an act of cooperation between the U.S. military and the Taliban to eliminate a common serious enemy. Ultimately, the Afghan ISIS was defeated, and the leaders were either executed or imprisoned. Meanwhile, on August 26, 2021, ISIS claimed responsibility for a terrorist attack at the Kabul airport as thousands of
The YouTube video published by GP Synergy, “GP Training in Aboriginal Community Controlled Health Services,” sends a message that Aboriginal Medical Services play a crucial role within the diverse community. The services are essential for providing culturally sensitive and high-quality care to the target populations, often marginalized and underserved, ensuring they have everything they need to tackle rising health concerns. The comprehensive set of services provided by the medical facilities ensures that the patients from the Aboriginal community have access to affordable and convenient health care. One service can support multiple aspects of clients’ lives.The comprehensive approach toward culturally-sensitive care is especially relevant in addressing the social determinants of health (SHOD), which encompass multiple areas of the population’s health, well-being, and quality of life. SDOH includes safe housing, neighborhoods, convenient transportation, racial discrimination and violence, education, income, job opportunities, access to nutritional foods, low-quality air and water, and language and literacy skills (Healthy People 2030, 2020). Therefore, the Aboriginal Community Controlled Health Services aims to address the health disparities and inequities that most Aboriginal patients encounter (Pearson et al., 2020). The professionals working within the Aboriginal Community Health Services framework underline the importance of patient education to ensure that the population is aware of its potential health challenges and knows about the necessity of early prevention and management.The prominent SHOD that is being discussed in the “GP Training in Aboriginal Community Controlled Health Services” video is discrimination. The health center workers acknowledge that many of their patients have experienced discrimination in the healthcare system and want to receive culturally-sensitive services (Kim, 2019). Providing such services is challenging because healthcare workers do not know what to expect from each patient and must be prepared to carry out culturally sensitive services (Jongen, McCalman, and Bainbridge, 2018). Care continuity is especially relevant in this case because when patients feel that they are being discriminated against or misunderstood, they are less likely to return to their providers to continue treatment or screening for their core health concerns.Even though implementing culturally sensitive care and addressing the SHOD of discrimination is challenging for providers, it is also highly rewarding. The patients discriminated against want to feel accepted, understood, and cared for. Because of this, the workers of the Aboriginal Community Controlled Health Services institutions always prioritize building meaningful relationships with their patients (Luft, 2017). Besides, the professionals have noted that they have taken the role of advocates who support their patients in terms of healthcare services and their acceptance in their immediate community and the larger society.Therefore, the work of Aboriginal Community Controlled Health Services professionals entails consistent collaboration between themselves and their patients who feel underserved and misunderstood. To conclude, addressing the social determinants of health that affects the Aboriginal community is a demanding process that requires dedication and focuses on the unique needs of patients coming to a facility to receive culturally-sensitive care. Undoubtedly, the process will take some time because healthcare providers must be well-prepared and well-versed in the social determinants of health affecting their clients.
The cultural effects of Roman dominance over the Greek-speaking regions is a fascinating topic that has attracted great scientific interest, especially in the last couple of years. The impact of the interaction between two cultures varied in time and space and was definitely more prominent in places where Roman communities had emerged. These communities served as the so-called influence vectors, and their long residing alongside Greeks resulted in the transmission of Roman elements into public life.One of such elements was Roman names, the dissemination of which may be explained by the existence of networks of exchange and the sense of identity of name bearers. Rizakis (2019) notes that the introduction of the Greeks to the Roman system of naming with its further adaptation to their norms and the Roman names adoption by peregrine Greeks are two different phenomena. However, they both are examples of the interaction process between the two traditions, which gradually led to the appearance of a common onomastic culture. This acculturation form, increased in the 2 nd century AD, showed wide regional variability, and the reception of it was different in different cities and social classes.These cultural transfers were mostly mediated by civic elites, as their purpose was to pass on their influence by name – both in a regional context and more broadly, on a system level. Tria nomina, in particular, and its use in the imperial period especially, as stated by Rizakis (2019), was a source of pride, power, and prestige. Due to this, some names became popular as expressions of the shared culture and were accepted and adopted, albeit on a small scale, by the lower classes as well, having lost their original meaning.However, the dominance of Roman names as the distinguishing signs of the Empire’s free citizens took place for a short amount of time. As per Rizakis (2019), by the end of the 3 rd century AD, a new way of identity expression appeared – a single naming system using separate Greek and Roman names. At first it was used sparingly but after the reign of Constantine – and especially during the period of late antiquity – it started being employed in almost all Roman provinces. This change, advanced by Christianity’s progress and the Roman Empire’s decline, might be deemed as a return to the Greek naming tradition.
The ancient historical texts on Minoans published by Halsall reflect some facts about their history discovered much later than these accounts had been compiled. Namely, Plutarch’s story about Theseus demonstrates the notion of the lack of defensive works in Crete. According to this text, Theseus invaded the island’s port and captured it quickly since its citizens mistook his navy for their own. This detail could remind the truth: Minoans were merchants and did not develop extensive safeguards. Moreover, Herodotos’ text depicts the extinction of Cretans, which corresponds to the archeological data, although they mention the eruption as the main factor for the demise of Minoans.British Institute at Ankara’s video about Helen of Troy is quite informative about the representation of women in ancient times. As such, Helen was perceived as the most magnificent and feminine person for many centuries in Athens as well as Sparta. Moreover, it is known that she became worshipped as a goddess in Laconia. Greeks often depicted Helen via the use of the most precious materials, which signified the importance of this character. This woman was traditionally perceived as a seducer and even the cause of sorrow in the Ancient Greek culture. Moreover, the image of Helen of Troy has surpassed time and is still used as a euphemism of beauty.Evelyn-White’s translation of Hesiod’s Theogony presents valuable knowledge about the Greek religion. Hesiod describes the gods as anthropomorphous beings who at the same time have natural power or represent parts of the universe themselves. For example, the Earth and the Heaven are
the types of women created by Zeus and primarily serve as an eternal punishment for mankind. Semonides describes females that are not beautiful in a sarcastic manner, yet he condemns women who care about their appearance and hygiene. Moreover, he complains about females that care about their household too much, as well as about ones who keep it not in the best ways; irritation expressed by wives also disappoints him. A proper married woman, according to Semonides, should be like a bee: working with joy and caring for her family. Furthermore, she should be a competent householder and not participate in raves with her girlfriends.Sappho’s Hymn to Aphrodite is an exciting piece of poetry for several reasons. First, it implies that the mortals and the gods can interact; people can pray for the help of the divinities and expect it to be fulfilled. This notion suggests that gods can be both benevolent and cruel, and the fate of humans is always at their will. Moreover, this poem indicates that Aphrodite is a goddess of love who interacts with human relationships by exercising her powers. So, by begging Aphrodite to end the struggle and enter the fight, Sappho invokes the wreath of the goddess for a human being that has disappointed her love affairs.
The way of life of South Sudan honestly does believe bulls to be vital; they are utilized in numerous services and butchered to take care of the whole family. Grey Bull is a film that mirrors the social meaning of the bull to South Sudanese individuals. Grey Bull , composed and coordinated by Eddie Bell, is a short film of around 15 minutes that reviews the antagonism between Martin, a South Sudanese man, and the owner of his cows’ slaughterhouse.The foundations of Bell’s story look back to the 1800s when one more novice to Australian shores was thinking of himself in the set of history books. “The principal part of a thought was that I needed to make a cutting-edge Ned Kelly story,” the video director uncovers in a discussion with Short of the Week.Grey Bull includes some strong creations, yet it is the strength of the story and the exhibitions that truly got many viewers’ attention. It is not difficult to see why director Bell won recognition for such a guaranteed film. At the point when relocation is a hotly debated issue around the world, it’s invigorating to be given a story circling a migrant that genuinely feels like it’s introducing a good perspective on one such excursion.A tale about leaving your past behind so you can zero in on your future. Grey Bull is a film that incites its crowd into taking on the perspective of its principal character and poses a few significant inquiries about displacement.The film has neither saints nor great intrigues,
making it exclusively about a man character emergency. However, in some way or another, the effortlessness of the visuals and nuance of the themes makes it agreeable to watch and adequately fascinating to rewatch once more. The visuals are dazzling to move the more oversimplified case. Every scene in this short film is without a hitch and intentionally shot with the viewer’s goal generally well.Every shot is calculated and sufficiently bright, frequently emphasizing the perfect thing with impeccable timing, providing a way to picturesque guidance, where the video director will deliberately place spotlight and upgrade on a particular setting, article, subject, or conceptual point to pass on a message or feeling in the scene.The shading reviewed in the film is fresh, great, and satisfying to the eye; no blasts or channels are essential – each edge of this short movie is satisfying when watching. Away from the camera works, Grey Bull has a surface to the entire job, a belief, and a mood that intensely influences the audience’s feelings during the review.The climate or lighting assumes a severe part in each shot, frequently making the generally tranquil and tired film significantly more cloudy and toiling. However, this does not jeopardize the movie; it makes the occurrence considerably more reasonable and exciting. This is wholly built build-up by the strained and semi-off-kilter story of binding together and absorbing clashes with the living.The movie stays away from platitudes and tells a legitimate and consistent biography of a man loaded with inward struggle and compelled to pick either his
IntroductionGroups are common in almost every aspect of human life. They can be formal or informal and are found at home, school, or the workplace. Groups feature people with shared responsibility and objectives. Collaboration is vital as the workload is spread among the members. Communication, sacrifice, and tolerance must be in plenty, given that different personalities are involved. Group leadership is an essential skill that determines the group’s success by creating a relaxed atmosphere, keeping the group focused on the goal, and mitigating conflicts.Type of Group: WorkplaceI work in the sales department as a supervisor managing 20 members. Our role is centered on pushing sales and making more profits for the company. As a group leader, I have the responsibility of ensuring that our objectives are aligned with the overall company objectives. Unfortunately, my group is laden with some behavioral challenges such as time management and resistance to direction, which affect performance negatively.Encountered ProblemsMissed TargetsSome team members have been missing the weekly sales targets, and most of the culprits show no signs of improvement. At first, the issue was with three of them, but the problem has escalated and now affects almost half of the team. Because of this, the overall team performance has been compromised. As the leader, I need to address this to inspire everyone back to their winning moods.Poor Time ManagementPart of the reason why the team is underperforming is poor time management. The work policy stipulates that all staff should report to work at 9:00 A.M and leave at 5:00 P.M. However,
some of the staff in my group do not always observe time. Reporting late takes away some hours that could otherwise have been used to generate more sales and thus boost performance.Resistance to DirectionAs the group leader, I am responsible for developing strategies that I expect everyone to follow. While some members always cooperate in supporting me in the role, some have fashioned themselves as a resistance faction. The group often rejects most of my ideas during meetings and tries to pull the rest toward their position. This has hampered progress as we spend too much time on unproductive arguments and counterarguments.Low MotivationMy team’s motivation has been on a downward trajectory for the last two months, which is a worrying trend. The low motivation forms the foundation for all the other challenges currently affecting members’ performance. This is a grave concern, given that performance is dependent on motivation as a significant factor. A preliminary investigation shows that my members are not satisfied with the current working conditions.The solution to the ProblemsThe identified problems are all behavioral and could be solved through some approaches proposed by behaviorism psychologists such as Ivan Pavlov and B.F Skinner. Human behavior is subject to change based on modifying factors such as motivation. Positive behavior should be reinforced to flourish, while negative behavior should be discouraged to diminish. As a group leader, I would approach the problems from a behavioral angle employing such techniques as classical conditioning, positive reinforcement, behavior shaping, behavior modeling, reinforcement schedules, and punishment where applicable.Classical ConditioningDeveloped by Ian
Gustave Moreau is a renowned Symbolist who invoked the motifs of ancient myths in his works. An example of such a work is Jupiter and Semele , which he painted in 1985 in France (Smith par. 1). The story expressed on the canvas originated from Ancient Greece, afterward assimilated and revoked by Romans. Namely, Jupiter, the supreme god of the Roman pantheon, fell in love with Semele, a mortal woman, whom he impregnated. His angered wife, Juno, tricked Semele into pleading with Jupiter to reveal his genuine appearance before her. This wish was fulfilled, yet the divine nature of Jupiter’s emanation was above the limits of what a human can perceive and suffer, so Semele died, and her child was cut out of her body. Moreau’s work depicts this tragic plot and indicates the theme of the difference between humans and the divine by portraying Jupiter and Semele on the border of heaven and the underworld.The mentioned piece of art might seem somewhat baroque because of the excessive sumptuous details. The central figure in the painting is giant Jupiter with luminous thunders haloed over his head. He sits on a throne, enriched with Eastern-style figurines and jewel-like flora, and holds frightened Semele, who bleeds and looks like a marble statuette. Above the god, giant columns penetrate the heaven; in the down part, various divinities and phantasmagoric creatures abide. Nearby Jupiter’s throne, Moreau placed an eagle, two struggling females, and a fawn, which would be identified later in the work. Although there is a clear symmetric composition
of the painting, its multiple elements make it difficult to discern the dominant images.Indeed, the central detail might be said to be Jupiter’s enormous body and visage. He wears countless ornaments and gems, as well as symbolic objects of various cultures: for example, Indian lotus and Egyptian scarab. These artifacts might signify the despotic nature of the heavens’ sovereign, similar to that of the Eastern rulers and Egyptian pharaohs. Moreover, the stern and penetrating gaze, aimed at the viewer of the painting, demonstrates the resolute spirit of the god. Hence, in Jupiter, Moreau portrayed the saturated divine essence, which is all-powerful and looming over humans.Next, Semele is highlighted by the whitish color of her skin and gown; she is also a dominating detail. Her appearance contrast with that of Jupiter: she is almost nude, with only some cloth laying on her leg. This image symbolized the nakedness of humans before the god, which is most likely Christian God, although Moreau uses symbols unrelated to Christianity. The newborn Dionysus, who is dispatched from Semele already, as seen by the blood of her body, is often compared to Jesus. Thus, Semele’s direct interaction with god demonstrates the inability of humans to conceive the divine because of the immense differences between them.Furthermore, three figures attract the attention of the viewer: the two sitting women and a half-man near Jupiter. From the left, the first female is Death holding a speared sword with blood on it and either covering her face from shame or removing tears with a piece of
meaning of the depiction of the upper world and the lower domain. The divine part, which surrounds Jupiter’s throne, is embedded with picturesque architecture, vegetation, and angelic figures appear in it. In turn, the downside of the painting illustrates, for example, Hecate, who was a divine patron of witches and sorcerers. The other winged or haloed divinities and creatures are also present. This is probably the human world, full of evils and unknown threats. This place and the heavens intersect with each other, indicating a connection between the divine and mortal.The other theme depicted in the work and connected to the contrast between human and divine might be rebirth. Namely, the death of Semele followed by the birth of Dionysus is the symbol of the uninterrupted cycle of life. Moreover, Dionysus is also considered a god, which means that although the differences between the two worlds are immense, they still have a connection and are interrelated. Hence, whatever cruel and non-benevolent God might be, he is still present in the lives of people.To conclude, Gustave Moreau’s Jupiter and Semele is a complex composition with a meaning that is not clearly defined. However, this paper demonstrates that the dominant symbols and elements of the painting all play role in contrasting human and divine nature. Thus, Moreau’s presentation of the ancient myth has a completely new sense from the original plot, somewhat affected by Christianity, although depicted with Eastern aesthetics.
IntroductionThe justice system in the United States of America was designed to fulfill a number of specific social and moral goals. It fulfills a retributive purpose, punishing those that are deemed to be unlawful or morally lacking. Alternatively, justice is also procedural, determining how people in society must be treated. Justice can also be restorative, aiming to integrate individuals back into society. The understanding of which aims must take precedence depends on the person. Once a person serves their sentence and comes out of prison, it is generally expected that they will be able to become a normally functioning member of society, capable of following its rules and regulations. However, in many cases, people commit more crimes after being freed.These types of individuals are often called repeat offenders, habitual offenders, or career offenders. Present systems of post-convict integration and the associated safety nets are considerably lacking, leading to many people struggling outside of prison. In most cases, repeat offender is not able to fully adapt to life outside of the criminal justice system, making them turn to the only lifestyle they are familiar with – lawlessness. Due to this fact, the US legislation also includes certain laws and guidelines for working with those who have previous experience with the justice system. The existence of Career offender guidelines is aimed at reducing cases of recidivism and discouraging criminal behavior. However, the actual effectiveness of such methods varies severely. This review will focus on discussing career offender guidelines and their effectiveness within the justice system.OverviewCareer OffendersFirst, the designation
“career offender” itself can be discussed. A person is considered to be a serial offender when they meet a number of criteria, including being over 18 years old at the time of a crime, being convicted of a violent or drug-related crime, and having at least two prior similar offenses (Burnham & Gorokhov, 2017). Meeting all of the above criteria makes one a career offender within the US justice system. When assigned such a status, it incurs a number of penalties with it, primarily focusing on the severity of sentencing. Usually, the minimum charge in court is increased, making any potential criminal repercussions more severe than they would have been otherwise (Burnham & Gorokhov, 2017). Additionally, the criminal history of a person considered a career offender is placed in a heavier category. The combination of the two results in most career offenders getting spending more time in the prison system. An individual is able to challenge their designation, and not all people are eligible for the title of a career offender.While the career offender system was designed in order to prevent repeat offenses and discourage criminality, the actual sentence limits were not established using empirical data. All of the increased sentences provided under this legislation are estimates. Additionally, it can be noted that the career offender system overlooks many types of crime prevalent in society. Corporate crime, theft, and inappropriate actions against others are not covered by the repeat offender guidelines.This approach makes the system especially prone to be ineffective or to target certain types of
people more than others. Due to the correlation between certain living conditions, income, and poverty, drug, and violence-related sentencing disproportionately affects social groups (Blankenship et al., 2018). In particular, black people are much more likely to be prosecuted for drug-related offenses. In regards to the career offender guidelines, this means that black people and other people of color find it more difficult to leave the prison system (Blankenship et al., 2018). Even in cases where an individual is able to serve their sentence fully, the actual process of adjusting to normal life often becomes too difficult. A disparity between sentencing outcomes and treatment negatively affects the wellness of non-white communities. Black men, historically the most vulnerable demographic for the prison system, are separated from their communities and left unable to integrate.Three-Strike LawThe three-strike law is a more general way of referring to systems such as the career offender guidelines. As evidenced by the name, these types of guidelines put heavy punishments on people after they have been found guilty three times. Designed in order to increase the punishment for repeat offenders, the actual way the laws are implemented depends on the state. Compared to the career offender guidelines, the three-strike approach focuses on certain types of felonies. Most states have implemented this law into action with varying degrees of severity. Life sentences are a large issue concerning the three-strike law, as the majority of people are committed to prison for life following their actions. In California, for example, no consideration is taken for the time between
each crime, meaning that a person can get a life sentence as a consequence of something they did many years ago.In addition, the three-strikes legislation also has other similarities with the career offender guidelines. The political aspect of criminal understanding is enhanced within this framework, and crimes considered to be more socially reprehensive become more likely to warrant increased sentencing Researchers also say that it is likely to be ineffective at preventing crime instead of working to promote social inequality. As discussed in work “Reimagining Criminal Justice”, the law was initially passed in order to keep socially detrimental individuals and outcasts away from others and safeguard the wellness of society. This meant that people such as murderers and rapists would have fewer opportunities to re-offend (Flores, 2020). However, with the current version of the law, most people under its influence serve sentences for non-violent crimes. The Three-strike system does not fulfill its stated goals and actively worsens the livelihoods of smaller offenders.First Step ActThe third notable piece of legislation is the First Step Act. Compared to the two discussed before, this law is used to help repeat offenders improve their standing. Signed comparatively recently, in 2018, the act was promised to lead to less recidivism. The legislation was designed in order to cut existing unnecessarily long prison sentences while also providing criminals with a framework of self-betterment. In addition, it was designed to make the present prison conditions better. Inhumane and violent practices of prison are cut short by the new legislation, limiting the amount of
physical and mental stress prisoners fall under. Additionally, the First Step Act gives judges more freedom to assign lower sentences to repeat offenders. Shortly after the time of its approval, 3100 inmates had the chance to be released back into society after sentence reductions ( The first step act of 2018: An overview ). The effects of the act were immediate, with people starting to get shorter time in prison ( The first step act of 2018: An overview ). However, the actual overall effectiveness of the law remains to be seen, as it has not been fully seen through on a country-wide level.RecommendationI fully disagree with the present implementation of career offender legislation and similar initiatives. While the stated goals of more thorough punishment as a method of deterrence are clear, their actual real-life effectiveness comes under heavy criticism. As shown by a number of researchers and examinations, the singular goal repeat offender laws consistently achieve is increasing the prison population. They are not conducive to reintegration into society, are destructive to communities, and don’t act as a sufficient deterrent. Currently, existing laws actively make it more difficult for people to move through the justice system. As noted by present research, the system of career offender guidelines is both largely inhumane, unable to reach their stated goals, and detrimental to society as a whole (Saltzman, 2019). The career offender laws target specific types of criminals, most notably those connected with drugs and violence, and make their sentences considerably harsher than they could have been.Black people,
Various cultures may imply certain practices towards medical preparations. Some of them may have no faith in modern medicine applications and prefer indigenous methods that have been in practice for generations. In Ghana, modern medicine is considered an expensive alternative to traditional curing methods. Due to doubt about its effectiveness and low health literacy, people are hesitant to consider it an option (Gyasi et al., 2016). This points to the negative impact of health beliefs in the region. Nevertheless, different ethnic groups’ health-related beliefs and behaviors can result in positive health and well-being and beneficial health results, significant and dangerous health consequences, or no detrimental health impacts and hence are harmless.In consideration of the medical administration, it is possible to point out several implications of health beliefs. One of such implications is the limitation of medication administration to the doctors or medicine men in western regions and only when a patient demonstrates specific symptoms. In community medicine, the prescription should be done by professionals with modern knowledge, insight, and moral obligations in the form of Hippocrates’s oath. On the other hand, some communities may rely purely on cultural methods of medication administration. Treatment methods may be administered based on bodily elements such as humoral imbalances manifested as too much “hot” or “cold” (Taek et al., 2019). Consequently, “Cold” conditions are treated with “hot” drugs, while “hot” diseases are treated with “cold” medications, restoring equilibrium to the individual (Taek et al., 2019). This demonstrates how such cultural factors as health beliefs may result in a large disparity
as people consider western medicine as deeply flawed and dangerous for consumption. They may consider lowering recommended dosages that sabotage the effectiveness of the drugs and have little to no impact on alleviating the symptoms resulting in prolonged sickness.One possible issue is adherence to medication regimens could be subjective attitudes regarding chronic illnesses. They regularly and negatively impact patients’ adherence to therapy regimens (Shahin et al., 2019). Taking patients’ comprehension into consideration while offering health advice and/or providing medical treatment is one of the challenges for health professionals in improving adherence (Shahin et al., 2019). Patient-related factors influencing adherence could be cognitive limitations and physical impairments, low self-esteem, substance abuse, lack of knowledge, and motivation. These factors may influence patients’ belief in the effectiveness of medicine and create a subjective perception of adherence which often increases non-adherence risks among older adults.It is possible to derive several intervention strategies that could improve adherence. These strategies include patient education, which can be characterized by telephone counseling sessions with professionals that would be recurrent and personalized (Kini & Ho, 2018). Another method is medication regimen management which could be used with patients that are hesitant to consume drugs due to the fear of side effects. It includes using combination pills so that patients will consume fewer pills daily (Kini & Ho, 2018). Nevertheless, it is necessary to consider that adherence will be determined by the practice’s or health system’s viability and availability.
Environmental FactorEnsuring the safety of a newborn child becomes the primary and most important task of parents. Especially in the first year of life, the child is unable to protect himself from damaging environmental factors. Examples of such harmful effects may be air and water pollution, excessive sun exposure, or dust and chemicals. This work analyzes the harmful environmental factors for a child under one year old and offers health promotion to protect newborns from harm.Sources emphasize that in 2012, almost two million children under the age of five in the world died due to the environment (“Children’s environmental health,” n.d.). The causes were respiratory tract infections, malaria, and various injuries and injuries. The most dangerous is that once experienced, illnesses and injuries can affect the child’s further development and its formation in adolescents.The main environmental factor is air and water pollution.Adverse environmental impacts and pollution substantially impact morbidity, disability, and in some cases, death. Thus, among the aspects that are involved in this factor are air pollution, inadequate water, and hazardous chemicals and waste that also pollute everything. Among the dangers are “lower-respiratory infections, diarrheal diseases, brain damage and inflammation, blood disorders, and jaundice” (“Air Pollution,” n.d., para. 2). Air pollution can be hazardous during the mother’s pregnancy since already at this stage, the child’s health will deteriorate. In addition to chemicals, there may also be harmful particles of dust and dirt in the air, which can enter the newborn’s body through the respiratory tract.Polluted water or lack of clean water for the child and
family can be very serious. This problem is particularly acute in developing countries, where people’s access to water resources can be severely limited. It is important to note that newborns are given water only on the recommendation of a doctor in the first months of pregnancy. However, water plays a valuable role in the functioning of the child’s body and must meet specific criteria to ensure safety. Minimal consequences can be poisoning or allergies, which can develop into more serious diseases.Another factor of harmful effects on the child during the first few years that are involved in environmental pollution is harmful chemicals and garbage. This is because children begin to explore the world around them after getting the opportunity to become mobile. Therefore, one of the ways to get acquainted with the new is a touch and a taste test. Hence, there is a possibility of stumbling upon substances that can be spilled on the street. Examples may be chemical poisoning or skin burn. Exactly the same properties are swinging garbage, which can harm the health of the child and affect the further development of the body.Health Promotion PlanThis part of the scientific work provides a health promotion plan that can which provide knowledge for caregivers on how to prevent and protect newborns from environmental risk. 1. Monitor what the child is doing both at home and on the street 2. Carry out water purification before use with the help of special filters. An alternative may be the purchase of bottled water, which will be intended
for newborns. 3. If possible, avoid places where there is a high level of air and water pollution near factories and production.In other words, it is necessary to maintain the necessary air quality, which is determined by the absence of excess gases, dust, and odors. To do this, it is essential to ensure constant ventilation in the room and to maintain a moisture balance in order to limit the occurrence of mold harmful to the newborn. All these actions are due to the fact that newborns have a high respiratory rate and a larger lung surface area in relation to their body weight. Due to the faster and more intensive immune system development, they are most susceptible to external environmental factors. 1. Ensure compliance with hygiene standards, which also apply to being on the street or in a public place. 2. To avoid poisoning with toxic substances, it is necessary to thoroughly wash vegetables and fruits before giving them to a child. 3. Avoid tobacco smoke and the smoke from burning things.Consultation with the attending pediatrician is necessary about what actions should be taken in emergency situations and the basics that are important to ensure the safety of the child’s health.This article raises the topic of such danger for newborns and the growing spread of sudden infant death syndrome. This is influenced by multiple external and internal factors, such as the high vulnerability of the body, the negative impact of environmental factors, and exogenous stress, such as sleeping on the stomach or a soft bed, during
polluted air from vehicles and various industrial plants. The source emphasizes the importance of creating strategies aimed at preventing the adverse effects of pollution on children’s health (Gouveia et al., 2018). Moreover, caregivers should pay special attention to airing the premises and avoiding the close proximity of the child to sources of polluted air. The information provided in the scientific article can also help monitor changes in health effects due to strategic interventions.One of the problems that external factors can cause is growth retardation in infants, which will have particularly serious consequences in adulthood. This health problem can worsen in the first few years of a child’s life. The authors state that “climate change will cause significantly more stunting through a reduction of food security” (2018, p. 551). This source provides recommendations and generalizations on environmental risk factors that were associated with growth retardation. Hence, if there is a threat, it is necessary to carry out measures to strengthen the health of infants, including steps to improve nutrition and take care of the condition of the room in which the child is located.
(US Department of Health and Human Services, 2018). The diversity of these elements demonstrates that one’s health is not just dependent on medical services or nurses and physicians (Nutbeam, 2019). The large range of activities that make up health promotion needs a diverse set of abilities from a number of health professionals and industries.Incorporating multidisciplinary specialists within the health promotion team, such as Nurse Practitioners (NPs), Social Workers (SWs), and Registered Nurses (RNs), will be advantageous in the long and short term. Nurse practitioners are nurses who receive further education and training and are capable of treating a wide range of ailments as well as providing preventative care and health education (Pun, 2018). Social workers have specialized training in assisting people and groups in developing skills and resolving difficulties. Whether the issues are personal, interpersonal, or social in nature, social workers can assist in guiding and resolving many of today’s issues (Nutbeam, 2019). Registered nurses examine and analyze healthcare needs in order to decide the best service or treatment, the best healthcare provider, and the best equipment to deliver patient care (Pun, 2018). Thus, their skills and approach will be essential in the success of an interdisciplinary team tasked with health promotion.
in the US and prepare a package of documents set out above. There are several airlines engaged in the transportation of ashes, one of the most reliable and well-known is Air France-KLM. In most cases, the tame frames are based on an agreement between funeral companies in America and the destination country.The consulate member I have had to communicate with is Julie Duhaut-Bedos. In addition, the flight booking service would be accompanied by the consulate’s help. Depending on the distance, it is necessary to book a direct flight or with a transfer. Furthermore, each airline offers individual conditions for the transportation of special cargo. The urn with the ashes of a loved one would be carefully sealed and placed in a special lockable box with dense walls. Transporting the loved one by plane is possible only in the luggage compartment.
Healthcare facilities and their staff ensure to establish effective emergency preparedness and response interventions to respond to disasters, terrorist attacks, and pandemic outbreaks. According to McNeill et al. (2018), health emergency preparedness is the capacity of the public health system and community to prevent and respond to healthcare emergencies. With adequate preparedness, healthcare providers become better equipped to handle health emergencies when they occur. Healthcare and emergency preparedness among rural communities are still low despite awareness of upstream readiness and social determinants such as inadequate resources, remoteness, and limited access to healthcare services.How I Provided Nursing Care that Addressed the Psychosocial Needs of Rural CommunitiesI provided nursing care to address the psychological needs of rural communities during the pandemic to conduct door-to-door screenings and education on the COVID-19 virus. The hallmark of this exercise was to burst the myths and misinformation about the cause of the virus, its spread, and the adverse effects of vaccination. The door-to-door screenings and education proved instrumental in recommending the need for testing the vaccine to rural households. We managed to screen 200 people in two villages on the first day during the activity, with only 3% refusing screening services.Our health team came across an elderly patient who was gasping for breath during the screening services and rushed him to the emergency department. Upon arrival, we conducted a triage on the patient to determine the severity of his condition and later registered him to the emergency room. I did compressions in the center of the patient’s chest to press down about
two inches. I did this with my shoulders directly over my hands while keeping my arms straight to help the patient stay alive.My health team provided nursing services that addressed the psychological needs of clients by creating and expanding telehealth services. The telehealth services included psychiatry that involved video communication with rural communities. For instance, telepsychiatry services facilitated communication and monitoring of patients through technology in real-time. According to Butkus et al. (2020), video-based telepsychiatry services help meet patients’ needs amidst the uncertainties resulting from the pandemic at affordable rates. The intervention was crucial in integrating behavioral health care and primary care to mitigate the spread of the virus.How Social Determinants Contributed to the Health Status of a Vulnerable Client I ServedSocial determinants of health such as poverty, low literacy, and unequal access to healthcare impact healthcare outcomes of vulnerable populations. One of the social determinants of health that contributed to the health status of a vulnerable client I served during my practicum experience is poverty. According to Khan et al. (2018), rural communities live on minimum wage and have generic poverty that influences access to care. This social determinant was reflected while I was offering door-to-door screaming in a mass testing exercise to mitigate the spread of the virus. I learned that the vulnerable client had limited resources to regularly visit healthcare facilities for screening and testing. As a result, the client foregoes preventive care and wait till their conditions are severe before seeking medication.More often than not, people living in rural communities have low
This support agency coordinates the efforts of community health centers, rural hospitals, local public healthcare departments, and other stakeholders to identify and address community health needs (Kearly et al., 2020). HRSA aims to improve access to healthcare by adopting coordination strategies to deliver quality care. The support agency will help rural communities improve their care outcomes by developing and strengthening care coordination.The Greatest Concerns about the Rural Population during Natural DisastersThe most significant concern about rural communities is their access to health services during floods and other natural disasters. Floods cause an unprecedented change in the demand for health services. Rural communities affected by floods experience disrupted access to medical services since it destroys roads and communication lines. Floods also increase the risk of infectious diseases by bringing debris and waste that contaminate water and food sources. Rural communities are adversely affected by floods that limit their access to medical services.In conclusion, rural populations’ health, healthcare, and emergency preparedness are affected by challenges such as poor coordination, limited funding, and geographical barriers. A wide variety of factors such as environment, income, and literacy determine the health of rural populations. The programs and policies to increase rural community preparedness to healthcare and emergencies should focus on addressing the underlying healthcare determinants to focus on upstream activities supporting resilience.
COVID-19 affected the world in various ways; however, the outcomes of the pandemic are not clear yet. One of such spheres which are still to be researched extensively, despite the colossal progress made so far, is healthcare. This is especially relevant for the mental health domain, as the major flows of resources in the healthcare sectors all over the globe are directed towards combating the main adverse physical consequences of the infection. Mental health issues receive significantly less attention; meanwhile, these issues are significant, especially for healthcare professionals, who suffer both physically and mentally from the enormous additional burden that the pandemic brought upon them. According to research, there is an “increased risk of acquiring trauma or stress-related disorders, depression, and anxiety” (Cabarkapa et al., 2020, para.3) for healthcare workers. Moreover, statistically, the risks are greater for nurses and female workers. Two primary sources of these potential problems are fear of the unknown and fear of getting infected.In such a dire situation, healthcare managers need to find new stress-coping methods or models for their healthcare facilities and workers. There have been various strategies tried in such a situation all across the globe, depending on resources that healthcare facilities possessed, cultural, social, and historical backgrounds of the communities. Some of the more researched strategies will be listed and discussed in more detail. The three main strategies to cope with healthcare workers’ stress are self-coping strategies, psycho-social interventions, and workplace awareness (Cabarkapa et al., 2020). It is possible to use and combine these strategies depending on the available
first country hit by the coronavirus. The strategy calls “to balance the work and rest hours for frontline healthcare staff, strengthen their occupational health and safety conditions, and improve crisis psychological intervention and counseling” (Zhou et al., 2020, para.5). Interventions included financial security and safe working environments, while healthcare workers were provided with psychological and mental health services online and on-site. The deployment of mentioned measures resulted in the overall improvement of healthcare workers’ mental health, reduced stress, and improved sleep.Finally, regarding workplace awareness, it is essential to understand that it is difficult for people to self-diagnose depression or other stress-related disorders in many cases. Especially in the emergency, when there is less time to reflect on and analyze one’s mental health. At the same time, the effect of stress-related disorders on healthcare worker’s own health can be devastating; moreover, this can negatively affect the quality of worker’s services, therefore, putting patients in danger. Thus, it is essential to provide constant monitoring of healthcare workers’ mental health status. The study by An et al. (2020) suggested organizing regular screenings for healthcare workers operating in emergencies. Such practices can help both healthcare professionals and the patients they treat.
and required a few easy guitar accords (Covach and Flory 119). Thus, the idea spread of folk being “for the people and by the people” (Covach and Flory 119-120). The concept was related to the music and the people’s ideologies, as the singers and the audience, united by social issues, expressed their concerns through songs.As folk was the music of people, it was also a movement characterized by many important figures. The Weavers consisted of traditional performers such as Peete Seeger and were one of the most significant folk groups in the US (Covach and Flory 119). The Weavers focused on societal problems and prioritized the simplicity of the music, gaining an audience among college students (Covach and Flory 119). At the beginning of the 1960s, The Kingston Trio was the most popular group that started the folk revival in the mainstream pop market (Covach and Flory 119-120). The Kingston Trio’s pop-sensitive approach was favored by the public and defined folk music for many general listeners (Covach and Flory 120-121). Considerable singers have represented folk music, supporting the movement of addressing issues within society.
One of the most significant forms of American folklore, which laid the foundation for such musical genres as gospel, blues, and jazz, was the spiritual chants of African Americans. The ancestors of African Americans were forcibly separated from their homes and brought to the United States to work on the plantations of the Old South. Descendants of hundreds of different tribes in Africa brought distinctive musical traditions that were destined to have a global impact on world culture. Spirituals were generally considered religious music, but they carried a much deeper meaning to the people who composed and performed them. African Americans faced severe restrictions even in arts and music. White planters tried to split the communities to prevent riots, and sometimes slaves were forbidden to speak their native language (Music for emancipation of African Americans, 2016-2017). Music has become a primary way of expressing inner feelings, grief, sorrow, and a sense of oneness with brothers and sisters in distress. It is a story about the strength of the human spirit, pure reverence for ancestors, and faith in the future.Frederick Douglas was born in 1818 in the US state of Maryland into a family of slaves. He despised American slave laws and actively tried to shed light on the terrifying events taking place in the country. Frederick Douglas’s lifelong goal was to fight slavery in all its forms, advocate total emancipation, and raise the moral standards of society. He perceived musical creativity as a way of raising spirits, prosperous fighting for a hopeful future, and a manifestation
about the life of African Americans. In the music, he saw the true feelings of his ancestors, but precisely through the prism of the Christian religion. A serious analysis of spirituals began primarily with the works of Du Bois, his final chapter of The Souls of the Black Folk , named The Sorrow Songs (Music for emancipation of African Americans, 2016-2017 ) . He viewed spirituals as anthems of self-determination and an expression of divine religious faith, messaged to God. It is a slightly different approach to the perception of African slave music, more revealing the religious aspect and its background.It is important to comprehend that one of the reasons people voluntarily converted to Christianity was the uncovered parallel in biblical stories with their real lives. The words were biblical, but the implications and meanings in songs were deeply personal. People could express their inner pain, protests, and the urging sense of the lack of justice. Gradually the Christian faith became the spiritual support of the slaves, which can be traced in the writer’s works regarding African American culture. The music of African slaves can be perceived from different angles, focusing on religion or, on the contrary, considering it solely a way to veil the true meaning from tyrants. The principal idea is unshakable: this is a monumental cultural heritage and the commencement of the prosperous crusade for freedom and equality.
features of Greek culture were borrowed by Rome, with minor modifications to fit their requirements.According to Polybius ‘ interpretation of the Roman government, the monarchy was solidified in the office of the Consul. The tales of Manilus Hippomanes, Olivier de Noyen, and Julien Barneuve are connected through history in The Dream of Scipio by a philosophical musing claiming that man is accountable for his action’s own redemption, but only by understanding, not by works or faith (Ruden, 2013). Rome had two chancellors, each in control of divisions of the Roman army and had the authority to convene conferences and present different initiatives before the Senate; they were acclaimed yearly.Citizenship in Rome was a complicated notion that differed depending on one’s gender, family, and status in society. Males were the only ones who could acquire full citizenship. A kid born of a legal union between a citizen father and a citizen mother would be granted citizenship by descent (Beard, 2015). Citizenship in the United States can be obtained by birth or registration. People are generally born U.S. citizens if they are born in America or are born overseas to U.S. citizens. They may also obtain U.S. nationality as a youngster as a result of the marriage of one or both adults.
IntroductionThe detailed investigation of clinical cases is a critical necessity for a health care system interested in improving the quality of life of the population and improving public health. It should be understood, however, that as far as the patient is concerned, their diagnosis is not always obvious, as it is often associated with subjective experiences of their own deteriorating health, feelings of stigma, and any possibility of inaccurate clinical tests. It is true that laboratory tests are a scientifically reasonable practice to refine the diagnosis as much as possible, but the possibility of human or instrumental error is never ruled out. Therefore, a comprehensive approach to clarifying the diagnosis, using a synthesis of scientifically based and subjective aspects of the course of the disease. This paper consistently evaluates an example of such a comprehensive approach, describing a case study of HIV infection.Background InformationAlthough it is not a societal issue, especially in light of COVID-19, humanity is exposed to several pandemics on a daily basis. One of these pandemics is HIV, as a huge number of individuals are exposed to this infection: according to statistical studies, the number of HIV-positive patients will exceed 37.7 million globally by 2020 (UNAIDS, 2021). People from every continent are exposed to the disease, which gives it pandemic status. HIV itself is an infection caused by the human immunodeficiency virus – during this disease, a pathogen from the class of retroviruses affects the patient’s immune T and B lymphocytes, resulting in lowered immunity. It is true that HIV has never been

This, in turn, negatively affects the ability to predict the required number of mental health workers. Secondly, potential crises and resulting inflation rates may cause a price increase, which, in turn, would necessitate additional money to purchase equipment and medication. Moreover, the costs for the services, training, and maintenance may also surge.Assumptions that can fill the potential holes in the project’s financial planAs for the former hole in the financial plan, it can be assumed that there will be an average demand for mental services among healthcare professionals. This assumption would help to partly mitigate the risks of the unknown need for offered services. It is explained by the fact that when the expected demand is low but the actual necessity is high, then the patients are largely underserved. On the contrary, when expectations are high, but the actual demand is low, it leads to substantial financial losses. As for inflation, it is necessary to assume a certain amount of money for unforeseen expenditures. Therefore, if the prices rise, the organization will still be able to pay for the planned expenses.
A house is more than simply a place to live; in fact, that is only one description of a house. A home is a place where one feels more comfortable and looks forward to living through every day. A house is constructed not with stones or timbers but with the link of family. A person may own every materialistic property on the earth, but it would be not very sensible if he did not have someone with whom to exchange it. In other terms, expressing pleasure is also linguistically tied to home. Additionally, home is more than a physical location; it is a state of mind. They share a sense of joy and pleasure with their family members.A home is when one understands they are around individuals who can run them nuts in a second and make them feel good in the very same second. Home signifies that no matter what one is experiencing or how difficult life becomes, there will always be someone watching out for them. When a person is secure enough to provide an honest account of themselves, they know they will be accepted definitively. For myself, I can single out a few places where I feel at home. This work was written with the aim of explaining one’s own concept of home and a place where a person feels at home.For me, home is made up of memories of memorable moments that contributed to shaping and teaching me. As a result, my house is also people, and when home takes on a
The coronavirus pandemic, which broke out all over the world for almost three years, completely changed the way of life of the modern world. Many researchers, journalists, and writers cover this topic and talk about various situations that can sometimes lead to shock. O’Connor Meg wrote about one of these cases in the article “Maricopa county moved homeless people to Sweltering parking lots in response to COVID-19”. This analysis aims to study this material in order to identify what actions were taken incorrectly and what consequences this entailed.People without permanent residence have become a particular threat to the spread of the pandemic. This is because this group has nowhere to live, and they often have close contact with each other, do not follow hygiene rules, and have minimal access to medical care. One of the opinions is that it is necessary to limit its causes with this problem. In other words, it is necessary to increase the level of social assistance to the homeless, increasing the availability of housing and social benefits. On the other hand, it is believed that homelessness and unemployment are psychological phenomena, and external factors cannot significantly contribute to their elimination. Thus, the COVID-19 pandemic and the situation of the homeless have become particularly acute in the United States of America.The incident described in the article under study occurred in Maricopa County. There, next to Arizona’s biggest homeless shelter, Central Arizona Shelter Services (CASS) has been hosting tents with homeless people for a long time (O’Conner para. 1). As a measure to
Homelessness is a major social, economic, and, most importantly, healthcare issue. There are currently hundreds of thousands of homeless people in the United States. If homeless people have already suffered greatly from a number of diseases before the pandemic, such as tuberculosis, HIV, drug addiction, and alcoholism, today COVID-19 is most prevalent among them (Canoso, 2021). The current American healthcare system is difficult to navigate under, even with the best of circumstances. For homeless people, the only medical care is being provided by hospital emergency departments. Emergency departments are costly and, since most homeless people do not have insurance, the money spent caring for these people can reach millions of dollars (Jain, 2021). However, even this amount of money does not solve the issue of homelessness; it only provides a temporary solution for people on the streets suffering. The current system of providing healthcare to the homeless is exceedingly expensive (Jain, 2021). In addition, it yields little to no actual result in caring for these people. This system requires a drastic change of the approach of solving the issue of homelessness to ensure people’s safety and sustainability of the economy.The complexity of caring for homeless people and the issues that led them to this state requires a highly coordinated partnership of major healthcare organizations. According to Tsai et al. (2017), homeless people, provided with improved housing outcomes and primary care services, move to a stable, healthy state relatively fast. As such, relocating the money to provide shelter and improve housing for homeless people would ensure a
spent; however, it would yield actual results.The change that can both provide effective care for homeless people and relocate the budget, making the most use of the money spent should be aimed at the long-term result. Most problems of the people living on the streets cannot be solved in an emergency setting. Compared to non-homeless, fewer homeless people keep appointments and take medications (Canoso, 2021). The complex behavioral and physical health needs of these people have to be met by the system of corresponding complexity. By providing the care now, the future need for it would be reduced proportionally with the decrease in the rate of homelessness. Since most homeless people are in no condition to attend medical facilities on a regular basis to achieve the long-term effects of the treatment they require, healthcare should be provided to them nonetheless. With more homeless people treated, the spread of COVID-19 and other diseases would decrease. Spending the budget on actual care for them now, resulting in the improvement of life of these people, means the reduction of the need for the said budget in the future.
IntroductionIn the United States, each state has its specially established laws regarding immigration on top of the governing federal laws. Consequently, some states have tougher immigration rules than others, depending on several factors. Some of these factors include demographics, geography, religion, history, and lawmakers. The state immigration policies shape the lives of immigrants in terms of education and socioeconomic status, among others. While Alabama and California have a relatively high immigrant populations, Alabama has tougher immigration policies than California.Immigration LawsIn Alabama, the immigration policy regarding access to education is more unfavorable to undocumented immigrants compared to that of California. According to “Alabama state immigration laws” (2019), a new immigration policy requires schools to run checks on the immigration status of students to track and collect data. This controversial policy restricts immigrants from accessing public and state-owned schools (“Alabama state immigration laws,” 2019). Furthermore, despite the court having halted this law, Alabama education institutions are still causing havoc for immigrant students by making it impossible to access equal education as other students.California, on the contrary, ignores federal laws to run policies that favor immigrants’ access to education. The state prohibits running checks for immigration status during the administration of students in schools. Indeed, California passed the Dream Act, which allows immigrants to pay equal tuition fee rates as other Native Americans (“California laws protecting immigrants’ civil rights,” 2019). The policy allows immigrant students to pay in-state tuition fee rates as those of public universities (Migliarini & Stinson, 2021). The in-state immigrants can also apply and enjoy tuition
fee-related financial benefits given to all students. For undocumented students, alternative ways of identification are allowed during the sitting of graduate exams.Theories of PowerAlabama’s strict education policy against immigration could be explained by the state autonomy theory. In-state autonomy theory, a state politically operates towards retaining its territorial integrity against the indigenous or ethnic demands for independence (Svarstad, 2018). Alabama’s political powers retain their territorial power by denying the immigrants the chance to grow in terms of education. By limiting their level of educational access, the state ensures that the minority will forever remain dependent on the majority.Pluralism, on the other hand, explains the large acceptance of immigrants in California educational institutions. Pluralism is the recognition and acceptance of diversity in a political body (Svarstad, 2018). This power theory permits the coexistence of various lifestyles, convictions, and interests. California’s political system supports diversification by allowing immigrant students to access equal education as the Natives so long as it achieves a stable and democratic political power. The state promotes power across various elite groups, including minorities.Other Factors Explaining the DifferencesDemographic is a major factor that explains the differences in immigration policies between the two states. In Alabama, at least 3% of its general population is immigrants. As of 2019, 27% of the California population was composed of immigrants (Kashyap, 2019). The higher population of immigrants in California pushes the states to create a positive environment for the majority as opposed to Alabama. Furthermore, most of the immigrants in California are located in urban areas, in contrast to
the majority of Alabama immigrants who live in rural areas.Socioeconomic status, history, and access to power are other factors that explain immigration law differences between the two states. Due to the lack of access to quality education and other public benefits as restricted by immigration policy in Alabama, the immigrants maintain low socioeconomic statuses compared to those living in California (Kashyap, 2019). In terms of history, California has a long history of having the largest number of immigrants, especially from as far as the 17th century (Kashyap, 2019). Alabama, on the other hand, has a shorter history of hosting immigrants hence the reluctance to embrace the ethnic groups. Lastly, California has easy access to power for immigrants considering their high population, which gives some immigrants a chance to be in political seats. Vying for a political seat in Alabama is impossible for immigrants, especially with the restricted I.D. application procedure.State of Migration Patterns in the StatesThe existing immigration policies in the two states have altered the patterns of migration, with California having vivid and Alabama with fading patterns. The tougher immigration laws in Alabama have significantly reduced the growth of the immigrant population in the state. In the past 20 years, Alabama has started attracting a sizeable number of immigrants due to high potential growth for the group (Kashyap, 2019). However, the recently aligned policies have made it harder for immigrants to access education, health, and economic stability. The lack of these major factors that play a great role in human development has seen a reduced
pattern of immigrants moving into the state. Although Alabama legalizes same-sex marriage, the patterns of migrations are likely to go graphically down in the future.California started to attract immigrants highly in the 1970s, and recent policies have increased the number of immigrants entering the state. In the United States, California is known to have the highest immigrant population, and the number is still growing in recent years (Kashyap, 2019). The favorable policies create a positive environment for the growth and development of immigrants in the country. The legalization of same-sex marriage in 2008 also played a role in pushing up the pattern of immigrants in the state. Furthermore, with more expected favorable immigrant policies, the patterns of migration to California will rise in the future.U.S. Supreme Court Prigg v. Pennsylvania, 41 U.S. 16 Pet. 539 539 (1842)The Pennsylvania statute of 1826 was deemed lawfully wrong for penalizing a slave owner that crossed jurisdictions to recover the slave. Edward Prigg, a citizen of Maryland State, was penalized in the court of Pennsylvania for forcibly taking a negro woman from the county to Maryland State. Margaret Morgan, a Negro slave, had escaped from Maryland to Pennsylvania in 1832. Morgan was the slave of Margret Ashmore according to the laws of Maryland. Prigg, as an agent and attorney to Ashmore, caused Morgan to be kidnapped and brought back to Maryland.The Pennsylvania law indicted Prigg for breaking the law which protected negro women from forcibly being taken and used for the slavery trade. The Pennsylvania court charged Prigg with felonies
States are under federal law, and even though they might develop laws in favor of the majority, their rulings may not hold in supreme courts. Concerning this topic, the U.S. constitution or federal law mostly favors Native Americans. The states have always wanted what is good for the minorities in the U.S. However, no matter how much the states may alter their policies to protect the immigrants, minorities will always be insecure about federal law.ConclusionTougher immigration policies in Alabama make it difficult for immigrants to thrive in the state. California, on the contrary, has policies that set a positive environment for immigrants to prosper. The differences in the policy development in the two states are based on the immigrant population, history, access to power, and geography, among many other factors. As opposed to Alabama, California continues to have a rising pattern in migration activities. The pattern is expected to keep rising in the future while that of Alabama declines due to imposed immigration policies. The U.S. constitution has always put the interest of the Native Americans first despite the presence of minority ethnic groups in the country.
In the article “The influence of peers during adolescence: Does homophobic name-calling by peers change gender identity?” the authors claim that negative name-calling among peers can lead to a change in gender identity. Firstly, this is because negative experiences with peers of the same sex result in the need to identify with peers of the opposite sex. Secondly, during the period of growing up, the adolescents’ identity is not yet fully established. Therefore, they are constantly re-evaluating whether the identity formation is going in the right direction. DeLay et al. (2018) recognize that homophobia can be directed at homosexual and heterosexual adolescents. This is presumably because the purpose of victimization is to hurt someone’s feelings, not point out real flaws.Gender identity development is a critical stage in developing a personality occurring during adolescence (DeLay et al., 2018). Since homophobic name-calling is a form of victimization, this practice should be frowned upon or banned in schools. Ioverno et al. (2021) note that “bullying GNCV may represent a defensive reaction to demonstrate bullies’ gender conformity” (p. 215). Therefore, work with bullies should be carried out competently and with the participation of a psychologist.Interestingly, Ioverno et al. (2021) highlight how this statement is especially true for male bullies. That is because their “own gender conformity can affect the selection of victims based on their gender conformity” (p. 216). It is critical to understand this mirror interaction to resolve the issues of gender victimization. Equally important, victimization of adolescents, including LGB, trans, and heterosexual high school students may lead to “anxiety, depression, and substance use disorders, especially among sexual and gender minority youth” (Valido et al., p. 602). This is another valuable observation that indicates the need for concomitant prevention practices of substance abuse among adolescents. No less important, substance abuse should be perceived as the consequence of psychological problems.
The first mention of a homosexual act is found in the Old Testament Book of Leviticus. And it is said there about this in a prohibitive manner: “Do not lie down with a man as with a woman: this is an abomination.” (Leviticus 18:22) The Apostle Paul says the following: “Just as men, having rejected natural intercourse with women, burn with lust for one another: men do shameful deeds with men, preparing for themselves the retribution that they deserve, having gone astray.” (Rom 1:27) First of all, when talking about homosexuality – the scriptures talk about “intercourse” or “lust,” but not about orientation in the sense that homosexual people today have in mind – an equal love relationship between two partners of the same sex. Homosexual relationships have been shared at all times and in all societies. However, the idea of ​​”orientation” as a property inherent in a particular person is relatively new; it appears only towards the end of the 19th century, making it difficult to directly compare the phenomenon of homosexuality in the context of Christianity (Kuefler 1256). The second important point is comparing religious books of homosexual relationships with a relationship with women. Homosexuality existed in the ancient world and the Middle Ages – but it was never understood as an equal union.In the Christian world, the execution was supposed to be for sodomites. In England, sodomites were executed until the New Times; for a long time, homosexuals were one of the targets of the Inquisition. The Code of Justinian in Byzantium provided severe punishments for them: up to castration and the death penalty. Given the high religiosity in the authorities, such persecution was supported by religious overtones. However, there was no equal modern understanding of the union, even at the level of a philosophical idea: such events were a deviation from the norm and were not perceived fundamentally.
A hospital-acquired pressure injury (HAPI) is a localized injury of underlying tissue or skin that some patients suffer during their stay in a hospital. HAPI is typically a result of prolonged immobility of patients, leading to unrelieved pressure upon bony prominences. In combination with shear, this pressure is linked to other variables such as age, perfusion, nutritional status, hematological measurements, sickness severity, and diabetes (Rondinelli et al., 2018). Despite the recent decline, the number of patients who acquired pressure injury during their stay is still over a million in the USA (Tschannen & Anderson, 2020). The development of HAPI increases patients’ risks of dying during the hospital stay by 2.8 times and dying within 30 days after leaving the medical facility by 1.69 (Tschannen & Anderson, 2020). Additionally, hospital-acquired pressure injury is accompanied by substantial pain and suffering, delayed functional recovery, as well as extended time for healing and hospital stay (Tschannen & Anderson, 2020). Even though much research has been done on the subject, HAPI remains a significant issue for elderly patients and a costly challenge for hospitals.During the patients’ time at the hospital, the primary care for them is provided by and the responsibility of the nurse practitioners. Since pressure injuries are proven to be preventable, the early recognition of the modifiable causes of the development of HAPI and taking corrective measures can stop the progression of the disease (Rondinelli et al., 2018). As such, working directly with patients enables nursing professionals to identify the symptoms and stop pressure injuries from developing. Failing to
The framers of the Constitution did not believe that citizens would take an active part in the political life of the country. While many freedoms were incorporated in the Constitution, its framers doubted whether people were interested enough in politics to follow its makings. It is true that in those times, information was limited; however, nowadays, mass media help people to be well-informed about political events. Moreover, the media act as a watchdog on the governmental powers (How Does the Media Affect Politics). Informational agencies report the events and let readers make their minds about them or share their views (How Does the Media Affect Politics). However, it always pays not to rely on the media too much and take pains to follow the political life of the country. They felt that everyday citizens were uninformed and did not care what was going on in our government.I disagree that citizens are uninformed and do not care about political life. Nowadays, there are many organizations that promote civil rights and freedoms closely following the events on the political landscape of the country. People do not wait for a crisis to voice their opinions; on the contrary, citizens try to stay well-informed about what is going on (Jach & Trolian, 2022). The media, as a great source of information, facilitates this task, allowing people to have access to the latest events all over the world (Greenberg & Page, 2015). Crises as such make people more interested in politics, but there are many people who take pains to voice their opinions, notwithstanding the political or economic situation. These people deserve great respect as they act as watchdogs on the wide judicial, legislative, and executive powers vested in our politicians and judges by the laws we have adopted as a nation.
Olivier Armantier’s et al. article, “How Economic Crises Affect Inflation Beliefs: Evidence from the COVID-19 Pandemic,” was published in the Journal of Economic Behavior and Organization on July 24, 2021. Publisher Elsevier has partnered with the Copyright Center RightsLink service to offer various options for reusing this content. Elsevier offers open or restricted access to content with permanently unique identifiers to include links and citations. This paper is an independent article focusing on the state of the public economy during COVID-19.In their paper, the authors examine changes in the perception of inflation during the first six months of the COVID-19 pandemic. Although this paper is an independent work, Armantier et al. (2021) complemented other research in the field analyzing economic changes during the COVID-19 recession. A feature of the article is the study by the authors of the consequences of inflationary crises and comparison with pre-existing crises to calculate the level of the crisis as a whole. The survey’s main purpose is to collect against a wide range of economic outcomes.As a result of their research, the authors studied the evolution of households’ perceptions of inflation and concluded that the growth of inflationary expectations was more restrained. It means that the muted reaction of average inflation expectations masks a significant polarization of views, especially in the short term (Bekaert et al., 2020). A significant proportion of households, particularly those with higher education, initially expected that the pandemic would lead to low inflation or even deflation (Armantier et al., 2021). Thus, the authors achieved their goal and confirmed their results with numerous graphs and tables presented in the article.I liked the study by Armantier et al. (2021) because the authors look at non-traditionally triggered crises and household responses. In addition, through comparative analysis with past crises, Armantier et al. (2021) determine the spread of the crisis due to erroneous assumptions about inflation to other areas of the economy (Armantier et al., 2021). For example, the Great Recession was predominantly a strong negative demand shock driven by a falling house and stock prices. I also liked that the authors found evidence for strong polarization of inflation perceptions and identified differences between demographic groups.
of a business nature, such expressions of speech do not make sense (Smith, n.d.). Of course, there are alternatives in the form of emoji and stickers, but in emails, as a rule, such forms are rarely used, unlike in messengers. From these features, an essential advantage of email is highlighted, namely increased accessibility, the possibility of virtually limitless communication, and staying connected with people at all times. However, there are also disadvantages: dependence on Internet equipment, the need for an electronic device, and any cybersecurity concerns.It is easy to make mistakes in electronic correspondence, as individuals automatically try to extrapolate real-world communication skills to the digital world. These mistakes include ignoring the type of interlocutor and lack of digital etiquette, mixing up writing styles, and sending long, unstructured messages (CNBC, 2018). To avoid making these mistakes in everyday correspondence, it is advisable to learn the rules of electronic etiquette, review your messages before sending, the appropriateness of using slang and style for specific interlocutors and reducing the letter to the minimum size that retains meaning.
each year (Fruhan, 2014). Therefore, while Treasury bonds yield about 11%, overall long-term inflation expectations equal 10% (Fruhan, 2014). This means that companies must grow fast enough to keep the cost of equity capital for common stock at 19–20%.Hence, a business should grow according to the inflation rate and other indicators. This way, in order to remain lucrative to investors, an organization needs to beware of a long-term inflation rate. While Treasury bonds are predicted to yield 10% annually, companies need to provide a premium of 9–10%, which in the end equals 19–20% growth. If a company cannot meet the expectations of investors and surpass the inflation rate, it is doomed. Moreover, a company needs to check its ROE and the cost of equity capital. When the former surpasses the latter, a company will be able to create ample growth. When a business fails to oversee these two points and grows more rapidly than it can manage, it can do more harm to its financial health.
The chapter in question tells the story of how global trade has enriched and changed cultures. During the analyzed period, many wealthy rulers and merchants began to demonstrate their power by acquiring exotic works of art. Ideas and books circulated, and cultural exchange was extremely active. People became more tolerant of diversity and more aware of how diverse the world around them was. Ties between different cultures were strengthened because of the continuing strong globalization. European influence had spread so far that the norms and habits of people from the West were beginning to be considered universal and objective (Adelman et al., 2021, p. 597). The key term of the era becomes the Enlightenment, marking a period of triumph of human reason. People begin to think that they can understand the laws of nature and human behavior. The importance of the chapter lies in its multifaceted analysis of the period, taking into account the contribution of each continent.Among the major events, the book describes is how the three great powers formed a group in West and South Asia. The author describes how the rulers of the Ottoman, Safavid, and Mughal dynasties contributed to the cultural development of their countries. The development of China, Japan, the two Americas, the slave states of Africa, and the development of Australia are also narrated. Particular emphasis is placed on how the interaction and mutual influence of different cultures contributed to their overall development. The sixteenth, seventeenth, and eighteenth centuries saw a global cultural renaissance brought on by the growth of new wealth (Adelman et al., 2021, p. 595). There was an increase in the consumption of books, and a greater number of previously unseen monuments were formed (Adelman et al., 2021, p. 595). The world has become highly integrated due to the spread of international trade. However, not all countries were willing to change and only agreed to adapt to the new norms. The Islamic and Chinese worlds generally maintained their identities, but America and Oceania could not resist European cultural pressure.
Silke, A. (Ed.). (2019). Routledge handbook of terrorism and counterterrorism . Routledge.The book describes the main acts carried out by the group, as well as its fundamental motives. In that way, the source includes information on the 1978 bank robberies and other violent actions that ultimately led to the Sri Lankan Civil War. Additionally, LTTE’s objective to create an independent and separate state for Sri Lankan Tamils, who the government had previously oppressed, is reviewed. The research source is relevant for investigating the goals of the terrorist group, as well as explaining the establishment of an independent Tamil state. Therefore, it would be helpful for my analysis of LTTE’s emergence process.Thurairajah, T. (2021). Performing nationalism: The United Nations Human Rights Council (UNHRC) and Sri Lankan Tamil diasporic politics in Switzerland . The Geographical Journal, 188 (1). Web.The themes of Tamil nationalism are explored in the following source. The article highlights ways through which the Sri Lankan minority groups acknowledged their right to an independent state and how such groups shared their ideology beyond their country. The source’s relevancy to the exploration of the group’s ideology is evident, as it explains its impact on the rest of the world. It was useful in the process of defining the concept of Tamil nationalism in my paper.Sauerborn, D. (2017). Political violence revisited: The liberation tigers of Tamil Eelam .

The introduction of computer technologies in modern society involves many activities that seemingly do not have a connection with computer technologies themselves, such as the recruiting process. With the rise of corporate culture and the development of a more competitive market of candidates, a detailed candidate selection process required a more straightforward solution than manual filtering. Recently, after assessing the possibilities of wide application of newly developed AI technologies, Human Resource managers started using program software to reduce the workload associated with the selection process. The article by Pardes explores how the candidates learned to manipulate the technology in favor of their own interests.The article starts with an interview with the person who discovered the consistent patterns in the operation of the software’s candidate selection system, Shirin Nilizadeh. According to Pardes, a friend approached Nilizadeh with concerns about her resume. Alizadeh’s friend has come to the conclusion that her resumes do not reach HR managers as they inexplicably seem to lack something. Through a series of enhancements to a collection of random resumes, Nilizadeh defined that using certain words not necessarily associated with required qualifications can increase the candidates’ position in the resume-ranking program. While Nilizadeh’s interest was related to academic purposes, many platforms offer the candidates a chance to improve their resume with all kinds of hacks, such as inserting relevant keywords in invisible font. It turns out that there are many ways for the candidates to increase their chances of to interview, from including the names of prestigious universities to using competitor company names
existing skills, a substantial portion of job applicants may never proceed to the next stage of the selection process. According to Julie Schweber’s perspective featured in Pardes’ article, software filters as many as 75% of applicants based on the resume meeting the specific job criteria. The issue is worsened by the fact that third parties offer paid resume enhancement and applicant tracking systems, influencing the labor market competitiveness level by improving the situation for applicants with financial means.Analyzing the information acquired from the article emphasizes the impersonal character of technology. While using technology to optimize organizational processes can benefit productivity, it creates a barrier for individuals with insufficient technological skills. In addition, excessive reliance on technology results in the presence of process weaknesses that can be manipulated for malicious or harmful purposes. Therefore, while the use of technology seemingly increases objectivity in the decision-making process, the potential manipulations can equal the outcomes of nepotism, corruption, and bribery.Lastly, I decided to choose this article because it displays the weaknesses of technological systems and their improper application in modern society. It was interesting to learn about the influence of the nuances between human and machine perceptions in reading the text typed in white color on white paper. Acquiring the additional perspective from the recruiting process can benefit me in identifying potential mistakes and threats in my future career as an IT professional.
Good Country People is a short allegorical story, written by Flannery O’Connor, about the dual nature of religious workers, loneliness, and egocentrism. Indeed, even the characters’ names possess a hidden meaning about their appearance, personality, or life. The story commences with the description of two old ladies and their children who belong to two different social classes. Mrs. Freeman is a maid in Mrs. Hopewell’s house, and the former was described as a woman with two primary unpleasant facial expressions for the public. Since the story was told from Mrs. Hopewell’s viewpoint, she was presented as a calm, polite, and tolerant person, noticing but forgiving other people’s flaws, including her daughter Joy, who chose the formal name Hulga. Their bitter coexistence was interrupted by a 19-year-old handsome man, Manley Pointer, who sold Bibles door-to-door and claimed to have the same heart disease as Joy but appeared to be a criminal. Through symbolism, O’Connor was able to convey the characters’ unique features with their names, connection to parents with Hulga’s wooden leg, Joy’s mindset with her glasses, and Pointer’s non-religiousness with the hollow Bible.The first symbol is the characters’ names that partly represent their fates and personalities. For example, the reader is not provided with the first names of Mrs. Freeman and Mrs. Hopewell. They acquired their last names from marriages, indirectly pointing to the only function that women could have in the South at that time, indicating the forced fate that is opposite of their actual situation. For instance, Mrs. Freeman is not a slave, but
she is not free because she is a maid, while Mrs. Hopewell is hopeless. The women’s personalities were revealed in their dialogues and their children. Both are polite and consider themselves good individuals who sometimes have to endure other people’s rudeness or ignorance. Mrs. Freeman’s daughters, Glynese and Carramae, red and blond girls, whom Joy associated with Glycerin and Caramel, indicating a lack of respect for their chosen life path (O’Connor 2). Moreover, Joy was never joyful in reality; thus, she changed her name to Hulga to complete the image of an ugly person to avoid the traditional path of all South women. Specifically, she seemed to want to avoid marriage and childbirth.The second allegoric element in this story was Hulga’s wooden leg. This symbol represents her inability to become independent of her mother. Indeed, she still lives with her parent, is unemployed, and does not have relationships with other people. It appears that she was born with a congenital heart defect that, in the best-case scenario, would allow her to live until her forties (O’Connor 5). Still, Mrs. Hopewell wanted her daughter to get married at the right age. However, an accidental gunshot wound at the age of ten became a pivotal point in Joy’s life when she was implanted with the wooden leg and escaped the usual fate of her female counterparts. Despite a PhD degree, the girl did not work and lived with her mother, waiting for her own death. The appearance of Pointer gave her a tiny hope for a new life.
for a different future but also confirmed her atheist believes.In summary, O’Connor’s Good Country People represents the issues of the dishonesty of religious workers, the difficulty of detaching from parental supervision, and the obsession of individuals with their goodness and other people’s faults. This story showed a painful experience of a young woman with poor health who failed to build social connections despite several university degrees. Four symbolic elements in this short story uncovered Hulga’s journey to detachment from her mother and old beliefs. The first was the characters’ names that described their appearance and personalities. The second was Hulga’s artificial leg as an anchor to her mother. The third was Hulga glasses, which the young man stole from her smoothly, becoming the critical facilitator of disillusionment. The fourth was Pointer’s suitcase with fake Bibles as a symbol of the falsity of his religiousness. Overall, the evil act of the young man left Hulga in rage and disappointment but with a more realistic perception of the world.
addictive potential as a legal alternative to heroin and other highly addictive drugs. Three substances are currently approved for substitution therapy: methadone, buprenorphine, and naltrexone (Volkow et al., 2014). Medications are determined with cautiousness to avoid unwanted psychoactive effects. For example, a significant disadvantage of methadone is its ability to provoke a strong withdrawal syndrome in case of discontinuation of its use. To alleviate the patient’s condition, doctors can resort to additional help with tranquilizers, antidepressants, antipsychotics, and non-opioid analgesics. In addition, doctors widely use symptomatic treatment and supportive therapy (Volkow et al., 2014). In the severe phase of withdrawal, the patient should be under constant medical supervision.Helping a Friend or a Family Member with an Opioid AddictionThe most important aspect of the treatment motivation is the family. It is necessary to help a person acquire a sincere desire to battle for life. Rehab centers remain an effective chance for an addicted person to return to a healthy, drug-free life. It uses a unique rehabilitation program that allows one not only to overcome addiction but to return to a healthy lifestyle and realize its value (Brown, 2018). To provide effective motivation, the psychiatrist should learn all the necessary data about the addicted person. It will require the assistance of relatives and friends who can tell about the psychological atmosphere, patients’ habits, interests, and family relationships.
IntroductionThe United States has a history of discrimination and inequality toward African Americans. Even after President Abraham Lincoln outlawed enslavement and won the American Civil War in 1965, prejudice toward black people remained engrained in both the northern and southern cultural structures of the United States (Jaffa 260). American subconscious biases endure over time and pervade organizational settings, social systems, individual neural processes, and tendencies of regular contact. The recent nationwide riots against police violence have resulted in a sea change in discourse and views regarding America’s institutional racism. The assassinations of George Floyd, Ahmaud Arbery, Rashard Brooks, and Breonna Taylor, among others, have fueled calls for transformation to the enforcement and justice system (Clark et al. 150). Numerous Black parents and Black-led organizations have advocated for these improvements in neighborhoods across the nation for generations. This essay analyzes some of the actions parents of color may take to realize an end to racial discrimination and violence in the United States.Advocating for Systematic EqualityIn America, prejudice is a financial, institutional, and social system. That system purposefully marginalizes and alienates Black people while preserving and growing clear and persuasive privileges for white people, resulting in increased possibilities for employment, schooling, accommodation, and inequality in the criminal justice system. To begin healing and moving toward true social equality, racial minorities must confront not only recent injustices but also hurts dating back to the country’s founding.Since the nation’s establishment, segregation has served a significant part in developing the United States educational, health care, property, employment systems, and practically every
other aspect of society. Elizabeth reminds Black children throughout her narrative of the evils of racism in America’s history in her narration:These narratives served as a teaching tool for young African-Americans about their physicality and susceptibility. The stories served as introductions to fear and hopelessness. The stories served as the fertile basis for their fury. These narratives taught children that anti-black prejudice and brutality were never far away. They witnessed these infringements numerous times up close and on their smartphones. (Elizabeth 307)For instance, parents of color have demonstrated the abolition of institutional racism along school and district lines in education settings. For example, in Brooklyn, New York, parents from many ethnicities collaborated to abolish talented monitoring initiatives favoring universal courses (Smalls 362). Allies should also advocate for measures that promote equal access to the difficult and advanced curriculum for all kids in their state governments and local education boards.Joining Movements against Racist ViolenceBlack Lives Matter has always been more interested in human rights than civil liberties. BLM has fought for a fundamentally restructuring of civilization in which Black people are not subjected to deliberate marginalization. Nonetheless, the revolution’s quantifiable influence on the constitutional environment cannot be denied. Since 2013, these activists have cumulatively caused major change on a local and national level, including the ouster of prominent fraudulent magistrates (Clark et al. 150). In her text, The Trayvon Generation , Elizabeth enumerates the racist violence against George Floyd as follows:I am unable to breathe again. A knee placed his entire weight on his neck for eight
minutes and forty-six seconds. “I’m having trouble breathing,” followed by, “Mama!” George Floyd broke down in tears. “Mama… I’m done!” exclaimed George Floyd. His mother had been deceased for two years when he shouted out for her during his lynching. (Elizabeth 307)In Chicago, organizations such as BYP100 and Assata’s Daughters resulted in Anita Alvarez losing her re-election. She unexpectedly declined to prosecute police officers associated with 68 fatal shootings (Clark et al. 152). The BLM protest’s continuous work on police misconduct contributed to the publication of four groundbreaking US Department of Justice findings confirming rampant police misconduct in Baltimore, Chicago, Ferguson, and Cleveland (Clark et al. 159). Additionally, the revolution’s wider societal significance has been immeasurable.Speaking out against Prejudice and Lending Support to Fellow Black ParentsRacism is institutionalized in the finance, schooling, and even commercial sectors. It pervades practically every facet of human interaction in cultures, adversely impacting black people. For example, African-Americans are underrepresented in leadership roles across commercial sectors, face barriers to affordable housing, are numerous in the criminal system, and their medical encounters are markedly different from white and non-black residents (Cain 156). Discrimination and inequality manifest themselves in various ways, from overt exclusionary behaviors to the most covert policies.Voting laws and proficiency exams were documented examples in the United States, which compelled individuals to spend on their right to vote and disqualified those who could not read. This disadvantaged strategy members of low-income neighborhoods. Therefore, parents of color could empower black, indigenous, and people-of-color (BIPOC) to form support communities to share their
the organization handles employees’ creativity. I would encourage the company to set a stage for brainstorming, thus, encouraging new ideas and creativity (Tamvada, 2020). Regarding complaints about the company engagement and expenditures, it is evident that the business is striving to improve CSR, and the further it advances in that direction, the more it benefits. For instance, experiencing more brand recognition means increases in sales.Nestle has endeavored to become a socially responsible and environmentally sustainable corporation. Thus, it qualifies for a pass because of its tremendous achievement in empowering communities. It has improved people’s living standards, creating access to hygiene and clean water and motivating populations to live healthy lifestyles. I would recommend the company implement an Enterprise Risk Management (ERM) process (Tamvada, 2020). ERM should be applied since it is designed to find possible events that can affect the business. This will also help manage risks and opportunities and develop meaningful assurance concerning company objectives.
Purpose: The purpose of this evidence brief is to prove that the utilization of registered nurses as primary team members interacting with patients during telehealth visits in an outpatient setting will improve patient outcomes. 1. PIO In the outpatient clinical setting, will the utilization of registered nurses as a primary team member to perform telehealth visits improve patient outcomes? 2. Background: Due to the increasing demand to access care, there is increased demand for telehealth during the pandemic. The issue is to meet the demand. Registered Nurses need to become Primary Team Members to interact with Patients during Telehealth. 3. Objective: The objective of this research is to discover information on how registered nurses can play a role as primary team members during telehealth visits through Evidence-Based Practice to improve patient outcomes. 4. Search for evidence was done in databases CINAHL Plus, Pubmed, ***Search words used were “registered nurse and telehealth”, “ role of the nurse in telehealth,” and*** The selection criteria of articles were English language and peer-reviewed articles. was The specifics of articles used were within the last 10*** years, with a majority of them in the last 5*** years, incorporating all evidence levels, I to VII 5. Summary of research-based evidence:     1. Yliluoma, P., & Palonen, M. (2020). Telenurses’ experiences of interaction with patients and family members: nurse–caller interaction via telephone.         1. Nurses’ capabilities and communication skills, including their ability to listen and be sensitive to their patients, nurses’ control of
the interaction to keep it relevant improved telephone interactions with the patients. However, background noises when a caller calls, communication problems such as inadequate communication, callers’ inappropriate behavior, inability to conduct an assessment, callers’ inability to describe the symptoms, issues such as family members providing different information than information provided by callers, technical issues, lack of appointments to accommodate all the callers, and long queues all these make it difficult to have effective interactions (Yliluoma & Palonen 2020).

The article discusses that Telehealth is not just a phone call, but it is a resource for patients and families and nurses play an important role in providing those services to patients via technology. Nurses are a good resources, and they can provide effective care by using good communication skills and competencies (Mataxen & Webb, 2019). Level V     3. Robeznieks, A. (2021). How to implement telehealth in your practice with equity in mind.         1. Many people are interested in utilizing Telehealth but there are several barriers on both patients’ and clinicians’ sides. Patients lack digital skills and literacy, have no access to the internet, or limited data plan which makes it difficult to have a quality telehealth visit. Similarly, many healthcare settings are unable to provide video-enabled devices to their clinicians, use difficult apps,
or have security issues (Robeznieks, 2021). (Expert Reviewed)     4. Javanparast, S., Roeger L., Kwok Y., Reed RL. (2021). The experience of Australian general practice patients at high risk of poor health outcomes with telehealth during the COVID-19 pandemic: a qualitative study.         1. This study explored the experiences of telehealth for vulnerable patients in general practice during the pandemic. The significant findings of this study concluded that patients are satisfied with telehealth for its convenience and efficiency. However, patients expressed that this only works if the patient and provider have already developed a relationship prior to the transformation of care. Another finding is that the common use of telehealth is for medication refills, follow-ups and reviewing diagnostic results. (Javaboarast, Kwok, Reed & Roeger, 2021) Level VI     5.

This study is to explore the results of medication adherence rate and disease process on patients with rheumatoid arthritis via customized telehealth education versus patients discharged home with standard care instructions. The telehealth education includes disease process, treatment goals, how to take medication properly and side effects. The results of this study concluded that customized telehealth education after discharge leads to a better medication adherence rate and, therefore, better symptom control
and prohibits the progression of the disease. (Chen, Reifsnider, Song, Xie & Zhao, 2020) Level II     6. Asiri, A., AlBishi, S., AlMadani, W., ElMetwally, A., & Househ, M. (2018).

Although telehealth is typically associated with remote care in therapy and related procedures, the paper by Asiri et al. (2018) establishes that telehealth can also be used in a surgical context. Specifically, the authors of the study prove the importance of incorporating telehealth as the device for patient evaluation after the surgery, thus, assessing the efficacy of the surgery and the extent of its success. Moreover, the threat of nosocomial infections and the associated concerns can be avoided with the help of the proposed technique. The study proves the role of telehealth in modern nursing.     7.

Journal of Medical Internet Research, 22 (9), e20786.         1. The study assesses the extent of telehealth efficacy in the environment of the COVID-19 pandemic. According to the results of the study, the range of telehealth applications by APNs has expanded to embrace a variety of patient-specific needs, which has led to a rise in patient satisfaction rates. Compared to in-person
visits, the use of telehealth has proven to be much more popular with patients as the tool that allows APNs to establish a rapport with the target population quickly. Moreover, the accuracy of the diagnosis and the opportunity to minimize medical errors when performing the assessment of a patient and to administer the required treatment have been noted as important factors in improving the performance of APNs. 6. Summary of expert evidence from professional organizations, experiences, or experts in the specialty     1. The Future of Nursing: Leading Change, Advancing Health. Institute of Medicine. (2011)         1. In the section “Examples of Redesigned Roles for Nurses”, the Department of Veterans Affairs recreated and extended nurses’ roles in the health care system to collaborate with Advanced Practice Registered Nurses, and the result exceeded its expectation. RNs are assigned to coordinate care and chronic disease management, while APRNs are the primary care providers. The result of this collaboration showed VA patients are getting better care, as evidenced by many quality-of-care indicators in comparison to Medicare patients. (Institute of Medicine, 2011)     2. Jnr, B. A. (2020). Use of telemedicine and virtual care for remote treatment in response to the COVID-19 pandemic.         1. Representing an important voice in the community of experts on the subject matter, Jnr (2020) explains in his paper that the role of nurses in promoting the use of telehealth in the healthcare context is
that the role of an APN in the nursing setting should expand to include of patient education and raising awareness. However, the authors also warn that, with the blurring of the lines between nurses’ roles, certain ambiguity about the functions of an APN emerges. Therefore, the study encourages examining the expansion in the range of APNs’ responsibilities and functions, implying that alleviation of the workload may be needed.     4. Woo, B. F. Y., Lee, J. X. Y., & San Tam, W. W. (2017). The impact of the advanced practice nursing role on the quality of care, clinical outcomes, patient satisfaction, and cost in the emergency and critical care settings: A systematic review.         1. The study shows that APNs have a critical function in the context of modern healthcare. Specifically, APNs contribute substantially to the extent of a patient’s access to critical care by improving the efficacy of communication and precision in service delivery. Furthermore, the study proves that the inclusion of APNs into the critical care context leads to reduced length of hospital stay, as well as an increased rate of patient satisfaction. Promoting innovation in the hospital setting and encouraging autonomy in nurses, APNs contribute to a significant rise in the efficacy of critical care. Thus, the research establishes an important shift in the perception of APNs and their function in the nursing context, transforming their role in critical care toward a more meaningful one.
Epithelial tissues of the body represent the tissues lining the surfaces of skin, digestive organs, and respiratory organs. They can be found anywhere in the body where a barrier is needed to be formed, with things being able to pass across the created barrier. Because of the wide coverage of epithelial tissues in the body, there are many types of diseases affecting the tissue, and it is essential to know them to understand how the disease affects epithelial tissues. At this time, let’s focus on eczema as one of the widespread concerns of epithelial tissue.Put simply, eczema also referred to as atopic dermatitis, is a condition that affects the skin, which is made of epithelial tissue1. It makes the skin red and itchy and can first manifest in people as early as childhood. It is important to note that eczema tends to transform into a chronic condition for many people and can disappear and flare up periodically, often depending on environmental factors. Unfortunately, there is no cure that can help clear eczema entirely and make it never reappear. Although, there are several treatments and self-care activities that can help relieve the itching and redness and prevent new flare-ups on a short-term basis. Examples of good practices for eczema include avoiding harsh soaps, moisturizing the skin on a regular basis, as well as applying medicated creams and different types of ointments.Getting to know the symptoms of atopic dermatitis can help identify the signs early to engage in preventive and management efforts, according to a doctor’s recommendations. While
feet, neck, ankles, wrists, as well as inside the knees and elbows’ bends. The skin affected by eczema usually appears thickened, scaly, and cracked, and due to scratching, it can often be raw, swollen, and highly sensitive to different external factors. Also, one may check for signs of small bumps that can leak fluid and crust over when being scratched.When it comes to the age differentiation of eczema, the onset of the disease is often at five years old, with the highest incidence taking place between three and six months, but it can take place at any age. Around 60% of patients develop eczema in the first year of their life, while 90% get it within the first five years1. However, it is notable that atopic dermatitis can happen to people of different ages, although the percentage is much lower than those mentioned for children.The burden of disease can be different depending on its severity as well as the ways of management. However, pain and itchiness of the skin can be quite cumbersome, preventing a person affected by eczema from doing everyday things2. Also, because eczema can often have an unpleasant appearance, some people can be self-conscious about it and get embarrassed, which is quite unfortunate3. Therefore, the problem with eczema is that it can significantly reduce the quality of life and health. Not only is sore and itchy skin annoying, but it also does not perform its protective function effectively, which causes a problem for the overall health of the body.
IntroductionHard disk failure is common among computers and leads to severe damage. The failure results from various causes, including human error, computer hardware failure, malware corruption, media damage, and exposure to heat or water. Changing the HDD before it wears out completely is prudent to protect other hardware and software components (Fernández-Fuentes et al., 2022). While tech-savvies easily replace the HDD, persons with little knowledge of computer hardware find it difficult to replace it. The persons with little knowledge include first-time computer users and those who rarely interact with computer hardware. Novice computer users can follow this instruction guide to effectively change HDD without causing any damage to the computer hardware and software components.These instructions will allow the readers to change the HDD from a faulty computer step by step and switch on the computer to test the new HDD. While changing the HDD seems easy following this instruction guide, the computer user should have basic computer knowledge. The assistance should be sought if the users interact with computer hardware for the first time. Appropriate assistants include computer experts and authorized computer hardware dealers at the place of HDD purchase.Overall StepsHDD can be upgraded in a fully functioning computer or a faulty laptop. To get started, the readers must ensure that their critical data is backed up in a secondary device such as flash disks or cloud-based storage like Google Drive. The computer must be switched off by following the appropriate booting process. After that, the power supply should be disconnected to avoid any instant of
electric shock. Proper instructions, as indicated on the HDD guide book should be followed. The users should avoid placing the new HDD near heat or magnetic fields that interfere with the storage mechanism. Before inserting the new HDD remove the existing HDD carefully. The computer should be allowed to boot up upon replacing the HDD. The process takes about fifteen to twenty minutes and should be done in a well-ventilated room at average room temperatures.List of Materials and Tools NeededBefore starting the process of changing the HDD, several tools and materials are required. The tools will help avoid static electricity, dust, electric shock, and other hazardous conditions to the computer and the user. Therefore, the user must acquire a list of protective tools before starting the process. The following list of tools is needed when changing the HDD in a computer.  * Anti-static mat to shield the users and computer equipment from static electricity discharge  * Anti-static vacuum cleaner to cause suction to remove dirt from the computer equipment  * Anti-static wristband to be worn on the writs to prevent static electricity build-up.  *   * Philips-head screwdriver to tighten and drive out screwsThe readers should also ensure that appropriate materials are available before the process. The following list of materials is needed to get the process started.  * A can of compressed air  *   * A can of refrigerant-based propellant cleaner  * A new hard drive diskList of StepsThe following steps should be followed when
changing HDD, and the readers should remember to disconnect the power supply and carefully read the HDD’s manufacturers’ instructions.Back up data on the existing HDDBacking up of data should be done if the existing HDD still works. You can use an external USB or online using OneDrive or Google Drive.Obtain a full, bootable Operating system copyYou should do this step if you replace a primary HDD and are not using a cloning tool. The software can be bought on a DVD or downloaded on a flash drive by creating recovery media.You should decide between an HDD or an SDD (Solid State Drive)Although SDDs are faster and more durable than HDD, they are more expensive. However, the two operate similarly, and you can choose either depending on your budget.Choose the right driver for your computerDifferent types of computers require different types of HDDs with varying sizes. If you are replacing a laptop’s HDD, you need a 2.5-inch HDD, and if you are replacing a desktop’s HDD, you need a 3.5-inch HDD.Shut down your computer by following the right procedureFollowing the appropriate computer booting process help protect the data and prevent damage to the existing hardware. Unplug the computer from the power supply upon shutting it down.Ground yourself before opening your computer’s system unitUse the anti-static wrist band while standing on the anti-static mat to avoid improper handling of the electronic components. The tools help avoid damaging the computer by electrostatic discharge.Open the system unit caseThis step varies depending on the computer being worked on: desktop or laptop.
The human mind and consciousness present many challenges to researchers, and numerous studies allow them to discover different phenomena, especially in the field of self-awareness. The documentary “Human Consciousness” (2014) from BBC provides viewers with an insight into different experiments which scientists conduct to explore the aspects of the functioning of the human mind. The most notable experiment in the documentary was the mirror self-recognition test, and current research shows that it is highly influenced by sociocultural factors.Despite the fact that the mirror self-recognition test is fairly simple and does not require many resources, it enables researchers to understand the capacity of people to recognize themselves. Essentially, the aim of the mirror self-recognition test is to measure the ability of a child to be aware of themselves. The experiment takes place in accordance with three main stages, which should be strictly followed. The first stage involves letting the child approach a large mirror and spend several minutes looking at their reflection. The next move involves the parent of the child placing a small mark on the child’s cheek close to the mouth where it can be visible. The third stage implies once again placing the child in front of the mirror and allowing them to see the reflection. The child passes the test if they touch the mark, which proves that they are self-aware and can link the image of the mark visible in the reflection to the actual one on their body. The film experiment showed that children start to demonstrate the signs of self-recognition
According to Kant’s philosophy, the distinction between a person and a thing runs through several basic criteria, largely related to independence and dignity. A thing is only a means to finitude, that is, to any completion, while man contains completion in himself. Man differs in his finitude from the infinity of the world, but he is valuable in himself and cannot be used as a means. This determines autonomy, that is, the independence of a person. Implicit autonomy determines the inner ability of a person to do anything and, accordingly, the ability to distinguish between good and evil. According to Kant, a person, in contrast to a thing, has a moral navigator that is common to everyone. It is because of the opportunity to master the concepts of good and evil and use them morally a person differs from a thing. A person cannot be used as a means and therefore, unlike a thing, has no value.Dignity should be perceived as an innate and inalienable trait of any person, regardless of social institutions, class, and experience. At the same time, dignity is not only an internal concept since it is something that can be given by one person to another, such as respect or favor. This means that the concept of human dignity may not always be strictly intrinsic. Concepts about the transfer or innateness of dignity can have a significant impact on medical practice. A doctor who believes that it is they who give dignity to other people by paying attention to them runs the
the criteria to be considered truly human. This is the third use case for this concept, in which the misuse of this view becomes really dangerous.A person can be determined by a higher awareness and cognitive ability, which determines the knowledge of their goal on Earth and moral criterion. However, some people with mental disabilities may thus actually not fit the criteria for being human. Consequently, their external dignity will be diminished by those who believe that their internal dignity is worthless. This is a terrible mistake in moral judgment and is very dangerous for medical ethics. Moreover, the question of human dignity arises in the case of embryos and embryos, which significantly complicates the issue of moral responsibility and giving dignity to a person in the case of an abortion procedure. Thus, the external dignity of a person comes from the field of social experience and the attitude of other people to a person, which is most valuable in bioethics and medical practice. The pursuit of dignity in each person can help a doctor make truly valuable ethical decisions and can help other professionals make them.
I trust that people create relationships according to the interactions’ risks and rewards. A person deliberates or unconsciously assesses the risks and benefits of action and chooses the most rewarding activity. Money, love, power, or societal approbation are examples of concrete and intangible rewards and drawbacks (Cox et al., 2021). Since people base relationships on rewards, each member of society tends to demand more gains from a relationship. Individuals are never born good or evil; however, they are influenced to develop certain attributes based on particular demands. Individuals are driven to labor for fundamental necessities such as food and shelter (Cox et al., 2021). Others obtain motivation from personal, cultural, societal, or economic conditions.In this regard, people are not born evil or good but motivated by biological, social, and economic factors. Individuals with quick actions and adaptability use agility to maximize their potential. People may also maximize their potential by adopting a positive attitude toward all events and confronting problems front on (Cox et al., 2021). Contemporary issues such as alienation, poverty, and insecurities significantly influence human relationships. Society must foster equity, cooperation, and respect among cultures and social groups to obtain control and achieve stable relationships.Administrations have an obligation to guarantee economic and social security to the citizens. To guarantee financial stability, the government in socialist ideology sets preparations for equal income distribution among working people (Cox et al., 2021). Other social provisions include free education, retirement benefits, social grants, and accessible healthcare services in allocated cases, such as maternal care. Additionally, states provide and
ensure the maintenance of public goods and services such as roads and security. A state’s responsibility is to safeguard its inhabitants against internal and foreign conflicts (Cox et al., 2021). The government safeguards civilians from economic, social, and political attacks through policies and the law. I think states should cushion vulnerable groups such as women, the elderly, and youths by providing free services, employment opportunities, and incentives on particular goods and services. The government should also nurture potential talents to help generate income, particularly the youth.The current government has initiated many programs that work for the welfare of civilians countrywide. For instance, the education for all movement has benefited many people regardless of age, gender and ethnicity. Nevertheless, wealthier individuals and localities profit from the system more than the poor and ordinary Americans. Some shortcomings include the health and safety of the average citizen. The government spends significantly on internal and external security, but many neighborhoods live in absolute fear due to violence and insecurity. I think the capitalist economic system is appropriate for the State. However, it needs reforms in the labor force regarding individuals with less competitive skills. For instance, providing alternative sources of employment to vulnerable groups such as the mentally and physically unstable. My ideal State entails equality and democracy in distributing social and economic services to have healthy and happy citizens willing to boost the economy through hard work and devotion.My views are inspired by Josephine Shaw Lowell, a social worker during the 19 th century. Lowell is famous for her
practice by providing global competence and institutional empowerment, which enhances service delivery. Nonetheless, the liberalization of the social work market may impede successful service delivery (Cox et al., 2021). Social workers operate under the ethics of integrity, social justice, and community development among all populations. Creating dominance by selling social work services depicts an economic-centered approach based on self-interest than community development. The liberal perspective discourages client discretion since purchasing services works on the terms and conditions of the buyer (Cox et al., 2021). Thus, making money the primary consideration in social work may hinder service delivery due to clients giving selective information as they are paying for the services. Alternatively, the liberal approach can be a barrier to helping poor communities since they cannot afford the capital. I anticipate meeting challenges while working with the vulnerable community due to the relative lack of resources on either side.
The secret of IKEA’s success on the global market lies in its perfect execution of all components of the marketing mix. The company has adapted its strategy to each market with precision, flexibility, and creativity that made its products highly recognized. The ingenuity of its marketing mix proposal can serve as an example for other companies in Europe and worldwide. In this paper, the four components of IKEA’s marketing mix will be discussed.This Swedish company has gained renown for the quality, accessibility, and innovativeness of its products. First of all, the firm’s pricing strategy is focused on affordability, as the structure and logistics of its stores are optimized for a maximum price reduction (O’Neill, 2021). Promotions of this store chain are widespread through all communication channels, ranging from local radio stations to social media accounts made for each region individually. IKEA stays on top of modern advertising strategies and employs influencers to reach younger audiences (O’Neill, 2021). Regarding its locations, IKEA continuously selects places where it will remain accessible for the public while keeping its prices at the lowest. However, the most notable feature of this company is its products. Its home furniture is easy to recognize for its style, modularity, and reusability (O’Neill, 2021). There is a constant stream of new products in IKEA, giving customers a reason to keep visiting it on a regular basis.In conclusion, IKEA’s marketing mix shows how affordable, stylish, and recognizable products are able to capture customers’ hearts and solidify a company’s success for decades to come. There is a piece of furniture for every need and every customer’s taste, as their modularity enables creativity beyond compare. IKEA’s drive to provide its customers with products they desire gave it an immense competitive advantage in Europe and worldwide.
Allergic rhinitis is an intermittent or persistent inflammation of the mucous membrane of the upper respiratory tract, characterized by nasal congestion, discharge, itching, sneezing, and a combination of several symptoms is possible. In this situation, a 35-year-old patient presented with nasal congestion, eyelid edema, conjunctival erythema, allergic folds and spangles, and inflamed nostrils, which confirms her diagnosis (Seidman et al., 2015). A medical specialist identified some of the symptoms listed.The hypersensitivity reaction is the first type since allergic rhinitis is determined by it. The allergen, having entered the body for the first time, causes the appearance of specific antibodies, immunoglobulins, which are fixed on the surface of mast cells. Upon repeated contact of an already sensitized organism with an irritant, IgE-dependent activation of mast cells occurs (Hoyte & Nelson, 2018). This process causes the release of histamine, heparin, and other inflammatory mediators responsible for the manifestation of allergic reactions. In fact, pathophysiology implies that the initial intake of the allergen causes the production of IgE by plasma cells.Three subjective conclusions from this situation are: the patient experiences constant sneezing, considers the complication of infectious diseases and describes improvement away from home in a different climate. A specialist established objective conclusions: firstly, eyelid edema and allergic sheen caused by venous edema of the lower eyelid. In other words, allergies give inflammation to the eyes. Secondly, inflamed nostrils and an allergic fold indicate a stable runny nose. Thirdly, the constancy of these signs shows the constant close presence of a source of irritation.First of all, it is necessary
not respected in reality (Gutiérrez 5). Therefore, most of them wanted to be viewed as Spanish Americans rather than people of Mexican descent to avoid stigmatization. I agree with the author’s final point that this historical event created not only a political border between two neighbors but caused subsequent misunderstandings in the relationships between the two nations.In summary, the first chapter in Foley’s Mexicans in the Making of America talks about the origin of Mexican Americans. Specifically, it analyzed the role of the war between Mexico and the U.S. for Texas’s territory in the future political climate between these countries. Overall, the annexation of Texas damaged the relations between them, resulting in the negative perception of Mexican immigrant workers and the desire of Mexican Americans to hide their ancestry.
seems that “the show-off” might negatively influence the moods of all the members, considering that it is easy to get irritated by such a type of behavior (Jacobs et al., 2016). In addition, show-offs’ aim is to impress people around them, especially a group leader, and to do so, they usually opt for talking without a stop or boasting, which distracts other members. It is a common issue in group settings as such members desire to attract attention to themselves as they might be insecure or not confident in themselves. That is why the show-offs tend to answer all the questions, even those that are not directed at them. Moreover, they can attract a leader’s attention by asking irrelevant or off-topic questions.As a matter of fact, non-stop talking may be an obstacle for reaching a productive learning atmosphere as, eventually, people will be irritated and not have acquired any helpful knowledge during the lesson. The constant involvement of the show-offs in the educational process is likely to annoy other members so that they will develop hatred for such type of behavior (Forsyth, 2019). Furthermore, the show-offs can easily prevent the group from reaching the set aim by distracting them through their foolery and over-involvement in the whole process. Overall, such members can harm the group’s productivity and effectiveness in learning as they opt for attracting all the attention to themselves without giving other individuals opportunities to realize their potentials within the settings.
The problem of unauthorized termination of life is the source of numerous debates. On the part of religion, this problem has several flaws at once, the most important of which is the commission of a great sin before God, who gives people life. Moreover, the negative consequences of euthanasia are the devaluation of human life, violation of the equality of people before the law, medical duty, and the structure of the doctor-patient relationship. Thus, it can be concluded that the spread of the popularity of euthanasia will lead to a complete loss and restructuring of the system of human values. This paper examines the case study of George, who has fallen ill with a severe illness that will eventually completely deprive him of mobility. Because of the negative emotions that have overtaken and the understanding that the disease is incurable, the man thinks to solve the problem by euthanasia. Hence, using literary sources, a scientific paper analyzes the problem of intentional death and religious considerations.In the modern world, despite the relatively progressive development of medicine, people are faced with diseases that, unfortunately, do not respond to any treatment. In such cases, the blow that the disease inflicts both physically and mentally can be tough to bear. Because of the fear of losing self-care and dignity, people are thinking about euthanasia or, in other words, voluntary suicide. However, this statement contradicts God’s attempts to restore the Christian religion. Thus, this scientific paper explores a thematic study about a man who has lost hope and is thinking about
euthanasia.The case study, which is the basis of this research paper, presents the reader with the story of a middle-aged man George. He leads an average lifestyle, works, spends time with his family, and devotes time to his own interests. However, one day a man begins to experience muscle weakness and immunity to muscle coordination. Subsequently, he gets injured, and when he goes to the doctor, he gets a far from satisfactory diagnosis. According to the results of further tests, George is diagnosed with such a severe and terrible disease like amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). This disease is expressed in the disruption of the nerve cells of the brain, which are responsible for the muscles and spinal cord (Westeneng et al., 2018). The most famous representative of a person with this disease is the great scientist Stephen Hawking (Westeneng et al., 2018). Deviation leads to the complete demobilization of a person, but aspects such as smell, touch, sight, hearing, and taste remain.George was informed that ALS currently has no treatment, and its development can only be suppressed by certain drugs, but scientists have not yet found ways to stop the disease. This news can plunge into deep shock and depression and cause a lot of strong negative emotions and confusion. That is what happened to George, who was terrified of being a wheelchair user and delegating all the responsibilities of fulfilling basic needs to his family members. The idea of becoming dependent and losing control of his own body did not give the man peace of
mind, and therefore he began to think about making life easier for his relatives by resorting to such a measure as euthanasia.The problem of using euthanasia is acute in modern society. In the United States of America, this measure has been legalized in nine regions (Hoehner, 2001). The main argument held by supporters of this intentional termination of life is to get rid of prolonged agony to death thanks to the development of medical technologies (Orr, 2001). Despite this, the spread of this method of death can lead to high medical costs for the families of patients, since due to low legalization rate, euthanasia is a costly service. The opposite is the opinion of Christianity, which denies euthanasia. For this faith, the main emphasis is placed on the fact that the near-death period is characterized by love, compassion and reconciliation, and care, which euthanasia deprives a person of.The main problem with regard to euthanasia on the part of the Christian religion is the fact of violation of the law of God. Thus, the Christian doctrine emphasizes that God gives a person life and determines when to take it away. Euthanasia implies that patients decide the date of their death themselves, which is equivalent to one of the main sins of religion – suicide. Despite the fact that euthanasia involves the introduction of a particular drug by a medical specialist and not by a patient, it is the patient who is responsible for the decision taken in this case. Sources also emphasize that “Doctors may help their
patients to die a dignified death from natural causes, but they should not kill their patients or help them to kill themselves” (Anderson, 2015, p. 1). Thus, in the eyes of religion, this action is also a sin since it can already be considered as intentional murder, that is, the decision to take someone else’s life.In addition, the scientific literature provides several main reasons not to support euthanasia. One of them is the introduction of risk for the weak and defenseless. Moreover, giving the doctor responsible for taking someone’s life can significantly negatively affect the doctor-patient relationship. In addition, it is also worth emphasizing the violation of relationships within the patient’s family and will violate such fundamental concepts as human dignity and equality before the law (Anderson, 2015). Supporting the Christian point of view, people should not help others to kill themselves but provide the necessary level of care and support to soften and bring calm into the life of the patient.On the one hand, in the light of the Christian narrative, George’s sufferings can be interpreted, as already mentioned, with an emphasis on the sinfulness of the world. This is due to the fact that euthanasia is considered suicide and cannot be justified by religion. On the other hand, the fear of future loss of control over their lives and loss of dignity significantly affect the patient. When considering the emphasis on the hope of resurrection, then the experiences of a man can be interpreted as a desire for a speedy meeting with the almighty.
sins. Thirdly, the promotion and dissemination of the popularity of this event can destroy the idea that human life is worth living, and people are obliged to support each other’s desire to continue living.Thus, it can be concluded that there are no options for justifying the procedure of intentional termination of life in the Christian worldview. All those factors that were listed earlier contribute to this argument. Based on my worldview, I can say that I consider euthanasia an easy way to solve problems, which is not a positive aspect. Hence, I believe that life cannot be stopped simply by wishing it since the Almighty has prepared a unique path and purpose for each person. However, I cannot be entirely sure of my opinion since I have never encountered situations like George’s from the case study, and I hope that I will never encounter them. Such a statement is since a person’s behavior in a stressful situation can change dramatically, but I hope that I will be able to preserve dignity and reason to make the right decision.
off due to the challenging situation in which the corporations could not sustain airports with such a low passenger rate. The airline companies have experienced major economic challenges that have been facilitated by all the negative implications of the pandemic on civil aviation. As a result, fewer seats were being offered (-50%), and fewer passengers were able to travel via plane (-2,7 bn) (Economic impacts of covid-19 on Civil Aviation, 2021). The effect was slightly balanced out due to the fact that cargo flights have been less impacted or even increased in rates due to the transportation of medical supplies (Nižetić, 2020, p. 10953).However, as vaccines became available and fewer restrictions were put in place, the situation has changed for the better in 2021. More opportunities have occurred due to the less rigid regulatory implementations, vaccination, and other beneficial factors. As exemplified in the relevant literature, the lost revenue in 2021 was slightly lower ($324 Bn). Even though these figures look dismal, the year 2021 has seen a slight improvement, with the years to come sure to be better and better.
The offered case study revolves around the change process within the Norwegian hospital X. The central idea was to go paperless and shift towards using the most innovative ways to work with patients, including electronic patient records (EPR) and electronic care plans (ECP). The proposed reconsideration was associated with numerous challenges linked to the nature of new technology and staff experiences and skills. For instance, nurses training to acquire knowledge of how to use new approaches was complicated by the lack of time and the absence of experience. Also, nursing assistants were unfamiliar with paperwork and documents, which was an additional limitation. However, it is possible to admit the positive nature of the outlined change and its possibility to promote positive outcomes. Several reasons from the case can help to prove this statement.First of all, the change can be analyzed using Lewin’s model, implying three major phases. These are unfreezing, change, and refreezing typical for all processes. Thus, Norwegian hospital management followed the model, which served as the basis for positive outcomes. Preliminary meetings with the staff and discussions helped to clarify existing expectations and fears. During this phase, the top management and health workers created a shared vision and agreed to engage in the change process, although there were some factors that could be viewed as barriers to attaining success. Moreover, the benefits of integrating the EPR and ECP were outlined, contributing to the growing interest and motivation to participate in the process. It means that the successful unfreezing phase was one of the success
each other during the most critical moments and were ready to do extra work to ensure the change continues and there are no critical barriers influencing outcomes.Finally, the role of leadership should also be admitted as managers create the basis for change. It was achieved due to the close cooperation with team members and a clear outline of goals along with their benefits. Leaders play a critical role in any change process as they can introduce needed corrections or redistribute resources if any problems occur. For the discussed case, effective leadership helped to correctly address the emerging complexities and unit the staff. The high level of support and cooperation can be viewed as the result of the effective strategy selected by leaders to address the problem and ensure the change process is successful. Altogether, the case shows that regardless of several problems that appeared during the process, the change in Norwegian hospitals can be determined as overall positive. The health workers were motivated to acquire new skills and learn new methods to work with patients and documents.
This fact might be surprising, however, the survey conducted by the Pew Research Centre (2021) reveals that from 2015 onwards the number of people using cell phones is gradually increasing. More precisely, in 2015 cell phones were used by 95 percent of respondents and in 2021 this number increased by 2 percent (Pew Research Centre, 2021). Undoubtedly, the growth is not drastic, but still, it exists. What is even more curious, only 85 percent of respondents use smartphones (Pew Research Centre, 2021). Therefore, it is a mistake to assume that cell phones are leftovers from a long time ago. Instead, people still need them, and the company is capable of presenting a cellphone of good quality and reasonable price.Cell phones are commonly used in companies as a means of communication between employees. The problem is that since the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020, many organizations transfer a significant share of employees to remote work. People who work from home are more likely to use personal smartphones and messengers to communicate with colleagues. From another point of view, the situation is gradually going back to normal and the shift of employees to remote work could be considered a temporary threat to our idea.To make the product more competitive, it is necessary to focus on its technical characteristics. Since 2019, American companies have widely introduced 5G smartphones (Gallagher & DeVine, 2019). 5G devices transmit signals 10 times faster in comparison with 4G ones. Therefore, it is necessary to incorporate this 5G technology into our new cellphone.To
An article published in Ahram Online provides information about the controversial statements of TV host Ibrahim Eissa regarding the journey of Al-Miraj. El-Sayed Gamal El-Din, the author of the article, first provides a brief overview of the event, followed by reactions from the officials and community, as well as background on past news related to Eissa. Additionally, the article provides information about the upcoming prosecution concerning the statements of the TV host.First of all, it is necessary to evaluate the article in terms of codes of ethics considering ethical news values. In terms of accuracy, the material presents facts, and the author does not present his personal opinion on the issue, which makes the article the most devoid of bias. Most importantly, El-Sayed quotes statements from the TV host and various stakeholders without commentary, which eliminates subjectivity. In terms of confirmation and tenacity, the reporter gives not only statements but also opinions of the community, presents the prospect of prosecution, and also gives background information about Eissa. These factors allow the reader to compose a more comprehensive perception of the event beyond the immediate news.The author also respects diversity, citing the opinions of both official bodies and religious communities for whom this event is important. In terms of dignity and reciprocity, The reporter uses non-emotionally colored vocabulary, which corresponds to the journalistic style. Additionally, El-Sayed tries to provide as much information as possible about the event and the reaction that it caused in the community. This factor also corresponds to the value of community, as it
reveals the possible impact of Eissa’s statements on society.However, concerning equity, the article does not seem complete enough, as it focuses more on the reaction to this event. Within the framework of the information provided, it is not entirely clear whether there are supporters of the statements of the TV host or whether the community as a whole reacted negatively to his statements. Accordingly, in this regard, the value of sufficiency is also inadequately addressed since not all information resources are covered.Based on the analysis of codes of ethics, one can also conclude the objectivity and credibility of this material. Objectivity prescribes that all parties affected by the event have an equal right to be covered in the article. However, within the framework of the article by El-Sayed, not enough attention is paid to the opinion of Eissa himself, as well as his possible supporters. This factor can make the article biased, and additional information about the past actions of the TV host can create a negative perception of the protagonist of the story among readers. In terms of credibility, the article meets the requirements of journalistic standards, as it provides information resources and quotes, and does not refer to abstract assumptions.A coherent theory of truth can be applied to this news report as the information presented in it is consistent with other beliefs. El-Sayed celebrates the opinions of the religious community, revealing the common opinion on the event, which makes it acceptable within society. It is necessary to keep in mind that the covered event
in the article refers to religious beliefs that are extremely significant for the major part of Egyptian society. This material, therefore, can be considered from the point of view of utilitarianism, which involves reporting events with the goal of the least harm to the largest population. In this situation, the lack of information from possible supporters of the TV host may be a desire to satisfy the interests of the majority of society and not offend their feelings.An article published in the BBC reports that those accused of killing a Black man in Georgia were found guilty of hate crimes. Bailey says the three men who killed 25-year-old Ahmaud Arbery because of his race were convicted of the crime. The author gives an overview of the situation, provides the opinion of both lawyers and prosecutors, and also talks about the significance of the event for the family of the victim.Within the framework of codes of ethics and adherence to ethical news values, this material meets higher requirements than an article in a local publication. First of all, the facts presented are objective and provide complete information about the situation, including the identity and age of the participants, their motives, and the events of the trial. Additionally, the author of the article mentions persons who declined to comment, which corresponds to the principles of accuracy, confirmation, as well as sufficiency. The inclusion of several parties in the report also meets the principles of equity. Even though the story received a wide public outcry and a negative reaction,
facts and official statements. At the same time, the perception of the family is presented as an opinion, which is clearly stated in the material. This approach does not allow readers to form bias but to perceive stories as interconnected. The credibility of the material is also extremely high, as the names of specific persons who comment on this event are given. Additionally, the author uses quotations and notes where and when the cited statements were made.This article can be viewed from the point of view of the correspondence theory of truth. Within this view, the factual and accurate information that is presented to readers is most important. The material of the article is written based on official decisions and statements of the parties involved, which makes it objective and based on facts, not assumptions. Additionally, the report is not subject to different opinions and beliefs. This article is also most consistent with the moral principle school of Stuart Mill, which focuses on the outcome of an event. In this case, the value of the accusation for the family is affirmed as a moral victory that is significant for them.
The researchers base their conclusion on three well-designed case studies touching on various software applications. The case studies include evaluating bone fractures following traffic accidents, bone injuries caused by a spade, and gunshot wounds on the head, which offer valuable data on enhancing contemporary forensic investigations (Buck et al., 2008). The modeling software and haptic device used for the study boast high precision, low friction, superior fidelity, and output capacity of six degrees of freedom. In the present world, these are top-notch specifications for such discourses. However, replicating the study to verify the findings may prove a challenge due to the high cost of assembling all the specimens and equipment utilized therein (Pinzon et al., 2016).The researchers do well to draw their interpretations and conclusions from the gathered data involving the three separate case studies cited above. The results of the studies indicate that haptic devices can prove very valuable in post-mortem and forensic investigations. In forensic science, the research can be instrumental in enabling investigators to recreate a crime scene (such as gun-holding position) and identify the object used in the crime with enhanced precision and speed. Hagmann et al. (2021) thus note that the use of haptics in forensic science can hasten the criminal justice process and make investigations more reliable.The research is highly innovative as it facilitates the use of technology to recreate crime scenes and enables the user to get the sense of touch often lost during such virtual excursions. Thus, the user can handle and feel 3D digital information, which is significant innovation and improves current technologies. According to Joukal et al. (2015), there may arise controversies surrounding the use of haptics due to fears of corrupting operating systems and online hacking to manipulate investigation findings. Such possibilities may impact the reliability of such devices in criminal justice proceedings. In terms of ethics, the machines make investigations much more expensive to conduct due to costly equipment and training for personnel involved (Fahrni et al., 2019). The costs may hinder the quest for justice in some cases, primarily in low-income areas. Nevertheless, the innovation is evident, and the researchers do well to draw solid conclusions based on their three well-designed case studies.
Imbalances and ExcessesWaterThe amount of food taken was recommendable on the first day, but the nutrients were not well distributed among the types of foods chosen. According to the principles of water should be taken regularly at least eight glasses a day. Water helps flush out harmful substances in the body, keep our bodies hydrated, and help us lose weight (Knight 1). Water is also vital because it aids during digestion and forms part of all the body fluids. Not even a glass of water was included among all the diets chosen for the three days.ProteinsThe foods containing proteins consumed on the first day are well distributed even though they have high calories. The foods containing proteins on the first day included cheeseburgers, eggs, and yogurt. The sources on the second day, milk and chicken breasts, are also sources of proteins, but they also contain calories. The source of proteins on the third day has the highest amount of calories which is dangerous. Proteins are vital in the diet in that they are the construction blocks of a lifetime; each cell in the human body comprises protein. The basic arrangement of protein is a hindrance of amino acids. One needs protein to help their bodies heal cells and produce new ones.Sources of proteins should not contain large amounts of calories as they are harmful to health. Human bodies store up excess fats when we eat more calories than we use up. If this behavior becomes, frequent one may put on more weight. Adding weight may lead
to obesity, which is a source of other health conditions that are harmful to the body. Calories in excess are unhealthy, so the daily diet should contain minimal calories or do more physical exercises so they are broken. Principles of nutrition suggest that to uphold a steady weight, the vigor that is put into people’s bodies must be the same as the one utilized during physical roles and bodily activity (Villegas 30). There are also minimal foods eaten over the two days that are sources of proteins like chicken and yogurt.PotassiumPotassium is a mineral required by all of the body’s cells. Since it contains a modest electric charge that activates frequent cell and neuron actions, it is also known as an alkali. Potassium is an organic mineral that might be present in several meals and taken as a supplement. Its principal objective in the blood is to contribute to maintaining steady fluid balance in our cells. Sodium keeps fluid heights stable outside of cells. Potassium also helps in muscular contraction and supports regular heart rates.Vitamins A and EVitamins are minimal in the diet because their primary sources are fruits and vegetables, which are minimally included in the diet. Another low-supplied mineral in the three da diet is minimal. Vitamins are essential because they are preventive foods. They prevent our bodies from disease b increasing the immune system. Fruits should be included in the diet eaten fifteen minutes before the meal. Taking them before eating ensures that the appetite is boosted.IronThe only meal in the diet that
supplies iron is the cereals taken on the second day. Iron is essential for the formation of blood. About 70% of the cell’s Iron is contained in blood, including in blood cells and deoxygenated blood, found in cardiac tissues. Red blood cells are required to deliver oxygen and nutrients to the muscles in your blood. Myoglobin receives, stores, transports, and releases muscle fibers into the atmosphere. About 6% of the body’s Iron is found in proteins required for breathing and carbohydrate metabolism, as well as enzymes associated with the manufacture of keratin and transmitters. Iron is also necessary for healthy immunological activity. All the foods containing calories are energy sources, so energy-giving foods were well supplied throughout the three days.CaloriesCalories were supplied in excess, and it is advised that the individual increase daily physical activities to ensure that they are used up. All the junk foods contain a high amount of calories. Calories are essential for the body because they are the primary sources of energy, but they should be taken in controlled amounts. Thus, to conduct the basic operations of life, the person’s body requires calories.ZincZinc is a vital nutrient in the body, and the body does not naturally manufacture it, so supplement foods are recommended. It is a nutrient found in the body and helps the body’s immune systems and metabolic rate. Zinc is also important for remedying injuries and improving the sagacity of the palate and scent. Through diverse nutrition, the body acquires adequate zinc. Zinc can be acquired from various foods such
as chicken, red meat, fortified breakfast, and cereals.Proper Diet RecommendationsThe nutrition principles require people to avoid canned foods because they are not suitable for their health. Packaged meals are highly damaging to your health since they include a variety of dangerous components. People may want to fill their bodies with delicious healthy grains and fresh foods while avoiding empty carbohydrates and hydrogenated oils. Consume 100 percent whole grains meals such as whole wheat tortillas, whole grain bread, and brown rice to provide the system with more consistent energy.Breakfast is the essential dish of each day, so it is mandatory to have it! Taking the mornings to eat a well-balanced meal will be extremely helpful to your health. A well-balanced breakfast increases your metabolism and gets your day started on the right foot. A poached egg, a cup of milk, whole wheat bread, fresh produce, and a cup of coffee are all excellent options. One feels full and energized the entire morning, and you will not go for harmful snacks like crackers.The principles of nutrition will be used in panning for the other meal. A good breakfast should contain the following whole grains, such as waffles or cold grain whole cereals—lean proteins that include eggs, lean meat, legumes, and groundnuts. Fruits should also be included in the morning meals. Cereal is an intelligent option since studies show that people that eat cereal for breakfast ingest fewer carbohydrates are much less likely to become obese than those who eat other breakfast meals. Cereals, on the other hand, are
In every firm, regardless of the industry, the gathered raw data needs organization, summarization, and visualization to turn the data into useful information. Evans and William (2014) show that statistics entails the knowledge associated with data gathering, organization, examination, clarification, and presentation. From a biblical perspective, statistics entails summing up and numbering. In Numbers 1:2, the Lord commanded Moses to, “Take ye the sum of all congregation of the children of Israel, after their families, by the house of their fathers, with the number of their names, every male by their polls” ( King James Bible , 2017). The authors further point out that about Six Sigma, statistical understanding is significant since it helps comprehend possible data trends, patterns, and changes in a specific time (Evans and Williams, 2014). As a healthcare administrator, this knowledge is essential since it will assist in understanding how my organization compares its performance relative to its rivals, business units, and best-in-class benchmarks while acknowledging the association among various metrics.Descriptive statistics represents how data is numerically and visually presented and might include charts, histograms, and frequency distributions in the organization and presentation of information. Database software like Access and Microsoft Excel facilitates how data can be summarized by every employee (Evans and Williams, 2014). As a healthcare administrator, the application of descriptive statics will be essential since it helps in minimizing the overall time required for inpatient admission, treatment, and discharge from the appropriate hospital department. Furthermore, under my administration, the application of such software will allow my subordinates to quickly
the Excel function MEDIAN, which is the data range.The most frequently occurring data is what constitutes the mode. As a healthcare administrator, the significance of the mode value will lie in the understanding that it consists of a relatively small number comprised of unique datasets. In a set of numbers where repeating numbers are few, the practical value of mode is also limited. When using Excel, the function MODE.SNGL or MODE.MULT represents the data range where the mode value can be obtained (Evans and Williams, 2014). Lastly, variance is a dispersion measure that relies on every data, and the larger the variance value, the more widely spread the data, and the more variability can be observed. However, this value cannot be provided using Excel and, as such, can only be calculated manually.
The work of a clinical or medical office worker is characterized by a combination of a large number of administrative operations with medical activities. Primarily, these professionals are office assistants filling out paperwork and interacting with staff (“How to become a medical office assistant,” 2021). As a result, I will be approaching interviews for this job in a professional business style. While the fitting suit can be expensive, I already have the proper formal attire. Using my black formal suit, shoes, and minimal accessories, I can make the right impression without reducing my budget. In warm weather, I can go to an interview right in a suit, and in cold weather, I can add my usual outerwear, for example, an overcoat.Work clothes, theoretically, may require additional investments and purchases. All healthcare workers, including office workers, must wear a special uniform called scrubs, consisting of a short-sleeved shirt and trousers. This uniform is relatively cheap, and a single set of scrubs can be found on Amazon for about $20-$40 (“Medical assistant’s uniform,” 2019). Most of all, in this context, one needs to take care of shoes since these specialists sometimes have to stand or walk a lot. A good pair of closed-toe shoes can cost around $100, but I have tennis shoes that fit the dress code (“Medical assistant’s uniform,” 2019). However, it must be taken into account that many medical institutions issue uniforms on their own, considering them as consumables, so the choice of purchasing a uniform will depend on the rules of a particular hospital. In any case, it is simple and easy to wear, so it will not entail high costs.Reflecting on the points studied and prepared, I want to note that the new information will affect my budget and life plan very little. In the best case, if the hospital issues uniforms, I won’t have to spend any money at all, as I can wear my existing suit for the interview and shoes for work. In the worst case, I will still be within the budget when I have to buy everything for work. Therefore, I can put that $200 aside and mentally prepare for possible demands from my interviewers. In addition, this study showed that the issue of clothing for interviews and work is not a problem for me, and I am already prepared for it in many respects.
In less than two decades, Amazon has changed the way consumers think about online shopping. Before the launch of Prime in 2005, two-day shipping was virtually unheard of. However, nowadays, millions of people are users of this service. In the beginning, free two-day shipping was Prime’s biggest selling point. But as Amazon expanded, the promise of free two-day shipping came with a host of caveats. For example, the company does not deliver small goods, such as razors or hair ties, separately. Instead, customers must purchase $25 worth of items before Amazon ships those items. As for the clients, they are dissatisfied with such conditions. Del Valle (2019) argues that the Prime service is like a gimmick that gives shoppers a false sense of security till they go to the checkout and see a delivery date much later than expected. In turn, this solution is beneficial for the company, as it reduces the cost of delivery.To understand its motives, it’s important to descry Amazon’s warehousing. With the spread of the pandemic, consumers have become more likely to use online shopping. Waddell and Singh (2021) note that between 2015 and 2019, Amazon opened an average of about 75 new warehouses per year, ranging from huge warehouses and fulfillment centers too much smaller delivery stations. In turn, in 2020, Amazon opened nearly 300 new properties, allowing users to shorten the waiting time for an item.In addition to the quantitative aspect, it is important to consider the qualitative one. According to Organized chaos: Behind the scenes of Amazon’s inventory management
The years between 1901 and 2000 provide enough evidence of the Surrealists’ artwork. The contradicting conditions between dreaming and reality are the rationale behind the introduction of surrealism. According to Anirudh (2017), the surrealism movement involved literature and visual arts that made headlines between World War I and two. Surrealists initiated a philosophical and artistic movement that examined the workings of the mind throughout the 20th century. Artists hoped to change people’s lives by striking a balance between a rational understanding of life and one that recognized the unconscious and the power of dreams. To physically show their imaginations, many surrealists now use automatic drawing or writing. In the past, artists used mysticism, ancient cultures, and indigenous art knowledge to connect with their minds. This essay will discuss surrealism, the agenda behind Surrealists’ movements, and how cultures and dreams can be interpreted through artwork.The agenda with Surrealists was to promote mind emancipation as well as artistic expression liberation. Artists intended to show that what a person thinks or what is in the mind can be pulled out through art. Different types of art such as bizarre have been remarkably successful in promoting artwork by trying to express different mind states. Surrealists attempted to tap into the unconscious mindset to reflect the creative potential. Experts who despised rationalism and literary realism and were heavily influenced by psychoanalysis believed that the rational mind stifled the power of the imagination by imposing taboos. The Surrealists’ desire to tap into the unconscious mind, as well as their interests in myth
Lady MaryLady Mary Wroth was a member of a distinguished literary family during the Renaissance. She was the niece of Mary Herbert, an eminent writer and patron during the 16th century. Mary married Robert Roth, but their marriage was unhappy. In the meantime, Lady Mary began to vent her grief with the help of poetry. Thus, her sonnet In this strange labyrinth represents the author’s throwing about the mysteries that love keeps. The significance of Lady Mary for literature is that she was the first female poet in England to write a complete sequence of sonnets called from Pamphilia to Amphilanthus.“In this strange Labyrinth how shall I turn/Ways are on all sides”The image of one who is lost in the labyrinth of love and is desperately looking for a way out is common in the sonnets of the Renaissance. In many gardens at this time there were labyrinths that played the role of an entertainment event. Thus, the very name of the sonnet personifies the labyrinth in which every lover rushes about. The lyrical hero describes the difficult situation in which he found himself with the help of the words “In this strange Labyrinth how shall I turn/Ways are on all sides” (Wroth). Different paths diverge in all directions, but none of them seems right.The origins of the labyrinth referred to in the poem find their origin in the myth of Theseus. The hero was saved by a woman named Ariadne, who gave him a golden thread so that Theseus could find a way out of
the lyrical hero’s anger is due to the fact that the speaker is faced with many ways representing love. However, these are all personifications of one person’s romantic love for another, and none of them are “the way”, which means the love of Christ.Finally, the heroine makes her decision in the third stanza. She understands that it seems impossible for her to choose one path that she will take and she chooses all paths. Thus, the heroine asks “let me take the right, or left hand way”. She tolerates her insecurities and moves on by enduring suffering. However, at the end, the focus shifts and the heroine realizes that she wants to leave the labyrinth. Thus, she wants to follow the thread of love, no matter how this road ends.
SummaryKnee injuries are very common, especially in sports medicine, and can have severe consequences for the patient, limiting their movements and impeding daily routines. There are four ligaments connecting the thigh and shin bones: medial collateral (MCL), lateral collateral (LCL), posterior cruciate (PCL), and anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) (National Library of Medicine (NLM)). The last one is the focus of the current study. The ACL is located in the middle of the knee joint and keeps the shin bone in its place behind the end of the thigh bone (NLM). When one overextends a knee joint, receives a hit at the side of it, or quick stops and changes direction while running or landing from a jump, the ACL can be overstretched or torn (NLM). An ACL injury can also occur with other knee injuries, such as a torn MCL or knee cartilage-meniscus (NLM). ACL injuries most frequently occur in the middle of the ligament or when it is pulled out of the thigh bone (NLM). Thus, the ACL is an important but vulnerable part of the human body.Most patients with ACL injuries require professional medical help and surgery. When an ACL injury occurs, the gap between torn edges prevents them from healing on their own (NLM). Therefore, patients undergo ACL reconstruction (ACLR) – the replacement of the torn ligament with a graft (Fineberg et al., 2000). Grafts can be taken from the patient’s body (autografts) or a cadaver (allografts) (Johnson et al., 1992; Frank & Jackson, 1997). These grafts are commonly harvested from a patellar
tendon or a hamstring tendon (Johnson et al., 1992; Frank & Jackson, 1997). Other allografts sources include Achilles, tibialis anterior, and quadriceps tendons (Shino et al., 1986). However, a bone-patellar tendon-bone (BPTB) autograft is widely accepted as the most suitable and reliable (Kurosaka et al., 1987; Noyes et al., 1984). Despite other kinds of grafts gaining popularity, it is still the most common choice for ACLR (Lee et al., 2008). Thus, a bone-patellar tendon-bone (BPTB) autograft as a method of anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction (ACLR) was chosen as the object of study.Although BPTB grafts are widely used for ACLR, little research was conducted to identify and study all of its possible complications. According to Almazan et al. (2006), intraoperative incidents and complications during ACLR with a BPTB autograft are quite frequent due to the procedure’s complexity. However, the researchers concluded that all of them occur due to technical errors during graft harvesting, tunnel placement, or graft fixation and are preventable (Almazan et al., 2006). Serious intra- or post-operative incidents and complications, such as a patella fracture or a late patellar tendon rupture, are very rare (Marumoto et al., 1996). Moreover, Stein et al.’s research (2002) demonstrated that even such incidents caused minimal changes in patients’ outcomes when they followed post-operative rehabilitation guidelines. As Milankov et al. (2012) noted, it did not affect their mobility, and most of the patients continued to engage in sports activities at the same or even higher level after nine months since ACLR. In brief, ACLR with a BPTB autograft is a
AbstractPreventative health care is founded on the premise that lifestyle choices, environmental factors, and genetic predispositions all have a role to play in the health outcomes of individuals. Therefore, the main aim of preventive care is to address these factors and prevent diseases from happening. The methods for increasing preventative care are explored and a project proposed that can be standardized across all healthcare facilities. Some of the methods have been studied and are presented in the current literature. Examples include primary care visits, clinical decision support systems, and cognitive-behavioral therapy. The applicability of each of these methods can be evaluated from a project management perspective where the recommendations involve the implementation of a single comprehensive program that incorporates all of them. Therefore, the project lifecycle approach is used for this exercise where four stages are implemented: initiation, planning, execution, and control/monitoring.IntroductionPublic health is a major concern for many countries, as illustrated by the devastating effects of the recent coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic. Lifestyle choices, environmental factors, and genetic predispositions all have a role in the health outcomes of individuals. Therefore, there is a need to target these factors to prevent diseases. This is the essence of preventative care as practices across the world. The focus of this paper is on identifying and implementing methods of increasing preventative care measures. Principles of project management are used, including identification and definition of the project scope, highlighting the roles and responsibilities of stakeholders, and identifying critical resources needed to achieve the set goals.The implications for this research include that
it helps put into practice the ideas proposed by previous work in this area. In its relation to previous work, a critical examination of available literature reveals methods that can be applied to increase preventative care measures. The research strategy involves a systematic review of literature to gather ideas about the viable options and use these ideas to develop practice recommendations.Project StatementThe project focuses on preventative care, a subject that has been approached from multiple perspectives in literature. For instance, AHRQ,( 2018) labels preventative cases as a means of achieving health equity by eliminating the health inequalities in a country’s population. However, the basic idea is that preventative care is the best approach to a country’s health outcomes since it prevents diseases and pandemics from devastating the population. According to Ngwewondo et al. (2020), the COVID-19 serves as a perfect case study for illustrating how preventive measures work. In their research, the authors established that most of the respondents scored high in preventative measures and positive health-seeking behaviors. While such findings highlight that preventative measured were undertaken, a large population still suffered from the symptoms of COVID-19.In other such contexts as the United Kingdom (UK), some preventative measures included the creation of an innovation hub that focuses on increasing preventative healthcare. During the pandemic, the hub was used as a vaccination center and proved effective (HHM Global, n.d.). Such innovation has led the stakeholders to contemplate the creation of similar facilities as a preparation for future pandemics. Therefore, there is a need to examine the effectiveness
of preventative measures and find a means of making them even more effective.Problem SignificanceThe significance of this project is manifested by the recent health problems facing the planet, including infections and pandemics. As mentioned earlier, these health outcomes are subject to the environment within which we live. Therefore, this endeavor serves as a blueprint to be used by the relevant stakeholders to implement better healthcare practices. The importance of preventative health measures is outlined, and the methods to increase its measures are recommended. The implications of the project include that the policymakers in the healthcare sector will adopt the proposed methods. Additionally, preventive care requires the relevant authorities to make the required investments (Health Business, 2019). Therefore, the proposed project should get all stakeholders informed on what pathways to follow to increase preventative health measures.Literature ReviewThe current literature on preventative care has often focused on its benefits and approaches, often emphasizing that it is the best way to approach some of the major health problems facing society. According to Hostetter et al., (2020), primary care visits have been known to influence health behaviors, but links between these visits and preventive interventions remain unclear. In this case, primary care visits are perceived as a mechanism for receiving preemptive care in such forms as vaccinations, colonoscopy, and mammography. The conclusion reached is that at least one primary visit a year will increase evidence-based preventative care measures without any increase in costs. The same observations have been made by Sabety et al. (2021), who finds that primary care visits
improve the quality of care, patient outcomes, and improved delivery of preventative services. The outcomes of this form of care include lower rates of hospitalization and fewer emergency visits. As a result, the overall cost of care is also greatly reduced. Therefore, primary care visits can be considered one of the most effective methods of increasing preventative care measures.Decision support systems are considered a critical method for increasing preventative care measures and outcomes. A study by Bowen (et al., 2017) expresses that a decision support system improves the performance of preventive health quality measures where care is done elsewhere, and patient exceptions are captured. While this study focuses on performance, the bottom line is that the clinical decision systems effectively capture patient data and identify those eligible for preventative care. Preventative visits were also found to increase after implementing the clinical decision support systems for the population used in the study. Other studies have focused on specific health problems where these systems where the findings indicate that clinical decision support systems improve recognition and management (Kharbanda et al., 2018). In their study, Kharbanda et al. (2018) found that innovative systems had the potential of pooling useful patient-specific data that could be printed and shared among different users. Additionally, the systems contained guidelines for preventative measures and approaches that could be followed by the practitioners. Therefore, decision support systems for clinicians can be an effective method for increasing preventative healthcare measures.Another method that has been covered in the literature is cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT). According to Suganuma et
al. (2018), unguided internet-based CBT has proven an effective method for preventative healthcare for mental health. However, the researchers have presented a pilot study to examine its acceptability and feasibility. The evidence from the study shows internet-guided CBT to be an ideal approach even though it has failed to gather the necessary attention. The rationale is that the use of technology in CBT should not be any different from face-to-face therapy sessions. However, the internet only changes from traditional practices in the mainstream delivery of the services. Even though mental care is the focus of this study, the findings can be generalized over other major health issues. Smartphone delivered CBD has also been investigated by Bakker et al. (2018), who finds that the use of apps to track health issues help in increased preventive care outcomes, including anxiety, depression, and other elements of mental health. The bottom line is that CBT, either delivered traditionally or using new technologies, should be an effective tool for increasing preventive care outcomes.Primary ContentOverview of ProjectBased on the literature provided above, this project seeks to aid in the implementation of preventative care methods. The project can be labeled as a guideline for holistic preventative care, a tool that allows health professionals to select and apply the right method to specific case scenarios. From a project management perspective, the project will be implemented in four stages: initiating, planning, execution, monitoring, and monitoring/controlling.Project InitiationThe initiation phase comprises a project charter and a stakeholder register. The business case for the proposed tool is presented
in the problem statement section (Brown, 2021). The scope includes handling major health issues, including cancer, mental, diabetes, and transmittable infections. The deliverables for the project are a fully functional program with the relevant supporting technologies and a practice guide for practitioners. Funds will need to be invested in clinical decision support systems. It can be estimated that the project can be accomplished in less than a year.PlanningPlanning for the project requires the development of a project management plan. In this case, the plan is to create a comprehensive guide for practitioners, which will be accomplished in stages (Brown, 2021). First, all professionals are trained on the mechanisms of the tool, including how data is gathered and utilized. Second, a supporting IT infrastructure is implemented, for which further training is required. Third, a pilot test for all key features is conducted. Lastly, the project is launched, and its use commences. At this stage, it is expected that any transferable data from other health records will be transferred and used accordingly.Execution PhaseThe project plan is put into action as outlined above. However, the execution phase will require the team to conduct other activities, including stakeholder management and team development (Brown, 2021). As a novel project, the healthcare facilities are required to be informed and educated in all stages of implementation to help the members acquaint themselves with the program and its functionality. Quality assurance tests are also conducted continuously, and corrective actions are taken.Control/MonitoringThis phase focuses on monitoring the progress of the entire project and correcting any
The slave population in the North progressively fell throughout the 1760s and 1770s with slaves in Philadelphia reducing to approximately 700 in 1775 (OpenStax, 2019). Antislavery activism was rife in the city, with nationalist pamphleteers handing out antislavery booklets to blacks and whites. The presence of antislavery groups facilitated the spread of manumissions thus slavery became less viable in the North. New York had a high percentage of slaves who acquired valuable trades such as masonry and goldsmithing working alongside artisan masters. All slaves in New York were freed in 1827 (OpenStax, 2019) despite the liberation sentiment in the North during the Revolutionary battle.The contrasts between indentured servants and slavesIndentured service varied from enslavement in that it was a type of debt servitude where an agreed-upon period of unpaid service that often covered the servant’s costs of immigration to America. Indentured workers were not awarded incomes, although they were housed, clothed, and nourished in most cases. Slaves were deemed property and were only awarded freedom on rare occasions despite several years of strenuous labor (Gabor, 2021). Slaves were sold, exchanged, negotiated for, and even utilized as property in a will.
by the state. Gaming activities could embrace tribal rituals or games of chance, depending on the wishes of the tribes and had to be agreed to by the state (Light and Rand). Since often tribal games are unique and have a deep meaning for the tribe, it would be right to say that granting tribes the right to hold their own games is necessary. This measure helps to uphold their culture and establish sovereignty over a very important sphere of life, which is relaxation. Moreover, gaming helps to support traditions and customs through rituals that have been molded over the centuries.As far as sovereignty is concerned, gaming serves to establish the spheres of life which are completely under the tribes’ jurisdiction. Thus, for example, some tribe members mix with the society at large, finding employment or integrating themselves in the life of big cities. However, gaming, and in particular traditional tribal gaming, serves as a reminder of one’s roots, promotes freedom of choice and sovereignty as it is the one thing that is almost completely under the tribes’ jurisdiction.
for all cases. However, individual freedoms are protected in most areas of social life, including migration, cyber security, economic stability, and international diplomatic relations. Interestingly, actual cyber security policy and practice take both human-centric and national-security-centric approaches (Deibert 411). In this regard, the states develop “indivisible network security on a planetary scale for the widest possible coverage of the human experience” (Deibert 412). The above example indicates the breadth of possibilities for applying the principle.There is probably a counter-argument against the opinion that national security interests should take precedence over individual freedoms. This position can be justified by an external threat or military ambitions and is usually applied by authoritarian regimes. This position is wrong since national security should protect the interest of every citizen, not the abstract idea of the nation. Every citizen is part of the nation and their freedoms should be sacred.Thus, it was discussed, how individual freedoms should never be sacrificed in the name of national security. The necessity to sacrifice individual freedoms is usually promoted by authoritarian regimes whose real purpose is to meet the interests of the regime. On the contrary, in democratic states, individual freedoms are fundamental and cannot be violated under any circumstances. These freedoms are sacred and ensure the integrity of the democratic states.
Infertility is one of the most common problems these days, and it means that a person does not have a chance to get pregnant for several health issues. Many couples in the United States may face this problem, and the causes can vary from congenital diseases to acquired physical or psychological trauma. This body condition does not always affect only females but also males can suffer from this issue. Genetics has a strong influence on infertility, and it may be connected to people of all ages and nationalities. Around 18% of women in the United States between the age of 21 and 52 stated that they had faced infertility in their lives (Mancuso et al., 2020). I believe that environment plays a significant role in this issue. People should be more cautious about their health to predict health problems that may cause the inability to become pregnant or impregnate a partner.The causes of infertility are diverse and might not be seen by non-professionals. For instance, age plays a significant role as the older males and females are, the more chances of receiving infertility. Moreover, hormones play an important role in pregnancy, and when any type of disbalance appears in the human body, problems with pregnancy might arise. Obesity or anorexia can also indicate infertility as the human body spends crucial resources on other areas to support life without giving a chance for women to become pregnant. Some physiological problems like anomalies of the uterus or ovaries may also become the main cause of the issue.The percentage
The healthcare system is currently under significant strain due to the COVID 19 pandemic. The problems of supply and staff shortages in healthcare have existed before but have now worsened. In particular, the issue of shortage of medical supplies is noticeable in the outpatient surgical setting where I work. This problem is directly related to the existing principles of building supply chains in healthcare, which should be subject to change. In this situation, John’s Kotter steps in leading change can become a framework for bringing positive results.The main advantage of this theory is the holistic approach to making changes. Most importantly, Kotter’s theory includes eight steps that are based on the formation and communication of a vision of the need for change (Beauvais & Spahn, 2018). Additionally, this theory is most useful, as it allows innovation to be introduced at a structural rather than purely organizational level. With regard to the described problem, this aspect is the most significant. Eight steps suggested by Kotter that could help in the successful implementation of changes are described below. 1. The first step is to create a sense of urgency for change. Kotter notes that it takes about 75% of supporters to successfully create a sense of urgency (Beauvais & Spahn, 2018, p. 255). This can be achieved through discussions with other nurses and providing information on how the shortage of supplies negatively affects the quality of care and patient outcomes. 2. Successful implementation of change requires building a coalition through the practice of effective leadership. On the issue,
the existence of both love and diamonds: “Yellow diamonds in the light. To make things even more awkward, we’re standing next to each other. You cross my path as your shadow does.” The diamonds in the song symbolize a silver lining that illustrates the chance for a better future and happier days among dark and depressing days. The song made me think about all the possibilities available when things do not turn out to be as I expected.I also chose the song because its presentation, which was both positive and hopeful, and I am always in a good mood when I listen to it. It is also quite inspirational because it encourages listeners to love themselves. Since its launch, the song has won multiple awards and has enjoyed massive success for years. For Rihanna’s career, the song gave a great boost because it was quite catchy and everyone could recognize it from the very first minutes of it playing.
is no longer as lucrative as it used to be a decade ago. It has become the primary way people do shopping, especially in the midst of the Covid-19 pandemic. Therefore, numerous new companies have jumped at the opportunity and managed to extend their market shares. Thus, Amazon is determined to cut costs substantially by various means, including the construction of its fulfillment centres in the neighborhoods that have not fully recovered from recent economic recessions. According to Kinicki (2020), turnover is one of the major outcomes that should be considered while tailoring the set of inputs. Currently, the company’s turnover rate continues to be extremely high.Desired Solution: Utilizing More Conservative Motivation FrameworksThe emphasis on fear, the discouragement of camaraderie and many other Amazon’s current policies substantially undermine employee’s motivation and the company’s public image. The desired potential solution plan includes the introduction of systematic pay raises, the enhancement of bonus systems and changing the way employees are timed. These steps will help the IT giant to motivate employees in a much more positive and respectful way.
IntroductionEvaluation information is one of the main factors in decision-making in various spheres of public life. The data containing results of evaluation procedures gives a specific characteristic of the advantages and disadvantages of various processes, working performance of employees, the effectiveness of production, and more. Therefore, the requirements for the evaluation methods are high as they should be reliable to serve as the basis for introducing changes, revealing weaknesses, and constructing new strategies for the development of different life spheres. Although evaluation information may be subjective or non-representative, it is an essential source of concentrated facts, which is crucial for people of different professions to make quick decisions when it is necessary.Evaluation Process from the Integrated Theory of Influence PerspectiveEvaluation as human activity has several factors that influence it and have affected its forming in the past. Firstly, it is a language used for evaluation, which affects the perception of all the judgments and interpretations and thus predetermines the effect of such evaluation (Kirkhart, 2000). Concerning the unique elements of the language that allow evaluators to express their opinion in a certain way, suspending goals regarding people’s opinion on the information, they can even be invisible (Hopson, 2000). Therefore, the process of evaluation itself can be affected negatively by the evaluators who use it unfairly.Concerning the development of the evaluation as a process that triggers essential consequences, the main point in its evolution is the following. An integrated theory of influence was designed to create a new framework for evaluation processes and make them more profound
(Kirkhart, 2000). The theory regards three aspects – “source of influence, intention, and time frame” (Kirkhart, 2000, p. 8). An integrated theory of influence considers both the process of evaluating its repercussions or using the evaluation information.Evaluation information is helpful in numerous situations as assessment of any kind always leads to consequences such as making decisions and triggering changes. Concerning the theory of influence, this type of information has a wide range of implementation opportunities. Kirkhart (2000) mentions two types of influence of the evaluation information on all the connected spheres – process-based and results-based. Hence, although the interpretation of evaluation results is a separate process, evaluation information determines the directions of future development of both the processes (operational performance) and goals (strategic performance).Moreover, evaluation information can affect different processes through another aspect related to it – intention. This means that the intentions of the primary evaluation process are not less important than the process itself because they partly reflect the purposes of the evaluator (Hopson, 2000). In other words, the evaluation intentionally depends on the purposes of the person who performs it (Kirkhart, 2000). Thus, stakeholders of the evaluation process may affect its result by placing the particular request.On the other hand, the influence of the intention of the evaluation process is not limited by the case described above. According to Kirkhart (2000), the intention of affecting the processes connected to the object of evaluation may be unintended. More specifically, this kind of influence is even more influential and may cause more powerful and profound
changes than the intended evaluation. Therefore, stakeholders of the evaluation process may be affected in a completely unexpected way, meaning that evaluation is a phenomenon that evaluators cannot fully control although they initiate it.Additionally, the influence of evaluation may differ depending on the time. To be more exact, evaluation consequences may vary in a short-term and long-term perspective and diverge drastically (Kirkhart, 2000). However, this fact only highlights the significance of evaluation information and its functionality for the party that uses it. Hence, management of the business, members of state structures, and ordinary people may experience the effect of the assessment in a wide range of ways, unexpectedly, at any time, because it cannot be controlled.The usefulness of evaluation is best expressed by the fact that it is widely utilized by the business. Pinch (2009) claims it is hard to think of an organization that does not use evaluation. However, regarding business, evaluation processes often become overused, making evaluation information not a valuable tool of performance assessment but a negatively perceived obligatory routine (Pinch, 2009). At the same time, if the evaluation takes place regularly and the gathered information is systematized, the evaluation turns into research that can be helpful for business or any other interested party (Pinch, 2009). Hence, the factor is substantial for the effectiveness of the evaluation procedure and its positive impact on the assessed unit because it reflects the level of devotion of people to their sphere of activity. Moreover, the higher is the level of professionality of the person who interprets
IntroductionIntel Corporation (Intel) is a semiconductor computer circuits manufacturer based in the United States. Intel, also known as “Integrated electronics,”- the company’s name, is headquartered in Santa Clara, California. The company operates through segments such as The Internet of Things Group (IOTG) and Mobileye (Hall, 2021). It sells platform goods, including chipsets and the central processor units and system-on-a-chip and multichip packages. In addition, the company offers high-performance computing solutions for embedded and vertical applications in the retail, industrial, and healthcare markets, as well as solutions for assisted and autonomous driving that include computer vision. It also provides platforms that optimized workload and related solutions to cloud service providers, business and government customers, and communications service providers. Cloud services providers, original design, and equipment manufacturers are all served by the firm. Intel Corporation has formed a strategic agreement to utilize and develop artificial intelligence approaches for improving drug discovery. The paper describes the Supply Chain ESG as how Intel corporation creates a positive impact on the global environment.Intel Code of Conduct (COC)The Code of Conduct establishes the company’s standards for how it coordinates its activities to create and deliver products, protects the value of Intel and its subsidiaries, and interacts with customers, suppliers, and distributors. When performing Intel-related business, it is the obligation of every individual at Intel to follow the code, the employment guidelines, and other applicable regulations. The company does business with unwavering ethical standards and honesty, treating distributors, suppliers, customers, fairness, respect, and honesty in all business interactions.Intel and its subsidiaries require all
employees to comply fully with internal investigations, comprising the provision of truthful information, except where the act would result in disclosing the participation of the in concerted activity under the National Labor Relations Act of the United States. Staff who fail to do so may face disciplinary action, comprising termination, depending on the applicable local legislation (Hall, 2021). Employee involvement in inquiries into suspected violations of the United States National Labor Relations Act is voluntary, albeit encouraged.Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR)Intel’s dedication to sustainability leadership and corporate responsibility is firmly ingrained in the company’s culture. The company does not create an encompassing and positive work environment where every staff feels like they have a sense of belonging and a voice. Still, it is also proactive in its initiatives to minimize its environmental impact by using natural materials and resources efficiently and responsibly. The company also wants to use its leading position in the global digital ecosystem to assist the industry and company in achieving more progress in corporate responsibility, including governance, social impact, and environmental sustainability. Intel’s 2030 “RISE” strategy aims to utilize the company’s leading position in the global technology ecosystem to build a more inclusive, sustainable, and responsible society, powered by technology and employees’ skills and enthusiasm (Ganusov, Iyer, Cheng, & Meisler, 2020). It aims to double the number of females and the minority groups underrepresented in higher employment ranks over the following decade.Supply chain responsibilityEffectively controlling and enhancing performance throughout the company’s supply chain lowers risks, enhances product quality, and aids the staff in
total dependence on renewable energy and producing zero trash by 2030. According to the company reports, many of the corporation’s 2020 goals were also met. It recycles over 90% of its garbage and sends virtually no hazardous material to landfills. According to the Intel code of conduct report (2021), the quantity of greenhouse gases it emits has decreased by around 30% since 2010. Yet, yearly emissions have increased somewhat since 2016 as the company has grown. According to the business, it reduced its water use by 38%, saving 44 billion gallons over the last decade (Intel code of conduct report, 2021). It will be a larger struggle to reduce those emissions, which Intel claims it is doing by attempting to make its devices more energy efficient.Efficiency Regulations of Smart Energy
The ten interesting events in my community are church construction, launching of radio stations, inter families football competitions, construction, and launching of health institutions, and ceremonies such as funerals and marriage. The other two important events are church baptism activities and wrestling matches among male children between 10 to 17 years. Among the six subjects, I am not familiar with inter families football competitions, but I find it to be the most exciting event.Inter families’ competition is the most interesting event in my community. Seven families combined to form a team of seven players. This competition is normally organized by the community leaders with the goal of promoting talents and also creating a better future for the young people. The competition only involves youths from the age of 18 to 30 years. One of the leaders elaborated that this program is purely for the youths who are seeking self-discovery. These competitions are held during the school holidays between December and January.Regarding this interesting and important event, I had already known a few things. I know that this competition program is sponsored by The Association for Talent Development. Again, this program creates employment for young people; three of my cousins are currently working with the American Federation of Women. Conversely, one thing I may want to know is how the pandemic affected event’s plans and challenges they have faced during the pandemic.Talent identification and employment creation make this event interesting since it helps fight joblessness among the youths. In an interview with Mr. Bowers, the chairman of
did not have enough space and time to train as a full team, thus leading to poor performance. The poor performance due to insufficient training has also led to the sponsor’s reluctance towards supporting the event.Based on my analysis, the COVID-19 pandemic affected the inter families football competition, the most important and interesting event in my community. This event has been interesting since it showcases amazing football talent among the youth and is important because it creates employment for the youths. From my observation of the previous and currently recorded videos, COVID-19 policies by the state have killed the event. Social distance has impeded the entire team from training together; the lockdown has prevented the sponsors from flying to physically watch and identify talents, while curfew has limited the training hours (Dönmez et al. 2). Mr. Bowers’s figurative language truly revealed how painful the pandemic cost the event. From my angle of view, Mr. Bowers should approach the national government to grant them a permit to conduct the inter families’ competitions regardless of the pandemic policies placed by the state. He should do this because this event has created jobs for the youths and earned revenue for the government.
Different circumstances under which medical staff has worked led to varying types of leadership strategies being developed. For example, the COVID-19 pandemic highlighted the role of clear communication and the handling of prompt preparation in top healthcare leaders (Nicola et al., 2020). Another key tactic includes the use of external change agents that ultimately promote excellent organizational decision-making (Alagoz et al., 2018). Moreover, one study explained how implementing positivity-related and open-minded approaches as leaders can improve their employee’s resilience, providing an additional source of motivation (Wei et al., 2018). Hence, effective healthcare leaders must adapt to various external changes and strategically communicate with their coworkers.Several departments can be interacted with through the role of a healthcare administrator. One of them includes the in-patient department where multiple approaches from skilled professionals are needed. Moreover, critical care and A&E require excellent management and collaborating opportunities. As already mentioned, the selected healthcare areas are prime examples of fields requiring strong leaders to provide optimal patient care. One way this can be improved to obtain the desired outcomes is through a holistic approach that considers external and internal factors. Furthermore, collective decision-making should not be viewed as limiting to effective leadership; on the contrary, it presents an ideal strategy in healthcare management.The importance of interprofessional collaboration in medical institutions is evident through its effect on patient outcomes. Research has demonstrated significant changes in healthcare conditions after the implementation of the strategy (Spaulding et al., 2018). The method involves acquiring knowledge from colleagues and incorporating it into one’s practice, seeking advice from the respective medical staff. Therefore, the strategy impacts the range of services professionals can offer to their patients and should be worked on further to improve its practicality.
The creation of intelligent devices provoked further development in this area, which led to the emergence of the Internet of things. Such devices are controlled in the same way using mobile applications, which creates additional sources of problems with the safety of their operation. Since most consumers lack technology security literacy, this problem poses a threat to users (Allifah & Zualkernan, 2022). Also, there are no available and understandable to the end consumer security standards for such Internet things that could influence the choice of purchase. As a result, the article identifies the main security risks, demonstrates previous attempts to build a ranking model, and suggests developed directions in this area.The first such devices began to appear in 1985, gradually increasing the consumption rate, but by 2006, many were noticeably concerned about the security of these devices. Because they were controlled by Internet access, they could be easily compromised (Allifah & Zualkernan, 2022). 40% of homes have at least five devices with Internet access, and the same 40% have at least one device with several vulnerabilities (Allifah & Zualkernan, 2022). Many authors and works are given in the article, where various loopholes and problems of the Internet of Things are proved. At the same time, there were appropriate safety labels, but the consumer could hardly understand them if he did not have the appropriate in-depth knowledge.Determining the relative safety of devices of this type is a rather complex multi-criteria task, especially given the different orientations of each of these devices. The models under consideration often adopted
a hierarchical analytical process as a method for solving such multiobjective problems (Allifah & Zualkernan, 2022). This method can combine qualitative and quantitative characteristics of a device, evaluate internal consistency, and have a transparent framework for comparing devices against criteria.The article proposes the construction of such a safety rating with the condition of its understandability for the end-user. Such an approach will create a criterion by which the user will make a more informed decision about the purchase. The method is also built on AHP, offering new solutions and insights in methodology building (Allifah & Zualkernan, 2022). Finally, the article also provides an example of the application of this technique.AHP is a goal-based approach against which criteria are built. Each criterion has its weight compared to others or relative priority. Based on the priority of criteria or sub-criteria, their contribution to the overall goal is evaluated. This method is widely used in various cyber security systems, information security, decision validation, web applications, cloud storage, networks, and mobile applications (Allifah & Zualkernan, 2022). The methods often focus on privacy, attack prevention, authentication, security, access, and integration.Most intelligent systems or devices in a brilliant homework with cloud storage and a service provider. In addition, wireless data transmission methods are used: Wi-fi, Bluetooth, ZigBee (Allifah & Zualkernan, 2022). Accordingly, given that each device is unique in its tasks, the task of the security risk assessment is to identify the main commonalities for the purpose of an integrated approach. Recently, there has also been a trend to use third-party local
cloud if a threat is detected on the main one, the same additional authentication methods, and diversification of different cloud providers (Allifah & Zualkernan, 2022). With smartphones, end-users should also change passwords more often, preventing the threat of resource restriction and information leakage through similar applications and other things using a firewall.The authors propose a security system with criteria for countering the main types of danger: applications, hardware level, cloud, and network. Then these criteria were given priority ratings, after which the relative safety of the device is calculated using formulas. As a result, appropriate sub-criteria were selected for each criterion, and a computational experiment was presented for a pairwise comparison of device security performance (Allifah & Zualkernan, 2022). As a result, the end-user will receive relative percentages for the four selected criteria and will be able to make an informed choice of the best device.The authors argue that although only one empirical study was evaluated with this model in this article, it can be adapted for other devices. The model’s flexibility is explained by a preliminary study conducted on the sources of vulnerabilities in most devices in the smart home (Allifah & Zualkernan, 2022). Sufficiently wide multi-criteria sub-criteria, each having its weight, make the system universal regardless of the operational purpose of the device.
profitable ways to implement the project. Consequently, the second advantage of this criterion is flexibility and additivity, that is, understanding the benefits of all available projects or one specific one. A third advantage may be that the calculation of NVP considers the size of the investment. This means that NVP is a unidimensional criterion that allows us to estimate the degree of probability of wealth creation based on the number of cash flows.Thus, NVP has several advantages over other investment criteria based on its application. First, NVP considers the present value of money, which gives a clear picture of cash transactions. Second, it is flexible and additive, meaning it evaluates the cost of capital and the appropriateness of the investment. Third, NVP is a one-dimensional indicator that considers all, even space investments.
(Graves, 2017). The demand for the variety of choices and the improving financial position of American citizens suggest that the industry’s structural characteristics are quite favorable.After that, 7-Eleven would be required to select a strategy that would ensure the provision of above-average returns. A promising approach could be the implementation of the chain store method, where several branches are established across different countries. However, to apply this technique, particular assets and skills are needed (Hitt et al., 2007). The first criterion is the possession of the products and resources necessary to launch an international branch, as the costs of sustaining a new location in a different country can be demanding (Graves, 2017). In addition, the executives must account for the economic environment of the chosen state, meaning that it is vital to be skilled in international trade and branch management.Finally, to implement the selected approach, it is necessary to establish which actions will be performed to achieve the above-average returns. For 7-Eleven, it would be beneficial to use the company’s strengths in this endeavor, namely the existence of other international branches and the successful history of operations in the US (Lee, 2021). By relying on the previously obtained knowledge and integrating global expansion into the organization’s goals, 7-Eleven might perfectly utilize the formulated strategy and earn above-average returns.
Iran is a theocratic republic in the Middle East (ME) and one of the most controversial states in the region. A diverse population includes many ethnicities, such as Persian, Azerbaijani, Gilaki, and others, being a significant factor contributing to the development of the highly divided society with the various interests and political aspirations. The continuous instability in the state, the efforts to acquire weapons of mass destruction as well as Iran’s connection to the terrorist groups, give plausible reasons to discuss its sponsoring of global terrorism. This essay will analyze the reasons for Iran’s involvement, the state’s foreign policy, and its support for the specific terrorist groups, which influence the ME as well as the whole world.Due to the particular features of the theocratic regimes, in the case of Iran, the inclination towards terrorism can be explained by two pillars of the Islamic doctrine underlining the constitution. Firstly, the obligation to support jihad – the holy war waged on behalf of Islam as a religious duty (Merriam-Webster, n.d.). Secondly, the mission to spread the Muslim faith, which is expressed in backing the proxy organizations (Spindlove&Simonsen, 2018). Since the establishment of the Islamic Republic of Iran in 1979 as a result of the Iranian Revolution prepared by the Mujahedin-e-Khalq (MEK), the secular regime of Shah Mohammad Reza Pahlavi was overthrown. Thus, the Islamic principles in the regime started to play an even more crucial guiding role under the religious leader Ayatollah Khomeini.Beyond the abovementioned Islamic motives, the critical implications for Iran’s foreign policy conclude in the anti-US
whereas the primary beneficiary of Iran’s support for terror has been Lebanese Hezbollah (Spindlove&Simonsen, 2018). The attack on the Khobar Towers in Saudi Arabia, the violation of Arab-Israeli armistices, and interference almost in every state of the region are clear examples of the state-sponsored terrorism in the Middle East, contributing to the continuous turmoil in the area. The Qods Force is another prominent actor providing military assistance in troubled regions, including espionage and assassination. As for the terrorism outside the region, Iran has a connection with 9/11, as it was the original source of the Commission Report (Spindlove&Simonsen, 2018). Their aiding and abetting Al Qaeda and the engagement of Hezbollah in the attack led to one of the most disastrous terrorist attacks in the Western world.To conclude, Iran’s involvement in international terrorism is undeniable and can be explained through different factors, with special attention to the government’s Islamic regime. The actions of the state in the Middle East as well as outside of the region led to countless wars, revolutions, and deaths, contributing to the destabilization of the world order.
IntroductionThe nature and form of war change, but its fundamental nature remains constant. Nearly two decades of continuous irregular warfare against violent extremist organizations worldwide — the demand for skill in irregular hostilities continues. The leaders search for the best strategy for dealing with irregular warfare and preparing soldiers for operational actions. The path to changes can be the introduction of the Performance Triad and improving of the leaders’ personal qualities, taking into account the peculiarities of irregular warfare.How Leaders can Implement the Performance Triad to Help Prepare their Organizations for Irregular WarfareIrregular warfare is different from conventional ones and therefore requires special training. Irregular warfare, which is different in form, describes types of violence conducted by sub-state actors, including terrorism and insurgency (James D. Kiras, 2009, p. 3). Irregular forces on one or both sides almost entirely suppressed the ongoing conflicts after the invasion of Iraq, renewed Taliban insurgency in the 2001 war in Afghanistan, conflict in Darfur, the Lord’s Resistance Army uprising in northern Uganda, and the Second Chechen War.Conducting effective actions in irregular warfare requires even more diligent use of the physical resources of soldiers; here, the Performance Triad can help. It is a comprehensive plan to build preparedness and resilience through public health initiatives and leadership engagement. Army Medicine has the privilege of maintaining, restoring, and improving the health of the entire Army family and helped the Army create the Performance Triad (Sleep, Activity, and Nutrition) initiative. Sleep is critical to the proper cognitive and physical functioning of the body. For soldiers,
lack of sleep can slow down the execution of orders both on and off the training ground, harming soldiers and units. Keeping fit is the key to making a soldier ready for action. Staying active and adhering to safe and effective training principles allows soldiers to fulfill their job responsibilities and become more potent fighters. A healthy diet provides exercise, increases energy and stamina, shortens recovery times between activities, improves focus and concentration, and helps soldiers feel better.The goal of the Performance Triad is to positively influence and maintain the health, readiness, and resilience of soldiers, and the entire army family. The pilot program, which began in 2013 and ended in 2014, reaffirmed the importance of committed leadership as a foundation to support soldiers and practice healthy sleep, activity and eating habits to support preparedness and resilience. The widespread implementation of this strategy will help strengthen the physical and moral training of soldiers, which is especially important in irregular warfare.How the Execution of Mission Command during Irregular Warfare Will Have Different Challenges than during Conventional ConflictsThe increasingly complex security environment suggests the need for a revised understanding of irregular warfare. The problem of irregular cooperative solutions is in this combined routine: reactive adversaries such as terrorists, insurgents and criminal networks, advances in technology and other phenomena on a large scale such irregular infections, even more deadly, capable of causing widespread chaos. These emissions are entangling populations through the skillful use of communications, cyberspace, and technology so that their impact spreads to regional and global levels. Many
of them manifest themselves, in essence, as a struggle for influence and legitimacy.The Focus is on addressing the underlying economic, political, cultural, or security conditions that fuel the population’s grievances, rather than on applying military power directly against the military and paramilitary forces of adversaries (Department of Defense, 2010, p. 20). The Cold War experience shows that long-standing traditional warfare – troop movements, partner interactions, public relations, partner logistics, security assistance, intelligence, and counterintelligence activities, and training – complement and mutually support objectives. However, due to the nature of complex and amorphous attacks, these competitions are unlikely to end in a sudden military victory. Fixing, reducing, regulating the conflict and its causes can be determined as success. Joint strength thus must find multidimensional approaches in tandem with other partners to resolve the problems. Complex political, cultural, religious, and historical factors and the various populations involved in all conflicts are difficult to understand deeply enough. Understanding the complex features and causes of irregular warfare can contribute to the formation of the right strategist, both for soldiers and leaders.How Leaders May Have to Adjust their Leadership Attribute of Intellect during Irregular WarfareThe army leadership requirements layout the attributes and competencies expected of every Army leader – character, presence, and intellect. These attributes often reflect personal experience and long-term development and are not immediately gained from direct training events. At the organizational level, they directly relate to how a leader behaves, influences organizational change, and guides the unit through obstacles and setbacks. Since irregular warfare usually results in protracted
Vitamin D plays a significant role in regulating phosphorus and calcium absorption in our bones. Far from this regulation, the nutrient is also essential in facilitating communication among cells within our bodies. The other significance of vitamin D in the body is that it can be manufactured when exposed to sunlight. These characteristics distinguish the vitamin from other nutrients since it can be obtained from sun exposure apart from food and dietary supplements. Compared to other nutrients, what characterizes vitamin D makes it a super nutrient.What sets vitamin D apart from the other nutrients and arguably makes it a super nutrient is that, unlike other nutrients, it can be obtained by exposure to the sun. Exposure to the sun is the most effective way the vitamin can be obtained (Klioze, 2017). The potential magic associated with the nutrient is that it acts as a potential hormone in over a dozen of cells and tissues throughout the body. In so doing, the vitamin helps the body regulate essential gene expression and rapidly activates the already-expressed proteins and enzymes (Klioze, 2017). For example, in the heart, vitamin D binds to a certain receptor of the same vitamin, generating a calming protective effect.With a considerable amount of research on the nutrient focusing on the significance of the vitamin on overall health, some epidemiological studies have uncovered a deficiency torrent of vitamin D. Based on the read report; findings show that between 50 and 75 percent of Americans have insufficient vitamin D levels in their bodies (Feldman et al., 2018).
sufficient vitamin D levels (Klioze, 2017). Several reasons exist why vitamin deficiency is widespread in the U.S. and the world over.Unlike other vitamins, vitamin D is one of the few nutrients the body can make. However, compared to the others, 40 percent of body exposure to ultraviolet B rays, between 15 and 30 minutes, results in the production of 20,000 IU of the nutrient (Klioze, 2017). Shocking statistics reveal that significantly few foods and supplements have the same amounts of vitamin D occurring naturally. Except for sardines, mackerel, salmon, and tunas, daily consumption of any other food results in insufficient vitamin D amounts in the body. Ironically, a one-eight-ounce of milk glass can only give 100 IU of the nutrient with a similar amount acquired in a bowl of fortified cereals (Feldman et al., 2018). Combined, both a glass of milk and cereals can only generate 200 IU of vitamin D, a one-tenth amount that can be acquired from thirty minutes under the sun (Feldman et al., 2018). Hence, it becomes physically impossible to eat your way out of vitamin D deficiency.Vitamin D is arguably fast becoming a super nutrient, with its importance growing exponentially in the past few decades. Scientific research shows that insufficient vitamin D can be associated with widespread health consequences. However, as shown, just because low vitamin D and disease are correlated does not mean that one causes the other. Contrary, by maintaining sufficient vitamin D levels, some major health complications can be prevented.
Following the 9/11 terrorist attack orchestrated by al Qaeda in 2001, America’s world transformed forever. Conspicuous changes included a fresh era and a new term called Homeland Security. Despite the lengthy pursuit of al Qaeda leader, Osama bin Laden and his ultimate killing by the Navy Seal team, the security threat to America’s homeland still continues. As demonstrated by more than 50 terror incidences, some thwarted while others successful, the U.S. must always remain watchful and continue to safeguard the country (Oliver et al., 2015). The principal strategies for responding to any terror occurrences and natural catastrophes are all anchored in local responders. Homeland security remains an organizational and administrative response to actual and potential threats. Therefore, National Incident Management System (NIMS) aligns with the homeland security structure in various ways.Firstly, following the 9/11 attack, the Homeland Security Act ordered every level of a government agency to NIMS for responding to any type and size of emergency. The objective of this direction was to provide a synchronized, unified, and joint response during any disaster. As part of efforts to reinforce homeland security, NIMS has a crucial component called Incident Command System (ICS) to address all disaster-related issues (Oliver et al., 2015). NIMS seeks to allay every friction and accelerate emergency arrangements encompassing various responses from many concerned institutions by acting as the common, scalable, and adjustable system used by involved parties. Moreover, its compulsion was strengthened in 2003 by Presidential Directive 5 on homeland security.Secondly, NIMS can fit into homeland security by offering a comprehensive, national
integrate or create a seamless command during an emergency.In conclusion, America’s homeland security remains a key priority following the deadly 9/11 terror attack in 2001. NIMS structure plays an essential role in reinforcing this security objective in the country. The fundamental premise of NIMS in executing its mandate is that all incidents start and stop locally. The system does not draw command away from local authorities and the Federal government. It simply offers the required framework to upscale the capacity of responders, non-governmental organizations, and the private sector to work cohesively. NIMS acts as the baseline notion that connects all the relevant agencies towards providing enhanced homeland security. NIMS integrates the resources and capabilities of various incident emergency and management response disciplines, governmental jurisdictions, and private sectors into a coordinated, seamless, and cohesive framework for internal incident response and management.
The suggested strategies to mitigate the effects of coronavirus in accordance with the example of Iceland could be considered as an interesting approach. This strategy acknowledges its apparent limitations, such as the resilience of the Iceland community, geographical idiosyncrasy. However, currently, this strategy might not be a valid method to address the high margins of infected individuals in NATO countries. It is certainly true that quick response and high testing rates would contribute to the deterrence of the effects imposed by the sudden growth of the number of infected. However, it is similarly meaningful that the population would be willing to undergo such a measure. Moreover, despite the financial support efforts, some countries belonging to the organization might not be able to financially withstand the high amount of testing imposed by the new waves of infection. This fact is especially relevant given that the virus dissemination might emerge across several countries simultaneously.Therefore, a different approach to the problem might be necessary. The Israeli government approached the problem of monitoring the infected with the creative solution of digital epidemiological investigation (Amit et al., 2020). This technology allowed tracking potential contacts of people that were infected and act accordingly (Amit et al., 2020). However, it is arguable that this methodology could address the geographical limitations introduced in the case of Iceland. It would be difficult for NATO countries to strictly monitor all entrances to their borders. Therefore, an analog in the form of digital tracking may solve the problem with the need for strict borders control and provide necessary tools for timely reaction to the new outbreaks. Nevertheless, it would require funds both internal and external in order to build new or reconstruct the existing infrastructure for the stated purposes.
to be made. This statement in itself is probably a contribution to the international image of Canadian humanitarianism, but the extent of such image improvement is questionable.The focus on building trading relationships and close ties with other NATO countries could be seen as the most important aspect that Israel might acknowledge. Israel’s national security has experienced decades of varying threats, which included terrorism, missiles, and existential nuclear dangers (Freilich, 2018). However, the former national security strategy (NSS) is non-existent in the country as the first document of NSS was developed in 1953 (Freilich, 2018). Nevertheless, the country is more secure than ever before due to the political and military bonds it forms active trade agreements with various powerful countries such as the USA, China, Russia, Germany, Canada, Poland, and India (Freilich, 2018). Currently, the country exhibits great regional power and is able to prosper due to the seven-decades-old strategy.
The current issue with Nike stems from its corrupt corporate culture, which puts women in a position of weakness. It allows powerful men in charge of the company to abuse and suppresses them, preventing them from reaching the positions they deserve without being harassed or denigrated. There are four potential ways of dealing with a problem: absolving, solving, resolving, and dissolving (Ackoff, 2019). Given the scope and the long-term aims for Nike and society in general, the only acceptable solution would be to dissolve it. The process of dissolution revolves around removing the underlying causes for the problem to exist in the first place. Absolving means ignoring the problem, solving – giving the women that were harmed some sort of compensation without making changes, and resolving – giving them the means to fight back without actively trying to change the toxic culture towards something better (Singh, 2018). Just allowing women to fight back is not enough – Nike should make it so that they do not have to.From an organizational framework perspective, the transformation of Nike’s culture should be done on all levels, from top to bottom. If harassment, cronyism, and corruption are acceptable at the top, there is nothing to stop them from occurring at the bottom levels (Singh, 2018). Therefore, Parker and the rest of Nike’s leadership must implement policies and solutions on all levels. This involves disincentivizing such behavior and ensuring that any potential sources of it are extinguished before they could take root again.The proposed plan of action, thus, is to conduct a massive revision of every individual employee and manager to determine their complicity in the acts that have been perpetrated in Nike for ages. All individuals found complicit should be removed from the company. That includes Mr. Parker and the rest of the board themselves, as they have been benefitting from the system while closing their eyes on it. The new leadership would be the one to implement and install a new culture based on equality, capability, and diversity.
and privilege, unevenly divided across racial, gender, and education lines (Blustein et al., 2020). The national socio-economic gaps lie between those who have a college education and those who do not (Galea & Abdalla, 2020). Within the framework of education access, race and ethnicity represent a major division plane between Americans. The black demographic faces racism in hiring, seeking housing, and everyday life, resulting in systemic marginalization (Galea & Abdalla, 2020). Therefore, the issue of unequal job availability persists, with racial divides being particularly striking recently.Discerning socio-economic groups’ post-pandemic recovery rates from April 2020 paints a clear picture. The divide is demonstrated by the Bureau of Labor Statistics (2022): there seems to be an improvement post-pandemic, with the average unemployment rate decreasing from 14.7% in April 2020 to 4% now. However, for the black population, the unemployment rate reached 16.8% in April 2020; later, stalled at 10.9% in October 2020 and then only lowered to 6.9% in January 2022 (Bureau of Labor Statistics, 2022).In contrast, the white demographic presents a steady decrease within six months from April 2020; by October 2020, unemployment more than halved from 14.1% to 6.0%. Higher education, stable jobs, and support networks contribute to the higher-than-average unemployment rates for the black demographic (Galea & Abdalla, 2020). This statistic demonstrates the uneven struggle to recover from the pandemic-induced and general unemployment.
Formal InstitutionsPolitical SystemItaly is a European nation found along the Mediterranean coastline, with Rome as its capital city. Kings initially ruled the Italian up to the Second World War. Nevertheless, in 1946, Italians decided to overthrow the empire, and the nation became an independent state. The initial State continued until 1992, when scandals devastated Italy’s main political parties. Due to those major improvements in the parties, the era is known as the Second Republic, even though there were no constitutional changes (Capussela, 2018). Sergio Matterella is the current president of Italy, even though it is a ceremonial duty.Legal SystemItaly is a republic with a constitution composed of 139 reports demonstrating society’s elementary ground from 1948. The reports are into three main groups: essential philosophies, human rights and responsibilities, and republican organization (Capussela, 2018). The national assembly and regional members elect Italy’s presidents by secret ballot. Parliament elects Presidents for seven-year terms to prevent re-election by the same parliament.There are three government systems in Italy, including legislative, judicial, and executive. As the head of the council, the prime ministers oversee and executive authority to the Council of Ministers who carry outlaws and other political decisions (Capussela, 2018). Acts are typically presented to the parliament, but in cases of urgency, bills can get approval through decrees or if the national assembly offers the council the responsibility to act.Economic SystemThe Italian economy consists of established industries in the North owned by private companies and a less established, heavily subsidized agrarian in the South afflicted by poverty and poor infrastructure.
The manufacturing of slightly elevated consumer products by midsized and small commercials, most of which are kinship, is a major booster of the Italian economy. In addition, Italy possesses a substantial subterranean economy, constituting approximately 17 percent of the GDP (Capussela, 2018). Farming, service industries, and infrastructure are possibly the most dominant regions to find these events.Italy falls in third place economically in Europe, but its extremely high public bills and structural growth constraints have made it sensitive to financial sector scrutiny. Since 2007, Italy’s community bills have continuously risen, surpassing 131 percent of the GDP in 2017 (Capussela, 2018). However, shareholders’ fear about Italy and the broader eurozone disaster subsided in 2013, reducing Italy’s administration bills borrowing rates.Informal InstitutionComponents of the CultureAccording to research, Italian is the State’s official language, and almost 93 percent of people speak Italian as their native language (Morretta et al., 2020). Italy’s languages include Sardinian and Piedmontese. Roman Catholicism is Italy’s most commonly practiced religion (Morretta et al., 2020). It is unsurprising, provided that Vatican City is found at the center of Rome and is the place of Roman Catholicism and home of the Pope.Several architectural styles emerged in Italy but not limited to Renaissance, Baroque and Classical Roman (Morretta et al., 2020). The Colosseum and the Leaning Tower of Pisa are examples of the global’s most known structures in Italy. Most individuals view Italian cooking as an art, which has impacted food culture globally. For instance, pasta, wine, and cheese are predominant in Italian cooking. Pasta is found in
various forms, including popular varieties such as spaghetti, lasagna, and linguine.Context of CultureItaly is a high-context society, and the majority of Italian cultural interaction relies heavily on physical indicators. A significant part of the content in high-context principles is hidden in the bodily setting of the person (Morretta et al., 2020). For example, the speaker believes that no explanation is necessary because the person to whom they are speaking should comprehend what they are trying to express.Hofstede’s Cultural DimensionsThe concept is used to identify cultural variations between nations. Some of the Hofstede cultural aspects in Italy include individualism and power distance (Burton et al., 2021). The individualism aspect addresses people’s opinions of various groups in their environment. When a person is individualistic, they perceive themselves and their close family as vital. In contrast, collective individuals are concerned with the welfare of a larger group, including their corporation, and prioritize their own needs.Italians thrive in individualism because they prioritize their close family over their friends and would rather do business with individuals they recognize and rely on when there is a need. The in-group then makes decisions, and meetings are mostly intended to tell the rest of the group about the results. On the other hand, power distance refers to the degree to which those at the bottom of the hierarchy embrace and even anticipate authority to be dispersed unfairly (Burton et al., 2021). This aspect demonstrates that Italians demand a certain amount of power distance. On the other hand, they like making fun of authority, and
breaching rules appear to be an Italian pastime.Resources and CapabilitiesNatural and Geographic ResourcesItaly has many natural resources, including crude oil deposits, pyrites, fluorspar, potash, pumice, coal, asbestos, and mercury, to mention a few (Cimini et al., 2020). The country’s mineral resources, such as petroleum and other rare earth elements, impact the Italian economy. Italy is a country found in a boot-shaped peninsula that extends outwards into the Adriatic Sea and Tyrrhenian and other water supply sources in the Southern part of Europe.The county’s geographical position has a significant impact on its heritage. The sea surrounds Italy, and its core is subdivided into sections by mountains. The Alps, which extend across the State’s summit, are dotted with long, thin icy lakes, and the Apennines Mountains extend from the South to the Western end of the Alps down the peninsula (Cimini et al., 2020). The wooded slopes West of the Apennines resides several of Italy’s ancient cities, especially Rome.Technological AdvancementItaly has dominated the European Union and financial markets, certainly bringing severe economic issues. However, Italy is the second-largest producer among the twenty-eight European Union member nations, close after Germany (Cimini et al., 2020). Italy is at the vanguard of the Fourth Industrial Insurgency facets, particularly in the information insurgency. Italy falls in the top 10 in the world regarding robotic intensity or the number of factory robots per worker, significantly outnumbering countries such as France, the United Kingdom, and Spain, with 132, 71, and 160 robots.Development of InfrastructureItaly is concentrating on massive infrastructure projects to boost its economy.
The Italian directorate declared withdrawal limitations on 130 construction projects regarded crucial for reopening the country’s economy and modernizing its infrastructure network on the same day that the European Union reduced its 2020 GDP prediction for Italy to fall by 11.2 percent (Cimini et al., 2020). Italy’s major projects include; A proposed motorway between Rome and Latina, the expressway construction joining central Italy and Liguria, and the Ionica state route with links to the Port of Civitavecchia, which is just a few cases.International TradeImportsItaly usually imports engineering and metal items, particularly from France, the United States of America, the United Kingdom, and Germany (Bontempi et al., 2021). Imports of vehicles, minerals, and chemicals are also significant products to the Italian economy. Italy imports energy and crude oil, especially from the Middle East and North Africa.ExportsMetals, fine machinery, and metal products constitute Italy’s two largest exports. Italy is also a well-known exporter of apparel and footwear and scooters, automobiles, notably luxury motor cars and motorbikes. Pharmaceuticals, other chemicals, and various culinary goods are exported from Italy (Bontempi et al., 2021). Italy distributes approximately 56 percent of its goods to other European Union nations, primarily Spain, Germany, and France (Bontempi et al., 2021). However, the United States of America and Switzerland are also important trade associates of Italy.Trade AdvantageItaly is among the five States which enjoy a trade export surplus in the European nations. Italian firms are determined to retain their export edge. They invested majorly in new production technologies such as robots, factory automation, and additive production,
which boost output and lower prices (Bontempi et al., 2021). Invitalia and State agency offers broad benefits to both Italian and foreign corporations through funding initiatives of all kinds in vital sectors such as factories, environmental protection, and tourism.Economic Trade ConditionsItaly had a Gross domestic product of approximately $1.85 trillion in 2020 and a per capita Gross domestic product of about $31,630 (Bontempi et al., 2021). Italy falls in eighth place economically in the current world ranking. Due to the Corona infection and the Italian administration’s containment actions, Italy’s GDP will reduce by approximately 8.9 percent in 2020 (Bontempi et al., 2021). Nevertheless, the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development anticipated that Italy’s GDP would grow either in 2021 or 2022, with about 4.5 percent in 2021 and about 4.4 percent in 2022.International Trade PolicyBeing a part of the European Union, Italy follows EU legislation that applies throughout the EU. Import obstacles based on tariffs come from both national and EU rules (Bontempi et al., 2021). Even though some limits exist to particular categories of goods, the European Union’s international trade policy is largely flexible, for example, agricultural goods. However, Italy is a member of the European Union and the World Trade Organization. Hence, it uses the Technical Barriers to Trade team to deliberate on some critical trade issues and research the choices and executions of the regulations.Instruments of Trade policyItaly is a European Union associate; therefore, products easily move between associate states just after establishing the internal market (Bontempi et al., 2021). Even though the
Considerable musicians have represented soul music, and James Brown was one of the most prominent. Southern soul became extremely popular towards the end of the 1960s, and Brown had his first success in 1956 (Covach and Flory 218). Initially, Brown worked as a stand-in for Little Richard, and his first record, “Please Please Please,” was quite thriving (Covach and Flory 240-241). Brown used to sing lead vocals, and his early musical style resembled that of the 1950s doo-wop (Covach and Flory 242). However, he began to develop the soul style in 1960 with “Think,” characterized by horns and a driving rhythm section (Covach and Flory 242). In 1964, Brown introduced “Out of Sight,” which represented the hard-driving soul style featured in his later songs towards the 1970s (Covach and Flory 242). James Brown was one of the performers who took control of their music, as he united an aggressive style of vocal and dance performance, production skills, and understanding of business (Covach and Flory 242). Brown’s musical style through the 1960s and into the 1970s changed from following prior era’s themes to creating his unique sounds.As Brown was searching for and evolving his individual style, his career differed from Motown, Stax, or Atlantic artists and led him to produce distinguishable songs. For instance, the stops at the end of the verses in Brown’s “Papa’s Got a Brand New Bag, Pt. 1” distinct the music from a Stax arrangement (Covach and Flory 243). At the same time, the absence of background vocals in the song varies from Motown’s approach (Covach and Flory 243). Moreover, James Brown’s music was highly famous within the Black community, as, unlike Motown and Atlantic artists, Brown expressed apparent racial pride through hard-edged musical style and political lyrics (Covach and Flory 244). Brown acted passionately on his live shows as a singer, dancer, and bandleader but also hired notable musicians and rehearsed them tirelessly (Covach and Flory 240). James Brown was a remarkable performer whose vision of music and societal norms differed from other professionals.
In contrast, when Janina thinks about a name for a rescue dog, her first idea is a human name, Marysia. She denies other pet names, saying that “considering her personal history” they could not be suitable for the dog. Thus, Janina thinks deeply about the animal’s life and problems, basing the name on the dog’s condition and story.By looking at the contrast between names and nicknames that Janina uses for people and animals, one can see her actual values. She loves animals while humans get judged or excluded for their oddity. Therefore, while the narrator is untrustworthy, she quickly gives away her views on the murders and exposes her potential role in them. Her nature is to judge people for their treatment of animals, and the latter is perceived as better, more worthy of saving than humans.
IntroductionThis paper aims to analyze the Japanese advertisement found on the website Ads of the World . This ad promotes a product called “Toilet Quickle Deodorant Coat Sheet,” which is intended to help housewives get rid of unpleasant odor in the toilet. An analysis of this ad shows that it cannot be standardized for the US audience; instead, it should be adapted because of the language and cultural differences, such as variations in the use of appeal and comparisons and the importance of diversity.Main bodyPerhaps, the most apparent reason why this ad needs to be adapted to the US audience rather than standardized is the use of the Japanese language. In this ad, the Japanese language is used in the speech of the actors delivering the information to the customers and the signs on the screen. While the actor’s speech can simply be translated into English, the signs on the screen have to be adapted. This is because the Japanese language uses characters that appear much more compact than English words. Therefore, simply writing the Japanese words in English would change the layout of the images that support the information delivered by the speakers.The next rationale for adaptation is that this ad is filmed in the format of a weather report familiar to Japanese housewives. In the US, the format for such programs is different to a certain extent, which means that this ad may appear less familiar to American housewives. The ad also shows such a common feature of Japanese etiquette as bowing, which is
not used in the US and, therefore, should be removed when adapting the ad to the American audience.The way the message is delivered in the Japanese and American cultures is also different, which further supports the need for adaptation rather than standardization. In particular, in Japan, advertisements use indirect communication to convey their messages and let the audience decide for themselves what they should think about the brand. This is because Japanese people, in contrast to Americans, have negative attitudes to hard-sell practices, so ads using direct communication would be ineffective in this country. In addition, Japanese ads do not tend to use comparisons. In contrast, US advertisements use direct communication to convey the brand value to the audience and often compare different brands in their campaigns, for example, in the advertising campaigns of McDonald’s and Burger King. The ad under review does not say explicitly that the advertised brand is the best in the market and does not make any comparisons; it only offers a brief explanation of what the product is used for. In order to adapt the ad to the US audience, advertisers should explicitly state their message about the value of the brand.Furthermore, the advertisement needs adaptation rather than standardization because of the differences in the use of appeals in the US and Japan. Japanese advertisements appeal to the audience’s sentiment, while American advertisements appeal to logical reasoning. Thus, Japanese ads primarily contain images that invoke viewers’ emotions, whereas American ads use testimonies, logical arguments, and spokespeople to persuade people through rational
to American viewers, it can include facts supporting the effectiveness of the product.One final reason for adaptation is the difference in the ethnic composition of the population in the US and Japan. Japan is a largely monoethnic country, meaning that the majority of its population is Japanese. Hence, it is completely acceptable for Japanese ads, including the ad under review, to feature only Japanese people. In the US, the ethnic and racial composition is much more diverse, and there is a recent trend to reflect this diversity in various media, including advertisements. Therefore, the adaptation of this advertisement to the US audience is necessary to reflect the different racial compositions of the US society and follow the rising trend for diversity in advertising.ConclusionIn conclusion, the given ad cannot be standardized for the US because of significant differences between American and Japanese cultures and languages. Therefore, the ad should be adapted in terms of language, communication strategy, type of appeal, and racial representation. In particular, because of the different writing systems of the English and Japanese languages, the ad’s layout should be changed for a better appearance for the English-speaking audience. It should also contain more factual details about the product and can include testimonials and direct product comparisons.
science and technology during the Industrial Revolution. According to Morris, the conventional understanding of it was determined by two nearly obsolete historical studies, which are reflected in the discussion between A.E. Musson, and Eric Robinson, and A. Rupert Hall (Morris, 2021). According to the first two researchers, science was an essential aspect of the industrial Era (Morris, 2021). Hall, conversely, believes that the 18th-century technical innovations attributed almost nothing to the era’s science.The way I see it, Hall’s opinion does not have a solid ground. The Industrial Revolution, in my perspective, was an amalgam of technology, science, and industry. Significant breakthroughs and technical advancements shaped nearly every present field of people’s lives while also introducing a slew of new ones. It is well known that during the early stages of the Revolution, natural forms of energy, such as wind and water, were harnessed to generate electricity. However, later, new technologies, including steam power, were investigated and improved by John Smeaton, and electricity was critical in enabling the Industrial Revolution to flourish.
This paper is devoted to the study of judgmental forecasting. It contains general data about this type of forecasting, cases of its application, examples of its most effective use, and its advantages and disadvantages. As an example of judgmental forecasting, the Delphi method is proposed, which involves identifying a consistent assessment of an expert group through an independent, anonymous survey of experts in several rounds, which involves reporting the previous round’s results to the experts. Resources such as the book Forecasting: Principles and practice by Hyndman and Athanasopoulos, and Sniezek’s article “A comparison of techniques for judgmental forecasting by groups with common information ” are used to support the presented data.What is Judgmental ForecastingIn cases of the extreme complexity of the problem, its novelty, insufficiency of available information, or the impossibility of mathematical formalization of the solution process, one has to turn to competent experts. The solution of problems by experts, their commenting, the formation of quantitative estimates, and the processing of the latter by formal methods is called the method of judgmental forecasting. Hyndman and Athanasopoulos (2018) assert that this method involves a set of logical procedures aimed at obtaining from experts the data necessary for the preparation and selection of rational decisions. In the theoretical aspect, the legitimacy of using judgmental forecasting is confirmed because methodologically correctly obtained expert judgments meet two criteria for the reliability of any new knowledge: accuracy and reproducibility of the result. Therefore, judgmental forecasting is created by experts based on their experience and assessments.Judgmental forecasting helps to formalize the
discrimination and lack of inclusion as a phenomenon continued to exist.Slavery was abolished as a result of the Civil War between the northern and southern states. The passage of the Thirteenth Amendment to the US Constitution in January 1865 brought a permanent end to slavery in the US, making it illegal and anti-constitutional. Currently, this phenomenon in the United States is considered one of the most shameful episodes in the history of the country. At the same time, an urgent question arises whether the state should have compensated the slaves for the material and spiritual damage that was caused to them in the process.Even if slave labor is not officially permitted and the slaves are freed, without the provision of basic resources for life, survival is unlikely. The concept and attitude of society also affect the acceptance rate of new members. In the case of unequal chances of receiving the same benefits, the slaves in the past have more difficulties, challenges, and complexities on the path of integration. In this regard, the new slaves were not truly emancipated, as they were still dependent on a source of resources for subsistence.
Defining a historical context of juvenile delinquency studies can provide valuable information about society’s progress concerning juvenile delinquency in such aspects, as parental responsibility. Comparing the acts that were acknowledged as juvenile delinquency in ancient times and modern society can determine whether current policies effectively prevent youth from misbehavior. This essay will compare how juvenile delinquency was perceived in Ancient Greece with the way modern society approaches juvenile offenders.Firstly, searching for the historical origins of the juvenile delinquency concept could quickly become confusing because, historically, such a concept only occurred at the beginning of the modern era. While there is no significant data on youth misbehavior in ancient times, some available sources suggest that misbehavior was encouraged among young men (Bates & Swan, 2021). In particular, because masculinity and physical power were highly appreciated in Ancient Greece, one could determine that the society was pushing male youth towards violent behavior.Exposing the youth to violent behavior and stories from a young age contributed to the unruly behavior of youth In Ancient Greece. According to Regoli et al. (2020), many stories from Ancient Greek culture focus on complicated parents’ relationships with their children that end with the killing of the children. Therefore, the author suggested that juvenile delinquency was sourced in one’s relationships with parents. While other sources suggest that in punishment measures, youth were treated as adults, according to Bates and Swan (2021), the issue of juvenile delinquency could not occur at that time due to close family connections. Furthermore, as corporal punishments were common in families
modern society. Moreover, parents, educational institutions, society, and media are acknowledged as responsible for the delinquent behavior of juvenile offenders.Furthermore, considering the punishment measures, the corporal punishment commonly used in ancient times proved ineffective in the long run. According to Finkelhor et al. (2019), corporal punishment can result in poor development outcomes, such as mental health problems and subsequent aggression. In the last fifty years, the rate of children subjected to corporal punishment significantly decreased (Finkelhor et al., 2019). In modern times, common penalties for juvenile offenders include treatment and counseling, fines, or mandated community service hours. For example, in cases where a young man committed misbehavior, he is accountable to the authorities and will be judged depending on the severity of his actions. Lastly, the punishment measures for juvenile delinquency in modern society will never include corporal methods.In conclusion, this essay explored the historical context of juvenile delinquency and compared how the state approached juvenile delinquency in ancient and modern times. The essay defined that young Greeks were exposed to violent behavior from an early age in ancient Greece, and many had problematic relationships with their parents. Moreover, as the state held parents accountable for the children’s misbehavior, parents were the ones who chose the punishment measures, often resorting to corporal punishment. In modern times, the state prohibits corporal punishments due to their ineffectiveness and limits parental engagement in juvenile delinquency, and offenders are judged based on the severity of their actions.
prevention or treatment.I think that the main reason why the percentage is low in my state is because of its geographic location. There are many job opportunities in the state of Washington, which means people can afford to pay for health insurance. Also, individuals living in this state are well-informed about their options regarding health needs. Apart from that, the number of healthcare facilities is much higher than, say, in rural areas. All of these factors contribute to the high level of insured people.Speaking about the gap in quality of care and access to health care, I should also note such factors as ethnic disparities, access to education, and community context. In my state, it is easier for people from diverse backgrounds to accommodate and find support. However, there are parts of the country where some ethnic groups might be accepted with prejudice, which makes it difficult for them to pursue high-quality education and find well-paid jobs.
Kantian ethics is the clearest example of non-consequential theories in philosophy, and by extension, in law. Support for the theory often comes from adherents of imperative social order ideas such as utilitarianism. In Kant’s philosophy, the ideas of non-consequential ethics are most clearly demonstrated by the moral and ethical phenomenon he formulated and called the categorical imperative.This concept, as conceived by Kant, is the formulation of how a person should act, striving to partake in genuinely moral behavior (Kant & Abbott, 2021). The imperative directly addresses the acting person, who makes specific moral choices according to the predetermined rational ways. It advises a person to strictly and urgently, most attentively, treat the maxims of their behavior, namely to the subjective rules of practical reason. According to Kant, the principles of pure practical reason have a specific non-consequential form (Kant & Abbott, 2021). They are statements containing a general definition of will, which is subject to many practical rules; this notion has particular problems in the very essence of the statement.It should be discussed how Kant understands ethics in greater detail. Namely, morality should not be relative, bound by private interests, but absolute and universal; otherwise, it does not exist at all (Kant & Abbott, 2021). In other words, relativism is the enemy of genuine morality, the contingency of principles, and adaptation to the situation. In this aspect of Kant’s philosophy, the conflict between the fundamental, strictly necessary, universal moral law, which Kant defends, and the always determined circumstances, the actions of specific people, acquires a particularly sharp form. This conflict arises at the forefront of Kant’s non-consequential ethical position. After all, a specific person cannot live and act otherwise than focusing on circumstances, building their own subjective maxims of behavior. Perhaps they have no reason to be guided by universal morality, and in this case, the universal moral law–the categorical imperative–becomes just an idea and a chimera.
Korean Popular Culture and the Selling of Place by Youjeong Oh examines the use of K-pop music and Korean dramas with an aim to promote the rural and urban places in South Korea. To facilitate this, the book provides a framework insight on ways in which South Korea has aggressively used a number of aspects such as K-pop, K-drama, K-food, plastic surgery, and tourism to develop multiple strategies. In addition, the book expounds on the crucial relationship between urban planning and Hallyu. It uses an academic point of view to bring out the role of Korean cities through its production of television and music programs to boost their images and attract tourists. The book does so by documenting, historicizing, and using visuals to support the narrative of Korean culture.Pop City examines that pop culture features place selling facilitated with two separate domains: Korean globalization and political centralization of Korean culture. Based on the book, the local elections put in place in the 1990s enhanced the desires among the cities to develop and promote their rural areas. A good example is Wando County, a rural village that invested approximately $8 million and used its historical sites to create a K-drama that resulted in an increase of 50 million tourists with an income of $160 million in 2008 (Oh, 2018). The same case has been used in other rural areas where they use Korean entertainment to attract foreign tourists and sponsors. The elected local leaders also portray the political dimension. The local council has the authority to pass
the city and governor’s budget. With such authority and mandate, they have had the capacity to promote drama sponsorships. It means that the local government has a political centralization to dominate the decision-making process without the residents’ consent.In addition, Pop City analyses the process of culture featured place marketing. The book illustrates that the urban spaces in Korea are produced and sold in a similar way K-pop and k-drama are promoted using spectacular images rather than using the cultural and physical qualities that are in existence. For instance, the Anseong city attempted to commodify to be featured in the television show the Baudeogi; the city invested $9 million to develop the region and ensure that the city’s cultures stand out, such as dancing, singing, acrobatics, and circus performance (Oh, 2018). The action was nullified as the locals claimed “that the spending of taxpayers’ money should be cautious, the local council, in particular, asked for a formal process to collect citizens’ extensive opinions.” (Oh, 2018). However, it is important to note that most of the K-dramas have featured different marketing regions through pseudohistory, artificial images, and fabricated representation that creates a fantasy of the reality. Hence, Pop City has demonstrated selling places through the consumer exploitative, image-based, and speculative nature of the Korean pop culture. It enhances shaping the commodification of the rural and urban regions.Furthermore , Pop City illustrates the reasons K-pop is a popular means of entertainment globally. K-pop is popular as the production uses desirable images that create an intimacy that is appealing to
the consumers; it includes visual quality, associated products, and idolized locations (Oh, 2018). It enables the consumers to create a relationship with the television show. Secondly, they use an idolized system that strongly influences K-pop. In Korea, entertainment agencies strategically produce idols who appear in films, television shows, dramas, and music. It states that “When releasing a new idol group, the gihoeksa invests a significant amount of effort in crafting unique and marketable images for it.” (Oh, 2018). The idols are used as marketing products that are used to captivate the consumer’s mind and sell the designed items such as K-pop places, music, drama show, and merchandise. The success of the idols towards the competitive market enhances profit generations.Furthermore, the book illustrates the diverse aspects of using human geography to market Korea’s urban areas and K-pop. It defined human geography as “emotional engagement with a place turns visitors into agents of value creation on its behalf—that is, into facilitators of place selling.” (Oh, 2018). It emphasizes that for a consumer to engage with K-pop music and K-drama, the entertainment needs to be invested with the consumer’s emotions and bodily experiences. These aspects can be achieved from different places through displaying emotions of desires, love, longing, and tensions. Hence, it explains how tourists visit the K-pop music and K-drama sites to engage in an interpersonal and precognitive way, as demonstrated in the emotions of these pop. Human geography plays a significant role in pop culture, capitalizing on these emotional qualities and the way humans enact, feel, and
the risks involved in the oversupplied race, both the cultural producers and place marketers appear confident because of the sheer amount of uncertainty involved.” (Oh, 2018). It is also a result of increased finance channels. Since there is an oversupply of Hallyu talent, the industry tends to invest in the surplus value without producing any tangible benefits to society. For instance, K-pop takes advantage of the existing culture without investing in it.In conclusion, Korean Popular Culture and the Selling of Place by Youjeong studies the Korean wave from a different perspective from K-food, K-pop, K-drama, fashion, tourism, and plastic surgery. All these aspects of Korean culture have enhanced the marketing and selling of Korea’s culture and locations globally. The book has enacted this by identifying that pop culture features place selling mediates through two separate domains: Korean globalization and political centralization. The political centralization is acquired through the local government having the power to promote their regions through drama sponsorships. In comparison, the globalization aspects are illustrated on the K-pop power to use their culture to earn profit and sell the place. Such reasoning and documentation of the book with supporting evidence create a well-designed, innovative, and creative reading. It is recommendable to any reader interested in the Korean culture, urban planning, and sociology of the Hallyu.
Labor racketeering can be defined as the illegal use of unions and authority for self-interest. Union labor corruption was perpetrated by, performed in collaboration with, or under the direction of organized criminal syndicates. The beginning of the 20th century set the foundation for labor racketeering and became a law and societal concern (Jacobs, 2020). Until the late 1970s and early 1980s, there was no systematic governmental or enforcement agencies effort to mitigate the issue (Jacobs, 2020).During prohibition, criminal groups chose to generate profit from selling illicit spirits, which maintained the alcohol demand and earnings high. When prohibition was abolished in the 1930s, the mafia’s advanced business-running methods remained (Jacobs, 2020). The most potent groups turned their focus away from alcohol to business, including narcotics, gambling, and prostitution (Jacobs, 2020). However, these were not the only money-making businesses that contributed to the profit diversification. Among other beneficial businesses for the organized crime was labor racketeering through the control of labor unions.There are many reasons why gangs prefer labor unions to other kinds of unions. For example, it can be evident from their choice to control the Teamsters and International Longshoremen’s Association (Jacobs, 2020). With the sources of such unions, members of Cosa Nostra could easily access all kinds of legitimate businesses, including waste management, construction, or demolition. Moreover, they had easy access to healthcare and pension funds from the unions. These legitimate businesses offered them ways to not only traffick illicit substances or people but also cover up their actions (Jacobs, 2020). Among other crimes, the organized groups performed extortions or threatened employers, and solicited or received bribes.Hence, it can be seen that organized crime has always tried to control local businesses and expand their influence with the help of diversification of their profits. Among the main activities of gangs were prostitution, drug trafficking, gambling, and labor racketeering. Labor unions were beneficial to organized crime due to the sources they had. Such unions gave mobsters access to legitimate demolition, construction, and waste management businesses.
English is the simplest form of communication available between people from different parts of the world. It remains an indisputable fact that most people continue to speak with an accent even after many years of learning the language. This fact generates a vast wave of discrimination, especially from native speakers. The truth is that even they begin to twist their language to achieve a certain uniqueness and dissimilarity, especially in the creative sphere. The accent, which is so difficult to get rid of when speaking another language, is that our ear gets used to filtering out frequencies from childhood that are not needed to understand native speakers. It is essential to realize that speaking with an accent is normal, that this is not a reason to discriminate against a person. Still, on the contrary, it is an excellent opportunity to help them improve their language.The policy of multiculturalism, which is the parallel coexistence of different cultures, is adjacent to the social movement “The English only movement.” The latter actively advocates establishing uniform norms of the American literary language for whites and African Americans (Park Hong). Various political and socio-economic measures designed to rid the country of racist prejudices have not yet been crowned with success. In modern sociolinguistics, a special place is given to language as a social practice that establishes power relations between representatives of various racial and class groups.The feeling of their alienness, “otherness” in a largely still segregated American society generates tensions between immigrants and the indigenous population. The color of the skin,
There are many different scientific approaches to language studies; one of them is the prescriptive method. This principle can generally be described as a set of rules that prescribe speaking or writing. Crystal (1987) notes that prescriptivism is a perspective that chooses one of the interpretations of a language as the standard and extends it to the entire society. This variation is most often found in formal speech and literature. An alternative perspective is a descriptive approach based not on standards but on the actual situation. The proponent of this method simply describes the facts of linguistic variousness (Crystal, 1987). They act as an observer, not constrained by the official framework.Although these methods are opposite in meaning, each of them can be applied in the appropriate context. Crystal (1987) notes that exploring these methods often leads to an unrealistic depiction of the opposite side, the formation of prejudice and confrontation. However, both approaches should exist together, combining the positive aspects of each other. While the prescriptive approach allows the design of society to be arranged, the descriptive approach allows the recording of real language changes (Crystal, 1987). This, in turn, allows combining logic and the natural order of things.However, not all language changes are received positively due to misconceptions. The clearest example is the belief that change means deterioration, as the old generation constantly complains (Crystal, 1987). In addition, language changes are associated with a decline in the quality of education and the negative impact of the media. Nevertheless, the author selects sufficient counterarguments to all these fears. The elders are always resentful of change, as evidenced by historical correspondence. Deterioration in the quality of education and social tension arises only if these changes occur abruptly.Nevertheless, such cases are extremely rare, so I agree with these comments. As Crystal (1987) points out, it is common for the older generation to dislike the modern world, as evidenced by the literature. The influence of the media and the quality of education is not always necessarily linked to direct language changes. Therefore, my support for this position is based on the fact that people are usually afraid of change. Most people need the consistency of developed habits and methods in life. However, language change is a natural process that is not subject to official structures and is formed together with society and its most progressive members.
Delegation is the key to success in any type of organization, yet it can be a serious problem in church management. Many ministry leaders, used to working independently, find it hard to imagine that others can handle tasks more effectively. However, as the church grows, it is impossible to do without the help of additional church staff or volunteers. When leaders perform all tasks alone, their energies are spent on tasks that are not part of their duties (Kouzes & Posner, 2017). This decreases the effectiveness of church leadership, which is not acceptable. This problem is all the more urgent when the church leaders are not experienced and young. They may think they have the energy to manage all areas, but the reality is that multitasking can quickly stress them out. To solve the problem outlined, it will be optimal to use a systematic approach characterized by a full analysis of the situation and making rational decisions based on it.Key stakeholders are senior pastoral leadership, specific church leadership (elders, deacons), and volunteer leaders appointed to participate in the delegation process. When delegating responsibilities to others, it is necessary to explain to them what is expected of them and, in addition, to define their responsibilities in detail. The optimal solution is to provide a culture of empowerment in which leaders quickly encourage and empower employees and volunteers to participate in various initiatives.Young leaders often provoke the situation when they perform too many tasks. They are happy to help employees because such demand creates the illusion of their
indispensability, value, authority, and trust on the part of the team. Inexperienced leaders do not leave time to tackle higher-level and higher-priority tasks by getting involved in every problem. The leader may take it upon himself to solve the employee’s problems, justifying his actions with his incompetence. However, such motives also lead to the trap of reverse delegation. In such a situation, it is better to assign responsibility for the task to an employee who can solve it under the guidance of a more experienced team member.The essence of a proper delegation is to plan the task and organize the work process to achieve the goals as quickly and efficiently as possible. The problem of excessive workload can lead to quick burnout of the manager, frustration with the subordinates, or simply a dulling of attention. This leads to a decrease in the motivation of subordinates and a decline in the efficiency of their work. Inexperienced leaders risk falling into the trap of reverse delegation: when they will be forced to do the work for a subordinate himself in the end. At the same time, the volume of tasks, the solution of which is left to the leader, is constantly growing. The diagram below illustrates the key reasons why delegation problems arise (Figure 1).Figure 1: Fishbone DiagramBad leadership is costly to companies that profit from their operations. For example, employee turnover costs $5,500 per employee (Bartram, 2019). It costs a quarter of a million dollars per year in a company of 250 people (Bartman, 2019). Certainly, in
question is, why is it important to delegate in the church? This mechanism is necessary because it allows for more effective management of the organization and frees up the leader for more urgent tasks. The fourth question is, why might churches refuse to implement this method? Fear of changing the power structure within an organization as conservative as the church can cause distrust. The fifth question is, why is it still worth using delegation? This mechanism is proven to improve the quality of church functioning and help young leaders feel more confident.Delegating authority and various tasks in the Christian church is an essential skill that every leader must possess. This tool increases group productivity and gives others the opportunity to learn and grow to share success. By delegating to others, church leaders are actually allowing them to serve. Knowledgeable leaders achieve better results by calling on people with diverse talents and abilities to help them. The ability to delegate to another creates space for joint discussion, for collegial work. And this is precisely the skill, the effort, because, without humility, it is impossible to participate in a dialogue. Without delegating, it is impossible to let the other participant in the collaborative process share his or her vision and knowledge. Delegation of authority can improve the functioning of the church and make it easier to serve young leaders who do not yet have all the skills needed for successful leadership.
other hand, it led to the need to design business changes in such a way that the company was ready to win against an unlimited number of competitors at every stage of development. This implies the first requirement for a future business leader: a company mission that does not provide for the pursuit of global leadership will not lead to success. Therefore, the design of change should be based on the goal of achieving global leadership, which refers primarily to cultural management skills.No one can deny the fact that cultural differences have a significant impact on the behavior and actions of a leader. Based on this, it becomes quite obvious that these differences are usually reflected in the ways of distributing working time, decision-making, and methods of motivation. The concept of leadership is an integral element in the system of international relations, which largely determines the course of the world’s political and economic processes. According to Ratanjee (2021), “the topic of developing a global mindset and exposing leaders to multicountry and multicultural experiences is gaining increasing interest” (pp. 2). It is clear that transformational leadership in the leadership process is strongly suggested for future leaders. Bonsu and Evans (2018) state that “embracing cross-cultural transformational leadership is strategic to business growth in an era of globalization, efficiency in technology and information dissemination, and parity of education and skills” (p. 50). With discernment and charisma, transformational leaders are able to inspire those around them to change their expectations and motivations in order to move towards higher goals.
of the criminal justice system. While leaders guide the change through a vision, managers implement coordinated processes and structures to pursue organizational goals and objectives (Nickels et al., 2019). Leaders are constantly challenged to take risks and encourage transformation. In law enforcement, for example, police leaders must develop and instill high standards in other officers to work toward the same goal. Beyond leadership, criminal justice relies on managers to optimize processes and lead efforts toward reliable outcomes. Generally, criminal justice leaders and managers work effectively to balance ethical and legal considerations.Earning a degree in criminal justice would significantly contribute to meeting my long-term goals. I have always taken pride in influencing change as a leader. However, I must leverage my education with experience in the criminal justice system to become more efficient and productive. The criminal justice system is becoming increasingly complex and requires more lasting and transformative trends. As such, the second goal is to become more adaptable to change. Bringing significant change through robust analytical skills is an objective in itself. Also, gaining strong relational skills to work with professionals and serve people from diverse backgrounds.
Robert Putnam makes the case that the United States has lost social capital and civil society over the last quarter-century after explaining the importance of social capital and civil society in democratic societies. Tocqueville during his visit to America said, “Americans of all ages, all stations in life, and all types of disposition are forever forming associations. There are not only commercial and industrial associations in which all take part, but others of a thousand different types—religious, moral, serious, futile, very general and very limited, immensely large and very minute…. Nothing, in my view, deserves more attention than the intellectual and moral associations in America” (Putmann, 2000, p. 65). Even though Putnam admits that determining the significance of a few countertrends without additional research is difficult, he concludes that critical factors such as social trust are eroding at an alarming rate in the United States. He then goes into great detail about this erosion, and he concludes by outlining the research required to investigate these theories thoroughly.This important book demonstrates that social capital decreased dramatically in the United States after the mid-to-late-1960s due to generational succession, the rise of television and urban sprawl, and the increasing demands placed on people’s time and money, among other factors. Numerous social problems have been implicated from the same, and as a result, ranging from poor educational outcomes to economic stress and tensions between and among social groups. The most likely solution to this problem is to re-establish social capital in the manner of the Progressive Era but using contemporary
Leadership is one of the most significant aspects of advanced nursing, included in most educational programs’ curriculum and inevitably occurred in practice. Indeed, solving a problem identified in a healthcare organization enables a practitioner to develop convincing arguments to encourage others to take actionEast Orange General Hospital, create plans and execute them, and evaluate the efficiency of interventions (Hickey & Giardino, 2021). In my practicum site, East Orange General Hospital, the problem of the impoverished population’s refusal to attend the follow-up visits with their doctor has been recently identified. Consequently, my practice hours completion is focused on creating interventions and solutions to the issue, and creating a plan with proper strategies is vital for success. This paper aims to explore the project management design and leadership styles appropriate for the efficient addressing of the issue of the impoverished population skipping the follow-up appointments.The problem of the impoverished beneficiaries who do not attend their follow-up visits is critical for the East Orange General Hospital because most patients represent that population, and their behavior negatively influences the services’ quality. Skipped appointments are severe for the organizations because they reduce efficiency, increase costs, and waste the previous treatment results (Dantas et al., 2018). The issue must be addressed on the healthcare organization’s end with the practitioners, physicians, and administrators involved. The initiative’s implementation requires an execution design that includes diverse leadership approaches and project management techniques where multiple activities can be performed and evaluated simultaneously. The SMART objectives and evidence-based practice implementation are the design approaches for creating a
project to address the problem of impoverished patients skipping their follow-up visits (Sipes, 2020). For instance, the objectives must be formulated based on the recent evidence, with the related actions necessary to achieve them.The strategy’s focus is the population that needs an intervention to change their behavior towards attending the doctor. As the beneficiaries interact with their physicians, nurses, and administrators, a change in their practice is required to decrease the number of missed follow-up visits. The Statement of Work (SOW) must include separate action plans for each stakeholder; thus, the leadership styles to address them can vary (Sipes, 2020). In interaction with the administrators, autocratic execution is appropriate as they must follow the action plan to achieve results (Spiva et al., 2021). In contrast, physicians aware of aspects of their patient’s life and health conditions can use different influence tactics; therefore, the leadership style suitable for them is transformational. Nursing practitioners’ role in the project is to communicate with the impoverished population and encourage them to change behavior towards attending the follow-up visit. Consequently, they would benefit from the visionary leadership style through which the person in charge would support their willingness to impact patient outcomes.Several practice changes must be implemented to address the issue of the East Orange General Hospital’s impoverished patients misattending their follow-up visits. Patient education performed by a physician should explain the importance of the additional appointment and the consequences of skipping it (White et al., 2021). Nursing practitioners can influence patients’ decision-making by discussing the priorities of the impoverished population
The healthcare setting typically incorporates a plethora of factors that cause nurses significant stress. Specifically, nurses must manage very tight schedules, handle a tremendous amount of information, and tend to the needs of a large number of patients. The need to provide constant support to patients and ensure that they receive emotional support has necessitated the development of coping mechanisms that shield nurses form stress to an extent. Learned optimism, which can be defined as a conscious effort to recognize pessimistic ideas and choose not to be consumed by them is one of such responses.At first glance, learned optimism might seem as an artificial attempt at avoiding confrontation with real-life concerns. However, on further inspection, especially after considering the challenges that nurses must confront regularly in the workplace, one will have to recognize the need for a tool that allows nurses to keep their resilience (Chang & Daly, 2015). In this respect, learned optimism as the means of keeping one’s composure and maintaining a positive outlook in the settings that involve high levels of stress and pressure is vital for maintaining mental and emotional well-being.Therefore, as a coping mechanism for managing stress levels in the workplace, learned optimism allows a nurse to avoid a range of complications associated with mental health. For example, the use of learned optimism an as coping mechanism for stress management can prevent a workplace burnout from developing. In turn, workplace burnouts currently represent a major threat for nurses due to the continuous rise in the number of patients and the extent
The legal issue of consent is quite an interesting topic for discussion. The main aspect of this concept is consent, which plays an important role in this process. To study this aspect, the Georgia vs case can be applied. Randolph, which affects the seizure of evidence without approval from the suspect. This work also explores what exceptions, in addition to the absence of a concent from a search warrant, can be applied to computers or other high-tech evidence.Before proceeding to the consideration of cases related to digital information, it is necessary to understand what Georgia v. Rudolf case is. The accused was accused by his wife of using narcotic substances and the woman promised to provide evidence of the accusations that were in their common house. However, if the spouse consented to the search of the property, the man refused and resisted him. Thus, the police got access to the necessary evidence, which was later collected after receiving the order and the husband was accused of cocaine possession. However, the court ruled that since the wife had no recognized authority in the law to give consent, she gave the police no more grounds for justifying entry than they would have had in the absence of any consent at all. Thus, there was a violation of the Fourth Amendment, and the compensation claims of the state were not summed up to outweigh it.The Fourth Amendment, which is the central legislative concept in this case, prohibits unreasonable searches and detentions. Moreover, it implies the issuance of search warrants
only if they are issued by a court with sufficient grounds. However, research shows that “the Supreme Court has never explained what makes an expectation of privacy reasonable, and scholars regularly complain that this standard is incomprehensible and unworkable” (Tokson, 2020, p. 1). Therefore, if we apply this aspect to Internet technologies and electronic information of a person, the police cannot obtain this information without the direct consent of the accused. This also applies to the fact that the security authorities cannot follow the consent of the roommates or neighbors, since these proofs are not their personal property.Moreover, thus, it can be concluded that the seizure of evidence is lawful with the permission of one person, when another, who will try to hide them and at the same time is present at the scene and clearly refuses to give consent illegally. The Fourth Amendment supports the fact of unauthorized actions for the uncoordinated acquisition of digital information and without a court order with the necessary amount of substantiated evidence.Therefore, using the case of Georgia v. Rudolph (2006) as an example, it can be concluded that law enforcement agencies, with assistance, can seize the necessary evidence on electronic media without consequences for the Fourth Amendment. The Fourth Amendment gives people the right to be secure in their houses and papers (Garrett & Stoughton, 2017). This is an inherent right that balances the governments need to investigate criminal activity while preventing unnecessary and unwarranted police intrusions. However, it is a limited right and is not applied to all
The phrase that caught me most from the video is from Isaiah, stating that Samuel has taught him that one person can play t-ball and hit it hard when sitting down. This is a powerful statement indicating that people can be prejudiced despite having good intentions. Samuel’s family did not realize the struggles disabled people go through before he was born (PinehurstPictures, 2010). The child’s image hitting the t-ball also showcased a powerful issue, that disabled individuals should be treated similarly to other people and given equal opportunities to give them the chance to perform optimally.I was intrigued to see children like Nathanial Orellana learning in a normal classroom. His mother determined they sought school actively to ensure he received the best care considering his autism (PinehurstPictures, 2010). Parents face a myriad of extra challenges raising disabled children to give them advantages that would help them compete with their peers in society. The video illustrates that communities and the government should provide parents with a variety of schools to determine the best for their child’s disability.Children with disabilities require special care but should be allowed to interact with others if their illness would not worsen based on these connections. Engagement is a crucial tool for child development as it requires them to be attentive and active, propagating greater achievement due to increased enthusiasm. Nathanial raises his hand to answer a question because each student is engaged in the classroom. His enthusiasm to answer the question shows interest and a desire to learn, traits associated with high achievement.The video is helpful because it provides a glimpse of the life individuals with disabilities pass through. Many of these parents face issues with education as they would like their children to receive the best education while also avoiding the pitfalls that other children do not face. Emily, a mental health advocate, has schizophrenia and discerns that people without the illness cannot fully understand their plight (PinehurstPictures, 2010). In this aspect, people without developmental problems may not see the issues they face and should work hard to help them optimally function in society. Keith Jones also showcases an important faction of society. He claims that individuals should not expect children to develop good social skills if they stay for eight hours in a classroom without adequate interaction (PinehurstPictures, 2010). It is crucial to recognize that inclusion would work well if children were given a chance to interact frequently despite their differences.
Songs of Song is a depiction of the value, beauty, and meaning of work and love between a man and a woman. The Song relays stories of an ideal image of family, work, and life by showcasing lovers who court, marry, and then work. King Solomon, who is the author of the Song, explicitly communicated the themes of hardship, pleasure, beauty, joy, passion, diligence, and family.At the beginning of the Song, a woman is expressing her love for her man. While at it she also informs that her skin has become dark as a result of hard work in the family vineyard. She says that her brothers made her work hard there. Although this Song is about love, one cannot fail to notice that work is also given center stage. In addition, dark skin had a different meaning from the present-day racial connotation. Dark skin was used to describe people who toiled in the sun for economic reasons. Perhaps, they were mostly the peasants who ranked low in the economic hierarchy. In this Song, however, the woman’s beauty has not diminished by hard work. As she puts it in Song 1:5, “Dark am I, yet lovely,” King James Version. Moreover, the woman is not regretting her job for it has prepared her for the future when she expects to tender for her own vineyard as well (Song 8:12). Later, she will leave her brothers and get married and have her own vineyard.In many civilizations, work has always been construed as an enemy of beauty. However, the
biblical perspective brought out through the Song depicts work as an essential beauty. Not only does King Solomon builds a palanquin for himself, but the Song also praises the loveliness of workmanship. Thus, as expressed in Song 3:10, it is a labor of love. Ultimately, the Song reiterates that apart from being a means to an economic end, work is also a foundation of aesthetic ingenuity.In the Song, the woman is in pursuit of her beloved, a man whom she describes to be the finest of men. She receives information from her friends that the man is at his obvious place of work where he is shepherding sheep. His work, however, does not make it hard to interact with her. The arrangement of their work allows them to freely interact as a family. This is in contrast to how work is today where family interaction time is dictated by job demands and an employer’s goodwill.The man and the woman proclaim their devotion to each other through the Song. He intones of her impeccable beauty and she sings how madly she is in love with him. When springtime arrives, they both sing in its glory and he invites her over to his place. In ancient Israel, springtime was a time to work on the farms. It was the time when crops were pruned to guarantee good harvests. It was also during this time that the young grapes were more attractive to foxes and animals. The two lovers, thus, find joy in chasing the foxes away from the
Most people during the Victorian era valued the virtues of society. Victorians believed that they were fixed and certain as guiding behavior to people all the time. The virtues included morals that one can be judged according to his behavior. Any betrayal of ethical standards was termed lousy behavior and could deserve punishment. These beliefs have become misguided, undesirable, and inappropriate in modern America (Schlereth, 2018). They have shifted to values that no longer have classical ideas of wisdom, justice, courage, or cleanliness (p. 691). They have become sexual connotation where people practice prostitution and other immoral behaviors.In previous years, there were low rates of crimes that have continued to rise. Victorians practiced moral principles in their lives, which maintained good morals and behavior. Currently, morals have changed and translated to destructive behaviors that contribute to higher rates of crimes (Schlereth, 2018). Victorian speaks about morality and the best ways of devising it. In modern America, a character has been substituted, and most youths indulge in immoral behavior.In the Victorian era, women were illiterate, immigrants were not socializing with others, while now women are educated, and immigrants share ideas with natives. Men used to work for wages and get involved in politics while women engaged in domestic work and childrearing. In literature, each era had a different theme according to the way we understand life (p. 693). The Victorian era focused on industrialization, imperialism, domesticity, and cultural identity (Schlereth, 2018). Modern literature focused on the theme of loss, despair, and politics. Victorian era, most people were
The article’s thesis statement is supported by the further reading authors investigating the case of a strange change in Professor Wilson’s lifestyle. Indeed, the reasoning behind such a decision was complex, and it includes elements of achieving maximum sustainability in the tiniest space possible. In addition, the article mentions that he shares his experiences during the nights when his ecology-focused students are invited to stay in the dumpster with him.The article caught my attention with a few details. First of all, the scenario where a respected scholar lives in the dumpster reminded me of an Ancient Greek philosopher Diogenes who lived in the barrel. Hence, it was interesting to investigate the topic and find if there are any similarities between the two. Furthermore, giving personal details and the personal background of the divorced professor added a bit of psychological interest to it. I wondered if the divorce affects men so severely that they are ready for such a downshift. But these are all subconscious thoughts and triggers.The visuals in the article were crucial to me because I felt a little tired when I started reading. Hence, being able to scroll down and see the pictures of the dumpster, pictures of day-to-day activities, and the interior of the dumpster was a way of relaxing and thinking about the subject. After looking at pictures, I had some questions; therefore, I had a personal interest in reading the article to find the answers. Honestly, the interior of the dumpster does not look that bad, and the best thing is that Wilson is able to lay there comfortably. Therefore, personally, living in a dumpster is an option for times when I feel like I need to be alone. But lack of commodities associated with the home kitchen and bathroom is why I could not choose the dumpster as a place of my permanent residence.
Both lookism and extreme body modification are inherently linked to unhealthy and unrealistic beauty standards of modern society. This trait aside, however, the two are very different in its manifestations and direct consequences. Lookism is merely the act of considering someone whose appearance is not what most people would regard to be beautiful. It focuses on exhibiting negative judgement to people that do not fit the standard and is thus oriented outside of the person who engages in it. Extreme body modification is the act of changing one’s body in order to look in a way that deviates from the norms that society sets on appearance (Good, 2016). To contrast these two, one does not look pleasing in appearance, while the other intentionally marks oneself in ways that others would perceive as deviances or outside of societal standards.The differences between the two stem from their external or internal angles, despite both being related to the dissatisfaction with appearance. It is likely that a person who engages in lookism is deeply insecure about their own beauty, and thus takes a judgemental stance towards the beauty of others. Obsessiveness over other peoples’ features or grooming habits generally signals a very unhealthy relationship with self-image, despite being less visible than bodily modifications (Good, 2016). Meanwhile, said modifications can happen both by a person’s own accord, and as an act of social pressure or custom. An example of the latter would be an ancient Chinese tradition of binding female feet to make them small and rose-like in their shape. More often then not, the expectations of extreme bodily modifications are placed on women, who are expected to conform to them in certain cultures to uphold their respectability and perceived marital value.
Customer loyalty is a positive perception of the company and its products. The loyalty ladder is the structural model that implies the different levels of customer engagement in the selling process of a company’s products (Gerami & Vahid Yazdanian, 2018). Usually, the researchers define five levels of customer loyalty: suspects, prospects, customers, clients, and advocates (Gerami & Vahid Yazdanian, 2018). The loyalty ladder is an efficient tool to establish long-term relationships with clients. Different companies apply various marketing strategies to move customers from one level of the ladder to another.A loyal customer predominantly buys goods and services from only one brand, not paying attention to its competitors’ offers. Such a customer is the main driving force of the business, in the long run, helping to build a positive image of the company and advertising it for free in his inner circle. Therefore, creating a loyal customer base and assessing customer loyalty is a top priority for a company that plans to remain in demand on the market for a long time.In today’s e-business, the loyalty ladder is exceptionally vital in attracting customers online. The e-marketing strategies allow more advanced methods to build efficient loyalty programs. For the analysis of the practical appliance of the loyalty ladder, two brands of organic cosmetics were chosen: Pacifica and Annmarie. Both retailers provide online opportunities and loyalty programs for customers. Considering their activities from the perspective of customer loyalty, the brands’ programs aim at different ladder levels. The first online brand, Pacifica, offers a digital gift card ( Digital gift
clients are more focused on one brand, which minimizes the risk of competitors’ victory. This approach is highly relevant for e-commerce, enhancing loyalty. The program is beneficial for both the brand and customers due to paid subscriptions and various privileges. However, Annmarie’s strategy fails at the level of attracting new customers. Even though the profound base of loyal customers and advocates is established, broadening the brand’s potential is also vital for future development.Therefore, both brands provide loyalty programs based on their current needs. They succeed on one level while failing at another. Addressing all the levels of the ladder would be the perfect strategy for both retailers. However, brands promote programs relevant to the current budget and opportunities. Annmarie’s approach is more efficient from a long-term perspective. The Pacifica’s one is beneficial in terms of broadening the client base.
The Prince, written by Nicholas Machiavelli, is an important contribution to the modern concept of politics. In a sense, this work contradicts the philosophical tradition of ancient political thought in which political practice is overshadowed by the idealization of governments and utopian cities. On the contrary, in Prince, Machiavelli (2014) establishes that the real implementation of politics implies real situations with real people whose behavior, decisions and actions usually are not necessarily moral. The main theme of “The Prince” by Machiavelli is monarchical rule and survival. This work was regarded as a guide for politicians on the use of ruthless, self-serving cunning and inspired the term “Machiavellian”. Machiavelli (2014) discusses in detail how a ruler should act in various situations or circumstances and establishes that the main goal of politics is the successful retention of power. The book had a lasting effect on political thought since in it, Machiavelli opposed the traditional attitude to politics that serves the people to a benign self-interest, where the ruler is self-centered and focused on his goals. The book justifies any means as long as they help the governor to achieve his aims.According to Hobbes, people are egoistic, greedy, and seek personal gain. Egoism is declared to be the main incentive of human activity. But Hobbes does not condemn people for their selfish inclinations, does not believe that they are evil by nature. Many people find Hobbes’ view cynical as it is too simplified and not all actions can be explained by egoism. For example, there are a lot of people and charity organizations that donate their money and time for free without any personal gain. As for me, I find human nature infinitely more complex than power-seeking individuals described in Hobbes’s work.
IntroductionIn the first section of the reading provided, various matters determine the human good. According to the book, one can be happy depending on the decisions made and actions taken regarding the choice made about an issue. For example, if one builds a house, they will feel happy, and if they also feel healthy, the aspect of good is also revealed. In other words, the writer is trying to help the reader navigate that the human good can be achieved under everything as long as the subject is affiliated with the person behind it. Human beings choose some of the factors to define their happiness and aspect of goodness (Aristotle 8). Most people choose general instruments of life such as wealth, flutes, and many others.Assessment of Important Issues, Themes, and Concerns of the ReadingsComplete good is determined by self-sufficiency, which means a person will live according to the estimated limit when dealing with matters. The aspect of human good can be extended from one party to another, such as from parents to their children or friends to friends (Aristotle 8). According to the inner picture portrayed by the book, it seems human beings are structured in political, social, and economic settings that come in different formulas for achieving the common good. Happiness can be an agreeable subject, measured by what people feel concerning the completeness of human anatomy and general ways of living. Some elements such as the interdependence that people have with the environment can be associated with human good. Therefore, what is spoken or
conveyed during sensitive societal settings defines the completeness of human beings (Aristotle 9). For example, if one is educated and has the roots of success, it means that the people who have been backing the person may benefit from the same, hence building the goodness more.The sketch of good can be drawn by showing what one has and what one lacks. The degree to which people seem to be satisfied by normal happenings such as rainfall, weather changes, and relationships with others can be a measure of good (Aristotle 9). A carpenter example is given to show the extent of discipline they have when it comes to measurements. In this matter, people have to do what appears more logical even if it may not be what they wish. These factors will be a limit to human beings, and they show the restrictions that are important in life.Some questions may arise from this context, and the reader may be baffled by the issues discussed in the book. First, how possible is it for human beings to be good to everyone if every aspect of the common good is self-centered? Second, can all people be the same in terms of traits that make them happy? And if they must be happy and do human good, what about the deficits left more so the environment such as plants, pets, and world animals? Thus, interrogating such issues in one’s mind may help one understand the account of human good and life perspectives.Critical Analysis of the TextThe author has given a
defense of the account of the good by supporting it with various elements. The main idea here is that the conclusions that people make from given premises will be harmonized by the true accounts of the subject matter (Aristotle 10). The truth must be compromised with false, and therefore, the clash between the two variables is seen in terms of the reaction and outcome of the matter. To understand the human good that the writer is talking about, people must think about the external, bodily, and soul perspectives. These three elements may notably categorize the metrics that can define the accounts of good in human life (Aristotle 10). The soul is often considered to offer a full account of the good from what people reason and decide to do with their reasoning.The author means that the soul is more powerful than the body in that the cognition of the account or the outcome of a task is articulated from the soul. It is important not to overlook the body as the doer. The context brought to light is that accounts of human goods are structured and reasoned by the soul before getting to the external perspectives. Happiness is a form of justifying the accounts of human good since many consider it a virtue (Aristotle 12). For example, if one is asleep or ill, they may not be feeling happy about it as some consider sleeping a measure of laxity while others say that illness is brought by evil. In short, human beings must engage in societal
frameworks that define the ways of living, and the cultural essence is felt significantly at this point.Active people always feel happy about the level of engagement they have daily. For example, a person working in a busy food outlet may feel pleased by the nature of their job for various reasons. First, it enables them not to see a long day and keeps them focused and developing their minds and souls. Second, the personal interactions with the guests during food and beverage service may make them learn various aspects of life (Aristotle 12). Hence, they may feel like they have a significant role in teaching others the same. These factors make people happy, and they are considered the root sources of human good.Happiness is achieved in various ways, according to the text. By reading the topic well, indeed, one may not be able to differentiate whether happiness is achieved by learning or habituation (Aristotle 12). To elaborate on this matter, it is more reasonable to say that it is cultivated from both. Here, a reader has to understand a critical point on this note. First, creating own happiness is a way learned from life exploration. Second, habits that one has grown with may be a determining factor in achieving happiness. For example, if one knew that going to church is one way of becoming morally stable in society, then such people may be active in religion as they feel it strengthens their human good. By this point, it will be true to say that they have
achieved happiness from habituation.Though, by keenly reading the book, one may wonder why happiness was not given as the super element of human good, assuming that it is a gift from God (Aristotle 11). This question probes one to investigate the possibility of having achievements that may not make one happy. The other concern from the topic is the level of happiness that one has to achieve, given that it can be a matter of self-efficacy and sociological well-being. The issue of fortune is a contentious matter at twilight since the book may not unveil the natural state of fineness that can be entrusted to bring human good.While reading the topic, it is clear that happiness is an activity of the soul, as mentioned earlier in this essay. Some goods determine the necessary conditions for happiness. The writer means that if one is healthy, wealthy, or successful, one can be triggered by the inner spirit from the soul to feel happy (Aristotle 14). These accounts of goods in human anatomy make it possible to achieve happiness. The political setting in the current society makes people express their happiness, and therefore, the metrics involved may be as forms of human goods. For example, diplomatic tensions probe people to start analyzing the power a given country has over the other. This, people, become happy when they notice their side is winning while the other party is losing.Similarly, a successful person may not be prosperous in matters in life, and that at some point, levels the human way of
Levels of culture can be displayed in different planes and depths. According to Edgar Shein, who developed the concept ‘levels of organizational culture,’ and Edward Granter who later expanded on this concept, the culture of the entity can be seen in four levels: super-structural, symbolic, discursive, and cognitive (Granter, 2019). In other words, the levels of culture in enterprises are developed due to external economic and social influences, artifacts such as logos, story rituals and events, values explicitly expressed by the organization, and underlying assumptions. This paper aims to assess the levels of organizational culture for Macomb Community College.Artifacts in Macomb Community College show that it promotes concentration, attentiveness, and responsibility, which is reflected in the logo. Looking at the architecture of the buildings, some of which use chrome-plated modern high-tech structures, one can assume that technology and science are the main focus of educational programs. Nonetheless, the central older building and a park with large trees create an atmosphere of solitude and introspection, which is more in line with the study of fine arts and social sciences. Equally important, the college has a high culture of mutual help and respect and cherishes community relations, which is reflected in the developed bus route system available to students.On the value level, many signs within the college, including parking signs, library signs, and other clues, point to a love of order and organization. Probably in this college, teachers appreciate the composure and commitment shown by students. On the level of assumptions, the college probably seeks to avoid accepting students who are overly self-expressive or whose identity is tied to superficial popular culture. The college website lacks flashy headlines or programs offering to participate in the community in a frivolous way, such as selling cookies for fundraising or taking part in field trips.Thus, the levels of organizational culture at the Macomb Community College were assessed. The college has a clear identity at the level of artifacts and values. At the same time, the analysis of underlying assumptions suggests several recommendations. Perhaps, the college underestimates the importance of openness in relationships and is too harsh on manifestations of superficial identity or judgment. Given the high commitment to social and community values, Macomb Community College members should consider that openness is an important value for building good social connections.
The story of King Uruk, or Gilgamesh, is widely recognized as the first known explanation of the relationship between humans and gods. In other words, The Epic of Gilgamesh is the first mention of mythology in our world. To be more exact, the piece’s primary focus is on King Uruk’s transformation from a horrible ruler to a kind one when he is forced to face mortality.As stated, the main character of this story is the King of Uruk, who now serves as a reminder that in the early times, humans used to feel the same as we did. According to Anneberg Learner (2021), this writing is older than Bible since it is “four thousand years old in its oldest form.” Therefore, The Epic of Gilgamesh describes the life of Uruk’s ruler, above all other kings, considering that he was special, “he was two-thirds divine and one-third human” (Anneberg Learner, 2021). However, when the gods realized that they could not handle such an arrogant ruler, they sent Gilgamesh’s copy, Enkidu. Finally, the King of Uruk realized the significance of social interaction, “wonderful about being engaged with another human being” (Anneberg Learner, 2021). It is significant to note that Enkidu actually started the same way as Adam and, consequently, was humanized by the prostitute sent by the gods. Still, one fatal mistake of Enkidu and Gilgamesh leads to the first’s inevitable death, and when the King of Uruk realizes that his friend is dead, he starts seeking immortality.Overall, the story’s main idea is that the gods created immortality only for themselves, while humans will always be followed by death. Eventually, as Gilgamesh’s chance to live forever was stolen by a serpent, he finally realized his treasure, knowing the past and ability to return back to his city. At the end of the story, the town survives its ruler, which is why such a powerful message leads to the human population remembering it ever since.
comprehend motivation, one must first recognize fundamental human nature, which may be both complicated and straightforward at the same time (Usmonovich, 2021). Understanding and appreciating the above is a necessity for successful employee motivation in the workplace, as well as good management and organizational achievement.Thirdly, a business is less likely to fulfill its goals if its personnel is not entirely committed. When people lose interest in their employment, organizations will see a commensurate drop in determination, invention, and productivity. The leadership that declines to confront these issues immediately endangers their job, as the firm relies on them to guarantee that employees regularly perform at a high level (Usmonovich, 2021). Thus, managers must be familiar with motivational strategies as well as comprehend their workers’ unique peculiarities and views to select incentives that will effectively motivate them to work together to achieve the organization’s goals.
This tote is perfect for mothers with teenage children who are constantly on the go but want to look stylish while doing errands and during family activities. It is high-end yet durable and keeps the owner’s personal belongings organized in a portable and secure way, making it easier to get outside in the shortest time.Product SelectionAccording to the survey data, in the target audience, the most popular brands are Channel, Pucci, and Kate Shade. Therefore, the audience is torn between products in which the quality matches the price and luxury products with unreasonable prices. In order to justify the high-end price, it might be helpful to use a high-quality leather material and equip the bag with extra pockets for organized storage, as most luxury bags miss that feature. As survey results suggest that the target audience mostly prefers shoulder bags or tote bags, providing an additional shoulder strap will offer a more substantial basis for the price. Most survey participants have three to five bags, meaning that they prefer to have one bag that will suit all occasions, including everyday use, rather than a wide variety of different bags in different styles. Combining the collected conclusions leads to the black bag option in size 9×11 made from leather with 36$ production cost.PricingThe survey results suggest that most of the target audience can afford the price from 300$ to 700$, and most prefer to shop online for handbags. Considering the target audience’s income, it is more likely that a bag with a high mid-range price will be more popular as its price can be justified, unlike luxury bag prices. The closest alternative in mid-range price from All Tote Bags On Shelves research is Ralph Lauren Carlyle Mini Leather Zip Tote Bag with a 195$ pricing. Therefore, setting the future product’s price around 250$ will result in a fair price for the customers for the products’ quality. The price will also provide additional revenue for Buhi that the company can spend on additional accessories and product packaging to create a more luxurious feel.
Marx’s thesis on the fetishism of commodities focuses on society’s tendency to place value on commodities based on contributed labor, which inevitably causes domination of the products over people. Furthermore, the fetishism affects the social interactions between the customer and producer: the valued objects are independently exchanged for the respective purposes. Such exchanges of objects occur independently of human needs or decisions (Ritzer, 2011). In this case, it is essential to note that the term fetishism does not suggest any sexual connotations; it only explains people’s inclination to devote themselves to the mentioned principles.In modern society, we have fetishized technological trends in the same way that Marx’s thesis suggests. For example, Apple products are known to be highly appreciated for their “high-quality” and “accessibility”. The labor that goes into creating the products, despite sometimes being considered unethical, benefits the brand’s overall image. Since hours and hundreds of workers are dedicated to producing the items, their values increase independently of their quality. The product’s value is then highly dependent on the importance placed by the general public and marketing strategies rather than its original worth. Moreover, the workers that are required for the brand’s success also become commodities, as mentioned in the Manifesto of the Communist Party (Marx & Engels, 1818-1883). In this way, although existing independently of one another, all major parts of the modern socio-economic system become disconnected from their actual worth.Marx’s thesis fails to explore how a commodity gains its value purely from the amount of labor included in the process. This could be outlined as a critical disadvantage to the thesis, as it ignores a central perspective that aid in changing the materialistic values of society. Another detail that was not mentioned in Marx’s work is related to the nature of commodities, why some are more valued than others. Still, the Manifesto of the Communist Party and Marx’s thesis provide a solid foundation for analyzing modern socio-economic relations.
to devote her life to saving lives (Breckinridge, 2021). After the war, Mary worked mainly in Kentucky and continued her education at the Teachers College of Columbia University in New York City (Breckinridge, 2021). In 1923, she went to England to study at the British Hospital for Mothers and Babies to become a qualified midwife (Breckinridge, 2021). Also, in 1925, she established a private charitable organization, the Frontier Nursing Service (FNC), which significantly decreased both maternal and infant mortality in the area of service (Brewer, 2018).During her life, Mary significantly contributed to nursing and helped many people. Apart from the FNC that still operates in southeastern Kentucky, she was recognized as the first who introduced nurse-midwifery to the United States (Brewer, 2018). It is worth mentioning that Mary’s impact on midwifery and nursing education continued even after her death. Today, people from around the world come to the FNC School of Midwifery and Family Nursing to study her model of rural health and social service delivery (Brewer, 2018).It is hard not to admire Mary Breckinridge for her contribution to nursing, despite all the tragedies she encountered. Even after losing her kids, Mary did not let the disaster break her spirit but devoted herself to reducing suffering from other people’s lives. I truly believe that everyone can learn from her example.
to engage with more sophisticated principles of 21 st -century nursing. First of all, Master’s degrees are aimed at the manner in which nurses think. More specifically, such programs promote critical thinking and cognitive agility that is required to make precise decisions in difficult situations. Thus, a certain leadership dimension is introduced, allowing nurses to enter the healthcare decision-making framework while understanding the social dimension of the issues to address (Bryant-Moore et al., 2018). Second, a Master’s in nursing supports the development of emotional intelligence, which is integral to patient-centered care. By employing critical thinking, nurses learn to analyze each case objectively and master the emotional aspect that enables strong patient connection (Cassano et al., 2020). Third, a Master’s in nursing is a major step toward proficiency in scientific research, through which nurses help to build a better system for tomorrow. Overall, Master’s programs complement the fundamental skills of each professional by a stronger presence of cognitive, emotional, and research competencies that support the emergence of nursing leaders within the professional community.
it is challenging to define the current world order. It is evident that multipolarity prevails and establishes the course of action. Still, it is closely intertwined with bipolarity, which indicates that the modern world is a unique system with dissimilar approaches and impacts. This connection distinguishes the current state of the world structure from the previous one. Therefore, one cannot associate the reasons for military conflicts solely with a specific system.Mearsheimer’s ideas regarding the grounds for wars are rational and reasonable. Nevertheless, the author doubts them because of the nuclear weapon, which existed when Europe was bipolar (Mearsheimer, 2014). It was not present in multipolar order, and therefore the arguments are not valid as the atomic weapon is one of the world’s most significant forces. Mearsheimer (2014) suggested that it, not the system, could be the foremost reason for the absence of war in bipolar Europe between 1990 and 1945. The balance of power cannot affect the outbreak of war as much as the fear of nuclear annihilation.
The question of whether media has any benefits in learning has been made and substantiated many times in the past. This has attracted a great debate, with some responders, such as Richard Clark, holding that instructional teaching methods influence learning and not media directly under any conditions. Similarly, the antagonists hold that media is molded into certain attributes of media, which instead influence learning (Clark, 1994).Various students apply these attributes of media as they are thought to enhance their cognitive process development. At the same time, protagonists such as Robert Kozma hold that media will influence learning through the application of technologies such as computers, telephones, and television in teaching and learning (Kozma, 1994). This paper, therefore, will explore Kozma’s perspective on the great media debate and provide the rationale for why Kozma’s viewpoint is favorable.An instruction method links and enhances cognitive processes that are essential in achieving learning. Clark (1994) mentions that instructional technology seeks to evaluate the necessity and type of instructional method that is vital in providing psychological support to learners in the learning process. Clark’s argument on whether media contributes positively to learning introduces the economic perspective of media and its attributes.According to Clark (1994), on the replaceability challenge, Clark asserts that if various media or their attributes lead to the achievement of the same learning outcome, then the cheapest instructional method should be employed. Clark (1994) proceeds to argue that the replaceability test explains the ability to replace a different set of media or attributes with another that is less expensive,
although it leads to the attainment of similar learning results. Therefore, Clark’s argument that media has no effect on students’ learning outcomes can be justified.Kozma’s argument in the media debate brings about the concept of learning as a constructive, cognitive and social process. According to Kozma (1994), learning encompasses where learners utilize available materials to come up with new knowledge through interaction with the surroundings and integrating the new knowledge with that already in the memory. From this viewpoint, learning is perceived to be a result of integrating learners’ cognitive resources with their surrounding resources. Consequently, this brings up the concept of media and learning as the interacting force that fosters the relationship between learners’ cognitive resources and environmental resources.Media and media attributes have exemplary capabilities that enable learners to achieve cognitive resources. According to Clark vs. Kozma (2018), two pieces of research pieces of evidence came up to demonstrate the effects of media on learning. These include the thinker tools and the Jasper Woodbury Series pieces of evidence. Clark (1994) explains that the Thinker Tools are used to teach force and motion problem solutions while the Jasper Woodbury Series are used to solve mathematically related problems. The Thinker Tools, which is a computer-based learning media according to Kozma (1994), introduces four phases; motivation, evolution, formalization, and transfer phases.The motivation phase asks the learners to predict the outcomes of forces acting upon objects in the real world, while the evolution phase pairs up the learners to solve problems presented in the motivation phase. In the formalization
In the case study, a subjective portion of the note provides a clear picture of the patient’s habitus, complaints, and anamnesis. However, it needs particularization about the last time the patient had unprotected sexual intercourse as it can help indicate the incubation period. The presence of similar skin defects at the patient’s recent sexual partners and the previous existence of similar skin defects on the patient’s skin and mucosae can define the duration of the disease and the episode number. The appearance of spread rash all over the patient’s body can indicate of duration and period of the disease. The intake of any medications, including antibiotics, for the last one month, can affect further diagnostics, tactics, and treatment plans; indicate fixed drug eruption. The patient’s anamnesis lacks gynecological questioning on menstruation details, number of pregnancies and abortions, and pregnancy prophylaxis. It is also significant to specify the patient’s travel history for differential diagnosis of chancroid, lymphogranuloma venereum (LGV), and granuloma inguinale (Afzal, 2020).The objective notes should primarily include physical examination such as palpation of the lymph nodes because one of the significant signs of primary syphilis is regional lymphadenitis, and secondary syphilis manifests with systemic lymphadenopathy. The assessment of the skin and mucosae in the rectal area, periorbital space, mouth mucosa, examination per vaginam is also needed. Multiple chancres can occur if numerous sexual contacts with the contaminated partner during the recipient’s incubation period happened or if numerous locations of bacteria invasion during one sexual act took place. An attentive examination of oral mucosa can indicate
regions of Africa, South-Eastern Asia, South, and Central America and manifests with inguinal and anorectal syndromes (Kand et al., 2019). Granuloma inguinale is caused by Klebsiella granulomatis and is endemical for South Africa, India, South China, and Brasilia, and ulcers tend to slowly enlarge and have raised rolled margins (Afzal, 2020). Behçet disease can also be used for differential diagnosis though it is a rare multisystemic disorder engaging several organs into the pathogenic process. The clinical picture is bright with painful and deep oral and genital ulcers, uveitis, and non-obligatory gastrointestinal, muscle, and joint involvement (Davatchi et al., 2017). Syphilis lesions are rarely painful, have a variety of skin elements, especially in the second period, and primary ulcer has a typic induration in the basement (Kang et al., 2019).
manual. The manual is problem-oriented, purposeful, and persuasive because it addresses precise issues that users might face. For example, it explains how to select the right program for specific types of crockery and food remains, cancel and stop the program, and check the condition of the machine.Even though the text is written without technical terminology, the manual remains professional. This conclusion is based on the fact that in the instruction, one could find answers to a wide range of specific questions. The manual contains instructions on how to use the dishwasher, take care of it, install, dispose of wastes, and what to do in case of a failure. As it has already been mentioned, the examined manual is designed-centered. It contains numerous illustrations, schemes, and bullet points that make it easy to read. What is more, near the paragraphs with warnings, a related sign is inserted. The exclamation point in a red triangle draws the attention of a reader and makes him or her focus on the content of the section. The manual is also logical: the first section is dedicated to the components of the dishwasher; in the second one, the manual tells the audience how to put tableware in it. Afterward, there is information on how to add water softener, salt, and rinse aid. Finally, the manual explains how to take care of the device and how to act in case of a problem.
What is a Mediterranean diet?The Mediterranean diet is perhaps the most popular gastronomy trend of the current decade. The trend has been popular for a long time and continues to gain popularity among food and culinary enthusiasts. Thanks to the COVID-19 pandemic, the Mediterranean diet has gained wider recognition among people from different countries. The trend adopts its name from the traditional cuisine of the four Mediterranean countries: Morocco, Greece, Italy, and Spain (Papadaki et al., 2020). Although the diet is associated with slight variations from the four countries it originated from, almost every Mediterranean diet incorporates fruits, vegetables, nuts, cereals, fish, legumes, and unsaturated fats. The growing trend to adopt healthy eating habits due to the pandemic has led people to embrace the Mediterranean diet due to its simplicity in preparing and the easy availability of ingredients.The menuThe proposed menu incorporates the Mediterranean diet approach by focusing on a two-course meal that will contribute to various nutritional benefits to an individual. Another important consideration of the design is time and satiety. Food preparation does not have to be lengthy, especially if the meal is more straightforward, such as an appetizer. Appetizers are initial courses that should be prepared promptly to give an individual a mouthwatering feel as they wait for the main course.The appetizer selected for the recipe is Cream of Mushroom Soup, while the main course is Boston lobster Mafaldine. Both meals are perfect examples of what a simple Mediterranean diet should look like. The selection suggests that people do not have to spend
too much money eating a healthy meal. However, for the meal to resemble the perfect Mediterranean look, some factors are considered. First, the meals have to be prepared using modern culinary techniques. For the mushroom soup, the mushroom soup is prepared, and then parsley is added through foaming, while Sous Vide cooking is used for cooking the lobster for the Boston Lobster Mafaldine.Cream of Mushroom SoupMushroom Soup ingredients are sourced from locally available grocery store items. The goal is to ensure that the recipe uses easy-to-obtain things to give interested people a straightforward approach to avail the ingredients and get straight into cooking. People do not prefer complex recipes since they use ingredients that are not locally sourced or cost too much if they are available. The ingredients for the appetizer are meant to eradicate this observation and reduce the time and money of people looking to prepare a healthy soup. The ingredients are meant for serving two people and include:  * 100 g diced Cremini mushroom  * 1½ tablespoons unsalted butter  * ½ tablespoon plain flour  * ½ cup of heavy whipped cream  * 3 tbsp chopped parsley  * 1 tbsp dash of black truffle  * Salt to tasteCremini is preferred since it stands between the white button and the portobello mushroom. When used to prepare the soup, it will produce a meal characterized by a brown, firm texture and rich flavor.PreparationMelt butter over medium heat for 3 minutes; add diced mushroom and sauté for 3 minutes. Add
a pinch of salt to the mixture and sauté for 2 minutes until the mushroom has released its juices. Stir plain flour into the mixture and sauté for 3 minutes to remove the taste of plain flour. Add water to the mushroom mixture and bring to a simmer for 8 minutes. Transfer the soup to a blender and puree on moderate speed for 3 minutes until it is smooth and thick. Return soup to pot, add in whipped cream, and stir for 1 minute. Add salt for seasoning. Garnish with parsley foam and serve.Production Flow ChartThe flow chart presents a simpler illustration that shows how the workflow should proceed. It is important to follow the steps highlighted in the flow chart to prevent one from producing the wrong meal with a completely different taste. The time interval within each process is also vital to ensure that the meal being prepared is of the right quantity for the exact serving. In case an individual wants to prepare the dish for over three people, they should calculate the time in relation to the number of needed servings. For instance, since an 8-minute sautéing period is allowed for one hundred grams of Cremini mushroom, this time should be multiplied with every additional gram. If the meal being prepared is for four people, then the time will be 16 minutes. The nutritional value of the appetizer is as follows:  * Calories 76  * Protein 3.4g  * Carbohydrates 5.6g  * Fiber 0.5g  * Fat 3.4g 
* Cholesterol 0.8gModern Culinary Technique: FoamThe culinary foam technique is an approach that traps air bubbles within a structure made from fat, proteins, or water. Foams are part of molecular gastronomy, which involves mixing natural flavors such as fruit juices with natural gels or stabilizers such as lecithin and hand-whipped through a whipped cream canister or immersion in a blender. Examples include foamed coconut, mushroom, and espresso. To create modern foam, the interfacial tension between the air-oil stage and the aqueous stage needs to be reduced through the presence of a surfactant (Ridge, 2019). Whipped cream, marshmallows, cakes, ice cream, soufflés, mousse, and meringue are examples of foods to which the foam technique can be applied. The tiny air bubbles give foams their unique light texture. Many products use protein as the primary surface active agent, helping form and stabilize foam in the gaseous stage. Creating this kind of form employs whipping protein solutions. The existing foaming characteristics determine the likelihood of creating the thin film at the gaseous stage for larger gas bubbles to be stabilized.Sensory Element EvaluationThe defining traits of any meal are the three sensory elements, texture, smell, and taste. After preparing the Cream of Mushroom Soup, an individual is presented with a creamy, fluffy, and moist-textured meal. A creamy texture is essential for improving food intake by making the mouth moist in preparation for the main course. This observation implies that the appetizer plays its role in prepping an individual for the main course. On the other hand, the smell is flavorsome
and aromatic. Being that the soup is the opening course, it should serve all the functions of making an individual want to anticipate the main course. Through the aromatic and flavorsome smell, the soup is able to increase an individual’s appetite. Finally, the taste is savory, sweet, and delectable. When eating, an individual is supposed to enjoy the course, even when waiting for the main course. Additionally, this taste is effective in increasing appetite and helps control protein digestion. This will become essential when the individual is taking the main course.Resource Constraints: Cream of Mushroom SoupOne can face several challenges when preparing the Cream of Mushroom Soup. The first challenge is hurried cooking which can produce unexpected results. Mushroom forms part of the ‘special’ meals that need additional caution during preparation. A slight mistake might lead to the production of the wrong meal. For instance, if one cooks the food too fast, they will prevent excess water from seeping out. If this water is maintained while cooking, there are increased chances of the food bearing a different smell or tasting entirely different. For better results, cook mushrooms low and slow. Second, it is important to use the right amount of water based on the required servings or amount of mushrooms. Water is also an important factor when preparing soup. Exact measurements lie with the chef, but the idea is not to use too much or too little water. While cooking mushrooms, many people may overcrowd the pan to incorporate different ingredients. While this may work in
some cases, it is not always a good idea to overcrowd the pan. Therefore, often locate a large pan before starting to prepare the meal. Finally, the art of making foam may be challenging for some chefs, especially those who have no prior experience in the art. It is important to research to understand how to make foams quickly and effectively.Boston Lobster MafaldineLike the appetizer course, ingredients for the main course are also sourced from locally available items. They include:  * 1000 g of chopped Boston Lobster  * 100 g of Mafaldine Pasta  * A bowl of shredded Brussel sprout  * Salt to tasteAlthough the recipe mentions a whole lobster, the tail will be used to prepare the main course. The tail is preferred due to its richness in protein, fatty acids, minerals, vitamins, and omega-3. Additionally, it allows chefs to prepare food rich in health benefits such as mental health, weight loss, and reducing the risk of cancer and heart disease (Mentella et al., 2019).PreparationPreparing Lobster Mafaldini is also simple as the preparation of the appetizer course. First, lobster meat is cooked Sous Vide at 80F for 30 minutes. This is done to make the meat tender and not chewy. This illustrates the employment of another modern culinary technique with Sous Vide cooking. Next, water is brought to a boil for 8 minutes, and then Mafaldine pasta is added and allowed to boil for 10 to 15 minutes. During this time, the lobster is already ready to be fried. Butter is
melted for one minute, and then the chopped lobster meat is added. The resulting mixture is sautéed for 6 minutes until it is fully cooked. Shredded Brussels sprout is then added to the mixture and sautéed for 2 minutes. The pasta is added and mixed with the mixture. The mixture is allowed to simmer for 2 minutes.Production Flow ChartLike the appetizer, following the main course steps is vital. The same observation applies to time intervals and the step-by-step guideline, as shown in the figure. The Boston Lobster Mafaldine is also rich in nutritional content as follows:  * Calories 489  * Protein 34.5g  * Carbohydrates 66.9g  * Fiber 4.8g  * Fats 2.2g  * Cholesterol 0.001gModern Culinary Technique: Sous VideSous Vide is borrowed from the French vocabulary for “under the vacuum.” In essence, this technique employs a similar “under the vacuum” approach whereby food is put in plastic pouches and then placed in temperature-controlled water baths (López-Alt, 2022). In some instances where restaurants use steam-filled environments to conduct Sous Vide cooking. This technique is used in cooking various foods, although the most common ones include meats, stews, and soup. The approach is employed if chefs ensure that food is evenly cooked inside and outside. The figure shows Lobster tail being cooked in Sous Vide.Sensory Element EvaluationThe texture of the meal is firm and chewy, an important factor that reveals the amount of protein present in the lobster tail. On the other hand, the smell is flavorsome and eggy. Upon mixing, the eggy
smell emerges from the pasta. A flavorsome smell, in this case, helps an individual retain their appetite for a long time during the course. The taste is sweeter and crispy. Another defining characteristic of the lobster tail is its taste. In this case, sweetness is produced from the taste of lean meat, while the crispy emerges from the fiber tendons.Resource Constraints: Boston Lobster MafaldineThe common challenges present when preparing Boston Lobster Mafaldine range from overcrowding, over-seasoning, overlooking the steps, and overcooking. Overcrowding, like the appetizer, is common when preparing lobster Mafaldine pasta. Overcrowding is likely to lead to the production of an unevenly cooked meal and the deprivation of other vital ingredients. To prevent this from happening, it is wise to always use a large pot for preparing lobster. The second challenge is overlooking the steps, as illustrated in the flow chart. There may be instances when an individual thinks that steps are a waste of time and goes ahead and skip one or two. Although people may have their idea of the perfect Boston Lobster Mafaldine, their final versions may differ from the current meal. Steps taken must be chronological to ensure that the final presentation is similar to the one highlighted in the image. Another challenge arises from over-seasoning, where an individual may be carried away by adding more salt to the seasoning water. It is important to get the right sizes before starting to cook. Finally, some chefs are likely to overcook their meals. Overcooking lobster can make t dry and rubbery.Marketing and
Melanoma is generally recognized as one of the cancers that have an increasing cover percentage, though it is usually diagnosed at early stages. Recently, the ways of melanoma treatment for patients with metastatic disease were so limited that many patients were practically doomed. Fortunately, melanoma therapeutics have developed for the past decade because of the use of immune checkpoint inhibitors. Now, people with stages II and III may easily have a long period of remission. Therefore, modern options for melanoma treatment serve as a source of hope for numerous people.Indeed, innovations in the sphere of melanoma treatment are connected with the use of checkpoint inhibitors and the so-called adjuvant therapy. According to recent research, “the use of anti–CTLA-4 and anti-PD1 immune checkpoint inhibitors and combination BRAF/MEK inhibitors for patients with BRAF V600 mutations has significantly extended survival and allowed some patients to remain in durable disease remission off therapy” (Poklepovic & Luke, 2019, p. 1166). This means that the so-called “low-risk” patients with stage IIA through IIC melanoma like Mr. B. from the question may have a long remission after receiving a special course.Still, patients in remission should better keep healthy with adjuvant therapies. A decade ago, such kind of additional treatment was frequently considered of marginal effects for earlier stage melanoma because of interferon-α2b (IFN). It turned out that “the substantial associated toxicity of that interferon and other treatments, such as the anti-CTLA4 antibody ipilimumab” (Jenkins & Fisher, 2021, p. 27). Therefore, it used to be of little trust for many efficient doctors. Moreover, as far as stage II is concerned, the lower incidence of disease progression calls for unprecedented efficacy (Rozeman et al., 2018). However, with time, adjuvant therapies became recognized in the sphere of cancer treatment. The case of Mr. B may be the one where adjuvant therapy could have prevented the biopsy from coming back to stage II melanoma.
Although mentoring is a relatively new term within church circles, it has been practiced widely in Christian communities for years. Across many churches, spiritual coaching, directorship, discipleship, and friendship have been implemented in a mostly unstructured form, necessitating the need to formulate standard skills and methods for mentors for better outcomes. According to Mallison (1998), Christian coaching encompasses the development of disciples and leaders through sound instructions and encouragement, which are founded on God’s will and biblical teachings. The author defines Christian mentoring as “a dynamic, intentional relationship of trust in which one person enables another to maximize the grace of God in their life and service” (Mallison, 1998, p. 8). The author’s predominant theme is that mentorship is not optional if Christians intend to grow and the criticality of taking an interest in the progress of others.Christian-based mentoring integrates various spiritual components, aspects, and the bible as the principal ingredients. By presenting Jesus as the prime mentoring model, Mallison’s (1998) central premise is that Christians should be concerned in the spiritual and personal growth of others since Christianity is relational and collectivist. The author emphasizes the concepts of community and interdependence by describing “a Christian wanting to live in isolation as a pious particle” (Mallison, 1998, p. 34). However, the author’s notable refutation is that despite integrating all the critical ingredients and observing the foundational principles, Christian mentoring is futile if not underlined by a genuine desire to see the mentor advance spiritually.Mentorship and developing an interest in the spiritual and personal growth of others are indispensable if Christians are keen on growing deeper in their spirituality. For instance, Christian fellowships should allocate responsible and dependable persons to mentor new disciples due to their reliability and genuine concern for the mentees’ progress (Mallison, 1998). One of the publication’s key implications is the critical significance of a properly structured and biblically inspired coaching program. This implies that Christian mentorship models should generate disciples and leaders who then would continue propagating the gospel. Notable critiques in the book include the exclusive dependence on the bible as the source of information for analysis. Additionally, there is limited exploration of the relationship of spiritual friends and the spiritual directors with the mentors and the absent views on mentor damage. The author also accentuates his views by drawing comparisons from other works and the extensive integration of biblical insights. A question arising from the publication is how the Christian model of mentoring can remedy destructive coaching.
There are several ways to compare and contrast the Mesopotamian and Ancient Greek civilizations. Socially, the two civilizations were very different; the Greeks were known for their strong sense of democracy, while the Mesopotamians were ruled by kings and queens. Politically, there were also major differences; the Greeks were republics, while the Mesopotamians had empires. Economically, Ancient Greece was known for its many exports, while Mesopotamia was mostly an agricultural society. Culturally, the two civilizations differed in terms of their writing systems and religions. The Greeks used an alphabet that is still in use today, while the Mesopotamians developed a cuneiform script. Therefore, there are eminently social, political, economic, and cultural differences and similarities between Mesopotamian and Ancient Greek.The social differences between the Mesopotamian and Ancient Greek civilizations were vast. Mesopotamia was a very hierarchical society, with a strict caste system in place. There was very little opportunity for social mobility, and the powerful ruled over the masses with an iron fist. Ancient Greece, on the other hand, was much more egalitarian. People were able to move up in status if they were talented or ambitious, and democracy was practiced in many city-states (Adams 35). This resulted in a much more prosperous society overall. Similarly, Ancient Greece was a much more democratic society than Mesopotamia. In Athens, for example, all male citizens had the right to vote and participate in government. Wealthy citizens could not buy their way into office; they had to be elected by their peers. Mesopotamian society was much more stratified; at the
top were the rulers and priests, followed by a small number of wealthy landowners (Adams 43). The vast majority of people were slaves or peasants who worked the land. There was no concept of democracy in Mesopotamia; instead, society was ruled by a small elite group who claimed divine authority.Both Mesopotamian and Ancient Greek civilizations exhibited a great deal of social similarity. For example, both were patriarchal societies in which women had few rights and were largely confined to the home. In addition, both societies placed a high value on warfare and physical prowess and considered martial prowess to be one of the key markers of manhood. There were also some key differences between these two civilizations. One major difference was that the Ancient Greeks were far more egalitarian than the Mesopotamians (Frahm 119). This is evidenced by the fact that in Ancient Greece, women could own property, engage in business, and even participate in politics. Mesopotamian and Ancient Greek civilizations were strikingly similar in terms of their social structures. Both were based on hierarchies in which people were divided into classes according to their wealth, power, and status. However, the two civilizations differed in terms of their religious beliefs. The Mesopotamians believed in a pantheon of gods, while the Ancient Greeks believed in a single god who governed the world.The two civilizations differed in their political structures; Mesopotamia was a theocracy, while Greece was a democracy. Mesopotamia’s theocracy meant that the gods were responsible for guiding the human king in carrying out his responsibilities. In
contrast, Greek democracy placed ultimate power in the hands of all free male citizens (Frahm 117). This resulted in decisions being made through discourse and voting, as opposed to divine guidance. The two civilizations differed in their political structures. Mesopotamia was a theocracy, while Ancient Greece was a republic. In Mesopotamia, the king was considered to be the representative of the gods on Earth. He had absolute power and controlled all aspects of society (Frahm 111). In Ancient Greece, by contrast, citizens had the right to vote and to participate in government. There were also many different city-states, each with its laws and customs. This allowed for a great deal of diversity and debate.Similarly, both cultures were polytheistic, with a pantheon of gods and goddesses who controlled all aspects of human life. They also shared similar architectural styles, with temples and palaces constructed similarly. The most significant similarity between these two cultures is their approach to warfare (Adams 55). Both Mesopotamians and Ancient Greeks believed that a victorious battle could bring great rewards, not only for the victors but for the entire city or nation. This led to highly strategic wars fought by armies of brave soldiers who valued their honor above all else.Mesopotamian and Ancient Greek civilizations were outstandingly similar in their political structures. Both were considered city-states, and each city was ruled by a king who had complete authority within his domain (Frahm 121). Citizens of the city were required to obey the king’s decrees, and disputes between cities were often resolved through warfare.
The major difference between these two civilizations was in their religious beliefs. The Mesopotamians believed in many gods, while the Ancient Greeks only believed in one god, Zeus. This difference led to different attitudes towards warfare – the Mesopotamians fought for religious reasons, while the Ancient Greeks fought for political reasons (to expand or protect their territory). The two civilizations had some political similarities in that they were both led by powerful kings, and their economies were based largely on agriculture (Frahm 115). However, the Mesopotamian civilization was considerably more advanced than the Ancient Greek civilization. For example, the Mesopotamians developed writing, while the Ancient Greeks did not. Additionally, the Mesopotamians had a more complex system of government, with a large number of social classes and a complex legal system.The main economic difference between the Mesopotamian and Ancient Greek civilizations was that the Mesopotamians were a more mercantile society while the Ancient Greeks were more focused on agriculture. The Mesopotamians were merchants who traded goods such as textiles, spices, and metals. They built their economy on the principle of credit and debt, which led to a high level of commercial activity. The Ancient Greeks, on the other hand, were farmers who grew their food (Heriyanto 95). They did not have as strong a trading economy and instead focused on developing their political and artistic cultures. The ancient Mesopotamian and Greek civilizations were two of the most influential in history.Though they share some similarities, there are several key differences between them. Mesopotamia was an early example of
The study of what rhetorical tools public personalities use in their speech can be a beneficial aspect to study. With its help, people can get an understanding of how, when, and where people can use rhetorical components. This work aims to study Michelle Obama’s opening remarks at the White House Convention on Food Marketing to Children. The main message of the First Lady was to draw attention to the suppression of the advertising of unhealthy food to minors. In addition, the main appeals that Obama uses are logic and emotional.The first aspect of rhetoric used in this speech is logic. It implies the justification and reasons for a particular action or event. Michele Obama stated that “between 2008 and 2011, obesity rates among low-income preschoolers dropped in 19 states and territories across the country” (Read Michelle Obama’s Speech on Food Marketing para. 10). Therefore, Obama provides a justification of how important it is for television changes to encourage a proper lifestyle among the younger generation.The next valuable component of rhetoric in the studied speech of the first lady is the emotional aspect. Thus, Obama emphasizes that “while we have made important progress, when one in three kids is still on track to develop diabetes, and when the diet has now surpassed smoking” (Read Michelle Obama’s Speech on Food Marketing para. 11). In this case, Michele Obama points to the positive results already achieved while also highlighting that children are still at risk.In conclusion, this work was engaged in analyzing Michelle Obama’s speech on the topic of the harm of the media for introducing the younger generation to healthy habits. To better convey the main idea, the first lady used such components of rhetoric as logic and emotion. They helped to better form and give important information, gave the speech solidity, and improved the audience’s ability to persuade.
Microsoft Power BI overviewData visualization enables the transformation of abstract measurable data into a visual representation in the form of tables, charts, graphs, and matrices (Bhargava et al. 1; Qin et al. 2). Microsoft Power BI is an intriguing data visualization tool (Bansal and Upadhyay 14; Hadhoud and Walid 5). Power BI consists of various components that are available on the market separately and can be purchased and used independently, such as Power BI Desktop, Power BI Embedded, Power BI Gateway, and Power BI Mobile Apps.When it was first soldIn 2010, Microsoft came up with the concept for this tool. In July 2011, it was made publicly available for download under the name “Project Crescent.” It took three months for the Office 365 add-in to be published under the new Power BI brand (Senter 44). After that, Power Pivot, Power Query, and Power View were thereafter exclusively accessible as Microsoft Excel add-ins (Becker and Gould 185). Power BI Gateway was integrated with various features, such as enterprise-level data connectors and security settings. Power BI was then released for sale with all its current full-fledged features for the first time on July 24, 2015. Today, Power BI remains a popular data visualization tool.Main customersFirms in the professional services sector are the largest customer group (16.3%), followed by the manufacturing sector (13.2%), the financial services sector (8.6%), and the healthcare sector (7.1%).

Life on its own is a complex notion that includes many stages, aspects, and problems. As a person passes subsequent stages of development, previous issues become less important, leaving room for new matters and concerns. In this regard, a mid-life crisis is a serious occurrence affecting most people who reach this point in life. As can be inferred from its name, this crisis emerges at an approximate middle point of an average lifespan when youth is in the past and the second half of life is approaching. At this stage, an individual is likely to reflect upon their past experiences and question their previous choices. Once enjoyable activities begin to lose their importance, and the future prospect may appear daunting. In pursuit of the elusive youth, people experiencing a mid-life crisis tend to make questionable decisions. Furthermore, their personal philosophy moves further away from materialistic matters as they reflect and discuss more sophisticated ideas. This paper reviews Leo Tolstoy’s My Confession as an illustration of the inner struggle experienced by a man in his mid-life crisis. While his faith-based solutions meet these needs, it is not and cannot be limited to the Christian religion.Tolstoy wrote My Confession when he was of an age that is currently perceived as “middle”. In this short essay, the famous Russian author reflects upon his literary career and life experiences as he becomes older. By that point, he had already attained great success as a master of literature, having published several prominent pieces. However, as he overtly admits, most of this
work served to make a living for him and his family. In other words, Tolstoy’s literary pursuit relied on materialistic motivation in terms of earning money and status. In addition, his career was a sufficient distraction from having to seek meaning in life. Authorship occupied a considerable portion of Tolstoy’s time, leaving little or no room for contemplating more sophisticated matters. Furthermore, amid the age when religion was of major significance for Europe, Tolstoy, as an author, remained loyal to facts and science. Ultimately, the author faced an imminent crisis of meaning at the figurative middle point in life.This crisis experienced by Tolstoy originated from his concentration on literature throughout most of his existence. In My Confession, it shortly becomes clear that authorship was neither a passion nor a destiny for Tolstoy. Instead, he openly refers to it as a “waste of time”, admitting that he continued on this path merely for materialistic reasons (Tolstoy, 2018, p. 7). In other words, he wrote to be famous and wealthy and ultimately accomplished this objective. Nevertheless, as Tolstoy passed the middle point of his life, materialistic wealth had not ensured his full satisfaction. He earned his money and his name became well-known both in Russia and abroad. However, he began to consider the futility of this pursuit and the overarching purposes of his authorship. Having attained material satisfaction, he found his spiritual needs unmet. Thus, Tolstoy encountered a mid-life crisis of meaning, knowing what he accomplished but questioning whether it was worth it.This way, the famous author found
his previous satisfaction temporary and even futile. Tolstoy reflected upon his feelings and experiences, ultimately deciding that his life lacked a spiritual component. While seeking an effective solution to the crisis, he remembered that his previous steps were dictated by rational knowledge. Tolstoy (2018) inferred that this knowledge provided him with facts but failed to ensure the meaning of life. Therefore, he sought answers in the so-called irrational area, which is faith. Tolstoy accepted the tenets of Christianity, considering the central concepts and of religion on a more profound level. He became convinced that science and logic do not suffice to fathom life’s intricate, complex, and multi-faceted nature and its meaning. Consequently, Tolstoy expected religion to bring him closer to the true purpose of life, which was no longer limited to material goods.In other words, Leo Tolstoy took a strictly theistic stance on this philosophical matter. For him, the answer to the meaning of life lay in God’s realm and the teachings of Christian philosophers. Evidently, as a free, educated person, he had the right to choose this path toward understanding the meaning of life. However, the ultimate presentation of theistic values as the absolute source of truth, meaning, and fulfillment does not align with the pluralism of opinion valued by society. For example, an atheistic opponent could reasonably argue that, unlike science and facts refuted by Tolstoy, faith is not substantiated by solid evidence. Therefore, this could be an instance of wishful thinking that does not provide true meaning to life. Instead, its overall uncertainty
Globalization has indeed become a significant pattern in the development of geopolitical and cultural practices of recent decades. With the advent of the Internet, people have become connected, even across continents: such a powerful catalyst could not fail to have a necessary consequence. In particular, people from different countries and cultures have become more integrated into a common, emerging culture in which there is room for the traditions of all peoples. Meanwhile, the representation of different cultures in this common one is unequal, which means that stronger national cultures can absorb weaker ones.A natural reaction to the unification of people was the growth of nationalistic sentiments among peoples whose cultures tend to be weaker. Thus, the spread of American sentiment (and especially the American dream) to the world often results in people from other regions becoming indifferent to their culture. In addition, globalization can lead to the destruction of the sovereignty of vulnerable communities: for example, if the big powers (the United States, China, Russia, Britain) suppress the development of small neighboring ones (Hawaii, Hong Kong, Abkhazia, or former British colonies). Healthy nationalism is not a problem because communities desire to protect themselves and preserve their cultural and political independence. However, radical, violent actions on the part of nationalists lead to international conflicts and inhibit globalization.Thus, globalization should not be evaluated regarding whether it is good or bad. Instead, it should be seen as a natural milestone in the evolution of humanity. Globalization does have advantages and disadvantages, but it is a fact in and of itself. The world now finds itself incredibly integrated, as every individual can learn news from another continent, listen to foreign music, and read non-domestic literature in a matter of minutes. This results in a new, shared culture. In this state, radical nationalism is a serious problem that society and governments must confront.
There is no simple answer to what it means to be human. Some might say that being human means being independent and controlling their personal lives. For other people, being human means utilizing the refinements of civilization, wearing clothes, and going to work every day, i.e., doing everything that animals cannot do. It is also complicated to say how people want to live because everyone has unique requirements, dreams, and thoughts on this issue. This essay reflects on the On Being podcast and answers the above questions.In the podcast, Thich Nhat Hanh explains why people need to be human. According to him, “we have to remain human to be able to understand and to be compassionate” (Onbeing.org 30:53 – 30:58). The monk adds that being human means having a right to make mistakes, but the absence of a “right to continue making mistakes” (Onbeing.org 31:15 – 31:20). Therefore, being human means being mindful, responsible, and open-hearted. In other words, being human is about being humane. People live in a world of violence and terror and cannot even talk to each other effectively (Onbeing.org). Consequently, they fail to understand which way of living is genuine. From the words of Thich Nhat Hanh, it could be inferred that people want to live without anger; they want to live mindfully and be in control of their emotions. Nonetheless, an average modern person could hardly achieve this way of living.Overall, the podcast is immensely inspiring since it is dedicated to being human, problems people face in the modern mad world, and ways to avoid them. The Buddhist monk Thich Nhat Hanh creates an impression of a conscious person whose ideas should be taken seriously. Even though I do not share the Buddhist worldview, I deeply admire the personality of Thich Nhat Hanh since he inspired me to learn more about mindfulness practices.
Modern parenthood is complex and sometimes unbalanced, and the consequences of it are anxious, at least because modern children growing up in those families obtain less care and adopt negative behavioral patterns. Unstable families produce instability, and children inherit it, creating more instability in the next generations. In times of change, it is crucial to understand those changes and be ready to react to overcome numerous challenges.Family instability conception refers to situations in marriages and relationships that change quickly. This concept was initially developed in the 1990s and considered children undergoing this instability (Cavanagh & Fomby, 2019). It studies children’s responses to the different stressors connected with those changes: divorces, remarriages, cohabitations without marriage, etcetera. Children undergo stress from parents’ negative feelings, from breaking up with schools and friends that usually follow the divorce, from living in incomplete families, and obtaining less care and family warmth. In that way, drastic changes lead to instability, and instability leads to stress.A high divorce rate is one of the main reasons for family instability: incomplete families tend to be unbalanced for different reasons. For example, it is much harder to maintain a work-life balance in such a family due to a constant lack of time. Due to high divorce rates and high marriage age on average, more and more children are in the situation when they live in an incomplete family. Divorce rates in the United States have risen slowly last decades, and for now, they have reached more than 40% of all marriages (Smock & Schwartz, 2020). Children
with their children is growing up (2013). Due to changes in gender roles, fathers spend much more time with children and doing housework: this time almost doubles from the 1960s (Parker & Wang, 2013). Maintaining a work-life balance is crucial, but it is more challenging due to those changes, both for men and women; people should adapt to new roles and conditions.In general, gender roles have become much less distinct, and traditional images of a working man and a housewife woman are vaguer now. The traditional family structure has changed. The percentage of working women has risen drastically compared with the 1960s (Parker & Wang, 2013). At the same time, the amount of time fathers spend with their children has increased more than twice compared to the 1960s. In general, working full-time for women and doing all housework for men is not unusual now. Such changes in gender roles bring even more chaos and instability to the situation with families.Instability in modern families produces challenges for parents and children: parents should maintain a work-life balance, and both parents and children should be more adaptable to live well. Chaos with gender roles has changed the familiar way of life, making people feel confused. Families tend to form and dissolve much quicker than before, and marriage is not mandatory for modern families. The abilities to maintain a work-life balance, react quickly, and be ready to change are crucial to living well in this time of constant change.
new business models, consumer protection, price transparency, hypercompetition, and environmental awareness, however, the primary ones are flexibility and technologies. In other words, companies cannot implement only one strategy for stable growth and development and should use all technological advantages to outperform competitors.Thus, those companies that are flexible, apply various approaches, and see opportunities may succeed even in tough economic conditions. For instance, NVIDIA, a multinational technology company that designs graphics processing and chip units for professional markets, gaming, and mobile computing, performs excellently regardless of the COVID-19 recession. The company has taken advantage of a global lockdown and people’s self-isolation focusing on remote computing services and video gaming. For instance, approximately seven million Nintendo gaming consoles with NVIDIA’s chips were sold in the third quarter of 2020 (Fitch, 2020). This case demonstrates that in the current competitive landscape, those companies who may rapidly adapt to any conditions will be able to stay productive and highly demanded.
“The Passing of Traditional Societies” is based on empirical material obtained from fieldwork and interviews conducted over a decade in Turkey, Lebanon, Syria, Egypt, Jordan, and Iran. Lerner proceeded from the fact that in the process of modernization, all societies move in the same direction, which was set by the Western countries that had completed modernization earlier. However, this “Western model,” according to Lerner, is, in fact, global. It acquired its name only due to a historical confluence of circumstances. Countries of the North Atlantic were the first to carry out the processes of secularization, urbanization, and industrialization. Analyzing the modernization of lifestyles based on empirical material, Lerner pays the most attention to the growth of population mobility, the spread of literacy, and the mass media.For example, Lerner dwelled on the problem of restrictions for modernization. Among the most critical factors hindering development, he attributed ethnocentrism. Lerner states, “From the West came the stimuli which undermined traditional society in the Middle East; for the reconstruction of a modern society that will operate efficiently” (Lerner 47). The author contrasts societies, at the same time declaring that the focus on cultural identity impedes progress.I believe that this concept of modernization designed to solve the problems of transition from “backwardness” to “modernity” was a specific product of the era after the Second World War. Built on numerous simplifications, the modernization theory interprets the historical process as one-line and non-alternative (Dunmire 23). The paradigm proposed by Lerner does not explain the development principles of many countries, such as China, Russia, or Cuba, and therefore loses its relevance in modern days.
The clothing industry is amongst the many monopolistically competitive industries. There are many clothing firms in the industry competing against each other while producing similar products. However, the firms in the industry earn competitive advantages by distinguishing their products through branding and advertisements (Davis and Özgür, 4). Product differentiation is one of the strategies commonly used by monopolistic competitive firms. Product differentiation in a clothing firm can involve designs, the quality of materials used, and the prices charged for the clothes. In advertisements, differentiation is put in physical aspects such as color, designs, elastic, and different sizes (Davis and Özgür, 7). Intangible aspects included in the clothing advertisement can be guaranteed money back, high quality, free delivery, and long-lasting usage.Steel manufacturing is an example of an oligopolistic competitive industry. In such a market, a few steel manufacturing companies rule over other firms. The few firms are the price and trendsetters for other small companies and often form a partnership to operate successfully (Ritz 185). To distinguish themselves from their competitors, they improve their product quality, hike or lower prices, and advertise the special features of their products. In an oligopolistic market, if a leading company lowers prices, the others do not follow but rather improve their products to remain in the higher cuts of prices (Ritz 187). The few leading companies also stay competitive in the industry by setting their standards high to prevent easy entry into the industry. The firms set high standards by producing the highest quality products, selling them at a higher price, and producing them in high quantities (Ritz 189). That way, they ensure that the small or new companies fear the competition at the top thus ensuring reduced entry to the industry.
seems to be more truthful.Several arguments can be made concerning moral relativism that reflect a dubious nature. Firstly, while many of the arguments that insist on supporting relativism may seem compelling, they all have a logical contradiction in that they all return the correct moral schema that all people should follow, which constitutes moral universalism. Secondly, relativists may argue that different cultures have different values and that morality is relative to different people. However, these arguments explain people’s actions in terms of absolute standards, so it converges back to moral universalism.Moral universalism presupposes the existence of an ethical system that effectively regulates the behavior of members of any community, regardless of culture, race, gender, religion, nationality, sexual orientation, or any other distinguishing features. The simplest justification for this point of view is the obvious observation that in all known moral codes that have proven their viability, there is a common core: respect for life, health, property, and personal dignity. Moral universalism seems to be the more truthful theory. Firstly, moral relativism is built on exceptions, not on general rules. All people approach morality from human nature, which explains approximately the same moral and ethical codes of all countries and peoples. Moral norms are considered basic everywhere, for example, the prohibition of murder. Secondly, if everyone had their own morality and ethics, as moral relativism suggests, it would be impossible to regulate human relations.
Das’ character development. as a result, he never grows throughout the novel, remaining in the same infant state of blissful ignorance. Thus, his intentionally turning a blind eye to the unhappiness of his family members makes him not as sympathetic as he might have seemed at first.Failing miserably to notice the presence of alienation between him and his wife, as well as his children, Mr. Das elicits emotions that gradually deny the reader the expected empathy and, instead, see him as desperately flawed. Even though the problems in Mr. Das’ perception of his marriage and his children are quite understandable, humanizing him and making him relatable, his inability, or unwillingness, to recognize the problem and tackle it leads to the reader’s bitter disappointment. Thus, with his complexity and contradictory nature, Mr. Das and his character arc teach the reader an important lesson about the need for introspection and acknowledging reality.
The article represents an overview of other literature on methodologies and criteria used in supplier evaluation and selection process, which is believed to be one of the vital components of a successful operation of a manufacturing company. In particular, the paper emphasized the industry’s change in this field – from focusing primarily on operational efficiency to embracing the potential of strategic partnerships. The article claims that the right approach to supplier assessment, thus, is the key to a company’s development and progress.The paper starts with various ways to address the issues related to MCDM of suppliers’ selection. The most common ones are stated to be mathematical models, Simple multi-attribute rating technique (SMART), analytic network process (ANP), analytic hierarchy process (AHP), data envelopment analysis (DEA), linear programming, and some others. For example, DEA is a methodology focused on a supplier system and classifies it either as efficient or inefficient based on selecting particular criteria. Mathematical programming models usually incorporate complex evaluations between suppliers, allowing one to compare them and identify the most optimal in terms of cost and other criteria.The article further compares all methodologies by their popularity expressed in the frequency of mentions in the literature. Thus, DEA is the most common approach with 30% mentions, whereas mathematical programming (17%), AHP (15%), and case-based reasoning account for fewer mentions. However, those methodologies represent the largest share of all MCDM approaches.The article highlights the significance of knowing this distribution, which can build an idea of the most prominent ways to address the issues with suppliers’ assessment and selection. It is also stated that suppliers should be evaluated based on “the inputs of the strategic, functional and operational levels” (Agarwal et al., 2011). Methodologies such as DEA, mathematical programming, or AHP are advised to be used for identifying the most optimal suppliers, whereas AHP is noted to be effective in providing consistency.
Rome did push some values and requirements upon the regions it conquered, for the most part, the people could live their lives, worship their respective religions, follow their respective traditions, and even maintain their own laws and taxation (Brooks, 2019). Rome by far was one of the most multicultural states in the ancient world that greatly respected the civilizations of others.The primary culture that strongly influenced the Roman culture is likely Ancient Greece. The Hellenistic society led the basis to much what is Roman, ranging from architecture to art to philosophy and politics. The Romans greatly respected the Greeks for their progress and intelligence, and sought to build upon that foundation in the prosperity of their empire including in the aspects of science, literature, law, economics, and even military tactics. Furthermore, the Romans were influenced by the Etruscans, a neighboring tribe to the northwest of Rome, who were allied with and then conquering the newly formed city-state. Etruscans were heavy traders with the Greeks, and had a similarly loose empire of city states, sharing many of the cultural elements. Essentially, the Etruscans allowed for the Greek culture to transition into Rome (Brooks, 2019). However, Rome was influenced by the Etruscans in its early days by contributing to its military capabilities and war-oriented, expansionist society.
A live classical music concert, which will be discussed in the paper, is the Millennium Stage by Apollo Orchestra. The orchestra joins forces with renowned opera stars and international instrumental soloists for an annual series of free concerts. The performance was held on March 5, 2020, and I attended on the same day. It brought me unforgettable memories, enough to be reflected in the corresponding essay.The performance was filled with music by many composers who contributed to the development of classical music. The concert begins with a work by Ottorino Respighi, an Italian composer who studied at the Bologna Lyceum, and then with Nikolai Rimsky-Korsakov in St. Petersburg, where he was the first violist in the Opera Orchestra ( Ottorino Respighi ). His active training throughout his life endowed the composer’s works with a unique orchestral flavor. The concert ends with a piece by Ludwig van Beethoven, known to the general public for his heroic struggle with the onset of deafness when some of his most important works were written ( Ludwig van Beethoven ). The musical compositions of these authors formed the basis for a concert that touched the heart and soul of every listener in the hall.The set of instruments was typical for conducting an orchestral concert. The professional orchestra group was endowed mainly with string instruments: the cello, double bass, violin, viola, and harp. As the largest group on stage, the string family accounted for more than half of the total number of performers. They were also accompanied by wind instruments, which sit
together in the middle of the orchestra, percussion, and piano. Together, they created a holistic and harmonious sound with each new composition played at the concert.The orchestra concert was attended by eminent composers of our time, contributing to the development of musical culture. For example, international pianist Peter Orth was acclaimed as a special guest artist and soloist for the concert. His career in the American mainstream began after the first prize at the International Piano Competition in Naumburg in 1979, held in memory of William Capell (Peter Orth, Piano). He was awarded numerous awards in America and Europe, bringing him worldwide fame in the music community. Claudia Chudacoff as a visiting concertmaster and associate conductor Jeffrey Newberger, conducted the opening piece, setting the mood till the end of the concert. The other members of the orchestra also coped with their work perfectly and provided the audience with an evening of high-quality and sensual music.The concert starts with Ottorino Respighi’s Botticelli Triptych, which is the memory of three famous paintings by Sandro Botticelli. The piece is followed by Beethoven’s early masterpieces, Concerto No. 3 and C Minor Concerto, which became an excellent end to the evening. Despite the variety of works and composers who lived and worked in different eras, the combination of their music sounded harmonious and unusual to an unaccustomed ear. All the music played during the performance belongs to the genre of an orchestral concert, although it affects differently due to differences in musical moods. The lightness of the first piece and the
one mood to another. The feelings I had towards the end of the performance may be described as excited and joyful because of the corresponding brutality. The music maintained a course for a constant change of moods until the end and caused a storm of emotions with its bright ending.The orchestra’s melody may be defined as undulating since the filling of the jumps occurred with a gradual movement either up or down, which made it possible to achieve an easy and natural development of the composition. The major triad of the first passage was replaced by a minor triad, shimmering from joy to calmness, from admiration to sadness. The polyphonic warehouse made it possible to highlight several main themes at once during the concert. The high register of the whole concert did not stop even in the last notes, allowing to simplify and facilitate the figurative series.Thus, the Millennium Stage by Apollo Orchestra gave me a lot of unforgettable emotions and can be recommended by me for listening as an interesting and exciting experience. The skillful musicians who took part in the concert were one of the main factors in its success. The selected compositions, representing an uncomplicated mood change, also served as the basis for obtaining positive emotions.
of tractors. The bull became the emblem of the brand, as the bull is the sacred animal of Zeus. According to some people, this animal is extremely hardy and strong, which endows the brand with great power. Now, Lamborghini cars are high-performance, expensive supercars, and the emblem of the golden bull is very appropriate for them.I prefer the myth of Prometheus because evil never prevails, and goodness and justice win. The mighty titan Prometheus stole the sacred fire from Olympus to provide it for humankind. He made humanity independent of the gods. Prometheus trained people to write, count, crafts and introduced them to metals. Before, people were afraid of the elements of the sea, but now the titan taught them how to build ships; humans became proficient in the art of medicine (Travis, 2021). Prometheus was destroying people’s faith in the deity, and for this, the thunderer Zeus decided to punish him. Prometheus was chained to a rock, the sunburned him mercilessly, and the rain was pounding him. However, this was not the end of the titan’s torment; a giant eagle sat on Prometheus’s chest every day and tore his liver (Travis, 2021). Heracles, the strongest men, killed the eagle that tortured Prometheus, broke Prometheus’ chains, and the titan was free.
Chapter 5 of the book talks about the condition of native women in the times of the colonial conquest of the Americas. The invasion of South and North America by the Europeans involved many males coming into contact with the local egalitarian societies. The Algonquian tribes experienced considerable changes in their established social and economic order (Hughes & Hughes, 1997). Before the invasion, the men and women of the tribe equally divided their work and responsibilities. Yet, after the conquest, the men’s work, which was hunting for large game, became more in demand among the Europeans. Moreover, the trade between the tribe and the invaders made some of the women’s work irrelevant, for instance, the creation of certain items which were now replaced by European ones. The Catholic Jesuits who came to spread Christianity also encouraged the establishment of a patriarchal society and primarily baptized tribal men. Many women opposed conversion to Christianity, but their husbands, brothers, and fathers beat them for their defiance of God.In New Mexico, where the slave trade was the primary source of wealth for the Spanish, Many Indian women were made slaves and used as property without any rights or freedoms. In Barbados, black female slaves were forced to work in fields and were also subject to different types of exportation, including physical, sexual, and emotional ones. In New Spain, the Spanish conquerors established their cultural norms and rules for women, which implied that females had to be sexually pure and practice discretion. As a result, the Spanish often raped and
highest status, while the concubines were mostly slave women. The Bakongo tribe in Kongo had a particular social order where women could be given the status of wife or sister. Wives were young women who were able to bear children, yet after the end of their reproductive period, many of them became sisters. The concept of sisterhood implied autonomy and active participation in family matters. Yet, slave women only could have the status of a wife and be denied any autonomy.The chapter also talks about queen Njinga, a woman who fought the Portuguese in Kongo after the death of her brother. The most important part of Njinga’s story was that to justify her legitimacy as queen, she became a man. As a noblewoman, she had the right to have several husbands, and she ordered all of them to dress in female clothes. Njinga became a successful ruler, led her army in battles, and repelled the attacks of the Portuguese. The chapter also provides information about Eur-African women who were born to European fathers and African mothers. Such women had a marginal status in African societies because they were not recognized by the natives as their family. Thus, Eur-African women, including Betsy Heard, leaned towards their fathers, who provided them with European education. The Eur-African women married other Europeans and thus accumulated resources and status, allowing them to act as intermediaries in the slave trade.
McDonald’s filed a lawsuit in the United States against its former CEO, Steve Easterbrook, after it was revealed that he had several consensual sexual encounters with workers in the year before his leave and maintained them hidden. Easterbrook misled authorities and threw away proof of his wrongdoing; he prioritized his interests over McDonald’s. Shareholders have filed a lawsuit against the corporation for attempting to prevent misbehavior and prioritizing speed over accuracy in resolving the issue. Negligent recruitment and retention responsibility are widely used to describe an employer’s commitment not to recruit or keep a worker (Monteiro et al., 2019). The supervisor was aware of or should have been aware of the likelihood of engaging in behavior against other persons or otherwise subjecting workers or third parties to legal responsibility. Companies can be held accountable for their workers’ intentional misbehavior (dos Santos et al., 2017). This work is written to study the case of negligence at work since negligence is the most common type of tort.If a McDonald’s fails to vet a worker before hiring them thoroughly and they cause harm to others, the corporation may be held accountable for their conduct. A McDonald’s, for instance, should examine all prior work, certification qualifications, and current professional associations before hiring an executive chef (Rushchenko et al., 2020). If the chef commits frequent culinary errors that cause health concerns for diners, the popular fast food restaurant is likely to be held accountable since it failed to do a basic employment background check. This is one of the reasons why criminal history checks are required. If a person strikes colleagues and consumers and can demonstrate that a criminal history check revealed past violent conduct, the business may be held liable. Assume an employer knows an employee’s risky, unpredictable, or disrespectful behavior but does not fire the worker. In that instance, McDonald’s might be held accountable for ensuring the safety of others.
A commercial business operates by increasing or maintaining profits. However, one of the agency costs is the excessive pre-requestive. This expense allows the contractor to get more, but does not affect the well-being of investors. Shirking of the company’s top management also creates agency costs, as it reduces the productivity of management and creates additional costs for the founders. Therefore, the earnings of other employees may decrease in this regard. In such a situation, a business must consider the ethics of its behavior.Corporate business requires companies to take full responsibility for how the achievement of their goals affects the world around them. Consumers, investors and employees of companies are aware of the possibilities of modern corporations (Bansal et al., 2021). In this regard, it is necessary to direct them not only to making a profit, but also to improving the life of society as a whole and developing human capital responsibility. The enterprise is obliged to carry out actions aimed at improving the condition of society, and not at its deterioration (Hoffman, 2018). The implementation of corporate social responsibility of the organization also includes responsibility to employees: the provision of an additional social package, which includes the formation of a pension system, medical insurance and recreation.The ethical attitude includes the sensational case of Wells Fargo, one of the largest US banking holdings. In 2016, about 2 million credit cards issued without the knowledge of customers were discovered, the bank was fined $ 185 million, and the management fired about 1,000 employees. Investors were dissatisfied with the
of forest plantations to absorb carbon from the Earth’s atmosphere. Proper management and professional tree care increase the amount of recycled substances on Nike plantations by 30%. At the same, the revenue of the company kept on almost the same level as during the previous years due to increasing costs. However, the business maintained a reputation in the eyes of its customers.In conclusion, currently, many companies pay considerable attention to compliance with the principles of corporate social responsibility. This is based on the fact that it is the observance of the principles of social responsibility that allows enterprises to improve their performance, both economic and social performance. On the one hand, corporate social responsibility is seen as an essential element of the competition strategy. On the other hand, corporate social responsibility is a consequence of the ethical behavior of an organization in the market, which is associated with the attitude towards the subjects of the external and internal environment or with an approach that takes into account three main areas (ecology, economics, sociology) as a factor of sustainable development.
Negro spirituals are songs composed by Africans who were abducted and transported to the United States to be sold into slavery. While they were stripped of their languages, families, and culture, their masters could not take away their musical characteristics. A negro spiritual known as Ring Shout uniquely expresses African Christianity. Ring Shout is characterized by hand clapping, footsteps, and other percussion accompanying the lush orchestral singing of the leader and chorus in this folk spiritual. It has a highly stylized religious dance in which participants dance in counter-clockwise circuits (blackhistorywalks 6:24). In the United States, the term “spiritual” is most closely connected with the racial oppression of African Americans. In terms of traditional music, the African American spiritual, also referred to as the Negro Spiritual, is among the most significant and most prominent cultural practices (blackhistorywalks).A few well-known spirituals are Wallis Willis’ Swing low, dear chariot, and Deep down my heart . (African American Spirituals). The word “spiritual” comes from a King James Bible conversion of Ephesians 5:19: “Speaking to yourself in psalms and hymns and spiritual songs and singing and making melody in your hearts to the Lord.” (African American Spirituals). African slaves held “praise houses” and outdoor assemblies titled bush or camp meetings, and brush arbor meetings where they met informally to discuss their conditions of slavery (African American Spirituals). There were ecstatic trances at the gatherings where people would sing, chant and dance.Enslaved Africans sang about their plight to the American slave lords through the spiritual hymns (blackhistorywalks 5:34). Slave lords let
When it comes to people I find most fascinating and interesting, Neil deGrasse Tyson is one of them. This man is a famous astrophysicist and planetary scientist who shares his opinions and knowledge on various platforms. Personally, I find the pieces of information he provides mind-opening and shocking at times. I believe that this person knows a lot of controversial information and has various opinions on such matters, which would be pretty interesting to know.Neil deGrasse Tyson was born in 1958 and received several degrees from various universities, including Harvard, the University of Texas at Austin, and Columbia University (Tyson). Additionally, in early 2000, he was appointed by the president to serve on the Commission on the Future of the United States Aerospace Industry (Culp). I am a person who has always been fond of the vast and mysterious cosmos. I have watched a lot of documentaries that shed light on the peculiarities of universes, galaxies, and planets. Among those documentaries was Cosmos: A Spacetime Odyssey, narrated by Neil deGrasse Tyson.I believe that the knowledge of this astrophysicist stretches far beyond the information narrated in the documentary. If I had a chance to talk to this person, I would definitely ask him questions about extraterrestrial life. I have always found it perplexing that our planet is the only planet that has life, and I wonder if Tyson has any theories on this matter. I would also like to ask him whether he knows about any classified information at NASA.Hence, Neil deGrasse Tyson is one of the fascinating people to me. His knowledge and experience inspire me, and I would love to have a chance to talk to him in real life. From this experience, I would like to gain new perceptions and theories on the cosmos and information about outer space, something not commonly discussed. I think this person has more information and opinions to share.
From a personal perspective, Disney+ has all opportunities to unseat Netflix as the leader in video streaming. First of all, the contemporary development of the streaming service industry presupposes the attraction of customers through the brand’s reputation, quality of content, and consumer targeting. In relation to these aspects, The Walt Disney Company has several considerable advantages. It is a well-known international corporation with history and millions of lovers all over the world. It operates across four business units: media networks, studio entertainment, direct-to-consumer and international products, experiences, and parks.At the same time, in relation to streaming, Disney+ surpasses other companies and stands apart from them being an optimal solution in its industry as it provides a combination of modernity and classics, creating an unprecedentedly high quality of entertainment (Agnihotri & Bhattacharya, 2022). In other words, this platform offers a wide range of exclusive content, from timeless classical movies to the latest releases, with a combination of accessibility and options provided by digital media technologies. In addition, with operation in all four quadrants, Disney+ aims to target literally all population groups covering all major audience demographics. In contrast with Netflix, Disney+ releases more kids and family-friendly content. At the same time, Marvel’s superhero blockbusters and Star Wars-based series also attract and unite people from various backgrounds. In combination with a cost-efficient subscription, the platform’s materials make it highly desirable for consumers who prefer the most convenient type of entertainment for all family members.It goes without saying that Hastings and his team should consider the experience and competitive
will enter the streaming service space. In general, their strategies will presuppose the availability of predominantly exclusive content and comfortable conditions in relation to prices – thus, every platform will finally have its audience. In this case, Netflix should remain one of the players in the market and follow its strategies by producing and promoting its content. At the same time, it may try new approaches to generate its competitive advantages and unique values.I think that with the development of technologies and digital media, the popularity of traditional media is inevitably decreasing. Netflix was a pioneer in the sphere of streaming services, and its dominance was obvious. It goes without saying that the production of content by traditional media companies will still be in demand; however, if they want to catch Netflix and attract a wider audience, they should enter the streaming service market as well with their unique benefits or generate other customer values.First of all, the success of video streaming is determined by the variety of content and its accessibility. In other words, people are attached to streaming services for the opportunity to choose from big collections of audiovisual materials suitable for all demographic groups and watch them from various devices at a relatively small price at any time and in any place or without even leaving home. Other advantages of video streaming include the simplicity of use and user-friendliness, the availability to control playback and record content, and the accessibility of live events.

Differentiation Regulation. 6. Therapeutic Approaches. 7. Discussion. 8. Conclusion.Literature ReviewPart 1The preliminary research suggests that there is a complex system of regulatory steps that involve GABA signaling. There is an array of signaling molecules involved in the ventricular-subventricular zone (V-SVZ) neurogenesis, such as Sonic hedgehog, fibroblast growth factor 2, glutamate, and others. The subgranular zone (SGZ) is another important germinal region of the adult human brain, and the mechanisms of regulations are comparatively different between V-SVZ and SGZ.Part 2For example, a key source of the proposal states that “V-SVZ NSCs are regulated by local signals from their immediate neighbors, as well as by neurotransmitters and factors that are secreted by distant neurons, the choroid plexus, and vasculature” (Obernier & Alvarez-Buylla, 2019, p. 1). In other words, distantly located cells secrete a wide range of signaling molecules to regulate the neural stem cell generation, differentiation, and regeneration processes.Schedule for the Completion of Tasks
The two American regions to be first settled by the English colonists were New England and the Chesapeake Bay. In the Chesapeake Bay, the colonists arrived under the auspices of Virginia Company – a joint-stock enterprise dedicated to colonizing America for profit. Although the early hopes of finding precious metals did not materialize, the region eventually found its economic specialization in growing tobacco (Corbett et al., 2022). The company hired the English poor for the labor-intensive task of growing the colony and producing tobacco, and most of the newcomers were young single males (Corbett et al., 2022). Conversely, the New England colonies followed a different settlement pattern. Unlike the Chesapeake Bay, they were shaped not by the pursuit of profit but by the desire to escape persecution and perceived moral decadence of England and create a virtuous society (Corbett et al., 2022). New Englanders came to America as entire families and, unlike the Chesapeake Bay colonists, established a largely self-sustaining economy of farms, hamlets, and commercial enterprises rather than cash crop plantations (Corbett et al., 2022). Such were the differences in settlement patterns and shaping forces between the two.Religion played a considerable role in both regions, although in the shape of different denominations. The founders of New England colonies established their settlements with an explicitly religious purpose of creating a perfect Protestant community, which was the case in Massachusetts, Rhode Island, and other colonies as well (Corbett et al., 2022). Interestingly enough, although the Chesapeake Bay colonies were business enterprises intended primarily for profit, the Anglican Church also played a considerable role in their life. For them, proselytism was a means to establish better relations with the Native Americans, as in John Rolf’s famous marriage to Pocahontas (Tsukada, 2020). Thus, both Protestant and Anglican denominations played their role in the colonization of New England and the Chesapeake Bay, respectively.
consequently, they have gained popularity in the market in a short time.A product that will expand gradually in the market is wireless headphones. It is becoming popular because every phone manufacturer is trying to produce such an accessory. At the same time, the competitive advantage is that they are small and comfortable to use (Hagiu and Wright 1527). Although their price is higher than ordinary headphones, they work longer and do not break as quickly. They have gained a stronger position in the market because of the fact that they directly attach to phones at a distance, which is convenient in today’s world. Moreover, people who buy the phone also choose headphones from their company (Hagiu and Wright 1527). Thus, the benefits listed above contribute to the number of types of wireless headphones on the market and their popularity.
With the current broad variety of species, as well as the emergent news about the species that are on the verge of extinction due to the impact of the changes in the environment, one might believe that discovering new animals is no longer a possibility. However, new species are still discovered regularly, the recent incredible find being an example of that. Namely, the Nimba myotis, also known as the fuzzy orange bat, or Myotis nimbaensis, has been identified as a new species this year (Simmons et al., 2021). Having orange fur with black pigmentation, Nimba Myotis represents a rather unusual specimen of bats. The animal prefers natural caves as the place where it lives and rests. Like other bats, Nimba Myotis uses laryngeal echolocation as the means of identifying and catching prey in the dark. However, due to the species in question being under researched, its diet is mostly unknown (Simmons et al., 2021). Overall, the bat represents a unique specimen in its class.The species belongs to the animal kingdom, particularly, to mammals of the Chiroptera order and the Vespertilionidae family (Simmons et al., 2021). The main rationale for placing it in the animal kingdom is the fact that Nimba Myotis is a mammal. Additionally, the specified species reproduces sexually, unlike members of other kingdoms, and is multicellular (Simmons et al., 2021). Furthermore, the fact that cells in Nimba Myotis do not have cell walls, allows classifying it with other species in the Animal kingdom. Therefore, the bat should be defined as an animal, particularly, a mammal. Furthermore, one should note that, being a bat, Nimba Myotis represents the largest order in the mammal class after rodents (Simmons et al., 2021). Overall, the discovery of Nimba Myotis has shed a lot of light on the species of bats, in general.
There are many different species of marine microbes that exist in the water in massive amounts. Among the Nitrite oxidizing bacteria, there are six main types: Nitrotoga, Nitrospira, Nitrolancetus, Nitrospina, Nitrobacter, and Nitrococcus (Han 2). One of the fascinating species of bacteria is Nitrobacter which plays a crucial role in the nutrition of plants. Since this is a nitrifying bacterium, it serves as a simple way to release nitrogen that comes out of plants. Therefore, this paper aims to analyze the essence of the Nitrobacter, its specific characteristics its position in the ecosystem.Nitrobacter is the most interesting among the other species because it participates in converting nitrite to nitrates. Nitrification happens due to the receiving of nitrates from ammonia by oxidation, and the process goes with the help of the pair of bacteria, which are Nitrobacter and Nitrosomonas (Han 3). First of all, it is crucial to mention the concept of nitrification and the operations that are included there in order. Since the process is happening in the soil, it is a remarkable biological phenomenon that may also influence the other factors connected with nature. The nitrogen cycle is a significant part of the biological processes, and bacteria that exist in the soil take part in the majority of chemical phases that produce atmospheric nitrogen into the new condition.Overall, Nitrobacter is an integral part of maintaining the diversity of the microorganism in the soil that is provided by its oxidation activity. It plays a critical role in the plants’ nutrition and, as a nitrifying bacterium, makes it possible for the soil to preserve the auspicious condition and maintain its fertility. Thus, due to those reasons, Nitrobacter is an exceptionally fascinating species of Nitrite oxidizing bacteria.
Posture and body motions are examples of body language. A straight stance, for instance, conveys confidence; the same holds true for physical motions. Sitting upright and leaning forward on the chair, for example, displays attention and focus in the debate, but a relaxed reclining back posture may imply apathy or superiority. Although looks might be deceiving, not all of them are when it comes to professional communication. Consider the case of a sales agent offering a high-end fashion item. The clothing and footwear they wore would highlight their personal style as well as their fashion expertise essential for marketing the goods. Gestures are acts that are done automatically or routinely, such as tapping fingernails on a table, bending the head from side to side, or laying palms on the cheekbones. Even if they are not intended to, certain gestures might communicate the wrong idea. For example, a worker may rest his forehead in his palms when intently pondering, which may be misinterpreted as boredom.In my opinion, I perceive body language nicely. When a person makes some kind of movement in order to pay attention, I always do it. I consider my strongest side in terms of non-verbal communication. This style of communication accompanies everyone from birth, and although this type is well developed for everyone, decoding is not always up to par. Most often, I study body language by analyzing the behavior of people in cafes and other public places; in this way, I get to study the maximum possible number of people, which allows me
I express my thoughts well in non-verbal language; at least people have always understood what I am trying to convey to them. I can say that body language is fundamental and understandable to me. However, as with decoding, I have difficulty understanding how to show some kind of desire to the interlocutor by appearance. I want to develop this skill as it is very versatile in everyday life and can help in many situations.Implementing the tips for becoming a better encoder of nonverbal will result in improved decoding ability due to greater awareness. Competent decoders of nonverbal information are considered to have nonverbal awareness, which, like skilled encoders, leads to more significant social networking sites, popularity, and reduced social phobia (Burgoon). I believe that the ability to express one’s thoughts not only with words but also with body movements, appearance, and gestures are beneficial skills that can be applied in all areas of a person’s life in order to simplify and improve life.
IntroductionIn every healthcare setting, the need to meet optimal patient care requires nurses to maintain ethical practices and follow the outlined principles effectively. The relationship between the sick individual, relative, and practitioner is vital for ensuring better services to the ailing person. In most cases, nurses are faced with technical situations that require them to make sensible decisions while taking into consideration the welfare of the client and family members (Bratz & Sandoval-Ramirez, 2018).Such challenging moments call for the caregivers to critically apply the principles of beneficence, non-maleficence, autonomy, and justice to ensure they optimally attend to the customers appropriately. Morals allow nurses to detect ethical dilemmas in the work environment and make sound judgments and practical decisions according to their values and beliefs while maintaining their conduct within the laws that govern their profession.Based on the current health status of Mr. Newcomb, I would approve the request to meet his mistress. First, Mr. Newcomb is at a critical stage of pancreatic cancer, and having in mind all the pain he is going through; it would be appropriate to consider his wish. Currently, he is under hospice care, where the main focus is to ensure he receives quality time and comfort experience before his death time. At this point, anything that makes Mr. Newcomb happy matters most for his life. He needs something that can make him happy to lengthen his days.Disapproving the request would diminish the trust Mr. Newcomb has in me, and he will probably start withdrawing his attention from my services, which will
be disastrous for his health. Therefore, to maintain the connection and ensure he receives quality care, I would ensure his desires are met. The practice will be good for the patient’s health, but for his wife, it would sound like a betrayal. As a nurse, I will make it secret after inquiring about the relationship between Mr. Newcomb and the mistress from him. Once I realize the relationship is healthy, I will formulate a way of allowing the patient to meet his friend.Principle of BeneficenceIn healthcare, the principle of beneficence requires a nurse to be kind and act in a way that benefits the patient. Caregivers are expected to support the welfare of sick individuals by preventing any harm while preserving moral rules (Giles et al., 2018). In the case of Mr. Newcomb, he wanted to meet his mistress, and the action would bring him joy and happiness that, in return, improved his health condition. Allowing interaction between the patient and the visitor is an act that follows the moral of beneficence. At the same time, keeping it a secret from their wife is protecting him from guilt and fear that would cause his status to deteriorate abnormally, reducing the number of his days to live.Principle of Non-MaleficenceThe principle of non-maleficence prohibits nurse practitioners from engaging in any action intentionally that can harm the patient. Based on the case of Mr. Newcomb, rejecting his request would cause him stress and pain following the sensitiveness of the wish. Therefore, finding a means of giving him a chance
to meet the mistress would be of great help to his care. I already knew that refusing to grant the permission would result in more traumas for the patient; hence, if I declined intentionally, my practice would be against the principle of non-maleficence (Ilkafah et al., 2021). If I weigh the burdens of denying and granting the opportunity, accepting the request presents more benefits to the welfare of Mr. Newcomb, which is necessary for his hospice care management.Principle of AutonomyThe principle of autonomy allows patients to make independent decisions concerning their needs. According to the scenario of Mr. Newcomb, he had the right to moral practice. Therefore, it is ethical to allow him to exercise his capacity of sovereignty. Upon hearing the patient’s request, I would have to assess his ability to carry on with the wish. If he is capable, then the principle applies, and the individual explores his self-determination. When I allowed Mr. Newcomb to meet his mistress following his decision, I adhered to the practice of autonomy to improve patient care services.Principle of JusticeIn nursing, the principle of justice requires nurses to practice fairness, equitability, and equality for all patients. The moral promotes recognition of a sick person’s dignity irrespective of their status (Silva & Oliveira, 2020). According to the scenario of Mr. Newcomb, I would apply the standard by allowing him to meet his mistress. The practice would follow the requirement of justice, which is to be fair to the patient. Displaying justice would indicate care to the victim hence enhancing his
emotional strength towards the services he is receiving within the facility.Beliefs and ValuesGenerally, personal beliefs and values play a vital role in influencing ethical practice in the work setting. Education, past experience, and culture are key factors that significantly determine how an individual portrays moral behaviors (Sari et al., 2018). I believe in the provision of care for people in need, and the concept has been of great help when it comes to solving dilemmas. According to Mr. Newcomb’s scenario, my decision was greatly influenced by the value of caring, which prompted me to do what was possible to help him relieve the constant pain. Based on my nursing experience, if you prevent patients from what they wish to have, they become depressed and lose trust in the care provider. Therefore, apart from the principles of ethical conduct, my beliefs and values would form part of the decision I make about a patient’s welfare.Strategies for Promoting Self-CareGenerally, nurses engage in different activities to ensure patients receive the best care services within the facility. It is their responsibility to ensure sick individuals’ well-being is achieved. Their duty requires maximum concentration and focus on ensuring they deliver optimal care to patients. They, therefore, need proper strategies to enable them to improve patients’ self-care to enhance the quality and safety of their health (Wang et al., 2019). The practice allows patients to have good physical and mental health while undergoing medication to enable them to overcome the stress and pain of the disease. Some techniques, such as regular exercise,
take control of the land God had given to Peruvians. He proposes a system of political organization wherein the government is representative of its people and adapted to their practical needs (Kilroy-Ewbank, n.d.). Poma has thus made a significant contribution to the discussions of liberty, political representation, social responsibility, and self-determinacy of individual states. His notion that the government should be created for and by the people that have historically occupied the land it rules over is strikingly modern.Furthermore, Poma’s work completely refutes the idea that Europeans brought civilization and political organization to the Incas. This interpretation is revealed as only a hypocritical pretense to justify violence, economic exploitation, and cultural erasure as a means of political control. It portrays how an entire way of life was completely destroyed and lost as its people were deprived of their freedom and forced to assimilate. Although Poma admires the moral standards the Spanish purport to uphold, he shows that they have not actually measured up to them.
Young people are known for their desire to change as many things in their life as possible in a short period. They like to make decisions, find opportunities, offer new ideas, and follow their dreams. This is what has recently been happening to me and explains my intention to get accepted to the program in this academic facility. Nursing is not just another career option I want to learn but a field of knowledge that should significantly improve my life. The question of health is more than serious today, and people need additional help and support to cope with an existing variety of diseases, health problems, pandemic-related concerns, and physiological challenges. I am taking a conscious step by applying to this program and choosing nursing and health science as my major to value care quality and promote health through developing the necessary skills and knowledge.The progress of nursing is remarkable and influential from multiple perspectives. Some people are ready to use any chance to advance this profession, while many individuals believe that this job is full of challenges. Human despair, unpredictable traumas, and innovation aspiration may provoke nursing burnout, anger, and depression (“Health Systems Are Implementing Creative Strategies”). However, modern progress and strategies allow healthcare employees to deal with such situations and predict the growth of negative emotions. Nurses play an important role in human life by supporting, explaining, and encouraging individuals when their health is not stable. I want to become a part of this process and recognize the worth of professional interactions.I understand that
The nurse needs to get information on Alyssa’s health history and the physical assessment results to propose adequate interventions. Alyssa was diagnosed with Ventricular Septal Defect (VSD), which may be an additional risk factor for other heart problems. The girl’s current symptoms include noticeably rapid heartbeat, dizziness, pale complexion, and increased sweating. She has already experienced the same symptoms, which denotes that her condition might be reoccurring. The nurse needs to evaluate the cardiac output rate formed by the heart rate and the stroke volume, heart sounds, and calcium level (Hinkle & Cheever, 2018). The physical assessment results may indicate some acquired cardiovascular condition, such as supraventricular tachycardia (SVT), which major symptom is the increased heart rate (Hinkle & Cheever, 2018). The information obtained from the physical assessment will influence the nursing plan and the necessary nursing interventions.The nurse should support Alyssa and closely monitor her condition. The first priority nursing intervention is assessing heart rate and blood pressure (Nurseslabs, 2019). The rationale for it is that it is important to monitor these indicators as compensatory tachycardia and decreased blood pressure may indicate reduced cardiac output (Nurseslabs, 2019). The second nursing intervention is monitoring an electrocardiogram (ECG) for heart rate, rhythm, and ectopy (Nurseslabs, 2019). It will help detect cardiac dysrhythmias and tachycardia that affect cardiac output (Nurseslabs, 2019). The nursing third intervention includes providing adequate rest periods that decrease myocardial and oxygen demand (Nurseslabs, 2019). These are three important interventions that Alyssa’s nurse must perform.Another important intervention is the administration of the prescribed medication –
A protein-restricted diet involves the reduced intake of protein foods that constitutes an individual’s daily calories. This diet is typically prescribed to control specific medical conditions such as kidney and liver diseases. These foods include eggs, nuts, salmon, chicken, and beef, containing high protein levels (Suzuki et al., 2018). Therefore, a low intake of proteins is a dietary style preferred for geriatric patients considering that their metabolism slows down in senior age, indicating that high-protein foods could result in weight gain and other diseases (Mirzaei et al., 2017). Therefore, an inclusive nutritional teaching strategy on low protein intake among geriatric patients is integral in promoting a healthy lifestyle.There are various risks associated with aging, including low immunity, unhealthy eating patterns, and the reoccurrence of chronic medical conditions such as diabetes and hypertension. In addition, when people age, their immune system reduces significantly due to the less production of the B and T cells that help fight against illnesses when they occur (Suzuki et al., 2018). Similarly, senior people are prone to developing unbalanced dietary systems due to social-economic factors such as a lack of a certified caregiver and finances to access healthier food choices. Additionally, geriatrics suffers from degenerative diseases such as dementia, affecting their judgment and nutritional choices (Mirzaei et al., 2017). Therefore, effective training in self-management is integral in facilitating change among this population of people. For example, patient M is a 68years African American male diagnosed with polycystic kidney disease (Suzuki et al., 2018). He is reported to have been taking half a
grains such as spinach and green peas. These plant-based proteins contain healthy compounds such as unsaturated fats and cholesterol that are harmless to health. However, the patient can still take low quantities of meat and other grains and fruits to ensure they get enough calories needed. An example is making fried rice with 50grams of meat instead of the earlier consumption range of 500grams daily (Mirzaei et al., 2017). This restricted protein intake will ensure that the blood is detoxified from excess protein intake.The short nutritional teaching plan, including a meal makeover and focusing on food contents, will be presented using nutritional videos and uniform brochures to promote mindful eating. Meal makeover videos will train the client on ways to incorporate their favorite plant-based recipes to ensure they maintain the stipulated diet (Suzuki et al., 2018). For instance, African Americans love soya and beans, which can be used instead of eggs and meat. The client will also be taught how to interpret the nutritional label to make informed choices. For instance, the patient will understand that 100 calories per serving are recommended and considered moderate through learning and discovery (Mirzaei et al., 2017). Therefore and anything beyond that mark has detrimental effects on health.
The two stories “The Tell-Tale Heart” by Edgar Allen Poe and “The Gift of the Magi” by O. Henry were examples of their authors’ writing talent. O. Henry and Poe were writers from separate eras; however, some similarities can be found in these stories, especially in terms of literary techniques employed. At the same time, the two stories differ in that they adopt distinct approaches to societal tensions and emphasize various parts of these and challenges.“The Gift of the Magi” deals with a couple named James and Della, who eventually sold their most valuable belongings to buy each other presents for Christmas. Della discovers a set of pricey ornate hair combs, but they are worthless because she chopped off her hair to purchase Jim a chain for his watch, which he subsequently sold to give her a gift (O. Henry). In certain socioeconomic situation (the couple is impoverished), O. Henry employs irony to show the situation in which a person can give up the most precious thing to show love.The major components of which “The Gift of the Magi” is being built up are irony and selfless love. While O. Henry’s story explores the positive aspects of these concepts, Poe delves into more negative, darker dimensions through the narratives of mental disorder. “The Gift of the Magi” became one of the foremost literary examples of irony (Sushma). Jim and Della offer their most valued belongings in this case so that the others might completely appreciate their gift. Jim sells his watch to purchase Della’s combs, anticipating
that she will utilize them, while Della sells her hair to buy a present for Jim. Neither of them expects the other to go to such lengths. The irony here is effective on both a practical and a deeper, emotive level (Zafarovna). Della and Jim both purchase each other a gift that turns out to be financially foolish. They cannot spend money on stuff they won’t use since they’re impoverished. They do, however, receive something they did not expect: a present that reminds them of how much they love one other and are prepared to go to great lengths to make each other happy (Zafarovna). They offered each other the most powerful statement of their love they could muster.One of Poe’s shortest stories, “The Tell-Tale Heart,” deals with paranoia and mental disintegration. While in “The Gifts of Magi” the aspect of mental illnesses is omitted, more focusing on the general assumptions of hardships of living being impoverished, Poe, as in most of his stories, delves into deeps of human mentality. In this story, Poe delves into a psychological mystery: why individuals damage those they love or need in their life (Bloom). Po, the narrator, adores the elderly gentleman. He is not envious of the elderly man’s fortune (he, himself, is impoverished), nor is he vengeful about minor matters. In this approach, the narrator removes potential reasons for a crime (Alsahafi). The narrator, claiming his own sanity, is fixated on the old man’s vulture look. In the end, the narrator further dehumanizes the elderly man by murdering
him and dismembering his victim. The narrator validates his theory that the old man’s eye is distinct from him by fully killing him and dividing him into several bits (Poe). The protagonist, on the other hand, ironically confesses to the crime when the police turn up. Poe’s stories are known for literally bringing the dead back to life by utilizing memory as a trigger to bring them back to life (Alsahafi). He identifies the bothering sound as the old man’s heart beating beneath the floorboards, which completely ruins his mental health.To make their stories more interesting for readers, O. Henry and Poe employed suspense, irony, or both. Irony has become a common thread running through both works, making them very similar in this aspect of their use of literary devices. Both O. Henry and Poe became well known for the twist endings, an unexpected outcome leading to a reassessment of the initial positions of their characters. However, the aspects of irony explored by authors are completely different. In “The Gifts of the Magi,” the irony brings the story to somewhat of a happy end. The ironic outcome of the gifts exchange serves as a bridge to the understanding of love, that is, sacrificing the most precious possessions (Sushma). Poe’s narrative is way darker in this regard, leading a reader not to expect the confession of a murderer, who is suddenly disturbed my ‘a heart pounding’.Poe often employs dramatic irony, such as the narrator’s kindness to an elderly man a week before he murders him. The reader
with the usual people’s acts and cause a surge of panic, disturbing to complete their work. Sometimes, “cognitive biases cause dysfunctional beliefs” (Van Leeuwen et al., 2020, p. 2). Secondly, compulsive actions interrupt a patient’s daily routine, forcing them to do specific steps a certain number of times. Such activities can last even for an hour or more: therefore, the extent of dysfunction is also noticeable.  * Danger: OCD may represent a significant danger for an individual since sometimes, people feel so depressed that they are ready to commit suicide. In addition, sometimes, they may try to defeat their obsessive thoughts, causing self-pain: for instance, they can strike themselves to get rid of the unwanted image. However, although one of the most widespread fears of people with OCD is to harm others, they rarely do it (O’Connor & Aude, 2019). Thus, the level of danger to self is significantly higher than that of danger to others.  * Deviance: Since OCD causes abnormal thoughts and behavior, people with such a disorder can be characterized as deviant. However, it would be wrong to claim that it is easy to “determine the degree of deviation from the norm” (Davis, 2009, p. 1). OCD causes anxiety, stress, and panic; it makes people live in fear that if they do not do specific actions, they will not be able to avoid danger. Therefore, an individual should visit a clinic and let specialists help them fight.
the future and will help to contact the most suitable employers. Ohio.gov also provides information and skills to help one’s take a career to the next level. Each employer’s proposal normally contains brief information about the company that provides the job. In addition, it describes the requirements for the candidate, his or her duties, and the possibility of career growth.The site provided all sorts of choice features to find information on the desired vacancy. If known, it is possible to filter the job search either by a specific job title or keywords. It helps those who would like to specialize in a certain area based on, for example, the main skills and abilities. Having sorted the information on the site by filters, namely: employment and job type, education level, and workdays, I thereby reduced the final result that the site would provide me. I also entered the keywords cybersecurity, computer science , and problem-solving , and I got a job link for Cybersecurity Manager (Job ID: 237544968). Thanks to Ohio.gov , I can immediately send my resume to an employer for consideration or bookmark the job to continue my search. If I do not find anything better than offer ID 237544968, I can come back and send my CV later. Crowe company, as an employer, posted all the necessary information and even indicated advantages over other companies.
The IDS is an intrusion detection system that helps people quickly identify potential security breaches in a device or network. There are several types of IDS, the main ones being HIDS and NIDS. These IDSs are focused on different analytics and data control. For all IDSs, the main advantage is a quick notification system about an attack or file deletion. Saving time and committing changes allows administrators to take action to protect information as soon as possible.NIDS analyze incoming and internal network traffic; the purpose of the analysis is to detect malicious activity. However, when port coverage is disabled, additional sensors should be installed, and this is the main problem of NIDS (Magalhaes, 2018). This is due to the fact that the switch does not directly transmit the packet to the entire network, but only to the recipient. This arguably makes working with NIDS difficult, forcing administrators to do extra work.HIDS are tools that control the operation of individual devices. Typically, HIDS captures the status of all files hosted on an endpoint and informs the administrator when system objects are removed or modified. In addition, this kind of IDS checks all data packets transmitted to or from the device (Magalhaes, 2018). HIDS usually has advantages over NIDS, and administrators find that HIDS is ideal for laptops, servers, and workstations.HIDS and NIDS can be compared in different ways, and analytics show that HIDS more often outperforms or is not inferior to NIDS, at least. HIDS protects files even if the administrator is disconnected from the LAN because
stay in this place. Feeling connected to other people supports employees’ interest and involvement in work. Talking to colleagues, a person gradually gets rid of the fear of expressing their ideas and comments.Scientists from the University of Michigan conducted an interesting experiment, Friends (and Sometimes Enemies) With Cognitive Benefits: What Types of Social Interactions Boost Executive Functioning? The participants were divided into two groups: first, the first group subjects had to get to know each other for 10 minutes. And the second group was asked to participate in disputes among themselves on a certain topic. Then all the subjects were asked to solve several cognitive tasks. The experiment participants from the first group, who had previously just communicated in a relaxed atmosphere, showed the best results in solving problems. They had significant improvements in the executive functions of the brain. These processes are responsible for planning, concentration, prioritization, and organization. In other words, for the skills and qualities that we need to work.
As a matter of fact, organizational factors play a highly essential role in the implementation and change of strategies, policies, and action plans in healthcare settings and determine their success. Thus, understanding and addressing organizational culture (OC) have become essential for achieving improved healthcare performance. This work aims to investigate the importance of OC for infection prevention and control (IPC) interventions, the theoretical basis of necessary cultural changes, and the role of leadership in them.In general, no common definition may unite all aspects of OC in it. However, the most appropriate one was probably given by Shein, who stated that OC is “the pattern of basic assumptions that a given group has invented, discovered, or developed in learning to cope with its problems of external adaptation and internal integration, and that has worked well enough to be considered valid, and, therefore to be taught to new members as the correct way to perceive, think, and feel in relation to those problems” (De Bono et al., 2014, p. 2). Moreover, the collective mental programming on the basis of core values, rules, attributes, norms, and assumptions distinguishes the members of different organizations (Valmohammadi & Roshanzamir, 2015). As healthcare-associated infections currently remain one of the most substantial challenges to medical institutions, the efficient implementation of infection prevention and control (IPC) interventions helps to reduce infection-related incidents (De Bono et al., 2014). However, effective IPC heavily depends on multiple management systems’ interplay influenced by OC. In particular, the organization’s design and the arrangement of different jobs are the main components
role in cultural change.Although several leadership styles may be applied to cultural change, transformation leadership provides long-term effects. According to Willis et al. (2014), in organizational culture change, “alignment refers to the connection between transformational vision and action through a range of activities performed by those at multiple levels of a system” (p. 9). Thus, competent leaders considerably influence their subordinates, forming their perceptions and behavioral patterns. First of all, they articulate a new vision of OC enhancing people’s motivation and self-control (Fischer, 2016). In other words, in transformational leadership, employees are united by a particular mission where they are responsible for outcomes. In relation to the implementation of IPC, hand hygiene may be regarded as the basic measure. Thus, instead of total control, a leader articulates the importance of hand hygiene for disease prevention and motivates employees to follow prescriptions. In this case, healthcare providers realize their responsibility for the success of interventions.
and subchondral bone, is impacted.Osteoarthritis is often overlooked, despite its significant personal, economic, and societal costs. Even though osteoarthritis frequently coexists with heart disease, diabetes, and mental health issues, and can aggravate the morbidity and mortality associated with these ailments, it is not included in worldwide strategic plans for noncommunicable diseases. Patients and practitioners may be affected by therapeutic nihilism, with misconceptions that osteoarthritis is an unavoidable component of aging and that there are no viable therapies (Abramoff & Caldera, 2020). The affected people are frequently misinformed about treatment options. Current health-care approaches can range from ignoring essential treatments like exercise, weight loss, and education to using expensive, unproven medications for late-stage disease. I find this issue to be the most interesting, although unfortunate, element of both the article and the condition’s perception. I believe that rehabilitation counselling could combine physical and psychological aid to help patients with osteoarthritis and its various consequences.
Autumn is not generally viewed as an appropriate season for having a garage sale, not to mention that one on a scale of a local community. However, what makes my neighbourhood particularly unique and different from others is its consistent inability to meet expectations (Pyrkosz 147). Either due to some event that occurred too long ago for any of the neighbours to remember or care, or out of sheer need to have something extravagant in the midst of one of the least unpredictable seasons ever, my community has a massive garage sale every autumn. Although the weather and the lingering threat of health issues complicated the task, the community garage sale carried out last fall was one of the highlights of its members’ public life due to the opportunity to communicate and share memories, objects, and ideas.The range and diversity of the items that our numerous neighbours and community members offered as sales items could easily make one feel surprised. Though being admittedly cheap and often worn-out, these items told exciting stories about the lives of their owners (Hassan 68). For instance, some of the kitchenware sold during the event was quite old, with the style thereof allowing tracking down its origin to quite far back in the past. Though these items were certainly not of high price, they still led to rather fascinating revelations about the cultural legacy of their owners and their fascinating life stories.As it often happens during large garage sales, there was some drama. For instance, one of the neighborhood children recognized
that the community garage sale introduced, the chance to share memories, ideas, and emotions was a particularly important part of the event. Though the concept of a yard sale might seem far too common and, therefore, lacking excitement, it, in fact, represents a unique opportunity to communicate and share experiences for the participants involved. Given the diversity of my community, the process was especially enlightening and leading to multiple new insights. Though the season might be seen as unsuitable for a yard sale, especially on a community scale, it di provide a perfect opportunity to embrace the opportunities that it provided and encourage participants to share their ideas. Thus, the weird yet lovely tradition of our community, the fall yard sale has left quite an impact on me.
Family relations are becoming increasingly important in the modern world. This cell of society has the opportunity to form the most favorable conditions for future generations. That is why it is necessary to research and find ways to solve problems, difficulties and disagreements between husbands and wives. This is also critically important due to the fact that even at present, the deterioration of family ties will negatively affect not only society, but also the psychological and physical health of individuals (Salinger and Whisman, 2021). At the moment, the Western model of marital relations is particularly widespread, where the relationship is based on friendliness and taking into account the person’s personality as the most important indicator. It is important to note the fact that the relationship between spouses is a direct reflection of the trends in the development of society. This is due to the fact that social conditions are constantly changing and transforming, presenting new requirements to the institution of the family. Hence, recently, the roles of husband and wife have been changing in values. There are often cases where a woman becomes the breadwinner of the family and assumes all responsibility, becoming a leader. However, an integral part of the union of men and women is following religious concepts. Moreover, faith emphasizes the preservation of traditional ideological values. The way people will relate to faith can be passed on to the next generations, which will have both a positive and non-negative character. That is why it is necessary to grow children taking into account religion
based on mutual understanding, love and empathy.Modern society, despite its rapid development, is characterized by a sufficient number of social problems. The need to solve them is to improve people’s relationships for the further well-being of other generations. Hence, one of the important questions is the survey of marital relations and issues that may arise in them. It should be noted that in this aspect, the importance of religion and its postulates plays an important role. Thus, this work examines the problems of matrimony, the ways to solve them and the use of faith for a better understanding of the problem.Therefore, more and more literature and scientific works appear on the topic of the relationship between husband and wife. Moreover, special attention is paid to their influence both on social life and on the psychological and physical condition of the spouses (Masoumi et al., 2017). The family as an institution of society occupies one of the central places, therefore it is characterized by increased interest from researchers in various fields. Similarly, this aspect attracts religion into its component, since it can become both a way of uniting spouses and a cause of disagreement. Despite this, most of the studies prove the positive influence of faith on this type of people’s relationships.For these reasons, it is necessary to fully understand the marital relationship, which is characterized by constant changes over time. It is also influenced by such external factors as modernization and globalization. To a greater extent, they influenced the development of the concept of a friendly
marriage, which has the features of a partnership relationship, where both parts consciously approach solving many issues and understanding what is happening. However, even in this case, negative and stressful situations may arise that require timely solutions and a sober attitude (Masoumi et al., 2017). Moreover, such healthy relationships are described by a high degree of closeness of spouses, a special level of affection, mutual understanding and empathy.The development of technology and changes in social values have a special effect on the institution of marriage. Hence, in modern society, there is such a type of nuclear family, where a man is engaged in mining to ensure the material side of the family, and a woman is more often engaged in preserving the hearth and caring for children. However, it is also possible to have families where these roles change and the woman is engaged in earnings, and the man is engaged in household aspects. In addition, the Western family model is spreading all over the world, where the main component is just the same friendly relations, and then romantic ones.Therefore, the modern Western model of the family is characterized by a focus on the personality of the partners, and not on the economic or status component. Unlike past experience, in society, first of all, people choose their life partners based on certain qualities, and then according to the level of wealth and position. Moreover, the age gap between generations is growing, which complicates the relationship between, for example, children and parents. This is due to the
shift in the pace of formation and establishment of the individual. Family values and patterns of behavior are also changing, adaptation to which may cause some disagreements and issues. The leader in the family is not always the male breadwinner, which also has its own special influence.A stable and satisfying marriage can become an important source of emotional and instrumental support throughout adult life. In addition, it is associated with increased economic well-being, mental and physical health (Rajabi et al., 2020). Some of these obvious advantages of marriage may be the result of improved health behavior among married people, care and control by a spouse, or, first of all, the selection of the healthiest, happiest and economically well-off men and women in stable marriages. Although the exact nature of the processes leading to these positive outcomes is not entirely clear, marriage is associated with important benefits for older Americans.It is worth noting that the close relationship between spouses is based on emotional support and trust. It is these aspects that will contribute to such a concept as a healthy marriage. The difference of interests in a couple can also become a way of bonding. Even if they are different, the main thing is to enjoy each other’s company. Moreover, a healthy relationship between husband and wife is a means of well-being and makes it possible to effectively manage emerging stresses. Conflict situations and problems in this case do not disappear anywhere, but they can be solved much faster and manifest themselves much less often. Moreover, when
dealing with different isuues, spouses are even more united and can bring more benefits to society.Thus, as already mentioned, stressful situations are inevitable and their solution is sometimes quite difficult. One of these problems may be the financial side of creating and maintaining a family. This issue is more often mentioned in the sources and may have one of the most harmful effects. It is noted that disputes over money often conceal the desire to have power over the cell of society. Moreover, it can be caused by different views on the family structure and values that one of the spouses has formed during the formation of personality. Thus, this problem increases the occurrence of difficulties, negatively affecting the psychological state of the husband or wife.The next problem is everything related to the birth and upbringing of children. These family members generally always contribute to increasing tension in the family, especially at the stages of preparation for parenthood and in the first period of caring for offspring. On the other hand, children in family relationships can significantly affect the cohesion, improvement of their responsibilities and care (Mahoney et al., 2021). With the advent of new family shuttles, however, the spouses manage to pay less and less attention to each other, which also causes conflicts and disputes.Daily stress in everyday life also has its contribution. Sometimes. It may be insignificant, but over time, tension can accumulate and become the result of a strong conflict. Under such conditions, it is important to see the irritated or depressed state
of the partner. This will help to regulate stress and avoid possible consequences. Successful stress management promotes the development of emotional support skills, which will help with a possible recurrence of the situation.The next problem that needs to be mentioned is the lack of time. It can be caused by many factors, but most often occurs due to the work schedule of one of the spouses. This situation affects not only the mental, but also the physical health of the spouses. A husband and wife may feel alienated and deprived of their former strong bond. Because of this, an issue of communication problems may leak out, which will disrupt the dynamics of the functioning of the family institution. Sometimes, analyzing the interaction of spouses based on their way of communication can immediately make it clear whether their marriage will last or not. The positive side is the fact that all of the above problems can be easily solved. If attempts to fix the situation on their own fail, many couples can turn to the help of family therapy. This aspect of working with a specialist, as if by an outside spectator, will help to come to a balanced decision and change the spouses’ ideas about the importance and criticality of any problem.Religion and theology also pay considerable attention to how the institution of family relations develops in modern society. Thus, research comes to the conclusion that faith can contribute to both improvement and deterioration of the situation in the family (Kelley et al., 2020). A special
place should be given to religion in the issue under study, since without God there is no real and sincere humanity in people, thereby proper relationships cannot be formed. Thus, based on the postulates of faith, it is possible to deepen and improve the understanding of such a social phenomenon as family relations and their problems. Moreover, this knowledge contributes to a more effective analysis of changes in this institution over time and the identification of future trends in its development. Without taking into account religious aspects, people risk getting rid of the understanding of the main values and the role of creating a family, which will have a negative impact in the future.On the part of theology, in contrast to more methodical data, three main points can be distinguished in family relations. Certain roles must be formed between the spouses, which were prescribed to them by the Almighty. This type of relationship requires the creation of bonds of dependence and service between the wife and husband. Further, these vocations of the spouses have a justification in the grace of Jesus himself, which determines the essence of the marital relationship. It also helps to cope better with conflict situations and brings a man and a woman closer to faith. In addition, the conclusion of marriage ties implies the creation of a community of love and life, forming a kind of home church. However, due to the fact that this aspect is increasingly ignored in modern society, many difficulties arise. Due to the distance of people from
the future strongly affect their children. This fact is especially valuable because it has a role in shaping future generations and how the society of the future will view religion. Thus, families where concepts such as pacification, harmony and mutual support in religious matters are neglected, much more issues occur. In other cases, children and parents find a source of peace and interest at the same time, depriving family members to commit sinful acts. Among the practices that must be had in every family, holding a joint prayer is noted, which has a beneficial effect (King et al., 2020)health. Thus, the members of this cell of society form a sense of cohesion and a goal to achieve and strive for the best for the benefit of each other.Therefore, the study and analysis of family relations is of valuable importance. This activity will contribute to a deeper and clearer understanding of this public institution and minimize the occurrence of problems related to marriage. Naturally, the creation of a family is accompanied by many difficulties, but with a sober look at the relationship between husband and wife, it will help to solve them in a timely and effective manner. Moreover, regardless of methodological research and data, it is important to take into account such an aspect as religion. It plays an important role in family relations, as it contributes to the creation of cohesion and mutual understanding in the family.
In order to prevent an offense and draw up a protocol on an administrative offense, the authorized person has the right to apply such a measure to ensure production as the detention of a vehicle. This happens if it is impossible to draw it up on the spot of detecting an administrative offense, ensuring timely and correct consideration of the case and execution of the resolution. In case of violations of the rules of operation, use of the vehicle, and its management, the detention of the vehicle is applied. This is due to placement in the nearest specially designated protected place (in a specialized parking lot), and storage there until the cause of detention is eliminated.The costs of moving and storing a detained vehicle, with the exception of vehicles, are reimbursed by the person who committed the offense. The cost of storing a detained vehicle is charged for each full hour of its stay in a specialized parking lot from the moment the detained vehicle is placed in a specialized parking lot until it is returned to the owner. Payment for the cost of moving and storing a detained vehicle is carried out within the time limits and at the rates established by the authorized executive authority. The prices of the parking lot owner, which should be involved in payment, should also be taken into account. Thus, attention should also be paid to the fact that Outback Insurance Company was notified by the parking lot owner and by the police. However, it should be noted that
(Outreach Chicago, 2022). To practice inductive reasoning, it might be useful to compare data stated by the company with the other statistical sources regarding poverty rates, checking the modernity of the information it proposes to the readers. The company works in several locations: Chicago Heights, Chicago, Cicero, Dolton, and Harvey (Outreach Chicago, 2022). The estimations, according to the site Welfare Info, relate to the following poverty rates among adults in 2017 26.4%, 20.6%, 19.8%, 26.6%, and 35.6% respectively (Poverty Illinois, 2022). The calculated average of these areas is 25.8% which means the company was either gathering data from previous years or referring to the numbers of the poorest city, Harvey.A question for qualitative research can be if the services provided by Outreach Chicago meet the requirements of the customers. This research can interview customers and assess the impression of service, and the use of the goods it supplies. The study hypothesizes that Outreach Chicago provides essential supplies for its clients. The results of the research could be used for better service providing as customers can give feedback on some items that are not necessary or could be changed.For the quantitative study, the question is if the general satisfaction level of the clients is above 50%. To estimate satisfaction, the clients will be given application forms to fill in. The research hypothesizes that Outreach Chicago meets the expectations of the customers by more than 50%. The research can help the organization receive information about the effectiveness of its performance.
second main problem is poverty: disadvantaged groups in rural areas live in poverty (Innes et al., 2019). Some of them decide to settle in the city because they believe that they can easily find work. Their main goal is to provide for their family, but almost none have the necessary education for a good job. These people come to the city and become a service class. They suffer from the prejudice of indigenous people, poverty, and worse working conditions. Another inconvenience due to overcrowding is the garbage from residents, which is difficult to dispose of (Namberger et al., 2019). In many European countries, this problem is solved thanks to separate garbage collection (even in houses, there are separate garbage cans). Then some of the garbage is recycled, some are incinerated at incinerators.In conclusion, to solve traffic and air pollution problems, people should use public transport as often as possible, rather than using their car. The government should build more roads and improve public transport to solve this problem. Poverty is now lower than at any time in human history, and all trends demonstrate that we will have consistent successes in the fight against poverty in the foreseeable future.
Panama has become a more attractive investment and tourist destination. Nevertheless, a dollarized system has outstanding inflation performances and may even lessen the influence of global trust shocks but not real external upsets (Bakari & Mabrouki, 2017). Furthermore, it is unclear whether Panama’s loose monetary policy resulted from the dollarization system or the competing, increasingly globalized banking sector.Panama’s geographic position as a key maritime route adds to the significance of the Agreement. Approximately two-thirds of the Panama Canal’s yearly transits are destined to or from U.S. locations (Park et al., 2020). Almost all U.S. automotive and commercial goods shipments to Panama will be duty-free initially, with residual levies phased away over a ten-year period (Park et al., 2020). Information systems gear, farming, large machinery, aircraft and components, healthcare and measure environmental, ecological products, medicines, fertilizer, and agrochemicals are among the U.S. items that will benefit from immediate duty-free accessibility. The U.S. and Panama exchange crops like corn and bananas if we talk about exports and imports.
Childhood has the most direct impact on a person’s adult life since it is the first step in the socialization process. Unfortunately, not all parents understand effective methods of upbringing, do not realize the value of a favorable environment for the child’s independence, and neglect the appearance of the youth’s emotional anticipation. It is a severe issue that requires broadening the knowledge of the theoretical bases of the family relations structure. One alternative that can promote the growth of skills and erudition of parents is studying online resources. Parenthub is a quality option with a sufficient amount of theory and approaches of its practical application to promote children’s mental and physical health.Parenthub is a resource that provides access to materials on interacting with children from their conception to adulthood. One can read about pregnancy, parenting, psychology, children’s education, family connections, eating habits, and householding. Complex relationships between kids and their parents are always psychological and mental trauma, which can provoke severe depression and destroy the most fundamental instinct – self-preservation (Idris & Ahmad, 2020). The online resource contributes to the solution of this concern at the early stages when contact is just being constructed, and approaches to family links can still be modified.For a child, the household is the primary environment for living, developing, and becoming a whole person. Kids learn to recognize the world, grasping the basic mechanisms of cognition and interpersonal relationships from the family (Chen et al., 2022). Therefore, the relationship with parents determines the basic skills, abilities, and psychological qualities, since children
AbstractObjectiveThis paper’s objective is to discuss the pathophysiology of intraoperative hypotension, or low blood pressure, with a focus on the causes of hypotension occurring at the cellular/receptor level.BackgroundIntraoperative hypotension (IOH) is a major factor associated with postoperative complications and high rates of mortality following non-cardiac surgery. The incidence varies according to the definition of IOH used by physicians and the causes of the condition. Even though there is no single definition of what can be considered intraoperative hypotension, physicians commonly use the indication of mean arterial pressure less than 65 mmHg. Despite the variations in defining hypotension and its symptoms, a strong connection has been between IOH and a number of adverse postoperative outcomes. These include myocardial injury after non-cardiac surgery, acute kidney injury, and other organ injuries.ResultsThe current research has identified several major causes of intraoperative hypotension. They include intravascular hypovolemia, vasodilation, high intrathoracic pressure, low cardiac output, and compromised baroreflex regulation. These conditions act as causative mechanisms resulting from the use of anesthetic medication and lead to the reduction of blood pressure. Risk factors are associated with included advanced age, the history of hypotensive episodes, emergency surgery, and the vulnerability to tissue ischemia. Although several conditions and processes have been identified as causes of intraoperative hypotension, more research needs to be done on the treatments and perioperative management of IOH. Patients that receive non-cardiac surgery under general anesthesia still face the risks of a decrease in blood pressure to dangerous levels.Pathophysiology of Intraoperative HypotensionIntroductionIntraoperative hypotension is among the most common side effects of general
anesthesia used during surgery. Most frequently, IOH or intraoperative hypotension is determined as a mean arterial pressure (MAP) lower than the 25% average value of the patient. Even short periods of the decrease in MAP have appeared to be connected to unfavorable outcomes. IOH is considered to be a major factor associated with adverse postoperative complications, such as ischemic myocardial injury after extracardiac surgery, kidney injury, organ injuries, and other dangerous conditions. Annually, over 8 million patients suffer from postoperative myocardial injury, which is also one of the leading causes of patients dying within the first month after surgery. Thus, IOH is a major factor linked to a high postoperative mortality rate, as it increases the risk of adverse postoperative outcomes leading to death.IncidenceStudies report the different incidence since the definitions of IOH used by researchers vary. Thus, “IOH defined as a mean arterial pressure below 65 mmHg occurs in approximately 65 per cent of operations, and IOH defined as a 20 per cent decrease in MAP from baseline occurred in 94 per cent”. Fourteen of the studies reviewed by Wesselink et al. have investigated mortality, and showed an “outcome incidence between 0.03% (follow-up: <1 day) and 5.6% (during hospital admission)”. Twelve studies reviewed showed a connection between IOH and acute kidney injury, with AKI incidence “between 2.8% (7 days) and 72% (7 days)”. Nine of the studies investigated the cases of myocardial injury preceded by intraoperative hypotension, and the incidence reported varied “between 0.09% (in-hospital) and 30% (1 day)”. Even though hypotension is believed to
be a strong signal and a significant factor involving adverse postoperative outcomes, and duration of its episodes has not been clearly defined yet.EtiologyTo be able to treat intraoperative hypotension and avoid its dangerous postoperative outcomes, health professionals have to identify its causes. The causative mechanisms that lead to IOH vary in different phases, which are defined according to the different stages of surgery under general anesthesia. Post-induction hypotension (PIH) and early intraoperative hypotension (IOH) have been identified as the main phases induced by intravenous anesthetics and other anesthetic medication.Patients undergoing surgery under general anesthesia can have hypotension caused by various pathophysiologic mechanisms, which means that the etiology of IOH involves a range of factors. Among the most common ones are vasodilation, intravascular hypovolemia, low cardiac output, high intra-thoracic pressure, and impairment of the sympathetic nervous system or compromised baroreflex regulation. During vasodilation, blood vessels widen as a result of the relaxation of their muscular walls. This mechanism leads to “a decrease in systemic vascular resistance (SVR) and an increase in blood flow”, which causes a decrease in blood pressure. Vasodilation and venodilation, in particular, is considered to be the main cause of hypovolemia induced by anesthetic drugs. It can also be caused by the reduction in circulating blood volume following massive blood loss (absolute hypovolemia) or inadequate “increases in the capacitance of the blood vessels as in vasodilatory shock” (relative hypovolemia). As a result, when compensatory mechanisms are impaired or function inadequately, relative hypovolemia can reduce arterial blood pressure.Decreased cardiac output can be caused by a
hypotension, can lead to acute or fluctuating hypertension4. Risk factors associated with intraoperative hypotension have appeared to include advanced age, the history of hypotensive episodes, emergency surgery, and the vulnerability to tissue ischemia.Signs and SymptomsPatients sedated with anesthetic medication during surgery do not convey most of the common signs of low blood pressure, such as dizziness, nausea, or blurred vision. Therefore, during surgery, physicians have to depend on common definitions of what is considered to be the lowest blood pressure that can be managed without severe health outcomes. That is why the definitions of what constitutes intraoperative hypotension still vary. However, it is commonly accepted that values below “a mean arterial pressure threshold of 65 mmHg” are dangerous and entail cases of postoperative complications and death5. It can result in permanent organ injury, as it means that blood is not reaching the patient’s major organs.ConclusionIt can be concluded that while the causes of intraoperative hypotension have been identified, the ways to prevent them and treat hypotension have not been clearly defined. IOH remains to be a major signal associated with adverse outcomes and high rates of postoperative mortality. Therefore, further research might focus on investigating the ways to manage.
wanted freedom from British rule and fought for it.Secondly, the American fighters for independence were more willing to sacrifice their lives because they wanted to defend universal ideals. Indeed, American intellectuals were greatly influenced by the ideas of John Locke and Jean-Jacques Rousseau, who promoted the natural rights and freedoms of every man (The Library of Congress, n.d.). However, with its rigid class system and the unrestrained power of the monarchy, the British Empire was far from the new values that more and more Americans held.Finally, the new generations of immigrants were forming a new identity that differed from those that their fathers had. They started associating themselves less with English, German, or Dutch and more with Americans (Hanson & O’Dwyer, 2019). Thus, the gap between people in England and its American colonies became wider, and the former was viewed as the conquerors by the latter. Therefore, the patriots were willing to risk their lives to ensure freedom from the oppressors.Overall, it is argued that there are at least three reasons that made the patriots willing to sacrifice their lives in the war against the British Empire. Among them, the unfair treatment that Americans experienced as they were heavily taxed and could not influence the political situation is found to be one of the strongest ones. Additionally, the spread of modern ideas and a new identity formation in the colonies further increased this dissatisfaction.
divine and the human in Jesus Christ has been the subject of discussion for a very long time, still, the complete elimination of the divine from his figure is not possible.The Pentecostal movement does not recognize the Apocrypha, and considers only the Bible to be a genuine subject for study. This, in general, makes Pentecostal in some way a bookish religion, similar to Islam. In Latin language, the principle of the inspiration of the Bible sounds like ‘Sola Sriptura’. There can be no additions to the Bible, and other authorities are considered illegitimate. Interpretations of the Bible are also prohibited and are not considered authoritative.Like Seventh-day Adventists, Pentecostals do not believe in hell. This is contrary to the principles of the mercy of God who cannot send his children to eternal torment. There are usually contradictions here too: “And shall cast them into a furnace of fire: there shall be wailing and gnashing of teeth” (Matthew 13:42). This is what divine love is: in saving people from eternal punishment. In conclusion, Pentecostals have a few differences from other Christian denominations and are unlikely to ever come to a consensus, therefore, these denominations cannot legitimize them.
The Coptic religious community has a long history in Egypt. The persecution began at the conquest of Egypt by the Arabs and, unfortunately, has not stopped until now. Coptic Christians are regularly targeted for persecution, sometimes resulting in terrorist acts or murders. At the everyday level, Coptic Christians are opposed by the inhabitants of Egypt, ordinary Muslims (Sherwood, 2018). On a spiritual and more global level, Copts are threatened by terrorist organizations such as ISIS. They were exiled from Iraq and Syria and took secret refuge in Egypt.Persecution of Copts occurs throughout Egypt, facilitating the persecution of the fact that their religion is written in the passport of citizens of Egypt. It allows the Muslim Egyptians to deny the Copts the desired work, hindering their small businesses development. In daily life, Copts complain that they are being discriminated against in hospitals, schools, and universities (Sherwood, 2018). Terrorist organizations often kidnap Coptic women and force them to marry Muslims (Sherwood, 2018). The meaning of such a marriage is that a Muslim does not want to marry a non-Muslim woman. Before marriage, a Christian woman is required to take her husband’s religion. In addition to kidnappings, radicalized Muslims kill church leaders and blow up vehicles and buildings that may contain Copts.The article does not describe the help of neighboring countries or any others who wished to support Coptic Christians. Despite this, the Copts have a large community consisting of Catholics, Orthodox Christians, and other offshoots (Sherwood, 2018). Readers can assume that countries do not intervene in the conflict since terrorists from radicalized groups such as ISIS are already involved. After the victims in many countries of the world, which occurred due to terrorists, no government wants to interfere. Another reason for the lack of active support is the deep history of the conflict. The history of the war describes its causes well, and many outsiders perceive the persecution of the Copts as a logical event.
established governing methods. Persian government allowed for efficient control over separated locations and managed the authority of the leaders who were given the most power, the political governors and military generals (Brooks, 2019). Alternatively, the Greek political system was based on democracy, but it was highly unequal and challenging to manage over long distances (Brooks, 2019). Another crucial aspect of Persian leadership was modest taxation, which was increased only when military forces were required for war. In comparison, the Greek taxation system was incredibly sophisticated, and to ensure prosperity; it heavily relied on Greece’s allies.The significance of Athens’ downfall in the Peloponnesian war is connected to Athens’ role as the city-state that unified several Poleis. One argument suggests that after surrendering to the Spartans, Greece lost most of its political and military power, primarily accumulated in Athens (Brooks, 2019). Another point of view is that the Peloponnesian defeat diminished Athens’ possibilities to conduct imperial expansion, undermining the established political order and reducing Athens’ influence on other Greek cities.
BackgroundThe action of the prayer effect is based on the regularities and peculiarities of cognitive processes. It is based on two attention abilities, namely, switching and concentration. In the course of prayer, people switch and focus on an area of higher spirituality. The requirement of regularity and systematic recitation of worship leads to frequent repetition of concentration on religious categories, strengthening the mental connection with God. Froese and Jones (2021) wrote in their article that prayer strengthens one’s faith in the supernatural and, therefore, it is a session of faith. In addition, public prayer has long been used as a tool to influence the political arena (Froese & Jones, 2021). Therefore, one can consider this phenomenon as a weapon, sacred and supernatural.The same idea that prayer is a weapon, and used politically, is also found in Martin’s article. Religion is familiar with precedents when it was possible to defeat enemy troops by force of turning to God (Martin, 2019). For example, in A.D. 174, by the power of prayer, a Roman legion was able to discover a spring of water, and the flood that followed washed away the enemies (Martin, 2019). In general, both authors emphasize that prayers serve as weapons and that their use brings people closer to God.Participants in the ritual often experience a sense of social acceptance and emotional uplift after the prayer is completed. The rhythmic and systematic repetition of prayers reinforces the ideals and guidelines of a particular religion (Froese & Jones, 2021). Martin also wrote about it in his article, he came to the conclusion that these circumstances determine why prayer can be used as an epiphany strategy. Proactivity manifests itself as a response to a stimulus; a prayer of this type responds to a vision for fate. Due to such rituals, it is possible to create the future by praying (Froese & Jones, 2021). People often asked God to protect them in battle throughout early Christian history. Prayers were used to ease the fear of the Israelites, strengthening their resolve long before Jesus was born (Martin, 2019). The initiators of such prayers were used to reassure soldiers before skirmishes. It was assured that they would be guaranteed a place in heaven if they won (Martin, 2019). Both authors mention that requests for intervention in this way have existed throughout Christian history. They are unanimously convinced that prayers are inherently proactive; there are no significant differences between their positions.SummaryRepentanceIn his second letter to the Corinthians, Paul refers to repentance as sorrow for God’s sake, which leads to salvation (2 Corinthians 7:10). Repentance in Paul’s understanding is when one does not return to sin again. Repentance cleanses the soul, and a clean soul, in turn, is able to more fully receive the grace of the Holy Spirit.Dedication
The COVID-19 outbreak was a sudden and terrifying experience for all people around the world. I remember telling my friends that the virus would not last for a long time and that we would all meet after two weeks of self-isolation. I did not know how far it would go and what changes to my life it would bring. Sitting at home and watching the news about millions of infected and fatal cases made me realize how fragile human life is. The pandemic has both positive and negative effects on people and their businesses. This paper addresses these effects and provides my experience of the COVID-19 healthcare crisis.The virus that is still ongoing has taught a valuable thing for all of us that is being able to adapt to rapidly changing circumstances. You will never know what is waiting for you in the future, and you should be flexible and calm enough to embrace the new reality. At the beginning of the pandemic, it was fun to sit at home, watch TV series and chat with my friends. Yet, after some time, I realized how my mental health was going downwards as I started to feel anxiety about the world and my future. I also felt very sorry for people who lost their close ones because of COVID. However, I somehow managed that stress due to mental health support, podcasts, and books. I realized that being able to adapt to a changing reality is the only way to keep doing daily routines. At a country level,
countries were also adapting and making new policies, and I think now many political figures are more flexible being aware of sudden changes. There were too many mistakes to realize the importance of effective and fast decisions that take into account today’s reality.One more positive thing about the pandemic is that people learned the value of family and socialization. People cannot live alone, and they need someone to rely on and care for. During the pandemic, I was with my family, and I think it was the first time interacting with them so closely. We were discussing the situation and sharing personal concerns a lot, so that I could understand my family more and support them. I was also worried about older members of the family, thinking that I did not appreciate time with them before the pandemic. It made me reconsider my family relations and understand that they are my close ones, and I should dedicate my time to them more. I assume this was a great lesson for everyone, and I hope people would value their families and take care of them.One of the crucial changes that the COVID-19 outbreak brought to us is online education. I did not know how to assess such kind of education as positive or negative as there are many arguments for each side. Personally, I liked the online mode of the studies because I could also register for other courses provided for free by different universities and platforms like Coursera. I also learned how to manage time properly
their families. Such conditions raised crime rates, unemployment rates, and global hunger, putting many countries in a hard socio-economic situation. Furthermore, the virus split people into two categories of supporters of vaccination and those who are against it. This division between people caused social disturbances that made the healthcare crisis turn into an ideological fight. People were making up some stories regarding the COVID-19 and not contributing to the solution of the outbreak. In my opinion, such a response of the public is expected as the general mass wanted answers that government officials did not have. As such, the government should be very careful on how to communicate with citizens.Overall, there is much to say about the effects of Covdi-19. For me, it was an experience of taking care of my mental health and being close to my family. For the world, it has resulted in disrupted economies, increased inequality, and loss of lives. I hope the crisis made people rethink their lives and be supportive of others. I also believe that the world would not be the same after the end of COVID-19 if it actually has an end.
people adoring a number of “wise men” who were considered to be especially important in Florence, where it was painted ( The adoration of the magi – sandro botticelli – google arts & culture ). The linear perspective allows the audience to see everything that is happening from a detached angle, taking in the scenery and understanding the importance of the event to the people depicted. While the magi are being revered by the people of Florence, the audience also understands that they are close to their followers, therefore placing them in close perspective proximity to each other.Figure 1: The adoration of the magi – Sandro Botticelli – Google Arts & Culture.The second image I want to discuss is Adoration of the Trinity (Landauer Altar), painted by Albrecht Dürer in 1511.Figure 2: Adoration of the Trinity (landauer altar) – Albrecht Dürer – Google Arts & Culture.The figures made central in this painting is much more important than in the last, and the significance of the Trinity for Christian religion is enhanced with both the visual presentation and the perspective. The pose he makes is reminiscent of the crucifixion, and the father and the holy spirit are also included. We, the audience, are made to look at the Trinity from below, assuming a position of observation and awe. The difference in the way the gathered saints and the holy Trinity are framed make it clear what the central piece of the image is.
Environment-friendly technologies develop with the growing social awareness about the issues caused by pesticides utilization in various industries. Sharma et al. (2020) claim that “these chemicals enter the ecosystem, thus hampering the sensitive environmental equilibrium through bio-accumulation” (p. 110812). Consequently, alternative strategies become in demand for protecting the plants and species from biomagnification and severe changes in natural settings (Sharma et al., 2020). Biological, semi-chemical, and physical control methods for decreasing the use of pesticides require proper encouragement to achieve sustainable improvement in the ecological situation. Indeed, the governmental programs, legislative changes, and business initiatives that promote environmental protection are the key for the novelties’ implementation.There are several ways to influence the decision-making processes of pesticides used in the industries such as farming and livestock. Firstly, the awareness about the hazardous effect on human organisms must be increased through public health programs or social events. Knowledge about the diseases their pesticides users can develop in their family members would force them to take responsibility in a more efficient way than reminding them about the consequences to occur in decades (Magarey et al., 2019). Secondly, legislators and government can produce a supportive program for those who move their business towards decreasing pesticides (Sharma et al., 2020).Indeed, special tax rates, privileges, or rewarding guarantees can encourage farmers to implement alternative control methods to eliminate the neonicotinoid insecticides utilization. Lastly, the range of eco-efficient benchmarks to evaluate the level of hazard caused by one industry or company’s use of pesticides must be developed. Magarey et al. (2019) state that “eco-efficiency is an operational basis for optimizing pest management for sustainability” (p. 3129). The presence of regulations and standards to match production can encourage the industries to seek environment-friendly ways of manufacturing.
Water contamination is a global environmental problem, and the use of pesticides worsens the situation. This essential element, if polluted, makes plants, animals, and food unhealthy and leads species to disappear and humans to develop chronic diseases. Pesticides contamination must be considered on the legislative level in most countries, and global environment protection organizations must establish regulations. Furthermore, a good rating of water contamination’s severity must evolve before encouraging people and regulators to address the problem (Demir, Dilek, & Yetis, 2019). Each situation is unique, and many countries cannot integrate contamination limiting regulations due to the inability to match the general environmental standards. The alternative strategies to decrease pesticides utilization can be implemented in different institutions such as social work, culture, healthcare, and politics.Indeed, replacing killing pesticides with natural alternatives can be achieved through social programs and healthcare initiatives that explore and educate about the severity of artificial chemicals. Besides, the impact can be achieved through local political campaigns in the regions with the worst environmental situation or enormous scope of farming businesses (van den Berg et al., 2020). The alternative strategy of cultural influence on citizens’ perception of danger pesticides’ utilization carries can be encouraged through governmental funding into the ecology protection projects. Furthermore, non-profit organizations need to increase their influence by promoting workable pests replacement and initiatives to establish legislative regulation for applying limits for hazardous chemicals (Demir, Dilek, & Yetis, 2019). Encouraging broad groups of people such as certain region inhabitants, doctors, or plant food manufacturers to address the problem is more effective than penalizing the businesses. Consequently, the examples of severe consequences must be publicly discussed, and actionable decisions must be taken collaboratively.
The impact of pesticide utilization can be devastating for nature and the environment because they influence health, animals, plants, and living conditions. Their hazard on bees’ behavior reveals that bioaccumulation is severe for pollination, critical for plants and seeds growth, and food production. Recent studies and organizations such as The Environmental Protection Agency encourage the government and manufacturers to act against pesticides to avoid disappearing entire incepts’ populations (Lawler, 2017). The artificial changes in the ecosystem can lead to catastrophic consequences, natural disasters, poor harvests, and water pollution (Matyjaszczyk, 2018). Consequently, actionable steps must be made to address the problem, and vectors control or integrative pest management (IPM) are the profound approaches to start from.Pesticides utilization is becoming a global problem, therefore United Nations, World Health Organization, and World Wide Fund for Nature need to address the situation. For instance, encouraging businesses and households to exercise IPM for sustainable improvement in decreasing the use of pests. The idea of evaluating if certain biological products are necessary for agriculture is profound for the optimization and selection of ecology-friendly alternatives (Matyjaszczyk, 2018). Vectors’ control influences the environmental situation, and encouragement to implement proper practices can be reached through research and social programs devoted to the importance of particular incept species. Lawler (2017) states that “Health agencies, the public, and environmental groups have especially debated the use of methoprene because some studies have shown toxic effects on non-target organisms” (p. 337). The hazardous side effects need to be revealed to the public to force industries to decrease the pesticide use in vectors control.
IntroductionProviding patients with adequate and effective drug therapies is essential for timely medical care and treatment. In the examined case of the patient with a number of severe diagnoses, one can single out the diseases that are characteristic of older adults and are less common in young people. As a consequence, as a factor to be analyzed in relation to the pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic processes, age will be involved. This criterion can help explain appropriate drug interventions and identify optimal treatment regimens to address the patient’s needs.Influence of Age on the Patient’s Pharmacokinetic and Pharmacodynamic ProcessesThe examined case study shows that the patient has severe health problems associated with the cardiovascular system. While taking these diagnoses into account, the aspect of age plays an essential role in pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic processes. For instance, Rosenthal and Burchum (2021) note that diuretics, such as furosemide, are prescribed to treat high blood pressure and lower blood cholesterol. However, due to impaired body systems in adulthood, diuresis may start later and persist for less than the standard eight hours. As Thürmann (2020) argues, the kidneys and liver, which are responsible for removing harmful products from the body, function worse in older patients. Anticoagulants aimed at preventing blood clots in people with ischemic problems are poorly absorbed (Thürmann, 2020). Therefore, drugs in the body of older adults enter into chemical reactions worse and have a shorter effect on the body than in young people.Impacts on the Patient’s Drug TherapyThese changes in the pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic processes can affect the drug therapy
A disaster preparedness plan starts with an emergency preparedness kit that must necessarily include drinking water for each person, a supply of food for several days, a radio receiver for listening to information. Moreover, it is important to have a flashlight and extra batteries in case of a long stay in an emergency. Additionally, the kit should include a dust mask and a whistle that can be used as an alert or help signal. If it is not possible to turn off utilities, it is essential to put pliers and a can opener in order to open the food.When preparing for an emergency, there are many other factors that influence action. There is a paralyzed person in the family, so it is critical to have a stretcher in case you have to leave the house. If circumstances do not allow the use of a stretcher, special bandages are needed in order to carry a person on their back. Moreover, the package should include all first aid supplies such as bandages, painkillers, and wound dressings. In this case, help can be provided in the event of injuries of varying degrees. One family member has asthma, so several inhalers are prepared in the kit. If they break, then it is necessary to use baking soda during an attack of illness. 1 tablespoon of soda is added to 1 liter of water; the vapors need to be inhaled for 5-7 minutes. Such alkaline inhalations help clear the bronchi, remove phlegm and relieve inflammation when coughing.Additionally, it is necessary not to panic, as calmness is the boundary between life and death. With the loss of calmness and peace of mind, a person begins to commit rash acts that can lead to death (Aruru et al., 2021). The implementation of the plan should begin by checking the supply of water and food. Moreover, I need to make sure that all members of the family are intact. After that, I will turn on the radio and listen to messages from the rescue services. In the absence of communication, it is important to remain calm and give distress signals with a whistle. The success of the plan should be judged according to the level of calmness and readiness for different circumstances.
should. By comparing morality with etiquette, Foot claims that there is no significant distinction between the two (Foot, 1972). She draws an example of a person not caring for some etiquette rules is not excused for violating them (Foot, 1972). As such, Foot concludes that since morality and etiquette can both use categorical imperatives, the should of etiquette and the should of moral judgment are similar.Next, Foot proceeds to dispute the reason behind following the moral rules. According to Foot (1972), a moral rule can be irrational for a person to commit to, marking this person as amoral or evil; however, not irrational. As such, being able to withdraw from committing to these rules for whatever reason, no matter how it renders the person, means moral rules are hypothetical imperatives, not categorical (Foot, 1972). Vice versa, people can and do act morally, despite not being binding to do so. However, Foot concludes that if the moral judgment is a hypothetical imperative, then there must be other reasons why people decide to stay moral (Foot, 1972). Such reasons can be the hypothetical imperative of desire for justice, charity, liberty, and other virtues.
Philosophical ThinkingIt is important to note that philosophy is a discipline that systematically applies reason to deepen the overall understanding of existence, reality, and the nature of knowledge as well as wisdom through a thorough examination. The question about knowledge is strongly associated with a branch of philosophy called epistemology. The latter focuses on defending and analyzing the key concepts of knowledge, including the core methodological frameworks utilized to attain it. When it comes to understanding reality itself, the most relevant branch of philosophy is metaphysics. It seeks to describe the nature of reality by addressing the underlying matters beyond science’s capabilities, but the principles are grounded in reason and logic. Lastly, the ideas about the good life and proper way of living stem from the branch of philosophy called ethics. It assesses and thoroughly defends the critical concepts of value by determining what is wrong and right.In the case of the question of knowledge, Socrates offered solid methodologies to uncover what is true. It should be noted that dialectic was a cornerstone of the pursuit of knowledge through wisdom, which is focused on a mutually respectful discourse between several people of opposing views to attain the truth (The Socratic Approach, n.d.). However, when it comes to delivering the known truth to people, who do not know, such as students, Socrates used the Socratic Method. The latter focused on asking questions about known matters and pushing the boundaries of knowledge to attain new ones (The Socratic Approach, n.d.).Arguments played a central role in the process of
structuring and obtaining the truth since they were vigorously evaluated and assessed in regard to their validity. Even during his last trial and sentencing to death, Socrates adhered to his reasoning by proving why death should not be feared. He claimed that death is either something or nothing; in the former case, one can communicate with the dead, and in the latter case, it is dreamless sleep. Therefore, both cases present no valid reason to fear death, which makes it irrational for him to be fearful of his sentencing (The Apology: A Defense of Philosophy, n.d.).In the case of the question about reality, Plato offered insightful knowledge and a framework to understand the nature of reality. The philosopher’s core claim about metaphysics is rooted in the concept of flux or change. His argument is that the world is constantly changing, which makes knowledge impossible, but since knowledge is possible, then there are some essences outside the world in the metaphysical one (Plato Forms: The Foundations of Being, n.d.). Reality is grounded on forms, which are entities such as paradigms and ideals (Plato Forms: The Foundations of Being, n.d.).In the case of the question of epistemology, Aristotle offered virtue ethics to distinguish what is wrong from what is right. It is important to note that virtue ethics focuses on character or actor rather than the action itself. He claimed that when a person needs to act, he or she will act in accordance with his or her character (Aristotle’s Highest Good, n.d.). Virtue is located between two
true even today, if not more relevant. The modern world reached new extremes of excess and depravity, where our capability to go to either extreme is unparalleled. A person can have millions of friends through social media, the wealthy have a net worth in billions, certain political leaders can influence the world, one can eat whatever and however he or she wants, people of the planet are suffering from extreme obesity and hunger, the higher level of comfort is achieved, the pollution impacting the planet, and these are only a few examples of extremes of the modernity. For example, Aristotle developed the doctrine of the mean, where he provided the example of courage. Too much courage leads to foolishness since there is a fine line between bravery and stupidity, and the lack of courage results in cowardice (Aristotle’s Highest Good, n.d.).
Coronavirus has significantly impacted the general health status of the planet’s population for two main reasons. One of them is the virus itself, as it negatively influences people’s organisms, and the other is the difficulties related to maintaining favorable health condition in the pandemic situation. Thus, it is imperative to stay physically active and perform various exercises to keep one’s body in proper shape, improve organism’s immunity and reduce the chances of being diseased.COVID-19 causes particular challenges associated with maintaining a physically active lifestyle. According to Shariat et al. (2020), the leading risk factor of virus transmission is people’s proximity to one another in groups, meaning that public gatherings are dangerous. Thus, public gyms and training grounds may not be a proper place to exercise as they do not always have enough space to keep the necessary social distance. However, it is even more crucial nowadays to remain physically active as the coronavirus keeps developing new variants, which means regular training can prevent potential issues and assist in keeping people fit and healthy. The corresponding exercises could include push-ups against the wall, single-leg step-ups on stairs, shoulder lateral raises, jumping rope, or simple walking (Shariat et al., 2020). Doing those can help people keep active and healthy during the quarantine.Overall, staying physically active is an essential part of people’s lives, and its significance has grown due to COVID-19. It has brought many challenges to physical training and made it even more important to pay attention to body shape and health condition. Doing aerobic exercises and strength training can help people stay physically active, improve their health, and reduce the chances of getting some disease.
objectivism states that there is right and wrong that do not depend on someone’s opinions or other factors. In this sense, moral standards are believed to be propounded and everlasting, not created by humans. There are many philosophical variations and interpretations of objectivism, but the key idea lies in proclaiming one genuine truth. This evidently opposes the concept of relativism in every aspect (Bush and Moss, 2020). Objectivism, however, admits that some moral norms may change, but at thy core, any rules and standards evolve around an unaltered understanding of bad and good.I find relativism more convincing despite some flaws it contains. Although absolute relativity often signals the absence of a moral and ethical core and is thus unreliable, the theory of relativism has more realistic features. Every day we face elections, the result of which often cannot be called correct or not. Most people, in principle, always try to act ethically, but even then, their actions can be perceived negatively. You will not please everyone precisely because, despite some existing ideas about good and evil, you make decisions that pass through the prism of experience, psychological characteristics of a person, circumstances, and weighing many factors. I find objectivism too utopian an ultimatum, which seeks to simplify morality while threatening it with a distorted view of reality.
Dark Side of the Moon is the eighth album of Pink Floyd, the British rock quartet. Since 1973 when it was released, it has been regarded as one of the greatest rock albums in the history of music. In the present day, it definitely deserves listeners’ attention, and its analysis may substantially contribute to self-assessment and self-development. The purpose of this paper is to investigate Dark Side of the Moon from the positions of meanings, sounds, and influence on individuals. Characterized by an extraordinary thoughtfulness, clear conception, and the coherence of lyrics and sounds, Dark Side of the Moon still has a massive impact on human society, reflecting people’s attitude to life, death, madness, money, violence, choice, and social norms.Dark Side of the Moon may be justly regarded as one of the greatest albums in the history of rock music, if not the most outstanding one. According to Epstein, who wrote for Rolling Stone magazine, “there are hit albums, and then there’s Dark Side of the Moon ” (par. 1). Recorded in several sessions from May 1972 to January 1973 at London’s Abbey Road Studios, Pink Floyd’s eighth album has become commercially successful after its release, with more than 45 million copies sold worldwide (Epstein par. 1). At the same time, Dark Side of the Moon is more than a top bestseller that stayed in charts for breathtakingly many weeks – it has managed to affect its creators and the rock music of the next generations as well. First of all, it was the artistic achievement
of Pink Floyd that defined the British quartet’s career and turned an experimental and jam-oriented band loved by college students into worldwide renowned top-echelon rockers. At the same time, the album’s rich songwriting, heavy lyrical musings, and cerebral soundscapes led to people’s countless listening sessions, set quality standards for future albums, and inspired other musicians.One of the major values of Dark Side of the Moon lies in its conception and thoughtfulness. In comparison with the majority of studio albums that imply a series of unrelated or unconnected songs, Pink Floyd’s well-written masterpiece includes a general theme addressed by all songs. As a matter of fact, there are multiple theories and disputes concerning the album’s concept and general meaning. Although Pink Floyd has partly provided the explanation of particular songs, listeners have been mostly given an opportunity to reflect and decide for themselves.From a personal perspective, Dark Side of the Moon is about life and its shortness, the importance of living and being human, finding the purpose in life, factors that may impact its fulfillment, and death. At the same time, the album may be regarded as a warning to people about challenges in life that may affect its fragility and lead to insanity and destruction. In other words, “Breathe,” “Speak to Me,” “Time,” “The Great Gig in the Sky,” and “On the Run” are tracks that may be grouped according to their focus on people’s perceptions and multiple aspects of life including its futility and shortness, fear of death, the boredom of routine, parenthood, luck, and
the freedom of choice.In turn, other tracks, such as “Us and Them,” “Money,” “Any Colour You Like,” “Eclipse,” and “Brain Damage” address ideas and concepts that cause destruction, madness, and uncertainty or despair related to life reflected in the album’s other tracks. They are selfishness, greed, social pressure, violence, wars, racism, common insanity, and hidden negative feelings. Thus, Dark Side of the Moon helps listeners realize that the pursuit of material things, social approval, and public acceptance lead to dissatisfaction with life and recognition of its futility.The meaning of the album corresponds with the ideas of individualism that were spread in the 1970s. According to Thompson, “by the 1970s, society had lost its constraining power and individualism became a matter of self-absorption and the quest for self-development” (851). Thus, concepts reflected in Dark Side of the Moon helped young people to understand themselves better and perceive the ways in which their lives could be fulfilled.At the same time, listening to the album may be highly beneficial for individuals today, especially millennials who “more than any other generation, are searching for purpose and purposeful work” (Grant 1). Regarded as materialistic, narcissistic, and individualistic, they are concentrated on ambitions, achievements, and competitiveness. However, young people are frequently confused about life balance and their purpose in this world. For them, the album may serve as a source of wisdom and consistency, reminding that searching for truth is natural. It shows that life itself is highly important and appreciating every moment of it is paramount. In turn, there are multiple
detrimental concepts, ideas, and events that may limit life fulfillment and lead to despair and madness – they should be understood to be avoided.In general, the album’s reflection of society may be defined as timeless. In the present day, pandemic-related circumstances limit people’s ability to enjoy life. Tragic news, the lockdown measures, misinformation, global tiredness from multiple restrictions, and isolation lead to anxiety, helplessness, anger, and more serious health problems. The album’s message resonates with individuals’ emotional state – for example, “The Great Gig in the Sky” reflects people’s attitude to death, either acceptance of fear, “Us and Them” is about conflicts that prevail in the modern world due to restrictions, discrimination, and inequities, while “On the Run” express stress, anxiety, fear, and the senseless of life. All in all, Pink Floyd’s album emphasizes the inconstancy of life. Although there are bright and positive moments, they are inevitably changed by bleakness and even horrors that will pass as well. However, listeners can interpret songs in numerous different ways finding individual meanings that describe what they feel in a particular life period.The whole album may be perceived as a journey for people who want to understand the importance of being a human, being alive, and life in general, uncover it, and find their purpose. It opens with a relatively long and cinematic introduction with the crescendo of heartbeat accompanied by distant voices, ticking clocks, and sound effects that resemble an airplane propeller, automobile motor, cash register, and arcade machine. It is possible to say that “Speak to
Me” introduces life both within and outside a human being with its rhythm, dynamic, and pace. Listeners may identify a clear phrase, “I’ve always been mad,” that indicates society’s influence on the development of its members’ mental issues (“Speak to Me” 00:00:44). However, when “Breathe” starts, slide and chorused guitars, ride-cymbal drum kit, and bass enter all together, creating warm and delicious merging tones (“Breathe” 00:01:09). They replace the sounds of life, offering listeners to distract their attention from routine and explore another dimension in search of truth.In general, “Breathe” represents the ideas of the shortness of life and its futility at the same time when people focus on the endless achievement of non-existing ideals, competition, and toil. On the basis of its message, the may be divided into parts, and one may be regarded as a parent’s guidance:Run, rabbit, runDig that hole, forget the sunAnd when at last the work is doneDon’t sit down it’s time to dig another oneFor long you’ll live, and high you’ll flyBut only if you ride the tideAnd balanced on the biggest waveYou race towards an early grave (“Breathe”)In these lines, the importance of continuous hard work is emphasized, however, it is senseless as even if success is achieved, non-stop “race” will inevitably lead to early death. In turn, the author states that the purpose of a person is in an everyday living as life is positive and negative moments that constitute it, and only they should be valued:Breathe, breathe in the airDon’t be afraid to careLeave, don’t leave meWalk
around and choose your own groundLong you live and high you flySmiles you’ll give and tears you’ll cryAll you touch and all you seeIs all your life will ever be (“Breathe”)Although the next track, “On the Run,” is predominantly instrumental, the theme of time passage is clearly recognizable. At the same time, the message of this song is controversial. On the one hand, it expresses people’s constant “race” for career achievements, money, or fame and related anxiety and stress. Moreover, airport announcements and a person’s steps scattered throughout it reflect the dynamic and rhythm of life. In other words, people forget to live being constantly on the run. On the other hand, this tempo symbolizes living on the spot, and a person’s words “Live for today, gone tomorrow” support this theory (“On the Run” 00:01:52). In any case, life is short and may finish suddenly and unexpectedly – in this song, life is probably compared with a plane that has crashed in the end.In a genuine masterpiece, “Time,” various concepts of time are explored. In addition, this song may be regarded as a person’s attitude to time during his life.Ticking away the moments that make up a dull dayYou fritter and waste the hours in an offhand way.Kicking around on a piece of ground in your hometownWaiting for someone or something to show you the way.Tired of lying in the sunshine staying home to watch the rain.You are young and life is long and there is time to kill today.And then one day you find ten
years have got behind you.No one told you when to run, you missed the starting gun (“Time”)In the beginning, a young person feels unprepared for life, waiting for a mentor who will guide him. In addition, he may feel unsecured due to the pressure of society and organized power structures. At the same time, when a person is young, he does not realize how time passes and believes that the whole life is still in front of him.So you run and you run to catch up with the sun but it’s sinkingRacing around to come up behind you again.The sun is the same in a relative way but you’re older,Shorter of breath and one day closer to death.Every year is getting shorter never seem to find the time.Plans that either come to naught or half a page of scribbled linesHanging on in quiet desperation is the English wayThe time is gone, the song is over,Thought I’d something more to say (“Time”)Finding himself in the middle of life, a person starts to run, trying to achieve success and do things he was always dreaming about. However, the majority of opportunities have already been missed due to aging. In general, “Time” is a song about the fragility and shortness of life, every moment of which should be valued. The tragedy of missed opportunities due to the ignorance of the importance of time is majorly reflected in this track.“The Great Gig in the Sky” is another predominantly instrumental work, and it is dedicated to the theme of death.And I
am not frightened of dying, any time will do, Idon’t mind. Why should I be frightened of dying?There’s no reason for it, you’ve gotta go sometime (“The Great Gig in the Sky”)People may accept dying or be afraid of death and hide this feeling. In this song, there are two contrasting positions – the first one belongs to a confident person whose attitude to death and the absence of fear is convincing. The second person admits that she accepts dying as well, however, her voice is less confident as if she conceals her genuine attitude to death.The next song, “Money,” opens the series of tracks that present various things that may destroy life and lead to madness. Obviously, money and money-related greed are some of them, however, not all people understand this truth. For the majority of them, money implies multiple opportunities and life pleasure:Money, get away.Get a good job with good pay and you’re okay.Money, it’s a gas.Grab that cash with both hands and make a stash.New car, caviar, four star daydream,Think I’ll buy me a football team (“Money”)At the same time, when a person has more and more money, he cannot stop and wants more and more things. Money leads to debauchery and a lack of self-control. However, money is never enough, and that is why they become a source of multiple global problems:Money, it’s a crime.Share it fairly but don’t take a slice of my pie.Money, so they sayIs the root of all evil today.But if you ask for a raise it’s no
surprise that they’regiving none away. Away. Away. Away…. (“Money”)“Us and Them” explores the themes of conflict, violence, and fighting that derive from people’s intolerance and inability to accept the existence of more than one opinion.Us, and themAnd after all we’re only ordinary men.Me, and you.God only knows it’s not what we would choose to do (“Us and Them”)This song tries to show the senselessness of the black-and-white mentality that leads to struggles. Addressing a conflict’s physical aspect, “Us and Them” states that ordinary people will suffer while powerful ones will promote violence staying safe. Thus, people should reject being guided by ideas and opinions that aim to instigate a confrontation.Finally, “Brain Damage” and “Eclipse” may be regarded as the album’s most somber compositions that address insanity, mental health disorders, a mental breakdown, and darkness to which they lead. It reflects both the insanity of a society obsessed with money, conflicts, competition, and success and the insanity of a person who ignores life and merges into his own reflections and concerns. The dark side of the moon symbolizes life’s unfulfillment and dissatisfaction that may destroy all – all hopes, all dreams, all love, all happiness.Throughout Dark Side of the Moon, all songs are connected with each other, not only lyrically emphasizing the themes of life fragility, alienation, and insanity. Tracks have seamless musical coherence flowing into one another smoothly and symphonically s parts of one single harmonious melody. In general, the album may be regarded as a concert divided into pieces during which listeners have an opportunity
The situation in Pioneering Technologies (PT) is complex and ethically unstable. On the one hand, Owl Vision is a unique product in the field of bionic eyes with clear strategies and benefits for customers. On the other hand, the causes of fall-off because of some changing conditions are poorly investigated. In other words, no guarantees are given to explain the shortages of the new product. Regarding such conditions, the utilitarian ethical framework must be applied as the most consistent option with PT’s corporate culture. The main idea of this approach is that morally right steps are those leading to the best outcomes for many people and resulting in the greatest overall good (Halbert & Ingulli, 2015). The company should analyze the harms and benefits of the campaign and the product not only in relation to its success but all stakeholders and users who may be affected by the decision (Halbert & Ingulli, 2015). The examples include the evaluation of long- and short-term outcomes. Many individuals can be attracted by the campaign at the beginning, but their problems and concerns would grow with time, challenging the company’s reputation.Following the rules and principles of the utilitarian ethical framework, the identification of the outcomes plays an important role. When the company is confident in positive results and benefits for the company and ordinary users, the success of the campaign within the framework may be observed. Thus, at the moment, PT should not proceed with the advertising campaign as it is but must focus on some changes and improvements before
to light. However, in this case, it remains unclear if EET wants to bring some changes or to achieve some competitive advantage and defeat PT in this attempt. As a result, it is hard to say that EET could ultimately win. According to Halbert and Ingulli (2015), whistleblowing might wreak havoc in the industry and damage the reputations of both biotechnological organizations. The chosen mechanism does not presuppose the presence of a definite winner, but the number of losers may unpredictably grow.Using a poor product and maintaining awareness of its threats provoke multiple risks for people. If PT gets a chance to launch Owl Vision and customers do not have enough information about failed performance due to weather changes, accidents, and other challenges. When a consumer is involved in a motor vehicle accident because of the poor performance of the Owl Vision product, it is possible to address product liability theory as a basis for a lawsuit. The citizen was not informed about the unsafe and dangerously defective product, and this unawareness makes it possible to use the product under unfavorable conditions, meaning cloudy weather (Halbert & Ingulli, 2015). Addressing the current common law of torts, the driver should expect compensations from PT if the problem with the Own Vision product is investigated and proved.
Since it is assumed that skiing is a rather traumatic sport, the company should have taken precautions for minimizing the injury risks for the skiers. However, in that particular case, the actions of the company’s workers have created risks for health damage for Mr. Craig and Mr. Alex, who were actually injured. The fact that it was April and the slopes were supposed to be closed may lessen the degree of the company’s responsibility in this particular case, but not completely. The company made a mistake letting people ski after the snowstorm though it could not have allowed people to do it. Hence, the company’s actions endangered not only the skiers but the staff as well.Though Mr. Alex’s injury was made by Mr. Craig, it is not only his responsibility in its causation. It would not have happened if Dan and Abby did not send him to the untested slope without any instructor who could have prevented Mr. Alex’s injury. Hence, the health damage was caused both by the company and by Mr. Craig unwillingly. However, it does not mean that the compensation for Mr. Alex’s injury is a part of Mr. Craig’s responsibility since his actions were the result of the actions of Dan and Abby. Thus, the company should compensate Mr. Alex’s treatment costs relying on the severity of the damage he has experienced and the length of the recovery period (Goguen, n.d.). Apart from that, the company should pay for the ski equipment that was spoiled during the accident.The fact that skiing is a traumatic sport means that Mr. Alex himself should have known the health risks he had to face when skiing after the end of the season. The fact that he decided to ski alone on a difficult slope relying on his experience, says that he understood all the possible risks. However, his actions confirm that he tried to escape the crash and acted professionally without any violations of the skiing rules and norms. It was the actions of Mr. Craig that caused the clash. Thus, it is his responsibility and the responsibility of those who sent poorly skilled skier to the untested slope.
IntroductionManagement accounting involves measuring and reporting of economic activities of an enterprise. It is vital for the decision-making and planning of any organization and society. Managers primarily depend on the information provided by this paradigm for forecasting, operational control, and performance evaluation. For instance, managers use this information to decide what to produce, make, and when to produce. Therefore, it is helpful to them in determining various costs involved in the production process and the needed resources to attain the company’s objectives.Additionally, the management accounting system is financial in nature. Therefore, it feeds into the financial accounting system, especially in the product costing system, which is vital in calculating the cost of sales used in the income statement and inventory cost used in the balance sheets. Arguably, this information can be seen as the backbone to the excellent management and operation of large organizations. Thus its preparation should be made monthly or quarterly and given to the various managers, including the chief financial officers, for efficient operation of their duties. This paper, hence, seeks to create a comprehensive report and analysis of the actual financial performance vis-a-vis the budgeted performance to be presented to the chief financial officer.SummaryThe actual net profit of 1036.8 shows that the company is in good operation and can secure financing and investments. However, the budgeted net profit is 153.9 higher due to the lower sales volume in the actual performance. This then signals the sales and marketing department to adjust their marketing strategy to prevent the sales lag that is deterring
the company from reaching its plans. Conversely, comparing the actual and budgeted net profit margins, the 15.88 % profit margin indicates that the company earns 15.88 cents for every dollar it collects instead of £15.71 that was budgeted (Maheshwari, Maheshwari, and Maheshwari, 2021). This shows that the company is operating optimally and is highly capable of meeting its objectives. This analysis, therefore, deems it fit for the company to try and reduce the cost of sales for it to generate higher profit margins. Consequently, the company is required to minimize the selling costs and increase its sales volume to continue earning higher returns. Similarly, in the analysis of this data, the liquidity ratio is also vital to examine as it determines whether the company can pay off current debt obligations.The liquidity ratio shows the company is relatively in a good position to clear its current debts without using the inventory financing method, which is the least liquid. Its quick ratio of 0.8 indicates that it has £0.81 of liquid assets without inventory to cover £1 liability (Maheshwari, Maheshwari, and Maheshwari, 2021). Although the company desires to achieve 1.02, it is not close to insolvency. With all these analyses, it is prudent to argue that the company is in good operation for the foreseeable future.Statements of Profit & LossBudgeted statement of profit and loss account for the year ended 30th Sept 2020.

performance for the whole year.In the data above, direct labor costs take a more considerable percentage of all the costs involved in the performance of this company. Direct labor costs apply to the cost of labor that can be traced to the creation of a product without unnecessary expenses, for example, the salaries and wages paid to the workers. It takes a more considerable percentage because it determines the volume of production (Maheshwari, Maheshwari, and Maheshwari, 2021). As production increases, labor cost also increases; that is why in the budgeted performance, the cost of direct labor is 2% higher than the actual cost of direct labor. It is followed by direct material cost, which includes the cost of raw materials and the items used to create the products. The direct materials in the bakery industry, for example, would consist of flour, eggs, oil, and water. It also contributes a bigger percentage of costs in the production process.When the production is increased, the output will be increased, and thus the inputs costs, including direct materials, must increase. This is evident in the two charts as it indicates that the direct materials costs are higher in the budgeted performance with higher sales. It is followed by the variable cost in the chart, variable costs are the business expenses that changes according to the output or sales. Therefore it varies linearly with the output level. On most occasions, it decreases with the increase in production or sales, as depicted from the charts (Maheshwari, Maheshwari, and Maheshwari, 2021). The budgeted
plan with higher sales has a lower percentage of the variable cost than the actual plan with lower sales. It is closely followed by the fixed cost, which includes those costs that do not change when production or sales volume changes; they do not vary with the output volume. Always the total fixed cost does not change, and they remain within a given range.However, the cost per unit of fixed cost decreases with the increase in production because the exact fixed costs are spread over more units. This is evident in the charts above, as they shows that in the budgeted program, the fixed cost is 6.76%, and the actual program is 7.87%. Following is the distribution cost, which is associated with storing and delivering the products to the respective customers. These costs are incurred in getting the finished products to customers, for example, the cost of fuel and depreciation of the vehicle. They are directly related to the output level, as the output level increases, the distribution cost increases, as seen in the charts. The selling costs also form part of the business performance. It deals with the costs associated with getting orders or requests from customers. They include salaries and commissions paid to the sales and advertising agents. As the output increases, the need for many selling agents is necessary; therefore, it also increases but not proportionately to the output level.Ensuing is the administration cost, which involves paying salaries and wages and giving benefits to the non-sales individuals. It is also directly related to
the output volume. The Finance costs, which include the cost incurred by the management to secure funds for the organization’s activities, are also included in the costs. Finally, there is the cost of taxation which involves the charge by the government authority on the gross profit or loss of the company, including interest on debentures and dividends to shareholders. It is proportionately related to the output level as shown on the charts. As output increases, the tax also increases, thus its costs increases (Maheshwari, Maheshwari, and Maheshwari, 2021). From the above-analyzed data, we can say that both the business’s actual and planned performance is in the same line, and there is a slight diversion on the actual and intended outcome; hence, they are positively related in terms of profit goals of the company.Graphs Comparing the Budgeted Against the Actual PerformanceBudgeted Against Actual Sales.

They show the variance between the business plan and the actual outcome. From the graphs, we can see that the budgeted; sales, operating profit, gross profit, and the actual; sales, gross profit, operating profit exhibit the same trend. The budgeted parameters designates a constant increasing growth, while all the actual parameters show a fluctuating growth. The actual parameters have a steadily increasing growth from October to February. They reach their peak in January and starts dropping in February up to March and then start to pick again with a constant speed before they start increasing increasingly in May. The performance then starts to shoot at a higher rate from august to its pick in September.
and the users of the accounting information should practice the economic theories that form the basis of cost accounting to aid in influencing effective decision-making in large and small organizations. On the other hand, management accounting system has been seen as an evaluation tool that evaluates the profitability of individual products and product lines. Therefore, this approach should be applied in determining the relative performance and achievement of different managers under different categories, programs, and departments in the organization.The organization would increase its accountability throughout the departments and minimize unnecessary expenses or losses. Through the management accounting, the managers would know the work in progress on the production floor and their stages of completion. This helps the line manager in spotting the bottlenecks and maintain smooth running of the production process. Therefore, it would be feasible for companies or organizations that have not incorporated this system to incorporate it and for those that have already integrated it to employ the synergistic energy in advancing it for better performance.
Unfortunately, I have not been able to attend any event or concert with a cultural dance performance. However, I remember well the TV program, part of which was dedicated to New Zealand’s indigenous peoples and their unique culture. The event was filmed in New Zealand and was called the traditional Poi dance; the date of the event is unknown to me, but I watched the program in December 2021. It was not the first time I saw cultural dance performances, but it was one of the most impressive.Poi dance is performed by large groups of Maori men and women who perform synchronized dance moves. The movements are quite simple and include mainly stepping from one foot to the other and active movements of the arms and hands. Additionally, women often spin around their axis and also walk one after another in lines. Specific actions also include interaction with special balls, bars, and sticks by each woman as additional objects, as well as singing. The theme of this dance is the traditional culture of the Maori people, in particular the expression of joy and gratitude.The most important movement theme in this dance is the interaction with various objects such as balls, bars, and sticks. Each of the women starts the dance with small fluffy balls, then moves to short white bars, and then they are replaced by sticks. The rhythm is set throughout the dance by clapping and singing, and the interaction with these objects is the center of the action and determines the movement. For example,
A policy brief is a concise explanation of a particular issue. The brief policy aims at government policymakers or interested parties who shape or influence policy. A policy brief provides adequate background for the reader to comprehend the problem and persuade them to handle it immediately. It identifies the most effective solutions to the problem and gives data to back them up. The policy brief encourages the reader to make the best decision possible.A good policy brief should be concise and focused on meanings rather than procedures. The policy brief should concentrate on a single issue or concern and give enough evidence from multiple sources (“2022 NACo Legislative Conference Livestreams”, 2022).Policy Briefs on the State, Local and Federal Issue1st policy briefEscalating Food Prices – A national crisisAction to be taken to eliminate poverty and hungerEscalating food prices pose a problem to the poor, government of low-income countries with high import bills, and aids agencies managing increased demand for cash and food. The poor are unable to buy food. Low-income countries face political unrest. The problem emanates from a lack of better investment in the food industry and poor management of the national food supply (Lubell, 2021).What happens and why?Initially, food prices were affordable since the farmers and the government had invested a lot in the agriculture industry. Since 2000, food prices have started escalating due to the increased cost of fertilizers, farm machinery, and chemicals. An increase in food prices was due to increments in fuels prices.Impact on the poor, low-income counties and farming industriesThe poor
spend most of their income on food; hence escalating food prices contribute to high expenditure, which is not manageable. The higher food prices contribute to higher transport costs that affect farmers’ income. The low-income countries face pressure from the bills, leading to low economic development and growth (Lubell, 2021).Policy recommendationUrgent action is required to eliminate distress that emanates from escalating food prices, and more resources are needed to support WEP and assist developing countries with higher import bills. Relevant policies are required to help farmers produce more food.ConclusionThe correct measure is needed to control the food prices and promote economic growth. The government must regulate the oil prices to enable farmers and the agriculture industry to reduce their income-expenditure hence low food prices.2 nd policy briefNatural resources: climate change challengeThe change of climate has occurred recently in the countries that cannot handle the change. The developing countries are the most affected because they depend on natural resources. The countries face global warming due to industrialization. Effective management of the natural resources leads to climate and suitable development.Soil erosionMost of the lands are affected by soil erosion due to cutting down the trees and poor management of the environment, like poor cultivating and grazing practices.Low rainfallsLow rain leads to low crop production and desertification. It makes the farmers have difficulty planning crop cultivation, resulting in a developing country.Policy recommendationThe government protects the water catchment areas and natural forests within arid and semi-arid regions. The government promotes farm levels to mitigate climate change.ConclusionThe practical measures to be put

The promotion of the local products facilitates increments in the revenue.Policy recommendationThere is a need to improve access to the markets and develop sound transport systems, roads, and communication channels for more production and increased income generation.ConclusionThe best measures are required to facilitate income generation to satisfy the economy.Gun Violence in AmericaGun violence is violence through pistols, shotguns, and machine guns. The violence results in homicide, mass shooting, or suicide. In America, many people have died due to gun violence. Gun violence in America needs applicable background checks. Politicians and the concerned groups need to ensure federal regulation on gun ownership (Vernick et al., 2017). The government needs to involve a justice department to ensure anyone who violates the related laws on gun violence is prosecuted in court.The government and politicians have developed the necessary plan, such as no sales of firearms to unlicensed groups or individuals, licensing the company that sells the gun, and prohibiting individuals from carrying the weapon in public. The implementation of the federal regulations will minimize gun violence among Americans. The politician organized the congress to support the national laws governing machine guns’ licensing. If the set regulations are adhered to, there will be a reduction in gun violence in America (Vernick et al., 2017).
In the last decade, Chinese internet enterprises have grown at a breakneck pace. This is significant because, while the online world in China is well-known to be trapped behind the Great Wall, there may be another half of the issue that has been comparatively overlooked: the big three Chinese internet providers are also hybrid or blended in the global economies in general of the investment, possession, and control framework that supports them (Jia & Winseck, 2018). The Chinese administration’s determination to improve the nation’s communication network and tight influence and authority has fueled the internet’s fast expansion in China. However, China’s most recent phase of internet growth has been driven by a three-way interaction involving the State, internet enterprises, and foreign financial capital. While these mechanisms are now substantially altering the Chinese internet, they have not been adequately investigated in research journals.The term “financialization” contributes to the expanding significance of finance, financial markets, and investment firms in the functioning of the economy. Financialization has an influence on both the macroeconomic conditions and combines the features by altering the structure and operation of financial markets as well as affecting company behavior and economic policy. Financialization has also resulted in higher income growth in the financial sector than in the rest of the economy. Financial crises may cause lasting lost revenue, have a terrible impact on the poor and increase unemployment.
IntroductionJudicial determinations are the outcomes of events in which the adjudicators are constrained by defined rules, independent from extraneous influences, and bound by their social experiences or sensibilities. In Duncan Kennedy’s Freedom and Constraint in Adjudication: A Critical Phenomenology , the interpretation of the law is presented as a constant interchange between law and life. Consequently, most judicial decisions are obvious outcomes reflecting the legal arguments, presented facts, and the judge’s ideological commitments. However, Kennedy argues that adjudicators develop the desired outcome at the initial presentation of a dispute. As a result, the subsequent interpretation and analysis of the law attempt to support their sense of justice and substantiate their decisions to make the judgment acceptable. While this argument mirrors the inherent tension and interplay between life and the law, it underpins the unavoidability of the principle of political neutrality in adjudication processes. Although judges usually reach their decisions by observing the legal rules of judging and exercising their freedoms in making judicial choices, their experiences and social context often influence the outcome of cases.Duncan Kennedy’s Rejection of Political Neutrality in AdjudicationAdjudication is the process through which judicial officers exercise their authority to determine disputes. It encompasses judges’ interpretation of the law through the observance of the established legal constraints and the exercise of judicial choices in making determinations. Kennedy (526) contends that judicial processes reflect a constant interplay between freedom and constraint. Manko (2) corroborates this view and asserts that traditionally, adjudicators determine matters brought before them by interpreting and contextualizing the laws against the
suggestion implies that judges are, by law preprogrammed to deliver obvious conclusions through the objective interpretation of the applicable legal provisions (Klaasen 1). However, Kennedy (527) argues that the existing laws often do not provide definitive answers to a dispute, yet judges are required to make determinations. This would mean that adjudicators are technically barred from making some judicial determinations through the correct legal reasoning. According to van Domselaar (72), such fixation on the rules and principles reduces judicial proceedings to empty rituals performed towards determinate outcomes. Harris and Sen (242) posit that such a viewpoint contradicts the longstanding empirical observation that law and its application are never certain, clear, and exact but is variable and vague. With such imprecision, indeterminateness, and lack of clear right answers, it would be imprudent and unreasonable to expect judges to be politically neutral.
discusses the content of the law, the danger of foodborne illness, food pollution, and presents arguments supporting the position on the inefficiency of FSMA. The work focuses significantly on the fact that there is no evidence that the provisions of the law can make food healthier even though it was adopted.I do not believe that FSMA is ineffective, and although the law has several shortcomings, I do not support a colleague’s position. The influence of the law is already confirmed by the fact that it strengthens the responsibility of manufacturers for the quality of products. The proof of FSMA’s effectiveness is that thanks to it, manufacturers, packers, and importers are taking specific steps for the safety of the population (Yiannas, 2021). Moreover, drawing attention to the issue of food safety through FSMA is also important and influential for future improvements. Thus, it is possible to find evidence of the effectiveness of the law under consideration.Having considered the positions of the opposite sides of the debate, I am inclined to argue about the positive impact of FSMA on food quality and public health. Food can be contaminated at various stages of the supply chain. FSMA focuses on the initial point – manufacturers and sets specific requirements for them. Although the danger is still present at other locations, the law is an essential step for future security. It drew attention to the problem, and in the future, society should expect other measures to improve food safety.
could afford to live in private and government-owned rental houses. Generally, it can be argued that the programs have a great potential of incentivizing recipients to seek employment. For instance, most job opportunities are found in urban centers. Having an initiative that makes life affordable in the towns and provides cheap residential houses encourages people to seek jobs in the cities. The fact that people can save some money from their salary motivates most people as it allows them to grow economically.Following the COVID-19 pandemic, I perceive subsidized programs as essential for individual growth and the country’s economic growth. The pandemic, for instance, caused significant disruptions to international trade, the economies of most countries were destroyed, and most people were subjected to extreme poverty. Besides helping the poor afford a comfortable life, subsidies will enable the investors to re-establish their businesses and profit margins, therefore, rebuilding the country’s economy. In conclusion, subsidizing programs are of paramount essence in a country as they support citizens with low-income levels and promote investment schemes that aid in economic development.
Large Corporation in Modern TimesThe gist of Justice Stevens’ opinion in Citizens United verse Federal Election Commission is that organizations are lawfully created bodies that carry out activities and are allowed specific legal protections equivalent to those granted to people. The state determines their rights and privileges (Massey, 2016). According to Justice Stevens, the court’s majority decision to overturn a century of legislative restrictions on election spending by corporations and unions is based on the First Amendment’s protection of right to free speech, which applies only to genuine people and groups of persons.Companies supersede the nineteenth century, but their current incarnation and involvement in the community, political, and fiscal policy changed and developed so dramatically in the last era that it is difficult to comprehend. Contemporary social transformation without analyzing the importance businesses have played in cultural and social structure transformation (Massey, 2016). They own and manage the majority of the world’s wealth; they are a pillar of the economy and a means for accumulating riches.The Corporation’s History of TransmissionIn 1600, the British, the Dutch, and other successful trading firms functioned under state charter to collect cash for trips, facilitate business, and fight any opposition they confronted from other states’ trading firms and the residents at the places of their ventures. The British East India Firm, a privately run business, had more than two hundred and fifty thousand troops under its control at one time to complete its mission of establishing supremacy over the world (Massey, 2016. The British royal, such as the Dutch crown, leased
or subcontracted the empire to private corporations.How Large Corporations Direct Social ChangeIn at least five aspects, big businesses are a driving factor behind the social transformation. First, the companies are deeply involved in repurposing and discovering different uses for old technology and building discoveries that help and drive what we do as consumers. Secondly, companies have structured and opposed labor for more than a century, defining how work should be performed and the norms regulating professional life (Massey, 2016). Third, the management of capital and the aims for which capital is deployed determines their size and economic stability.Fourth, huge companies control the physical environment with their images, goods and services, and the sensitivities that push people to engage to the fullest of their capability in the realm of product consumption and beyond (Massey, 2016). Finally, corporations are vital to the political system, playing a significant role in promoting legislation that helps them and resisting policies that would limit or impede their ability to operate as privately operated, income businesses.Economic liberalization or nonregulation of financial activities, for instance, having the government do nothing. Those are some of their objectives in state intervention. Statistics and research are mobilized to show that any limits or regulations are pointless. Sometimes it is better for major firms that the issue never obtains an airing, rather than fighting back unpleasant recommendations regarding how the government should handle such concerns (Massey, 2016). Any hint of difficulty is disregarded simply as a non-issue or something that falls outside the government’s jurisdiction.Large Corporations and Resistance
to Social ChangeThere are barriers to social transformation in the major companies, just as there are instances of resistance to technology, social movements, and other agents of social transformation ( Massey, 2016). There is also opposition to the trend of societal transformation because of company practices. However, big firms are expected to maintain their affairs because they are part of the existing condition.For years, reporters and researchers attempted to understand why companies oppose or weaken measures to curb their influence over resources (Massey, 2016). Public interest groups have proposed limiting their control over tax policies and economic legislation, enacting more restrictions, and boosting administration and community supervision. Companies frequently successfully reject these regulations and any alteration to their activities, whether acting alone or through trade associations.The strong States and Social ChangeThe opportunity of the nation’s grew extensively with the exceptional of rebels and denial, nobody within the ideological range, self-governing and preservation disagreed that government should offer safety and physical security for its people or involve themselves in war. The current nations made and preserved the worth of the currency and control funds. States constructed and operated learning institutions, bridges, roads, waste treatment plants, and airstrips; it was a move that was regarded as the end of the Iris Summers lifetime (Massey, 2016). The United States enhanced hospitals, improved public resources, and prolonged people’s rights, which showed a great driver of social alteration since it provided solutions to the problems to its people.Public Health; Reducing Disease and Accidental Death as a Public GoodThe death rate in
IntroductionHuman beings maintain good health through practices such as eating balanced diets. Pregnant mothers need perfect nutrition not only for themselves, but also for their unborn babies too. The period not long before the birth of a child is referred to as the antepartum period, where mothers are encouraged to eat healthy diets to ensure the development and delivery of a child. Medical practitioners term nutrition as one among significant factors that contribute to a successful child delivery. According to Clark (2020), eating a balanced diet will provide nutrients for both the mother and the child. However, ladies are still exposed to malnutrition practices that are caused by various factors such as the level of income, awareness, and illness history. This essay discusses the risk factors of age, cultural, lifestyle, socio economic, and dietary complications during the pregnancy period.Nutritional Risk FactorsAge-related Factor: TeenageThe age of a pregnant mother can have a significant impact on the nutrition habits. Young girls, especially under the age of 20 are associated with poor eating habits (Nana & Zema, 2018). Stickler states that teenage mothers are at a higher risk than those over 20. Pregnant mothers require a variety of vitamins and minerals that are necessary for both body and child development. Teenagers like eating snacks and a lot of starch foods such as fries, thus leaving their bodies imbalanced with nutrients. It would definitely be hard for a teenager to strictly follow a diet schedule compared to a mature woman of about 30 years. Because nutrients are not produced naturally, one must obtain them through eating. When the body does not receive enough nutrients, that is a nutritional deficiency (Nana & Zema, 2018). Teen-aged mothers get exposed to risks such as low birth-weight and premature delivery due to poor nutrition habits during the antepartum period.
President Franklin Roosevelt did much to end the Great Depression, which included passing acts and laws. They were aimed not only at restoring the economy and infrastructure but also at improving the situation of certain groups of the population. They included immigrants, African Americans, and workers, creating health clinics, special courses, college buildings, new schools, and recreation facilities, thus, increasing their quality of life.The first act I would like to analyze is the creation of the Public Works Administration (PWA). It was a Federal American Agency created during the New Deal by President Franklin Roosevelt (Corbett, 2014). This act not only contributed to recreation from the Great Depression but also provided workers, immigrants, and African Americans with workplaces and necessary social infrastructure. The act was specialized in building and public works, which formulated an improvement in the industrial field as well.The next act I have chosen to consider is Agricultural Adjustment Act (AAA). This act focused on the improvement of agricultural fields by providing farmers who decreased their land compensation (Week 6 Lesson, 2022). Thus, the president managed not only to engage people to participate in the agricultural spectrum but also promoted improvement of the African American, immigrants, and workers conditions. It helped farmers as prices for corps raised; thus, the business became more profitable. However, there was another side to the coin as people had to pay more money to buy it.In my opinion, the New Deal made a significant contribution to the recovery from the Great Depression. There were created many agencies aimed at the improvement of different fields. Moreover, the government attempted to control wages and prices and established many programs for vulnerable population layers and unemployed people.
Pressure ulcers are a common occurrence in the medical field, affecting patients that are immobile due to illness or injury, or the elderly that typically have less mobility. A pressure ulcer can be defined as localized damage to the skin and soft tissue underneath as a result of intense or prolonged pressure, or pressure combined with shear. The prevalence of pressure ulcers has remained relatively consistent in the United States, affecting nearly 3 million adults. However, healthcare costs have been increasing and pressure ulcers, if left untreated, can cause severe health issues such as localized or general infection, or necrosis. Approximately 60,000 people die from pressure ulcer adverse outcomes each year (Mervis and Phillips, 2019).Pressure ulcers can occur both during hospital stay or after discharge during homecare. Many housebound adults who may be immobile due to age, injury, post-surgery recovery, or other illnesses are at-risk to develop pressure ulcers. Unlike in hospitals, there is no regular nurse presence to aid in changing of positioning, dressings, or identifying ulcers early on. Therefore, literature indicates thatan effective solution for adults in community settings is the use of pressure reducing surfaces. At the most primitive level, there are recommendations to use pillow, cushions, or mattress pads to reduce the pressure and support the area (MedlinePlus, 2020).More complex interventions would be the use of pressure reducing support surfaces. This is identified as durable medical equipment (DME) and used to care for pressure sores and ulcers. Pressure reducing support surfaces can be split into three groups dependent on complexity. Group 1 are surfaces meant to replace the mattress or serve as an overlay include specialized mattresses, pressure pads, and overlays from foam, water, or gel. Group 2 is similar but includes more complex devices such air flotation beds and powered pressure reducing mattresses. Finally, Group 3 are complete bed systems including air-fluidized beds which use circulation of filtered air (United Healthcare, 2021). Pressure reducing support surfaces are meant to prevent pressure ulcers or contribute to the healing of existing sores. This is achieved by limiting tissue interface pressure to the best possible extent, most often by improving circulation and conforming to the contours of the body and spreading pressure over wider areas of the body (Rae, Isbel and Upton, 2018). There is a general consensus among literature that active and reactive support surfaces are effective in prevention and treatment of pressure ulcers.
The process of recruiting employees is vital since it determines the type of workforce and skills organizations will have to accomplish their goals and objectives. Companies’ managers and recruiters focus on hiring diverse teams to ensure that their firms are more innovative creative and achieve better results. Undeniably, a workforce comprising individuals from different backgrounds and perspectives contributes significantly to newer and diverse ideas that are instrumental in solving problems and driving innovation. Nevertheless, fairness or diversity, attracting the right candidates, the establishment of a strong employer brand, engaging qualified candidates, and efficiency are prevalent concerns in the recruitment process. An evaluation of these challenges can help design strategies to address them.Many organizations experience problems attracting and hiring diverse candidates due to unconscious bias. Companies have legal obligations to offer equal opportunities to all individuals regardless of applicants’ gender, age, religion, or ethnicity (Horváth & Szabó, 2019). However, unconscious bias during the recruitment process can increase risks for legal litigations and deprive companies of a chance to hire and retain the best persons for particular jobs.Attracting suitable candidates and engaging the most qualified ones is also a significant concern in recruiting. Higher chances are that qualified and unqualified candidates apply for jobs once companies advertise vacancies. It becomes challenging to find the right candidate, primarily when a pool of applicants comprises unskilled talent (Fuller et al., 2021). Consequently, the recruiting managers may end up choosing the best individual they can find at the time but not the best fit for the position. Conversely, different recruiters regularly
maintaining efficiency is an additional challenge experienced in the recruitment process. The hiring team should effectively communicate, quickly evaluate the candidates, and be aware of what is happening in every step (Stuss, Stańczyk & Wziątek-Staśko, 2018). However, possible strained relationships between the hiring managers and the recruiters may be a significant issue with adverse impacts on the process. Administrative tasks may also deprive the recruiting team of valuable time to ensure a good candidate experience.Different approaches can help address the concerns in the recruitment process. One can prevent the issue of unconscious bias by using techniques such as utilizing blind hiring software and structured interviews. Being clear and concise about requirements and roles in the job adverts and researching what motivates qualified candidates can help attract and engage the latter. Being a good employer, courteously responding to online reviews, encouraging coworkers to share their positive work experience and what they like can be an instrumental approach for establishing an exceptional employer brand. Installation of an applicant tracking system (ATS) can ensure efficiency in the recruitment process by coordinating the hiring team.
both into the business and out of the business operations. Therefore, cash flow is considered as attainable operational balance and conclusive monetary coverage (Sitompul & Khadijah, 2020). While cash flow existence can occur without necessarily a firm gaining a profit, the existence of profit is only estimated after a positive balance of trade. It is believable that the firm’s cash flow and profit are essential aspects. For instance, understanding both will allow the company manager to gauge the firm’s operational capabilities while ensuring that the business can stand on its feet in terms of paying for its expenses. Additionally, while profit indicates positive returns to the company, cash flow indicates positive operations that contribute to desirable business decisions.As a technology manager, I would be keeping an eye on innovation and incorporating the same into operation while focusing on the cost factor. According to Elia et al. (2021), the cost factor is the main aspect to focus on when a firm needs to be innovative. For instance, cost consideration is critical as it will minimize resulting friction from the extended cost that might jeopardize entire operations. Cost consideration will be my major aspect to focus on in my venture.
The introduction of project management standards is vital for any organization as it will improve collaboration between employees and goal achievement. Thus, the recommended strategy focuses on creating the roadmap for the project. It should imply working with interim goals and a final purpose (Kerzner, 2017). Thus, the standards should include improved teamwork, the discussion between team members, and the attainment of high standards and outcomes via collaborative effort. The first standard is critical for any organization as an aligned work of teams is vital for their evolution. The employees should be provided with the opportunity and tools to create high-performance groups and engage in interaction and decision-making. For instance, Basecamp can be employed as an application to create a platform for workers to discuss current tasks and share information (Biafore, 2020). Adding them to specific groups will help to distribute tasks and attain outlined standards.Moreover, the collaborative effort can be managed by creating clear lists of deliverables and presenting them to teams. Providing them with information about current goals and tasks will result in higher awareness and better distribution of responsibilities, which is vital for meeting new standards and promoting positive outcomes. In such a way, the recommended strategy implies focusing on improving group work and introducing standards such as cooperation and collaboration by using available tools, such as Basecamp. It will allow individuals to discuss various aspects of their work, share information related to specific goals, and create smaller teams regarding the existing requirements (Kerzner, 2017). Following the given strategy, it is possible to achieve significant improvement in performance and ensure the company will move forward to achieving new goals.
Justice is important in a country and should be applied equally in crime and social setup. Social justice demands that everyone be given equal economic, political, and social rights regardless of their social class or race background (Chisholm-Burns et al., 2021). During John F. Kennedy’s presidential campaign in 1965, he was unhappy with children loitering on the streets while others were in school. John F. Kennedy saw the need to develop a learning culture for all children in the United States. Ending the helplessness in children would require disrupting the culture of poverty that was passed from generation to generation through education. The move to operate Head Start was to promote social justice in education for children. Head Start was initiated and started in the summer of 1965 by Lyndon Baines Johnson (Pillay, 2018). This essay will discuss the role of the Head Start program in the promotion of social justice in the US, focusing on the values taught to the children and the activities that constitute the program.Social justice promotion through Head Start is seen through its initiative to instill cognitive and emotional development of children from low low-income families below five years in preparation for school. The children under the program would not go to school if they were denied the opportunity (Johnson & Jackson, 2019). The children at the program are taught life-long skills of observing social justice for all races and backgrounds.The program’s selection process is an open and justifiable process. When a family is selected for the program, support is provided
depending on the family’s needs. Case officers make frequent visits to the homes to see how best they can help the families. The needs that can be addressed range from health problems and parenting skills to drug abuse and alcoholism. The social workers’ focus on the selected families is maintained to the issues identified.Head Start provides clinical services to the selected families. Head Start provides counseling to individuals and children either in groups or singly, depending on the needs of the families. The program’s other clinical services include diagnosing health problems such as anxiety or depression, among other health complications (Williams et al., 2018). Mental health problems are common in low-income families due to difficulty meeting their daily needs. The social workers working with the program are highly qualified and can offer psychological assessments to the families and visit them at home to provide counseling and intervention in crisis cases (Nix et al., 2018). The officers can review the family’s needs upon new discoveries and support the family in other initially not included needs.To provide equal opportunities to the community, the program social officers organize outreach activities in schools, community gatherings, and churches to educate the community about Head Start activities. Educating the community about Head Start allows every family that qualifies to enroll in the program to have a chance to be assisted. The outreach team distributes enrollment forms that provide the requirements for a family and child to be registered to the program (Gatewood, 2019). The social officers encourage the attendants of the organized
to know the progress of the families and children following the needs registered at first. The Head Start program might withdraw a family from the program in cases of change in social class, and a needy family on the waiting list is added to provide equal opportunities for the community. The documents for income verification and treatment plans are checked often to keep only the families that truly deserve the services.In conclusion, when we speak of social justice in early childhood education, we must consider the importance of understanding what it means and what is required to have equality in early childhood education. Head Start bridges the gap between children aged below five in preparation for their school attendance. Social justice should not end with Head Start after the children surpass the requirement age. Teachers in various schools should teach the correct values that promote social justice through leading by example and theoretically instilling the right values in children. Society should condemn discrimination of any nature due to socioeconomic status or privilege by teaching good morals to the young generation.
Purpose of the StudyCOVID-19 has shaped the global economic context significantly. Head Start, an initiative that has been providing educational opportunities, as well as focus on healthy nutrition and management of public health issues in children in families affected by the coronavirus, illustrates how the outcomes of COVID-19 have shaped the performance of non-profit organizations, causing them to adjust to the environment of the online setting. This study aims to analyze the coronavirus’s impact on educational and health management opportunities for children in families affected by COVID-19 in the U.S., providing solutions to the current problem by providing educational opportunities and social support to the target demographic.Literature ReviewHistorical ReviewThe coronavirus has brought changes that would have been deemed as otherwise unimaginable to the setting of the global economy. Specifically, the complete transfer to the online context and the readjustment of strategies for managing financial resources have been essential change that has affected the performance of multiple organizations (Wilke et al., 2020). Notably, due to the comparative recency of the pandemic becoming a global problem, the history of the issue at hand, namely, the effects of COVID-19 on early childhood education and health management, is quite brief (Wilke et al., 2020).Specifically, some of the earliest studies show that the variables in question are deeply interconnected as the pandemic has drastically changed resource allocation (Wilke et al., 2020). As a result, a range of early childhood education projects has been lacking the necessary funding (Wilke et al., 2020). Similarly, the management of public health issues in children has
been affected by COVID-19 since a sizeable amount of financial resources had to be allocated to address the health crisis (Wilke et al., 2020). However, the exact relationships between the variables in question are yet to be discovered.In turn, the issue of early childhood education has been the subject of multiple discussions for quite some time. The developmental significance of providing children with early education opportunities has been examined since the 17 th century and has been actively explored since the 1930s (Silalahi, 2019). With the emergence of theories of early childhood education created by Vygotsky, Piaget, and Eriksson, strategies for encouraging the rapid emergence of critical thinking and related academic skills in young children have been devoiced (Silalahi, 2019). In their frameworks, the researchers in question specified different developmental stages, explaining the nature and course of cognitive progress (Silalahi, 2019). Therefore, understanding these theories is central to examining the effects of external factors, such as the pandemic, on early childhood development opportunities.Recognizing the role that external factors play in children’s cognitive development is central to building the framework for their successful learning and identifying the effects that the pandemic, with the relevant changes in the Head Start opportunities, has produced on children’s academic options. Therefore, Vygotsky’s developmental framework is vital for examining the variables in question. According to the theorist, social interactions represent the key to effective early childhood development and learning, the zone of proximal development defining the range of skills a child can embrace at a specific time (Silalahi, 2019). Therefore, in the
context of the pandemic and the drop in social interactions, the opportunities for enhancing early education are significantly reduced.Similarly, the theoretical framework created by Piaget emphasizes the importance of building cognitive skills at an early age. However, Piaget’s approach suggests the focus on individual learning as opposed to knowledge development through social interactions, which allows suggesting that the lack of Head Start opportunities may not be as devastating to the opportunities for young learners as one might have believed it to be.Finally, the concept of social support that Head Start offers needs to be reviewed as a critical, independent variable. The subject matter has been examined through the lens of the recent changes in social services, particularly the outcomes of the coronavirus (Jalongo, 2021). Specifically, the issues regarding the increase in staff turnover, a rise in workplace burnout, and the resulting unavailability of quality care need to be examined.It is worth noting that the current body of knowledge lacks evidence concerning the effects of the pandemic on the quality of early education and the development of cognitive skills in children. The specified lack f information is understandable given the relatively short time span over which the pandemic has managed to engulf most the social interactions on global and interpersonal levels. Furthermore, there is a considerable lack of information concerning the specific effects of the absence of Head start opportunities on children’s early development. Therefore, further analysis of the specified concerns is strongly needed to identify perspectives for future early childhood education.Current FindingsAt the same time, believing
that the issue of supporting children academically and socially has not been seen as an issue with strong research potential lately. For example, the study by Sciberras et al. (2020) has investigated the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic on the physical and mental health of children in Australia, thus, producing essential results. Furthermore, despite the gap in the analysis of the effects of the levels of social security, particularly the provision of education options and health maintenance opportunities, especially in regard to Head Start services, several studies have outlined the drastic effects of the coronavirus on the quality, efficacy, and frequency of support provided for young learners (Jalongo, 2021).Specifically, the paper by Li et al. (2020) denotes the presence of multiple obstacles in addressing the accessibility of early education opportunities and health management services for families affected by the coronavirus (Jalongo, 2021). Nonetheless, the issue needs to be explored further in order to identify the exact nature of the problem and the current range of concerns that young learners have in accessing learning options and healthcare services.MethodologyTo address the issues raised above, meticulous and profound research will be required. Specifically, the mixed research method will have to be adopted to gauge the coronavirus’s exact effect on the opportunities for children and their families, as well as the extent of challenges that Head Start has been facing in providing the services in question to the target demographic. Specifically, the qualitative analysis will allow for determining the essential factors impeding the provision of vital education and healthcare opportunities
of violence such as robbery or homicide when compared to people that live at a farther distance from these locales. Programs such as HOPES provide these individuals with answers to troubling questions involving why the cases are more rampant in their locale. It is also important to consider the potential for these programs to illustrate the safety level of a particular location based on activities such as drug trafficking and police presence. This information is critical in enabling possible victims to make logical decisions concerning their living conditions and predisposing them to various forms of violence.The writer asserts that the criminal justice system does not protect victims against possible repeat attacks. It is important to discern that women are considered rape victims in most instances. One should note that studies such as those conducted by Kopel in 1987(Karmen, 2020) do not focus on male victims, illustrating the flawed nature of this system. While males encompass a section of this population, they are not listed in the statistics. It is also crucial to note that black individuals are more prone to experience any form of crime when compared to their white counterparts (Karmen, 2020). Discerning such information allows programs such as HOPES to target particular communities and neighborhoods while providing aid.
IntroductionThe vague language of the current Intermountain Healthcare (IH) description of PC results in insufficient elaboration of specific nursing responsibilities such as quality of patient life, caregiver support, and non-discriminant patient treatment. A comprehensive PC policy has not been adopted in the IH facilities, leaving care teams to devise an individual approach to each terminal patient, which may be inefficient and result in subpar service. Across the country, many HCPs lack knowledge and skills in pain and symptom management, communication, and care coordination, while the public has only a vague understanding of the benefits of PC and how to access them (Meier et al., 2017). Given a wide range of responsibilities in providing palliative care (PC) and lack of specific instructions, IH healthcare providers (HCPs) filling only primary orders such as medical prescriptions may coincidentally neglect some care aspects. Therefore, an instructive PC policy is needed to facilitate successful administration and ensure equitable access to care services in the IH facilities.Current PolicyDue to the lack of an established PC policy, most details were obtained from annual reports and public website sections. Palliative care in IH facilities pursues several goals: quality of patient life, symptom relief, family and caregiver support, and a team approach to care and care aligned with patients’ aspirations (Intermountain Healthcare, 2018). However, the current key goal is for HCPs to focus on managing pain and other symptoms like nausea or sleep problems (Intermountain Healthcare, 2020b). None of the listed elements are thoroughly elaborated, including the key goal. Intermountain Healthcare (2022) nursing services for
end-of-life care include symptom assessment, “skilled services and treatments,” and situational management. In addition to nursing care, patients and their families can expect the care team to cover counseling, emotional and spiritual support, medication and supplies, domestic helper services, and home care in acute need (Intermountain Healthcare, 2022). The nuances are to be addressed in a plan of care (POC), jointly created by the care team and the patient based on the diagnosis, symptoms, and other needs (Intermountain Healthcare, 2022). However, it is unclear what ‘skilled services’ constitute or how detailed POCs are.Literature ReviewScholars in medical and legal research encourage the development of detailed palliative care policies. Supporting this initiative, IH developed a hospital-based electronic palliative care algorithm to improve the identification of patients benefitting from PC services and calculate PC penetration rates (Gruhler et al., 2018). The algorithm then indicated that the need for receiving PC might be as high as 26.4% of the total IH inpatient population (Gruhler et al., 2018). It will be progressively more challenging for HCPs to devise individualized care plans for IH patients with as high and potentially increasing numbers. Therefore, an approach with great universal applicability is needed to meet this demand.Furthermore, the policy focus should be on restructuring service delivery as a whole. Palmryd et al. (2021) found that nurses caring for intensive care unit patients did not prioritize integrity, arguing that more explicit guidelines are required to ameliorate the issue. This issue may apply to the IH facilities, given that extant IH guidance on PC does not
identify the expectations and responsibilities of each party. Thus, the research mandates a policy change to guide productive communication between providers and patients.Additionally, the lack of a universal, comprehensive PC opens a leeway for bias. A striking finding was that patients’ quality of end-of-life care might depend on the disease the patient suffers (Martinsson et al., 2018). At the same time, Spraker-Perlman et al. (2019) found that IH patients without known critical conditions (CC) benefit significantly from PC support before their death just as much as patients without CC. Therefore, the research necessitates ensuring that the non-discriminant approach to PC provision is specified in the policy.Lastly, blaming IH nurses for negligence is impractical, given their inability to assist sometimes. The outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic has demonstrated that the lack of resources and nursing burnout contribute to the increased negligence in PC (Human Rights Watch, 2021). In its Annual Report (2020a), IH recognized that its caregivers focused on creating personal protective equipment (PPE) assembly lines, with their regular duties seeing a significant decrease in hours because of the pandemic. This situation mandates ensuring that nurses can meet the care requirements. Hence, the policy to improve patient care should involve reconsidering the carer support system, as nurses’ workload can interfere with the quality and quantity of services provided.Discussion OutlineA detailed assessment of contributing factors, strategic goals, and budget plan will be required to create and implement the policy successfully. The policy should ensure even responsibility distribution and uphold an appropriate accountability standard for non-compliance. It should provide
an appropriate level of detail in each aspect and implement enforcement mechanisms to avoid regular duties suffering due to negligence. Moreover, sufficient staffing in every establishment is mandatory to avoid situations where IH staff is overwhelmed with double duty. Overall, the proposed approach should create concrete and explicit guidelines regulating nursing staff responsibilities in end-of-life care, a comprehensive support network for HCPs and patients, and specific instances of accountability.DemographicsThe COVID-19 pandemic highlighted that curative care is currently at the core of provider-patient interaction over any PC aspect. During an acute crisis, hundreds of IH staff members were sent to help in New York hospitals (Intermountain Healthcare, 2020a). The crisis may have passed, but the question of which duties take priority remains, which may be overwhelming for the IH facilities staff. Therefore, the major demographic that policy changes can affect will be nursing staff needing explicit guidance on responsibilities and expectations. Further, the inpatient population of the IH facilities will be experiencing the consequences of the changed PC routine.Morbidity and Mortality RatesNot addressing the issue of inadequate PC may impact mortality rates significantly. Gruhler et al. (2018) estimate 90 million Americans currently living with serious, life-threatening illnesses and expect the number to double within 25 years. There is strong evidence of PC reducing acute unplanned hospitalizations and specialized PC services associated with improved short- and long-term care outcomes (Sleeman et al., 2021). Therefore, improving the policy approach to specialist palliative care would improve patient outcomes.Disparities Resulting from the Current PolicyThe poorly recognized role of end-of-life care in
2021). The major stakeholders are HCPs and terminally ill patients in IH facilities, both groups being receptive to potential policy changes.CostsThe costs of implementing a PC health policy have been scarcely investigated in recent years. Increasingly, though still limited, evidence supports the efficacy and cost-effectiveness of specialized PC (Sleeman et al., 2021; May et al., 2021). Patients who receive early specialized PC show improvements in a range of outcomes, including physical symptom control, survival, and quality of life, and caregivers report increased satisfaction and decreased depression (Sleeman et al., 2021). Moreover, appropriate and timely provision of PC likely lowers overall healthcare expenses (May et al., 2021). Therefore, the costs of keeping current HCPs and effectively helping patients in IH facilities may be reduced by implementing a new policy.
Cryptocurrencies are a controversial topic in society, as their volatility puts their long-term validity into question. However, older blockchain coins have failed to deliver a scalable and secure currency that will be as decentralized as possible (Hamilton, 2022). Unlike Bitcoin and Etherium, Solana has multiple advantages that make it a worthwhile investment. For this proposal, I would like to highlight the benefits of this cryptocurrency to a business university graduate.Solana is not the newest cryptocurrency, yet it is one with the highest potential. Other blockchains possess a small capacity for transactions, as their operations per second make them unfeasible (Locke, 2021). However, this currency transfers faster and has incomparably small transaction fees (Farrington, 2021). An investment in Solana is a safer choice among cryptocurrencies, yet it has the potential to multiply one’s savings. Safety and speed of transactions are the reasons behind the high chances for future widespread usage of Solana (Hamilton, 2022). My proposed idea is to capitalize on Solana’s recent success on the market, as this currency was up 12000% in the past year (Locke, 2021). I think that this subject deserves more attention, as cryptocurrencies provide a unique take on financial interactions, yet their current state disallows companies to utilize them efficiently. Solana has the potential to overcome these barriers and turn into a globally accepted currency.In conclusion, Solana is a cryptocurrency that is worth one’s attention, as it has several benefits that make it a better choice for investment than other similar coins. Its current solid position on the market and strong backing from a cryptocurrency community is a perfect indication of future prospects. It might be necessary to analyze Solana’s carbon footprint to prove its potential for a long-term success.
It is no surprise to anyone that professional sport is inseparable from monumental physical and mental challenges. High-profile athletes across disciplines have spoken up on how excruciating training, ongoing lifestyle restrictions, social isolation, and an inevitable race against time have affected their mental well-being during and after their sports careers. Most of these struggles are, to a degree, unavoidable, but an impossible standard of never-ending endurance that athletes have to face outside of practice and championships has undoubtedly made them even harder. The New York Times article Simone Biles Rejects a Long Tradition of Stoicism in Sports (2021) comments on the standard and the way American gymnast Simone Biles rejected it during the Summer Olympic Games 2020. It explores the tense and complex question of emotional vulnerability in big sports and the cost of such vulnerability.Right at the beginning, the article acknowledges the cultural shift toward acceptance of mental struggles both in general and particularly in athletes. An athlete of Simone Biles’ stature ten years ago, or even five years ago, might have been hesitant to admit that she battled with pressure, much less withdraw in the middle of an Olympic competition. Simone’s decision to quit the largest international event in the sports world has made her a poster figure of the relevant yet uncomfortable conversation. Success in sports, as well as in many other fields, is impossible without self-discipline and willingness to struggle. Yet, which point is considered a respectable place to pause and allow oneself to recover? After her pivotal decision, Simone has experienced
been taken seriously early enough.The article proceeds to recite the comments of Sian Beilock, the president of Barnard College, who studies the dynamic between outside pressures and the minds of athletes and business people. According to Beilock, the growing willingness of athletes to speak up proves that mental health issues touch everyone. Biles, Osaka, and others’ open admissions are, according to Beilock, essential in the ongoing endeavor to destigmatize the questions of mental health issues (Longam, 2021). If a renowned and successful athlete can experience anxiety, depression, and struggle with pressure in general, then regular people should not put unrealistic expectations on themselves.It can be devastating for an athlete to perform poorly at the most anticipated and public moment of their career. As such, admitting the pressure and taking a step back might be a smart decision not only within the moment but for the long-term trajectory of an athlete’s ongoing path in their chosen sport. Sustainable lasting success and consistent performance are only possible when a person recognizes and accepts their limits. There is no shame in needing the help of others, as well as there is bravery in admitting the fact and adjusting current actions. At the end of the day, unnecessary endurance does not necessarily reflect greater resolve within championships. As everyone has their resources, it is essential to utilize them in optimal ways without ignoring the basic needs of the human psyche.
It is important to note that psychopharmacology is a critical field of knowledge and expertise for any independent mental health practitioner. The main reason is the fact that psychopharmacology is a science-based study of medications and drugs on human psychology. It is becoming increasingly necessary for a mental health practitioner to be familiar and knowledgeable about pharmacological aspects of the treatment of mental issues.As a future independent mental health practitioner, one must be fully equipped with skills and competencies in treating clients’ mental health problems, which is impossible without pharmacological interventions. It is stated that “even though psychiatrists represent the branch of medicine that specializes in psychopharmacology, they are directly responsible for providing only a fraction of professional services to the mentally ill” (Preston et al., 2021, p. 13). In other words, no treatment can be effective if the dedicated specialists are outsourcing the prescription of drugs to non-psychiatric professionals. In order to help clients to overcome stigma about mental disorders and medication, it is important “to bring up the topic in a preemptive way, at the time when the prescription is first written” (Preston et al., 2021, p. 66). In other words, a mental health practitioner needs to help patients weigh the pros and cons in an informed manner. Since non-adherence is a major problem when it comes to medications, one can help clients to comply with the prescriptions by giving “patients (and parents) time to really explore any concerns or worries that they might have about the psychiatric medication being recommended” (Preston et al., 2021, p. 67). Therefore, it is likely that patients will be cautious of drugs, which is why their concerns need to be heard, voiced and evaluated.In conclusion, psychopharmacology is becoming critically important for an independent mental health practitioner. Medications play a major role in ensuring proper treatment measures. Thus, clients require assistance and informed education about their options.
In the piece under review, Putnam seeks to investigate the nature of pain, specifically, to identify whether it is a brain state or not. He highlights the dissimilarity of brain structure in various forms of life through the example of an octopus and a mammal, from which the difference in their “physical-chemical” functionality emerges (Putnam, p. 56). Simply stated, the ways activity occurs in the brain may differ from one type of it to another. This, according to Putnam, drives to the conclusion that physical responses most living creatures demonstrate, including pain, are not exclusively brain states.An essential nuance, at which the thinker points, is that such reactions normally manifest themselves in particular behavior that enables detecting the state. For instance, it is possible to guess that a certain organism is experiencing pain, hunger, uncomfortable temperature, or other from its movements or the sounds it is emitting (Putnam, p. 56). This serves to prove that the states are not limited to changes in brain activity, but can also determine its bodily equivalent; therefore, it is more reasonable to consider them complex. Specifically, the term Putnam offers to classify basic physiological response to irritants, which interfere with the well-being of an organism, is “a functional state” (p. 54). His hypothesis tells that to feel pain, a living creature needs to possess an appropriate type of functional organization, which actually determines this condition, making it physically possible.In the simplest terms, Putnam rejects the identical nature of mental and physical properties, which two hypothetically are intertwined up to inseparability.
Coronavirus disease is a rapidly growing worldwide pandemic due to severe pulmonary and syndrome coronavirus 2, henceforth increased pessimism and high loss of lives. It was first discovered in Wuhan (China) in a cluster of pneumonia patients with acute respiratory illness. The pandemic presents an unrivaled challenge to public healthcare and food systems (Alcendor, 2020). As governments try to curb this scourge through border closures, trade restrictions, and confinement measures, it has crippled economies. Beyond impacting the economy and healthcare, it has debilitating effects on many families globally.Disparities in knowledge, attitudes, and practices (KAPs) levels exist regarding COVID. White people are perceived to likely have high knowledge and confidence associated with a high level of education and income compared to their non-white counterparts, who were likely to have a low level of education and attitude but are viewed as high practice responders (Alcendor, 2020). Race, sex, education, income, health insurance status, and political views are all associated with KAPs.Hispanic and African- Americans have a higher infection rate and the number of deaths, despite being minority races. African-Americans had many deaths in Chicago and Louisiana despite being a minority, consisting of roughly a third of the population. These undermine the social determinants in health, socio-economic disparities, and prevalent racial disparities in health outcomings in the USA. In NEW YORK, 34% of COVID-related deaths were Hispanics, who consist of almost a third of the population (Alobuia et al., 2020).Concerning knowledge of COVID, a higher percentage of white people had a slightly higher knowledge than Hispanics or African-Americans, who
IntroductionMovies about racial tensions and the effects of significant tragic events take up a large portion of cinematography. Their creators send a particular message through films using verbal and silent visual signs. The movie Crash is an example of a media piece with a strong anti-racism message while showing how ingrained it is in every community – even those who face it themselves. It has a diverse cast of characters that hold their own biases against other groups and even members of communities to which they would say they belong. The use of verbal and nonverbal communication in Crash creates the picture of post-9/11 America plagued by mistrust, hatred, and fear, which is intensified by people’s inability to see their own prejudices.Communication Model, Co-culture Interactions, and Biases in Verbal CommunicationThe variety of racial and class distinctions between the characters creates an opportunity for many co-culture interactions and problems during communication. The movie features young and older adults, black, Hispanic, Latino, white, and Middle Eastern characters with low-, middle-, and high-income lifestyles. According to the communication model, the person sending the message encodes it, and the recipient of this message has to decode it to gain its meaning. Each step in this process is influenced by one’s relationship, culture, knowledge, attitude, communication skills, noise, and much more (Jandt 71). As a result, one message can be encoded and decoded in seemingly endless ways.A simple explanation of the problem can turn into an argument and a perception of a threat. In Crash , characters often start arguing due
to their inability to encode and decode messages. For example, Farhad is a Persian-American man with limited English skills. Due to his appearance and speech, most locals perceive him as an Arab foreigner, and they show hostility spurred by the recent September 11 attacks. He is similarly tense and aggressive towards anyone who doubts his American identity. However, his inability to speak English also leads him to misunderstand any negative news as a personal attack. When Daniel Ruiz, a locksmith, tries to explain to Farhad that the man needs to change the door rather than the lock to protect his shop, Farhad is confused, which leads to him suspecting Ruiz of being a scammer. In this case, the unsuccessful process of decoding a message leads to conflict.However, messages can be specifically coded to show belonging to or distancing from a group. For instance, one can compare the speech of Anthony, Peter, and Cameron. These characters are black, but Anthony and Peter are low-income young men, and Cameron is a famous and rich television director. One can see that Anthony and Peter often use constructions and terms from African-American Vernacular English (AAVE), while Cameron does not use AAVE and uses mostly standard English grammar. Here, the correlation between class and culture is posed both as a stereotype imposed on characters and something they continue to uphold as a part of self-identification. When a white colleague of Cameron notes that one of the actors does not speak “black enough,” Cameron initially protests but then gives in as he
horizontal analysis. Therefore, this section will seek to explore the pros and cons of the mentioned financial analysis tools. Ratio analysis helps in the determination of efficiency in operations and in analyzing the financial budget of the organization. However, the ratio analysis tool is useful only when the competitor organization is of the same size and type. Similarly, it ignores the current and future data trends and focuses on past data hence, not an effective analysis tool. The vertical financial analysis tool provides an easier way to compare financial statements within an organization as well as between different organizations. Nevertheless, the vertical analysis tool does not measure the liquidity of the organization.The horizontal analysis tool allows for easy interpretation of organizations’ comprehensive information as well as monitoring growth and financial patterns. Nevertheless, horizontal analysis is seen as inconsistent due to ever-changing accounting principles and factors. Financial statement analysis facilitates the financial plans and management of an organization by reviewing the cash flows, liability, business trends, and budget preparation. Different financial statement analysis methods are utilized in an attempt to obtain organizational data and information regarding the assets, liabilities, profits garnered, losses incurred, growth, and competition patterns.
The study of historical facts about the fall of empires and republics still attracts the interest of many researchers. This is due to the fact that the acquired knowledge can give valuable insight and help solve some problems in the modern world. Thus, this scientific paper aims at how a series of racing strong military men and inter-class conflict influenced the fall of the Roman Republic. I believe that both structural and individual problems contributed to its fall. This is because they are in a direct relationship with each other. An example may be the wrong decisions made by the ruler about economic policy, which will lead to a downturn in the economy and discontent among citizens. Thus, this can cause subsequent problems with an incorrect solution, of which many problems can also accumulate. This is precisely what happened to the Roman Republic, where the causes and consequences of problems influenced the disappearance of the empire.It was one of the main reasons for the fall of the Roman Republic, which led to other events that were problems related to the economy. They followed after the end of multiple conquests and smoothly turned into political ones. As is already known, thanks to historical sources, the final point was the murder of Caesar. As a consequence of the multiple expansions of the lands of government, Roman citizens no longer had to pay taxes. However, this wealth led to open corruption in the elections, and senators bought at the expense of considerable contributions to the election campaign (Arena 1).
into having children due to the possibilities does not correlate with the previous standards in which women who did not get married and have children had almost no opportunities in society.Based on the materials I have read, I would say that being child-free is a choice that everyone can make depending on the life goals and aspirations of the person. On the one hand, a woman may be happy building a solid career and not have any desire to make changes for a child, which makes it unreasonable to have one unless love and care can be provided. On the other hand, the majority of women are still opting to have children despite the possible difficulties that correlate with motherhood, including financial, professional, and social problems. However, since every woman is different and living in a modern world means being able to make a choice, having or not having children is an individual decision that every person is to make based on their own life experiences and overviews.
Although Lemuel Haynes and Mary Wollstonecraft discussed two distinct issues, slavery and female rights, the fundamental idea behind their works was that liberty and freedom should be equally distributed to all in a civilized society. Haynes Liberty Further Extended and Wollstonecraft’s A Vindication of the Rights of Woman were ahead of the time they were written. In fact, Haynes claims that freedom is a naturally given gift to all human beings, regardless of race (242). One of the renowned feminists of that time, Wollstonecraft, presented her ideas with a significant portion of anger, suggesting that women should be equally allowed to aspire to the same goals as men. Indeed, virtuous existence is impossible if all people do not have the same opportunities to pursue their objectives and share their natural gifts. This rhetoric analysis argues that both authors created the framework for defining the good life by claiming that rights and liberties are inherent to all people and thus they should not be withdrawn from someone.Individuals may perceive the good life differently, but it is impossible if people cannot use their talent, skills, and knowledge to attain specific goals. Wollstonecraft stated that women could become better citizens if men “be content with rational fellowship instead of slavish obedience” since females would become more “observant daughters, affectionate sisters, faithful wives, reasonable mothers” (179). Moreover, what is good or bad for one person is equally dignified or evil to others (Haynes 246). Both authors agree that liberty is essential for all people, and this term can be defined
as having uniform opportunities, freedom of expression, and equality before the law (Wollstonecraft 230). If the law is threatened, people cannot attain a good life; thus, the more equality is present in society, the more virtuous it may become. However, from policymakers’ viewpoint, women were inferior creatures, allowing the government to create the environment that would enable men’s success (Wollstonecraft 30). In fact, Wollstonecraft’s sarcastic tone in her writing suggests that the regulations of that time were hypocritic because they allowed white males to dominate and discriminate against individuals based on their race and gender.It is probably impossible to achieve virtuous life in a country if some groups are devoid of their rights or unaware of their options. If only a portion of a group’s potential is involved in decision-making, it cannot attain the highest potential. Therefore, Wollstonecraft promoted the idea that women should acquire physical and emotional strengths to become fully functioning members of society; in that case, virtuous life will become possible (31). Furthermore, the author seems appalled to elegance, delicacy, and gentleness, calling them the impediments to a good life (Wollstonecraft 31). Wollstonecraft is not sarcastic about these characteristics, but she appears to feel offended by the fact that strength is men’s privilege and a taboo for women. Still, her tone is satirical when she talks about the male population’s fear that if females are allowed to exercise and receive better education, they will become excessively masculine because it may not be attractive. The author also believes that being eloquent should no longer
Plato’s Cave , may prevent someone from learning and growing. Overall, a good life is possible if all people possess the liberty to seek knowledge and apply it because everyone will be producing equally good results. Still, even equality and freedom may not save someone from failing to become better if one’s mindset is incorrect.In summary, Haynes and Wollstonecraft used the framework of slavery and women’s rights, respectively, to raise the issue of liberty. Evaluating their works and the tone they used in their writings allowed me to understand that equal rights, responsibilities, and opportunities are essential for society to reach a virtuous life. Furthermore, applying analysis to these readings helped me see that emotional writings are as convincing as rational explanations as in the case of Wollstonecraft’s and Haynes’s works. Indeed, Wollstonecraft’s satirical tone came from her anger at men who deprived her of her natural rights to pursue a better future. Haynes’s essay lacks sarcasm, but the author is quite assertive that slavery must be eliminated.
A work of art’s subject and its content are different and yet closely connected concepts, as well as its essential components. According to Fichner-Rathus (2016), “the subject is the what of a work of art—people, places, things, themes, processes, events” (p. 4). This statement means that there are discernible visual elements that are accessible to nearly all human beings and can be perceived as something representing or resembling reality. In turn, “content refers to a work’s array of intangible aspects: the emotional, intellectual, psychological, symbolic elements” (Fichner-Rathus, 2016, p. 5). Hence, the content involves the particular thought behind the piece of art, which can be understood through the subject. Thus, the content differs from the subject in its abstract nature, referring to ideas rather than the material world.The contrast and interdependence of the subject and content of art could be seen in the sculpture Tourists by Duane Hanson made in 1970. The apparent subject of this work is a couple of people, a male and a female, both old-aged. They are dressed in bright colors, and their clothes resemble stereotypical American attire for vacations: the man wears a t-shirt with palm trees and has a camera, and the woman—sunglasses, bold pants for weekends, and a spacious patterned bag. Both persons are in the position of waiting or observing something.Yet, the content of this work is more complicated than it seems. These people were probably average consumers of the time 60s when the author worked on the sculpture. They are perhaps from the middle class and devote their free time to vacation trips in the decade when there is no economic crisis that would disturb them so that they are participating in the careless and meaningless process of spending their money. Hence, Hanson conveys the meaning of troubles and yet eager to new experience existence through the details, such as the clothes, the equipment of the couples, and the postures. Therefore, the subject of the sculpture, namely tourists, is complemented by the idea of ironizing about the lack of worries among ordinary people with economically stable status.
IntroductionMilk preservation is a key concern to large-scale dairy farmers across the globe. The product is required to remain fresh from the source to the consumer. This has led to the development of milk devices that aid farmers and dairy factories to process and preserve the product. Factors such as presence of pathogens in the milk products, lowers the duration the commodities take while still fresh and fit for consumption (Garcia et al., 2019). The condition for the equipment has to be maintained cleaned to ensure the products do not get spoiled or become unfit for human consumption. Furthermore, some of the equipment help milk processors to make various types of milk products like cheese, cream, butter, and so on. With the use of the devices in the production, individuals have been able to lower the costs involved, like labor, and reduce the time consumption during packaging. The focus of his paper is to analyze milky devices and the current technological involvement.BackgroundDairy plants have evolved to use equipment that facilitates processes like milk manufacturing, pasteurizing, packaging, storing, and transportation. Initially, these activities were expensive, time-consuming when the level of technology was limited (Charlton & Kostandini, 2021). Currently, the advancement in engineering has made the processes convenient due introduction of various machines that perform the factions effectively. Most dairy farms have access to equipment like tanks for storing milk, cream churner milk containers, tubular heat exchangers, and evaporation systems that aid in the processes. The machines are useful in ensuring farmers do not incur unnecessary losses resulting
from poor preservation. They have improved dairy farming since the plants can manage to process the amount of milk produced.Technology for Dairy products back in the 1900sThere has been an improvement in dairy products over the past century. The milk processing industry has been growing gradually to provide dairy foods that meet the expectations of human diets with respect to nutrients, safety, and overall sustainability. Around 1917, the private dairy farmers presented milk products to their consumers in their locations (Rankin et al., 2017). During this time, farmers had started adopting pasteurization as the mechanism of preserving and controlling milk from contamination by some diseases.In the milk processing plant, the mechanization of cream separation, filling, washing bottles, and capping them set the root of modern industrialization in the sector. Between the years 1907 and 1913, bottle machines were put into use as well as the fillers and cappers (Capstaff & Miller, 2018). To enhance the safety and increase sanitation of the milk products, there were some advancement made on the mechanical bottle washers. Most countries developed compulsory pasteurization processes due to diseases that were connected to unsafe milk consumption that caused deaths amongst adults and children.The process of milk pasteurization was officially in use but the methods, timing, and temperatures totally varied from farm to farm. There were no heat regulators during this period therefore the process took about 60 seconds at a temperature of about 72 degrees Celsius followed by immediate cooling. Similarly, proper timing was not manageable due to a lack of technology (Charlton
& Kostandini, 2021). It was termed flash pasteurization and it was not fully accepted due to its limitation. Another current technology involved in dairy industry is using the in-bottled method. In this process, the bottled milk was subjected to a high temperature of about 63 degrees Celsius for close to 30 minutes. It proved effective because it reduced the shortfalls of post-pasteurization.The advancement in technology prompted the improvement in dairy products as effective equipment was developed. Devices like a vat holder, heater, and cooler were used to improve the milk pasteurization process. Another milestone in the dairy plant was achieved in 1934 when a mechanical refrigerator was introduced to help in preserving the products. On the basis of sanitation, the use of stainless steel bulk ensured the commodities were kept safe.Current TechnologyScientists and technologists have been working to improve the milk processing procedure and the content of the products. Over the last decade, a number of innovations and advancement in technology has been made to enhance productivity in the industry. Some of the current know-how used is aimed at lowering cost, increasing shelf life, and separating the component products of milk (Akbar et al., 2020). Some of the current technologies used in the milk processing plant are discussed below.Milk AnalyserFluid milk consists of various components like lactose, fat, protein, total solids, and other elements. The milk processing plants use the Mid-infrared examination method to determine the composition of the product (Akbar et al., 2020). Once the analysis has been done, the result is used to evaluate
the amount of money the dairy farmer will receive in relation to the available contents. Mid Infrared Spectroscopy also helps farmers to decide on what feeds to give their animals to influence the needed components. The technology is fast and facilitates efficiency in the testing of milk components.Automated Sprayer DryerDairy farmers are able to undertake the necessary quality tests using the automated sprayer dyer at once. During the analysis process, a sample of the milk products is taken and analyzed by infrared technology to determine the content of moisture in the milk powder, bulk, and temperature (Shinde et al., 2018). There is a specific inline powder developed for the automated sprayer dryer. The procedure is helpful since it allows the producers to set warning alarms in case of product loss during the manufacturing process.Automated Clean-In-Place (CIP) SystemThis system allows the milk plants to clean the interior surfaces of the pipes, filters, vessels, associated fittings, and process equipment while they are intact. CIP uses sensors, controllers, valves that are well-programmed to enhance effectiveness. It makes the plant maintain the required level of hygiene for the proper preservation of the milk products (Ledo et al., 2020). Internal cleaning is essential as the materials get into contact with the milk.Direct Vat Set (DVS) CulturesCurrently, milk processing industries are using some species of microorganisms to facilitate the production of fermented products. DVS are significant since they have no side effects to the consumers and they also improve the immune system (Rankin et al., 2017). The main reason for applying the
DVS cultures in the milk processing steps is to increase the production at a relatively lower time. For instance, it takes about 10 hours to make a curd using a homemade approach whereas when the microorganisms are used, the production time is halved.High-Performance Liquid ChromatographyHigh-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) is a reliable, precise accurate process that helps in detecting the presence of melamine in pasteurized milk, ultra-heat temperatures, soft cheese, milk powder, and powdered infant formula (Ledo et al., 2020). Generally, melamine is an organic chemical compound that looks like a white crystal. HPLC enables farmers to easily locate the melamine hence reducing the time that would have been taken in the process.Fortification of MilkIn most cases, the component of milk does not contain all the required nutrients. To ensure consumers obtain the necessary minerals, some vitamins that are not contained in the milk products are added (Ledo et al. 2020). Fortified milk is essential for human consumption because it has a good ratio of useful ailments. The process is essential in increasing the mineral and vitamin content suitable for human consumption.Ultra-High Temperature (UHT)UHT is used to aid in the process of the pasteurization of milk in the industry. It involves using commercially sterilized equipment to heat milk then fill them under an aseptic state into packages that are hermetically sealed (Warncke & Kulozik, 2020). During this process, milk is heated for about two seconds at a temperature of 138 degrees Celsius then cooled down quickly. UHT is capable of eliminating bacteria present in the product, therefore,
increasing the shelf life of milk. After UHT, the commodity can take a long like six months without refrigeration.High-Temperature Short Time (HTST)The dairy plant uses hot water and metal plates to attain the required temperature suitable for pasteurization. HTST technique also allows dairy farmers to heat under a temperature of about 71 degrees Celsius within a time frame of 15 seconds (Garcia et al., 2019). It is then cooled off before packaging to enhance the shelf life. It also enables the dairy farmers to eliminate the threat of bacteria present in milk products.Dairy Product Composition and Attribute TestingCurrently, near-infrared and inline mid-infrared technology is being used in the firms to enable the manufacturers to establish and analyze the composition of the products. The system makes it easier to test the components of the liquid milk (Akbar et al., 2020). The factories usually produce a large quantity of milk therefore the advancement makes it easier to examine the milk for cheese making and other products.Types of Equipment for Dairy and MilkDairy PasteurizersThis equipment is used to heat the dairy products to a considerable temperature that is suitable for killing the pathogens that might be present in the milk. They are used to enhance and increase the safety of milk for human consumption.Dairy Milk TanksIn the dairy plant, there are tanks used for storing milk, cooling, and for fermentation. There are isolated tanks, one-lay, two-lay, and process tanks that are used in the processing process.HomogenizerThis machine helps in making the milk products have a uniform consistency to minimize
separation. It also helps in reducing large fat globules into tiny ones (Warncke & Kulozik, 2020). The equipment facilitates the conversion of two insoluble liquids to form an emulsion. It enhances flexibility and quality performance in the industry during the processing. Furthermore, it reduces the intensity of work done in processing milk.Dairy SeparatorThis equipment is used by dairy farmers or milk processing plants to separate skimmed milk and cream. They increase the effectiveness in the processing of milk and enables farmers to reduce cost. Dairy separators are easy to use therefore very efficient for most milk plants. The machine makes it easier for the dairy farmers to lower labor and have different composition of the milk products.Manufacturing of Milk (How it is Manufactured, Pasteurized)The process of manufacturing milk involves a series of steps. It starts with milking cows by attaching vacuum cups to their teats. After that, the liquid milk is taken to refrigerated vats for storage under a temperature condition of about 5 Degrees Celsius. Milk is then transported to factory tankers where different procedures take place, such as pasteurization where milk is put at an extreme temperature of 72 Degrees Celsius for about 15 seconds to destroying harmful pathogens. The process allows the products to have an extended shelf life. The next step is homogenization, this method subject milk to high pressure that helps to disperse fat globules (Soundous et al., 2019). It enables manufacturers to stop the cream from rising to the top and separating to ensure a consistent taste and texture of
the product.The milk is then taken to centrifugal separation to enable the removal of the available cream to facilitate the making of low-fat or skim milk. The other procedure is ultrafiltration which involves passing milk across a given membrane at a considerable pressure to aid in holding back the fat globules and other proteins present in the milk content (Mikhaylin et al., 2018). During this process, lactose and water pass through the membrane leaving behind the large particles including calcium complexes.The next process involves reverse osmosis which is more like ultrafiltration only that the membrane permits water to pass across leaving lactose. Then there is ultra-osmosis that entails both reverse osmosis and ultrafiltration (Mikhaylin et al., 2018). This procedure allows salt and water to go through holding back solid milk. Another procedure is spray drying which helps to eliminate water from milk to produce powdered milk products. The process does not interfere with the nutrition content of the milk. The last step is permeating, which enables the manufacturers to produce milk having consistent properties.Future ResearchBased on the predicted demand for milk products in the future, agriculturalists should further the research on how to increase the amount of milk each cow can produce. The finding should focus on ways of raising the limit without having a devastating effect on the life of an animal (Capstaff & Miller, 2018). If such improvement can be achieved, sustainability shall also go up since it will not be necessary for the farmer to keep a large number of dairy animals.The world
the sixth century, the need to distinguish between nomens and cognomens also disappeared. The Greek naming system, vice versa, spread across the country. By the end of the seventh century, the population of Western Europe had completely returned to individual names. But many of the names that originated within the ‘trial nomina’ have been adapted to use and have survived to the present.Thus, it can be concluded that the Greek naming system, initially used only for slaves and servants, triumphed over a more prestigious Roman equivalent. On the one hand, the reasons for it were changing the social structure of the society, where social strata gradually became less pronounced, and, on the other, the emergence of Christian ideas within Greece. Moreover, the natural tendency for shortening played a significant part in this process, making the Greek naming system preferable to the Roman one.Figure 1. Roman naming system (Breytenbach, 2018).
The relationship of Nora and Torvald develops significantly throughout the play and eventually shows a completely different side of each of these characters. At the beginning, they seem to be a perfect couple, both content with their roles in the family. However, as the play develops, they are revealing their unhealthy relationship and dissatisfaction. Torvald treats his wife like a child incapable of making her own decisions. He cares mostly about his money and reputation, and through his pressure and arrogance, he makes Nora believe that her life has to only be devoted to her husband and children. Nora sees her purpose in the same way: all she does is try to make her husband happy. Nora and Torvald’s relationship shows that women’s role as an individual was not always recognized, and that for many men, women were and still are simply “dolls” (Gardner et al., 2020). Nevertheless, after Nora reveals her husband’s true self, she realizes that he is a self-centered person who does not really care about her. She becomes stronger and decides to leave her family to educate herself and find her own purpose.The relationship between Kristine and Krogstad have also evolved through different stages. In contrast to Nora and Torvald, Kristine was the one who cared about money more and eventually left Krogstad, even though she actually loved him. This caused Krogstad to become a bitter, devastated, and unhappy man, which shows that he truly loved her as well. What saves him in the end is Kristine, who offers a second chance for them to be together. It appears that his motivation is not gaining money or respect form society; instead, all he needed was love, understanding, and honesty. The fundamental difference between these two couples is that Kristine and Krogstad love each other, which makes it possible for them to talk and solve their problems to reunite after many years of separation.
deeply religious and devout man. The complex and unusual iconography is considered a Neoplatonic interpretation of the Bible, representing the main stages of the spiritual development of humanity and the dramatic relationship between man and God (Gilbert, 2022). To fill an almost unimportant ceiling space with such a painting demonstrated a deep respect for the religious motives of that time.Isenheim Altarpiece by Grünewald was painted for the hospital chapel of the Monastery of St. Anthony in Isenheim. The painting was created five years before Luther nailed his Protestant theses to the doors of Wittenberg Cathedral in 1517, but it perfectly reflects the agony of the early 16th century. In this sense, Grunewald’s tortured masterpiece is the complete opposite of modern Italian works of the High Renaissance. While the crucifixion is gloomy, though deathly pale, the other panels are marked by Grunewald’s vibrant Renaissance color palette, as well as his unique images of the devil. The altarpiece challenges its viewer through its depression of the reality of suffering and makes them question how “good” can come out of it (Aramini, 2018). The religious subtext, focusing on the suffering and pain of Christ’s crucifixion, has a huge psychological impact on the viewer.
Religion is a fundamental part of most world societies and cultures. There are numerous varieties of religions worldwide with a wide range of differences than similarities. This factor makes it challenging to have an all-encompassing definition of religion that works for all people. The most common traits among the religions include the focus on supernatural or sacred power, ritual acts, and moral codes. Some regions are easily recognized globally, while others are confined to a particular region or country. For instance, Shinto is a Japanese religion widely practiced by that country’s nationals. Although Shinto is a Japanese religion, its myth of origin that supports the divinity of the country’s islands and rulers to ancestral lineage with gods can have a similarity to other religions such as Jewish and Christianity. DivinityThe Shinto Divinity Myth about Japanese Islands and Japanese EmperorsAs noted in the introduction, most Japanese communities subscribe to Shinto, an indigenous religion that defines the country’s culture and national identity. According to Mizumura, more than fifty percent of Japanese adhere to Shinto. Shinto myth supports the notion that the Japanese islands are divine by indicating that they were created by gods, Izanami and Izanagi. The two gods used a spear encrusted with jewels to stir the ocean, where crystalized salt on the tip fell after withdrawing it, forming the islands. The gods settled on Onogoro-Shima, the first island they created, and the female deity, Izanami, wedded Izanagi. Later, the divine couple created other islands that comprise Japan, the world, and other gods.Shinto myth also holds that
the Japanese emperors are direct descendants of Amaterasu. According to Mizumura, Amaterasu Omikami, the sun goddess, was of the gods created by Izanami and wedded Iznagi, from whom the Shinto religion believes that the imperial family descended. Therefore, the Japanese people considered their emperors to have qualities of Kami, making them superior. The people obeyed the emperors and divine rulers and worshipped them. The emperors executed religious and political roles in society, such as performing rituals and protecting the country. Shinto’s divinity notion about their land and rulers is relatable to other religions.The Jewish Story about “The Holy Land” and Shinto’s Divine LandThe Jewish story about God creating and giving “The Holy Land” has significant similarities with the Shinto myth concerning Japanese islands. The Jewish believe that their land is divine, created by God’s supreme supernatural being, and given to their forefathers and descendants. The story began when God asked Abraham, from whom the Jewish descended, to leave his native land for another that He (God) would show him (The Jewish virtual library). God gave Abraham a divine promise that He would bless the latter and make his name promise. God made a covenant with Abraham, saying He gave his descendants the land (The Jewish virtual library). Canaan, or Israel as known today, is the “Holy Land” endowed to the Jewish community. God fulfilled his promise when He used Moses to take the descendants of Abraham from Egypt to the promised. The Jewish right to the land of Canaan shows that God had already planned that
the place would be an everlasting possession for the Jews.Similarly, Shintonians believe that the Japanese islands were created and given to the Japanese community to inherit. Although the Jewish “Holy Land” was created by one Supreme God and the divine Japanese islands by more than one God, the creators were both supernatural beings with the powers to control humans and nature. Like Jewish who believe that God’s power and favor have always been upon their land and consider Israel a center for adoring their Creator, Shinto has numerous shrines in Japan for worshipping their gods.The Notion of America as God’s Country and Shinto MessageAlthough several countries worldwide have ever identified themselves as a nation of God, they cannot contest the title “God’s own country” with America. The factors that make most Americans consider their nation as God’s country range from a religious perspective to the prosperity and freedom associated with it. According to Perry et al., American civil religion and Christian nationalism are religious factors that make citizens consider their nation as a country of God (131). The American civil religion considers Americans as united under an ambiguous Creator’s (Judeo-Christian) covenant (131). The citizens are obliged to the Creator because He maintains an equitable and just society. Conversely, Christian nationalism aligns the country’s national identity with an evangelical Christian God. America is among the most economically developed country and one of the world’s superpowers. Living in the country is associated with prosperity and freedom, which are God’s providence.This notion of America as God’s country is similar
to the Shinto myth that Japanese islands were created and belonged to gods. Both perspectives associate particular countries with religions, Christianity for America and Shinto for Japan. Americans, most of whom are Christians, believe that God is responsible for the country. Equally, Shintonians believe that the gods who created the islands are responsible for their land’s high production.The Egyptian Concept of the Pharaoh as God and the Shinto Belief about the Japanese EmperorShinto belief about the Japanese emperor is similar to the ancient Egyptians’ concept of the pharaoh as a god. Notably, pharaohs were the prehistoric Egyptian rulers who played political and religious roles in society. The Egyptians considered their rulers divine, who linked the people and gods (National Society). The pharaohs maintained religious harmony among the residents of the region. Additionally, they participated in different important ceremonies and were head of state, made laws, and oversaw all operations in the land of Egypt. Likewise, Shinto believes that Japanese emperors are divine and worshiped because they are descendants of gods who created Japanese islands. Like the pharaohs, Japanese emperors are also considered important religious leaders by Shintonians.The European Notion of the King’s Divine Right and Shinto Belief about the Japanese EmperorKings were an important symbol in most communities across the world. However, some parts, such as the European region, believed that their kings had divine rights from God. According to Wills, the kings derived their authority from God, and no earthly power could hold them accountable for their actions. The medieval notion that God grants power
beings. Like Jesus, Japanese emperors are considered the leaders of Shintonians and are the essential symbol of the religion.Indeed, religions are a fundamental part of most societies and cultures. Most people in the world have ever associated themselves with one or more religions in their lifetime. While some religions are easily recognized globally, others, like Shinto, are confined to a particular region or country. Shinto myth of origin that supports the divinity of the country’s islands and rulers to ancestral lineage with gods can have a similarity to other religions. For instance, the Jewish and the Shinto believe that their lands are divine and given by supernatural beings. Equally, Shinto, Egyptians, and medieval European believed that their rulers were divine and their authority came from gods, so no earthly power could question or hold them accountable for their actions.
In many countries, religion is still a very sensitive topic that might lead to severe violations of human rights and dignity. North Korea is particularly notorious for its oppressive political regime where people have virtually no civil rights and freedom to express their faith. According to the laws, North Korea does not prohibit any religions; however, in reality, most beliefs are being actively persecuted (Burkle, 2020).Linda Burkle (2020) explains that Christians are some of the most oppressed groups in North Korea. As a result, Open Doors 2020 World Watch List declared North Korea as the worst country to live in for Christian people (Burkle, 2020). Christians are being transferred to labor camps and prisons, while approximately 200,000 Christians have also gone missing for “unknown reasons’ ‘ (Burkle, 2020). Even acquiring sacred texts is impossible and might lead to imprisonment and torture.Unfortunately, other nations do not interfere in North Korea’s internal affairs due to immense differences in political regimes and the possibility of a war. The North Korean government is widely known for its inhumane laws and policies while holding significant military potential and nuclear weapons. That is why other nations attempt to achieve a diplomatic solution and do not interfere with religions within the country. Concerning reasoning, North Korea prosecutes Christians due to the government’s belief that religious people undermine national values and integrity. North Korea emerged after World War II and gradually increased the severity of political control. As a result, for more than 70 years, the North Korean government has been actively prosecuting religious groups and, specifically, Christians to mitigate the spread of freedom. It is an unjust policy, but, unfortunately, other nations cannot do much to help oppressed religious people in North Korea.
God is the highest judge who evaluates people according to their actions fairly; if people pray and believe in him, he heals and provides what he desires. At the same time, atheists maintain that God does not exist because there are still wars and acts of terrorism in which innocent victims are murdered (Krause & Ironson, 2019). This is not consistent with what can be found in the scriptures and the Bible. It can be argued that the Lord is the supervisor; once there is doubt about the existence of this guard, a man who is a potential malefactor is capable of anything.Although, God’s tribunal is not the only tribunal before which a person can hold accountable. Hence, if God did not exist, people would still be restrained by other factors, but in combination, heavenly and earthly potential punishments act as restraining forces against omnipotent conduct. It is essential to mention Polytheism and the Christian religion, where the concepts of good and evil are different. For example, magic is forbidden by the Lord, but permitted in pagan rituals (Krause & Ironson, 2019). At the same time, Christianity creates the single fair rules for everyone, but Polytheism is the privilege of certain individuals and donned by the forces of the gods, which is not equitable.
rule, the media use clichéd descriptions and forms. Thus, it may deliberately attach a positive or negative reaction to the appearance of others (McCombs and Valenzuela 9). Newsfeeds may lack description and consideration from different angles, which inappropriately leads to a limited presentation of racial formation and, therefore, an unreasonable reaction.Thus, the role of the media can be very ambiguous in forming reactions and carrying adverse reactions. On the one hand, the mass media give a person ample opportunities to join the world’s information picture, including racial appearance, which can expand the experience of a person on a global scale. On the other hand, the media can construct a new reality in the human mind. Such a reality is usually quite far from the truth and creates a false illusion about appearance and racial prejudice. As a result, the technical possibilities of disseminating information fade before the media’s harmful influence on the formation of opinions and ideas about another race.
Social Inequality in the Gilded Age and Progressive EraThe Gilded Age was one of the United States’ most prosperous eras. Between 1870 and the early 20 th century, the country amassed wealth at a meteoric rate. The nation seemed headed in a path of economic stability, with everyone welcome to tag along, but this was a fallacy. The Gilded Age was glorious on the surface but full of rot underneath. It bled into the Progressive Era that aimed to correct the wrongs of the Gilded Age with arguably considerable success. It was a period of heightened social activism. In this paper, I look at the social injustices suffered by minority communities in these eras, how they sought to solve them, and the coverage of these critical periods of American history in the textbooks.Social Inequalities Experienced by Minority GroupsOne of the hallmarks of the Gilded Age was widespread inequality. This form of injustice broadly took two forms; social and economic (Cashman, 293). With the rise of corporations that offered jobs for everyone willing to work, streaming millions of immigrants from Europe and the Far East was a welcome sight; or so it was supposed to be. It led to the advent of the deplorable state of workers in the republic. The number of workers was more than the jobs, and mass unemployment followed. The majority of the migrant population was unskilled, and the lack of factory jobs meant no income.Getting a job was not glorious, maybe just the lesser evil at best. Workers in these companies run
by overly shrewd businessmen who held productivity above all else were paid meager wages for their troubles. They had to endure dangerous working conditions without compensation for injuries incurred while on the job. This, coupled with the high rent charged by landlords, made the cost of living for the immigrants fresh off the boat. So high was this cost that most immigrants were forced to live in crowded and sanitary and crime-riddled tenement yards, all in pursuit of the American Dream.Most of the social injustice during the Gilded Age was propagated by trusts and companies running monopolies and the ‘robber barons’ who wanted to effect full-scale capitalism. Andrew Carnegie, Cornelius Vanderbilt, and JPMorgan are among them. To say that wealth distribution in the US was uneven will be a significant understatement. Four thousand families, which formed 1% of the population, controlled as much wealth as 11.6 million. The financial moguls that made their fortunes in various sectors of the economy insisted on production at whatever cost, a cost borne mainly by the working man. The stories, such as one of Carnegie releasing a small army on his workers, are quite scary.Efforts to Address the InequalitiesWith the Progressive Era came reforms; people were teaming up to end the social injustice they had been under for so long. The populist movement of Agrarian reforms, the antitrust movements, and the progressive movement of urban social reformers came up. It became evident that the only way to be hard was not by individual action but by a coalesced effort to
Epigenetics refers to the study of how one’s own behavior and environment can affect the way in which the genes work. Unlike changes that occur directly in the genes, epigenetic changes can be reversed and do not affect the DNA sequence; however, they can change the way in which the body reads the DNA sequence. For example, when one encounters two identical twins, their appearance shows some differences, even though they start out looking the same. As the two twins age, the impact of environmental and behavioral factors becomes more prominent, contributing to the changes and differences between the two twins. Therefore, epigenetics could be used as a critical framework for understanding one’s propensity to develop a particular health condition.When it comes to the considerations of epigenetics in terms of a disease for which an individual is at high risk, it is necessary to consider family history as well as environmental factors that add to the development of the adverse health condition. Considering all factors, the most highly likely disease to develop in the future is type 2 diabetes. Type 2 diabetes refers to an impairment in the way in which the body regulates and uses sugar as fuel (Rosen et al., 2018). It is a chronic condition that can be managed with medication and lifestyle changes but cannot be cured completely with no traces of the condition left behind. This conclusion was made based on several factors concerning family history and environmental and behavioral factors.Specifically, both the parent and the sibling had type 2 diabetes,
diagnosed as adults. In adulthood, type 2 diabetes is likely to develop as a result of behavioral and environmental factors, such as increased blood pressure, elevated levels of fat in the blood, a sedentary lifestyle, high alcohol intake, obesity and overweight, and others (Rosen et al., 2018). Therefore, since there are direct DNA connections between a parent and a sibling, both of whom developed diabetes as adults, it is essential to consider such information as highly relevant. Other potential diseases included breast cancer, glaucoma, and thyroid disorder, which were identified in other relatives, for which the risk factors are lower.Epigenetics suggests that even in the case of genetic risk factors, there is a possibility to either increase or reduce the chances of developing a disease with the help of environmental and behavioral improvements. Besides, researchers have been focusing on a new research agenda, emphasizing the interactions between health and environmental and social factors. Therefore, social determinants of health represent a considerable part of epigenetics as it seeks to explain any non-medical factors that directly influence health, such as values, attitudes, knowledge, and behaviors (Notterman & Mitchell, 2016). Besides, across an individual’s lifespan, health can be significantly affected by social disadvantages.The study of epigenetics has considered the control of both disease and homeostasis. Considering that the risk of diabetes and its complications is associated with environmental and inherited factors, it is not surprising that research in this area is extensive (Rosen et al., 2018). In addition, Rosen et al. (2018) stated that there are several areas of
epigenetic regulation, such as direct methylation of adenine or cytosine residues, covalent modifications to histone proteins, higher-order chromatin structure, and non-coding RNA. These areas have been implicated in cellular processes that are relevant to diabetes, with a long history of links between diabetes and epigenetics, as well as other metabolism-related challenges that include obesity, overweight, and other metabolic disorders.It is notable that the risk of diabetes development in an individual has been linked to increased rates of micro- and macrovascular complications. Clinical trials conducted among people with diabetes have underlined the positive effects of intensive glycemic control to avoid the occurrence of complications and their progression. Specifically, the rate of complications associated with diabetes can be influenced by glucose levels that were experienced years earlier, which is referred to as metabolic memory (Rosen et al., 2018). Energetic changes can offer a biological explanation for the long-standing impact of metabolic changes, as metabolite levels can impact the epigenome while such changes are preserved during the division of cells.Importantly, studies focusing on cells and tissues from patients diagnosed with diabetes have illustrated striking differences in epigenetic marks at core genes linked to complications, including fibrotic and inflammatory genes. For example, the authors refer to the article by Beckerman, Ko, and Susztak (2014), who used kidney tissues from patients diagnosed with diabetes and chronic kidney disease to illustrate epigenetic changes in renal disease-related genes. In addition, epigenetic mechanisms have been shown to influence cellular models of metabolic memory.Therefore, the epigenetics article showed that diabetes and complications associated with it
A credit score is a number between 300 and 850 that reflects a consumer’s creditworthiness. Lenders use credit scores to assess the likelihood that a person will repay a loan on time. A credit score is an indicator that helps one understand how safe it is to trust an organization with one’s money. Banks, insurance companies, non-state pension funds, and other financial institutions that work with private clients usually have such ratings. A credit score can significantly impact financial performance as it plays a vital role in a lender’s decision to offer a loan to a client. People with a credit score below 640 are generally considered to be subprime borrowers and have poor chances of getting a loan, while those above 800 are considered excellent.The rating takes into account not only the current financial position of the subject, the amount of capital, the volume of debts, and the entire previous financial history. A high credit rating means that it is practically safe to trust the subject with money because they have always paid their bills before, and now their position is relatively stable. At the same time, a low rating means a substantial risk because the entity’s business is not going very well, and it is highly likely that it may go bankrupt.There are three major credit reporting agencies in the United States, namely Experian, Equifax, and Transunion, that report, update, and store consumer credit histories. While there may be differences in the information collected by the three credit bureaus, five main factors are considered
Yoga is a concept that signifies a set of spiritual, mental, and physical practices aimed at managing the cognitive and physiological functions of the body. Practicing this sport allows one to broaden the horizons, change the habitual way of life, and eliminate harmful patterns that negate the efforts. That is why yoga is considered the most effective practice of self-development that has unique benefits for health, both physical and psychological.There are numerous varieties of modern yoga; despite the dissimilarities, they are grounded on shared parts: body postures, breathing exercises, and spiritual contemplation. The combination of exercises that train the body and soul has unique health benefits. It strengthens muscles, increases flexibility, and enhances mental soundness. Moreover, yoga classes have enormous therapeutic potential and preventive effects. Studies involving patients with various musculoskeletal conditions have indicated that yoga helps to reduce pain and improve joint mobility (Saeed et al., 2019). Breathing exercises relax the muscles that constrict the airways and strengthen oxygen diffusion, leading to better lung function.One of the chief yoga concepts is the “eight limbs,” which consists of alternating stages for achieving a state of enlightenment. Eight steps are a prerequisite for everyone to feel connected to the world. Through these practices, one learns to control one’s actions, accept all hardships calmly, and find compromises. The ultimate goal of the methodology is to learn to find a balance between one’s own and the world’s values and understand that each person has an essential mission in the community. It significantly affects an individual’s social well-being as it seeks to bring body, mind, and soul into unison (Saeed et al., 2019). The balance of these essential elements ensures a healthy and harmonious personality, activates energy potential, and prevents psychological stress.In conclusion, yoga is essential for promoting health and combating social isolation and depression. It can be used for physical development, healing, and emotional restoration. Yoga is based on a holistic approach that helps the whole body return to a normal state. It makes it an indispensable and beneficial self-development practice for the health of both adults and children.
of production by breaking tools, feigning illnesses, and slowing the work process. However, these were mostly ineffective measures because they led to negotiations where masters benefited the highest. In addition to sabotage, theft was also a form of resistance, where slaves stole certain goods for their own personal use. It was done mainly due to poor living conditions, such as nutrition, among slaves, which is why food was the main target of theft. It should also be noted that theft was justified from the slaves’ perspective since they are their masters’ property, and thus, how can a property steal the same owner’s property?Unlike the previously daily forms of resistance, the flight was an overt resistance. However, it was not effective because it led to harsher oversight and severe punishments. Escaping was a risky endeavor with rather low chances of success with no widespread impact. In addition, it was mostly men who had acceptable chances of successful flight. Therefore, the most effective form of resistance with the best revenge was armed rebellion, such as the Haitian Revolution. Although it was the only successful rebellion among many suppressed ones, the victory was not the main point. The key message was the fact that slavery will never be tolerated and it always is challenged by slaves, and the Haitian Revolution’s success was a reminder to masters that they will not be able to own slaves forever.
The correlation of the fate of the hero with the development of society, which is the main distinguishing feature of the genre of tragedy, can take on a variety of artistic forms. It can be folk-historical tragedy, bringing to the stage the broad masses of people set in motion by social cataclysms. At the same time, it is a tragedy, in which the plot is based on a conflict that captures a relatively small number of characters (Boorman, 2021). Even with the most cursory acquaintance with most of the mature Shakespearean tragedies, it is easy to see the center of the playwright’s attention. These are the relationship between the fate of the characters and the course of the development of society. Shakespeare’s great tragedies most often develop the theme of the death of the best people and their internal discord. Such is the tragedy of Othello , where the author describes the internal struggle of people whose honor has been tarnished.In Shakespeare’s play Othello , the main characters kill their wives to protect and restore their honor. During the play, women must obey their husbands to show real honor. Iago and Othello reflect this attitude towards their wives: they give them a reason to feel faithful by killing their women. Iago kills Emilia because she dishonors him by revealing his manipulation of Othello and Cassio. Othello strangles Desdemona because of the false infidelity that his assistant Iago imposed on him. As can be understood from the play, both characters have their idea of what honor is
them for a profit. They seek to shift such things across as quickly as possible in order to reduce inventory holding expenses. They, however, then resell the items on a comparatively small scale and don’t facilitate bulk-buying. Out of the three groups, retailers are the most consumer-oriented, and offer direct customer service to those who attend them to buy products from multiple brands.Wholesalers acquire items in bulk from producers and resell them to retailers and consumers at a profit. Wholesalers take on a moderate level of risk, acting as a part of the chain of middlemen (Bowersox, 2019). To be lucrative, they must acquire items in large quantities and deliver them to merchants on time. If the products do not sell and merchants do not restock, the wholesaler may be left with large quantities of goods that occupy their storage space and are not delivering profit.Finally, manufacturers are engaged directly in the production of goods that are later sold to wholesalers or customers directly, depending on the industry. Although manufacturers are, just as the other two groups, in need of accounting for the costs of taxation, salaries and other business expenses, their risk is arguably the lowest of the three (Bowersox, 2019). Since the manufacturers control the quantity produced, they might adjust it depending on the current demand, thus reducing waste to a minimum.
Second, there was a significant problem with variable consideration, as contractors needed to identify the most likely outcome and adjust the value of a contract. Before Topic 606 was implemented, it was impossible to recognize revenues based on a claim. Finally, the number of required disclosures increased significantly.Even though the majority of firms are ready to embrace the new regulations concerning leases, there are some problems associated with Topic 842. These problems include identifying embedded leases, ensuring the accuracy of all the data associated with leases, and standardizing procedures about new leases, renewals, and modifications to let all the departments receive the required information timely. Moreover, similar to changes in revenue recognition, changes of policy concerning leases now require more disclosures, which may affect the decision-making of investors.
right, and more ways of thinking and behavior. Wollstonecraft writes that learning and exercising one’s own reason are the only paths to developing virtue and women (Wollstonecraft 21). However, unlike men, women of the author’s time were limited in their access to education and had few opportunities to broaden their horizons. In this belief, Wollstonecraft echoed Plato and his Allegory of the Cave . In this work, the Greek philosopher argues that one’s perceptions may differ from reality, and people who are not allowed to receive knowledge will never know the real world (Plato). Thus, Wollstonecraft believes that women, equally to men, should be allowed the right to education as it affects them and the world around them.In A Vindication of the Rights of Women, Mary Wollstonecraft insists that men and women are equal human beings and, therefore, should be offered the same rights and opportunities in life. The feminist writer argues that, although men and women are different in their nature, “their virtues should differ in respect to their nature” (Wollstonecraft 27). In saying this, Wollstonecraft holds men and women to the same moral standards and criticizes those who contend that a woman’s role in society should be reduced to ornamental function and childbearing. It can be argued that Wollstonecraft inspired the feminist movement, specifically, individualist feminist tradition, that emphasizes personal autonomy and individualism. In particular, her unwavering support of women’s right to education inspired many women to pursue learning, improve their knowledge of the world, and become more virtuous.
One should note that Chapter 9 explains some concepts and ideas about the future and progress of society and the state as a whole. Garth Morgan Massey in his book claim, that most modern people are confident in their abilities to control situations and change events and phenomena for the better (p.321). However, only the power of reason harnessed to the inquiry can change persons’ “disadvantage” in the best light (p. 321). Thus, the writer calls this aspect a kind of progress and lists several essential concepts regarding this phenomenon.First of all, he states that different people, groups, and societies may have other thoughts, ideas, and beliefs about progress. Some see such improvements in more global events, and some do not expect drastic changes at all but want to live “well.” Further, as evidence to these words, Massey attaches the thoughts and ideas of some famous personalities. Hence, according to David Harvey, people strive to accumulate and increase material goods and abundance to improve life (p.321-322). Supporters of postmodernism reflect on these issues and assure that the contemporary world is the self-referential world, and modern times is a “tangle of myths.” Especially in the age of consumerism, people tend to accumulate in a flow of multiple events, but they are not as happy as they would like.Lester B. Brown claims that a modern world is a mess; previous experience dictates further human actions, such as future changes in climate, population, amount of water, product prices, and states (p. 322-323). Additionally, technologies “absorb” a person’s soul, depriving
On the right hand, contemporary data analysis presents chances that can be leveraged to improve current organization practices by growing the business, making life efficient, and helping in worthwhile causes. Through big data, contemporary data analysis plays a significant part in how the firm will stay ahead of business practices by anticipating potential needs and problems (Khine, 2019). To date, contemporary data analysis dominates the health care sector by minimizing operation costs and identifying efficiencies. However, to improve current organizational practices, data analysis will enable the firm to eliminate diseases, minimize, if not avoid, unnecessary harms, control infections, and extract the most valuable information from the existing dataset.To ensure continuous improvement in the firm, the following three processes might be implemented. The PDCA, or the Deming cycle, presents a systematic procedure to enhance products or services by identifying, analyzing, and developing tests and thinking of viable solutions to the problem (Hamm, 2016). The Kaizen process will allow the firm to utilize standardized continuous improvement approaches by becoming the second nature for every employee. The Six Sigma process will enhance the business by error elimination (Hamm, 2016). Data analysis trends can improve current practices by identifying decision areas where clinicians perform better and duplicate the level of success. Moreover, through data analysis trends, the organization can also identify areas where clinicians are underperforming and provide evidence in helping the business inform its decision-making process (Hamm, 2016). In other words, data analysis trends can help the business track successful metrics in clinical decisions via predictive analytics to minimize potential risks.The relevant and best practices to target proposal messaging to stakeholders constitute developing a plan that outlines the need to engage them. A plan becomes possible to engage the stakeholders, and an outlook of what the outcome might be is anticipated. Moreover, a plan becomes an important guiding principle that defines every engagement step from defining the content to potential achievable outcomes (Winter, 2019). However, persuading buy-in from all stakeholders might not be easy. Some familiar challenges constitute differences in decision-makers, competing priorities, resource limitations, and disparate opinions and data.Overcoming the challenges requires careful consideration of the best strategies to persuade all stakeholders’ buy-in. The strategies to employ would be identifying the stakeholders and monitoring their activities, listening to what they have to offer, arranging a meeting with each stakeholder, and determining what motivates them. Once the strategies have been put in place, the stakeholder can be persuaded by identifying and aligning their needs with those of the organization (Bakken, 2018). Moreover, through engagement and support from senior management, it becomes possible to track and measure progress by sharing feedback with the group and addressing potential issues.
Creating a legal definition for various ages is crucial for lawmakers in America. By establishing the boundaries between childhood, adolescence, and adulthood, it becomes possible to clarify the specifics of such periods and behaviors that the individuals might demonstrate. However, as explained by Scott (2000) in The Legal Construction of Adolescence , there are several complications connected to clearly defining the end of childhood and the overall period of adolescence. While childhood and adulthood ages can be specified by distinguishing between the children’s vulnerability and adults’ responsibility, adolescent populations’ ages are more difficult to determine due to the transitional nature of this growth period.In the contemporary legal framework, adolescence is not properly defined. Nevertheless, it appears that not including this term in the system is a highly successful tactic that allows the policymakers to avoid additional confusion that is connected to the introduction of a new concept. As such, the categorical approach is most commonly used when managing cases of adolescents, thus relying on the concept of the age of majority (Scott, 2000). In this sense, anyone under the age of majority is legally considered a minor, eliminating the need to account for individual developmental characteristics or differences in maturity (Scott, 2000). Therefore, all people under the age of 18 are currently regarded as minors.However, this legal framework fails to account for the numerous factors affecting young populations’ maturity. Given the differences in development, cognitive abilities, and the surrounding environment, some adolescents can enter the age of maturity earlier or later than 18 years. As a result, the legal definition of adulthood might not apply to some teenagers, forcing the authorities to treat all individuals below 18 as minors regardless of their actual development (Scott, 2000). Nevertheless, as perfectly explained by Scott, incorporating the multitude of factors impacting maturity is a highly strenuous task that requires significant effort from lawmakers.
The Metamorphosis by Franz Kafka is a great story about a young man who transforms into a bug and is imprisoned in his own chamber as a result of apples thrown at him sticking in his casing. Georg Samka awakens in a surrealistic dream world, and he receives no sympathy from anyone, despite the fact that he has sacrificed his own aspirations for years so that his sister might study music at the Conservatory. His family members’ reactions to him and how they choose to deal with the situation betray their relationships with him, revealing what they actually feel about the young man.While Gregor’s family has never shown affection for him, they did at least treat him as a human before his transformation; following his transformation, they have become progressively nasty and aloof. Gregor’s family tolerates him before his transformation since he takes over as the family’s breadwinner. They don’t have a particularly warm connection, but at least they show him some respect so that he may continue to support them. When they suspect he’ll be late for work, they double-check to make sure he arrives. When his father tries to wake his kid up, even if he doesn’t work, he has a warning in his voice.His sister is the only one of his family that comes to his aid, inquiring if he is ill. She instantly tries to console and assist him in any way she can. Grete, the sister, begins collecting goods that she feels he will be interested in after his metamorphosis so
work, his parents and sister have all taken up jobs to supplement his income. Grete, too, gradually loses sympathy for her brother. She was most likely his closest family member, yet caring for him is a strain for her. She eventually informs her parents that she wants Gregor gone. He determines that the best thing he can do for them is to die, and he does so.To conclude, Gregor’s metamorphosis reflects a true approach of his family members to him. With the transformation, Gregor illustrates that he had a wish to be free of the duties that should be his father’s, his dislike for his profession and the drudgery that comes with it. His transformation shows Gregor’s anger towards family’s exploitation of him and their irresponsibility in not contributing to the family income.
Harlem Renaissance was a period in America between the 1920s and 1930s. Great migrations of African Americans characterized the South to the North, Harlem in New York (Farebrother and Thaggert 77). The First World War had just ended, and the Jim Crow segregation law was gaining momentum forcing black people to move to the North. During this period, African American culture grew tremendously in literature and thinking. Harlem was flooded with black artists who looked to grow their reach and capabilities. Their way of thinking was transformed, thus developing a sense of independence; they developed their literature instead of copying the white artists. They embraced their African heritage from which they developed their music, art, and poetry. Authors wrote novels and poems basing them on the way of life of the people in Harlem during that decade. For instance, Zora Neale Hurston, a renowned writer and anthropologist wrote several novels that bore and applied similar themes as those of Harlem, the novel of choice is ‘Their Eyes Were Watching God. The paper will discuss how Hurston exemplifies the Harlem movement in her book.‘Their Eyes Were Watching God is an award-winning novel first published in the late 1930s and is considered one of the classics of the Harlem renaissance. Furthermore, this novel portrays the movement in all its features and style. The novel narrates the story of Janie and her pursuit for peace. As much as the book portrays as a product of the rebirth, it also acts as a representative of the Harlem Renaissance. The novel
exemplifies the Harlem rebirth by accommodating various themes portrayed in the way people of Harlem lived and carried out their daily activities. These themes include; racism, freedom, independence, language, power and conquest, love and relationship, and humanity. Through these themes, the author can capture and present the Harlem sensation in her novel.The language being used by the novel’s characters displays mastery of the southern dialect. Hurston uses an exciting narrative structure by accommodating idioms and literary speech, which was common during the movement. The characters of this novel are designed in a manner that long passages contain as much artistic voice as possible. For instance, Janie’s character has a distinctive use of grammar and vocabulary similar to the people of Harlem. Hurston uses language artistically to match Janie’s quest to search for her voice (Rau 154). Similarly, artists in Harlem use their power over language to develop pieces of art that are compelling to the audience.The novel portrays language as an instrument of harm because it can hurt somebody. It is displayed when Jody asks Janie to be silent when elected as the mayor. White people despise vocal African Americans since they do not like the idea of black people demanding equal treatment (Rau 147). Language is depicted as a key for harmonious correlation; Tea Cake and Janie engage in conversations that breed love, respect, and togetherness. The same applies to Harlem, where artists use their skills to bring people together. Hurston has established that one can define themselves through language and let their intentions be
known (Hurston 224). In Harlem, black artists used their voices to air their grievances against racism.Though not a significant theme in the novel, race plays a crucial role in Harlem since African American artists are considered inferior compared to their white counterparts. Racism in the South has become unbearable for black people due to the oppressive laws which the Democrats are approving (Farebrother et al. 179). The great migration is mainly attributed to violent racism in the South, meaning that it is a crucial influence on the Harlem Renaissance. Black artists are being despised, which prompts them to focus on producing authentic art by embracing their African traditions. Furthermore, racism is so rampant in Harlem that white Americans migrate from their town Harlem to avoid mixing up with black people.In the novel, racism is portrayed, but in this case, a black person discriminates against another black person; this is colorism. Although Janie is black, she is light-skinned because she ¼ white hence the Caucasian-like hair (Hurston 234). Mrs. Turner discriminates against Tea Cake, who has darker skin, and despises Janie for marrying him. Mrs. Turner asks Janie to leave Tea Cake for her brother, who is light-skinned like her. She is but another obstacle that Janie has to navigate before achieving fulfillment and being at peace with herself. The novel depicts racism during the burial of those killed by the hurricane. Here black people are buried with nothing while white people are put in pine caskets. Explicit instructions are laid that no black person should be
buried with white people and vice versa (Hurston 205). Tea Cake jokes that the caskets are for helping god identify white souls since there is no Jim Crow law in heaven.Power and conquest for fulfillment is the second theme in Hurston’s novel, basing its origin on the Harlem rebirth, where African American artists flood Harlem to make a mark in the world of music and literature. Harlem was initially a white man’s town, but whites were overwhelmed with the influx of black people and thus moved higher up North (Farebrother and Thaggert 204). White Americans can no longer suppress black people or keep them under their command. Their illusion of power is destroyed. African Americans seize the town of Harlem, and this gives them a deep sense of fulfillment since they are now occupying a town that was purposefully constructed for middle and upper-class white.Similarly, Janie achieves fulfillment by undertaking spiritual journeys to self-awareness and love (Hurston 141).On the other hand, Jody achieves fulfillment by suppressing and controlling everybody. He is obsessed with forcing those around him into submission under the illusion that he will be fulfilled. Nevertheless, his illusion of power is destroyed when he becomes sick, and it dawns on him that he can no longer control his surroundings.Love and relationship are other themes present in the novel on the basis Harlem Renaissance. Many artists travel to Harlem to develop their talents since its population guarantees an audience (Farebrother and Thaggert 154). These artists work together and maintain symbiotic relationships where everybody gains. They

The article “What’s new in the Caribbean for 2022” written by Suri (2020) describes the revitalization of the Caribbean islands after the pandemic of COVID-19. Specifically, the author mentions that the infrastructure in the region is undergoing serious renovations and advancements to attract an even bigger number of visitors when the situation grows more stable. In 2020, the Caribbean travel industry experienced a devastating downturn, but in 2021, a substantial share of international travelers chose the region as their destination. The author specifies that Americans are not an exception; the reasons are the proximity of the islands and their relatively successful campaign against the pandemic.To delve deeper into the situation with the tourism advancements of the Caribbean, Suri provides specific data. According to the author, many visitors, primarily people from the U.S., were driven to the Caribbean as a pandemic travel destination because of its accessibility and reasonably successful reputation in managing Covid-19 (Suri, 2021). Though incoming visitations were severely impacted in 2020, the number of foreign tourists in 2021 was significantly more significant, at least for a selection of islands (Suri, 2021). 14 of the 26 Caribbean Tourism Organization participating nations reported a substantial increase in international travelers in 2021.Considering the above, the region seeks to turn new visitors into regular to overcome the quarantine-related economic recession as soon as possible. This requires a maximal renovation of the resorts so that they can remain sufficiently competitive. Therefore, the most popular and influential islands are investing outstandingly large sums in their development. The latter involves not
additional dwellings, air seats, and attractions to entertain the guests. In addition, the existing visa policies need reconsidering to enable visitors to spend long-lasting vacations in the region with no worries about bureaucratic issues. Furthermore, some islands are planning to allow foreigners to work without any special documents, which may add to their willingness to stay in the region. Certain communities find creative solutions to attract as many people as possible, among which is a cruise to Bermuda with no connection to other islands.To provide factual information and illuminate ongoing changes, Suri provides examples of developers like John Alexander. He intends to build more accommodations and will open the area’s first glamping destination, Little Bay Eco Resort, on 54 acres, with tented rooms comparable to another luxurious glamping resort, Paws Up Montana (Suri, 2021). Another example is shown through St. Lucia’s attitude, in 2021 received 20,000 extra flight seats from the U.S., and the development of new facilities was already ongoing (Suri, 2021). According to the island’s head of state, Evelyn Wever-Croes, Aruba’s number of tourists began to recover in July 2021 (Suri, 2021). The region now intends to invest around $153 million in 2022 and $264 million in 2023 to increase accommodations.
ignorant.Consequently, the example of how rhetoric and oratory skills can be abused to persuade people into doing harmful things is seen in “Thank You for Smoking” book The main protagonist of the book Nick Naylor is a lobbyist for a tobacco company. He is able to win any argument with his wit and his speeches. For example, he made a speech in congress where he started with the statement “show of hands who out there thinks that cigarettes aren’t dangerous?” knowing that the cigarettes are indeed dangerous and that nobody interacts with the audience in Congress (Buckley 2010). He mastered three rhetorical appeals as Ethos that appeals to credibility; Logos appeal to reason, and Pathos appeals to emotions. Therefore, regardless of the truth behind his words, the audience is most likely to be convinced by Naylor’s rhetoric at the end of his speech.
the high school history class, to connect to the topic on a more personal level.Moreover, the very fact of including this scene in the chapter endows it with a confessional quality. Within the scene, the father asks the narrator to omit what he just told because it has nothing to do with the Holocaust, signifying it as personal information. However, by virtue of reading the chapter, the readers already know that the narrator does not keep his promise because the story is right there, told through both drawings and text. Once again, adding this scene demonstrates Spiegelman’s awareness that most of his audience would not have a direct and personal connection to the Holocaust. Yet, by including this scene, the author makes the audience feel as if they have been let onto something personal and intimate, which fosters a better connection to the topic. Thus, the choice to include the episode with the narrator’s father asking to omit the stories of his youth is rhetorically aware in more than one sense.
IntroductionFrom the perspective of business accounting, risk management involves the assessment, evaluation, and mitigation of risk within the practices of an organization. Typically, risk management is seen as a strategic management concept, but within the context of modern businesses, accounting contributes strongly and is heavily invested in risk aversion. Enterprise risk management should be at the core of a professional accounting mindset, and to add value, accountants must be outward-looking risk experts that offer insight for their organizations when meeting their objectives or responding to uncertainty. Finance and accounting provide key quality information to management in a timely manner that can be used by managers at all levels for informed decision-making (Camilleri & Camilleri, 2017). Accounting is a tool for success, working with operating management to make conducive decisions, take on evaluated risks, and achieve enterprise strategic goals.DefinitionRisk management is a comprehensive process of identifying, analyzing, and mitigating/accepting the risk of uncertainty. Risk is quantifiable in both absolute and relative terms and becomes ultimately inseparable from return on investment. Despite risk being viewed in negative terms, it is necessary to achieve performance objectives. In its basic form in accounting, the risk is a deviation from the expected outcome (Camilleri & Camilleri, 2017). The deviation is either positive or negative, but it is generally accepted by financial professionals that increased returns come at greater risk and, in turn, come from increased volatility. Accountants consistently search for means to reduce volatility and risk through the use of various metrics such as standard deviation, distributions, and dispersions. Risk assessment
is one of the key components of internal control in organizations, identifying areas of risk loss via accounting records and implementing adequate controls (Needles et al., 2014). Evaluating risk statistically and numerically allows for highly informed decision-making in regard to existing or potential risks.Risk has traditionally been defined in terms of the chance of danger, loss, injury, or other negative consequences. In accounting, the risk is viewed from the perspective of decision trees, probability distributions, cost-volume-profit analysis, pricing models, cash flow models, and many other frameworks. Risk management allows one to methodically address risk, immediately attaching it to organizational activities and pursuing organizational objectives. Effective risk management consists of assessment, evaluation, treatment, and reporting. Meanwhile, the more in-depth enterprise risk management approach is aimed at aligning risk management with a business strategy and embedding a management culture into business operations (Collier et al., 2006).Types of RiskRisk is broken down into categories allowing for more effective and efficient comparison and evaluation. Risk will always be existent to some extent, so accountants must understand that some level of risk is viable, but tradeoffs and opportunity costs must be considered to either eliminate or maintain some risks. Therefore, it may be helpful to categorize risks, but different institutions may approach this differently. 1. Market risk – changing conditions in the marketplace where the organization operates, ranging from general market tendencies to specific company-specific elements. 2. Credit risk – stemming from the risk associated with credit extended to customers and/or suppliers, with the risk that either can default. The company
must also ensure that it meets its own credit obligations in a timely manner. 3. Liquidity risk – this can include asset liquidity and operational funding liquidity. The company must have cash on hand to pay for basic expenses, balancing its assets and operational funding. 4. Operational risk – risk arising from daily business activities, ranging from crises and lawsuits to fraud and business models (Camilleri & Camilleri, 2017).Role of AccountantsAccountants have an important role in helping organizations with internal controls and risk management processes. It is one of the core competencies of accountancy as a profession to oversee and improve internal control programs in an organization. They ensure that staff members are away of risk control language and standards, which must be met with all financial operations. Accountants virtually create the standards and then implement them in an organization (Needles et al., 2014). In a way, accountants are key strategic partners in decision-making management in risk management and consideration.Accountants are most effective at risk management when they have an understanding of enterprise risk management (ERM) and applications of daily operations of a business. Companies with ERM strategies in place generally thrive better in risk and can focus on business continuity. A significant portion of companies is reactive to risks rather than proactive, and risk management is an activity that is best undertaken offensively before anyone is prepared. In order to do so competently, companies need accounting staff that can measure and manage risks accurately in all their forms. However, for ERM to work, it must
be linked directly to company strategy and actions. Accountants have direct insight into a company’s finances and supply chains, so they work cross-functionally with other departments, such as H.R., I.T., sustainability, and others, to essentially evaluate financial and non-financial risks across the organization to construct a holistic risk framework (Thompson, 2020).Impact on Accounting QualityERM gained significant attention and popularity in the midst of the 2008 crisis. It is believed to enhance a company’s ability to soften the impact of a major economic crisis as well as lead to an improved value relevance of account information for firms adopting ERM. Accounting quality is not a clearly defined term but generally implies that the value relevance of accounting information is considered and the ability of accounting information to reflect the true performance of an organization. Some common characteristics highlighted as vital to accounting quality are timeliness and timely loss recognition, accrual quality, earnings management, and discretionary accruals (Olayinka et al., 2019).Accounting quality allows firms to reduce earnings management, minimize discretionary accrual, and offer great information on earnings. It is a vital measure of the value relevance of accounting for an organization seeking sustainable growth. ERM became popular around the world because it is meant to enhance the accuracy of corporate disclosure, improve the reliability of financial statements, develop stronger risk management, and enhance accounting quality. Therefore, accounting is directly interrelated with risk management and prevention in such systems. Accounting is vital for ERM function, while ERM seeks to enhance accounting processes by improving financial reporting quality and strengthening
the internal processes of an organization (Olayinka et al., 2019).Risk Management and Corporate GovernanceCompetent corporate governance is a result of an effective risk management system that creates a controlled environment. This is why much recent legislation around the world, including the Dodd-Frank Act in the U.S. in response to the 2008 financial crisis, requires effective risk management implemented in firms. Management accounting, under the concepts of risk and governance, has to be managerially actionable in order for their role and proficiency to be interpretable in logical and predictable terms. While risk management is the foundation of modern management control, management accounting is directly influencing corporate governance. For example, failure to provide accurate accounting reports and then use these reports inefficiently by risk management will have a negative impact on corporate governance. There is an inherent interdependence between risk management, managerial accounting, and corporate governance (Van der Poll & Mthiyane, 2018).The design and utilization of strategic management accounting techniques are based on strategic information collection to address environmental uncertainties to support strategic decision-making. As part of the organizational structure, it is the role of the board as part of corporate governance to formulate a successful strategy, with managerial accounting reports enabling this task. Strategic management accounting is the basis for strategic positioning, which includes Porter’s competitive advantage and strategic cost exploration. Therefore, the usefulness of management accounts in risk management is paramount and is necessary for sustainability. However, if a firm chooses to ignore the strategic position, management accounting can then be used as a mitigation strategy.
This once again demonstrates the triangle, side-by-side interdependence between corporate governance, risk management, and management accounting, and companies should recognize this interdependence (Van der Poll & Mthiyane, 2018).Therefore, to understand how accounting systems influence risk management, it is important to view the firm as a governance coordinating mechanism for information provided to individuals. The objective is that the correct information is shared with targeted teams, departments, and individuals to whom they are relevant and enable them to undertake the tasks which fall under their responsibility. Effective information provision seeks to support efficient operations and primary concerns regarding risk management. Another important step is to extract meaning from the information, which requires expert judgment to interpret various calculative practices for risk assessment, such as the interpretation of uncertainty (Brookfield, 2018). Management accounting is a critical aspect of a company. However, even its elements can have certain challenges. For example, transparency, which is exalted as necessary for smooth governance, can be concerning. Evidence has shown that not all firms utilize management accounting in risk management for governance purposes. Some viewed M.A. statements but chose to ignore them; others presented manipulated healthy financial information, which was inaccurate, leading to collapse in both cases (Van der Poll & Mthiyane, 2018).Multiple organizations adopt ERM to meet compliance regulations and virtually ignore the need to proceed with risks strategically. However, a comprehensive ERM approach is more effective. First, management accountants are asked to aid the organization in identifying risks and opportunities with events that have not yet occurred. Accounting is also asked
to determine probabilities of occurrence and financial outcomes of these events, as well as justify why substantial investment controls of said risks are necessary even though there are chances they will never happen. Management accountants are familiar with regulatory standards, have direct lines to top executives, and usually have the experience for informed advising to decision-making parties. Management accountants play internal control roles in various ERM activities, and these activities may be aimed at multiple stages of risk management, from risk prevention itself, such as staff training, information on new software, etc., to actually resolving problems when confronted with consumers or regulators (analyzing costs of alternative ways of delivering repairs). Despite this, the profession still has no clear taxonomy regarding the role of management accountants in ERM activities (Bento et al., 2018).While research and regulatory body of guidance and frameworks in ERM are becoming extensive, management accountants are still creating new territory regarding ERM practices. Management accountants have specialized experience and training on how to measure, report and analyze the financial and non-financial impact of decisions. Given leadership roles, management accountants can develop truly enterprise-focused ERM systems that are not dependent on functional silos but seek to permeate decision-making through the organization. This fits into the new paradigm of management accounting which calls to broaden its professional strategic scope and be better than a myopic view of planning and control, measuring the performance of the past and being able to make forward-predictive measurements about organizational sustainability and risk (Bento et al., 2018).In a complex dynamic market
environment, the effectiveness of risk mitigation may be difficult to pinpoint. The point of ERM is not to maximize profits but rather to create an equilibrium that is optimal and conditioned on its environment. The organization reaches a status quo where desired outcomes are reproduced from transactions undertaken that motivated the firm creation in the first place. Therefore, the issue adjusts from a static set of accounting-based budget targets to a process of equilibrium. Accounting and accounting technologies contribute immensely to organizational effectiveness and follow all other elements of organizational hierarchy closely (Brookfield, 2018). The key to remember is that information provision is always central to accounting technology and its role in effective risk mitigation.Future of Risk ManagementCurrently, the financial industry is undergoing significant changes with the advent of blockchain and fintech technology. Blockchain is a disruptive element in currency, supply chains, and information-sharing practices. However, as with any new technology and practices, it will present additional risks. Accounting and ERM will be at the helm by addressing aspects of financial data integrity issues, financial reporting risks, and implications for external auditors. Firms that adopt blockchain will have to adjust their policies and accounting practices over internal controls and counterparty risk assessment. Both internal and external auditors will have to assess blockchain implementation primarily as a financial reporting risk (Smith & Castonguay, 2019).Advancements in fintech are rapidly advancing, with up to a quarter of global financial institutions being at risk in the near future. The primary benefit of financial tech is eliminating elements of costly data
up hope. They also provide some guidance for those who long for justice (Hoezee, 2020). The problem these verses present for the world of health care, however, is that they do not tell how soon relief will come and illness will go.Matthew Chapter Five is not all about the same thing. In line eleven, it says to remain blessed when persecuted for the faith (English Standard Version Bible, 2001). This is the most difficult verse for me, because when faced with condemnation, I often get lost and begin to doubt. Lately, however, I have become convinced that people’s negative reactions only strengthen my faith. Overall, Scripture itself is a guide for me in my career in health care administration. The truths it contains allow me to stay on track and give hope to others, including patients. In addition, these verses play an important role in making me aware of my spiritual poverty and desire for God.
SummaryEven totalitarian nations are vulnerable to powerful requests that may organize millions of citizens and potentially influential leaders, attract foreign institutions and mass perception, and push their regimes to respond. The openness of legitimately established administrations to local opinion and initiatives by entities to reform policies and regulations varies substantially. The viewpoint of a revolutionary organization on the formulation of a cultural crisis can attract the public’s concern, focusing interest on the issue at hand and discovering answers. They might, however, be short-lived endeavours or episodic spurts of energy (Massey, 2016). Advocacy groups and participants of progressive organizations concentrate on the factors that contribute to the success of social movements. Not all social movements succeed all of the time; instead, the vast mass of individuals fails to meet their objectives.How Social Movements MatterIn most cases, social movements pursue collective goods or outcomes, but not always. These things must be shared by a group regardless of their participation in the movement. Some outcomes are shared among the activists and a larger group not part of the movement (Massey, 2016). Politically active people can be members of a movement to bring social change to society. Members of a movement who interact as they seek social change create a social network constructed in cyberspace and through exposure through grievance-voiced media.What is a Social Movement?Social movements are forms of tumultuous engagement that question current conditions and practices and their validity and ethics. Movements must communicate with the general public, arrange contacts, and successfully fulfil the needs of those participating. Members
their theatrical nature because of the necessity to break through the cacophony of information that will otherwise drown out the movement’s activities; theatrical staging has become more likely (Massey, 2016). Without the threat or disruptive measures, gaining recognition for a union and obtaining a collectively bargained contract are improbable outcomes.Political Opportunity for Social MovementsPolitical opportunities, such as the capacity to establish several voting blocs and get a foothold in public debate and government halls, are critical to a movement’s success (Massey, 2016). The rule of law is intended to protect the general public from specific political viewpoints. When the government has complete control over what is transmitted, it can monitor it and use it to suppress any opposition.Digital Technology, Social Movements and when Social Movements MatterSocial movements are primarily supported by the usage of social media, which allows them to express their opinions openly. Understanding how social movements affect societal change requires separating movement goals, activities, and claims of success from other elements and linking what a movement accomplishes and the outcomes. Social movements are significant since they affect the popular view, shape legislation, and shape culture. It also affects several individuals who take part in the movements have a long-term influence on their personality, personal decisions, and degree of societal participation.
The foundation myths of Rome represent some of the qualities vital for a successful state in antiquity – decisiveness, militancy, and political and social flexibility. Historians of different sorts have been trying to understand and interpret the story of Romulus and Remus since its creation. The following stages of Rome’s supposed history also raise many questions regarding fratricide, abduction, rape, and also the backgrounds of Rome’s first citizens. The fact that according to most of the myths, Rome started from fratricide seems to be quite relevant as the city’s history is famously filled with civil conflicts and wars. Many historians tried to sugarcoat this episode – Cicero ignored it, Dionysius of Halicarnassus depicted Romulus as full of regret, and Egnatius suggested that Remus had survived and outlived Romulus (as cited in Beard, 2015). Another Roman historian – Livy – told the story of Romulus reacting to his brother’s actions, therefore, portraying the city’s founder as a hard, bellicose, but rather just person (as cited in Beard, 2015). Regardless of the interpretations, it seems that belligerence, resoluteness, and willingness to quickly resolve both internal and external conflicts with blood found their reflection in Roman myths and history.On the other hand, the history of Rome is the history of unprecedented openness, inclusiveness, and social mobility. The fact that the majority of first Roman citizens supposedly were criminals may cast an unpleasant shadow on the city’s legacy, yet in the end, this led to more open political and social systems. Unlike other states of the ancient world, Rome not only accepted foreigners but also incorporated them into its society, gradually granting citizenship to the people of provinces (Beard, 2015). One of the kings of Macedon in the third century BCE recognized the advantages of the Roman approach (as cited in Beard, 2015). Without much of a doubt, it can be presumed that Roman foundation myths are closely intertwined with the Roman identity, and it is possible to identify some of Rome’s success factors through its myths.
Romanticism is a large-scale ideological and artistic trend in the culture and art of the 19th century, which replaced the cold rationalism of neoclassicism and Enlightenment. Romantics have elevated the importance of fantasy, emotions, feelings, and mental tossing (Steiner & Foster, 2020). The era of heroes with robust, bold, contradictory, and sometimes rebellious characters has begun in literature and art. These are figures like Byron and Prometheus, who either proclaim man’s greatness or become vulnerable in the hands of fate while passions overcome them. They embark on wanderings, climb the barricades, raise the banner of freedom, and do not know peace.Romanticism in painting rejected the rationalism of classicism and reflected the attention to the depths of the human personality characteristic of the philosophy of the Romantics. It grew up on the emotional soil of sentimentalism, but while preserving lyricism and poetry, it replaced sentimental sensitivity with dramatic manifestations of nature. Therefore, it is not necessary to associate this direction with religious motives – instead, with the romance of distant wanderings, travels, mysterious discoveries, and even revolutionary struggle. Unlike sentimentalism, there is no tenderness and tearfulness in Romanticism – it is the philosophy of the brave and strong.The characters in the paintings of romantic artists are similar to the heroes of literary novels: sensitive, often enigmatic, sometimes riotous, sometimes cruel, and often lonely. Many creators were immersed in studying the dark sides of human nature (Steiner & Foster, 2020). Hence, there was the interest of artists in the night, thunderstorms, and mysticism. To some extent, the romantic
work The Hero of Our Time . Thus, at the heart of any piece of the direction of Romanticism lies the gap between reality and the idealized world, and this gap has rather sharp edges.An example of contemporary romanticism is the film “The Perks of Being a Wallflower.” The main focus is on the 16-year-old boy Charlie, who is surrounded by typical problems for his age: school parties, cool friends, relationships, unrequited love, drugs and alcohol, and teenage depression. Like any romantic character, Charlie struggles with the outer reality that he is not willing to accept. The major romantic idea of the movie is that the protagonist is that Charlie matures, and his view of the world, experience, and environment changes. Therefore, despite the fact that modern films can hardly be viewed from the point of view of romanticism, “The Perks of Being a Wallflower” is a worthy example of a romantic work of art.
IntroductionThere are a variety of options used by psychologists, psychiatrists, and counselors to identify the symptoms of mental health issues and psychiatric disorders among patients. In turn, the Rorschach test is considered one of the most popular and developed assessment systems utilized in different parts of the world. This test has got a vast spread throughout the media, which is why the majority of the worldwide population is aware of this test due to movies, TV-shows, and fictional stories. On the one hand, such considerable popularity of this assessment tool can be explained by its effectiveness in the process of detecting numerous psychiatric issues. On the other hand, this test has been criticized by scientists and healthcare providers for several decades in a row.Nowadays, this test is represented as a procedure when the examiner demonstrates the other person each of 10 cards and asks to describe them. In turn, the examinee expresses personal thoughts and ideas regarding the images, thereby, offering a psychiatrist the opportunity to determine some deviations associated with the psychological health of a patient. These cards are mainly black-and-white, although some inkblots are colored. In terms of interpretation and assessment of the results, scientists have been debating since the middle of the past century. As a result, there are numerous evaluation tools which can be applied to the answers of patients. The Rorschach Performance Assessment System (RPAS) and Exner’s Comprehensive System (CS) are regarded as the most reliable and valid assessment tools which can be used for the Rorschach test. Thus, in spite
of the fact that the suggested psychiatric test has been critiqued many times, it is still one of the most well-grounded methods to identify psychiatric issues, such as schizophrenia.HistoryEven though Rorschach is frequently perceived as the first scientist to assess the psychological well-being of individuals on the basis of ambiguous scenes, this belief is not accurate. In fact, this person was inspired by numerous other influencers aiming at detecting the earliest stages of psychiatric issues. Initially, the boy developed an interest in this area due to the game called Blotto , a form of Klecksography (Teles, 2020). The majority of kids were playing this game at the beginning of the 19th century. However, the production of art and charade-based pictures out of inkblot has become Rorschach’s main point of interest in adulthood as well.Once the health issue called schizophrenia became a globally recognizable problem, Rorschach began studying the artwork of mental patients. In 1920, the scientist managed to develop 15 inkblot cards which were intended to test the psychological health of patients (Teles, 2020). First, the effectiveness of using these cards was tested with the help of 400 patients, including 117 individuals previously diagnosed with various types of mental health issues. Once the effectiveness of this method of psychiatric assessment was confirmed, Rorschach took appropriate measures to spread this information throughout the whole world. In 1921, the book called Psychodiagnostik was published by the House of Bircher (“The Status of the Rorschach”, 2005). However, the Swedish scientist died one year later due to complications of physical
health issues. In turn, the contribution of this individual to the field of psychology and psychiatry was acknowledged only after his death.UsesTo assess and interpret the responses of patients accurately, it is important to understand how the Rorschach test should be used. First, each respondent should be provided with 10 cards, one by one (Weiner & Greene, 2008). In turn, the examinee is allowed to analyze pictures from different positions. Therefore, test-takers are able to hold the cards upside down or sideways. Moreover, these individuals can provide answers related to their associations with the picture in any form they want; it can be done with one word or several phrases. Second, the examiner is allowed to ask additional questions or stop the process of a patient responding if the given explanation is not subject to future interpretation.Rorschach and Assessment PracticesUsually, the assessment of received results is based on 2 important steps, such as simultaneous analysis and further interpretation. In the context of the first stage of assessment, examiners pay attention to a variety of different factors. They include the way respondents describe the image, the length of response, extra comments, and the uniqueness of responses. For instance, the majority of individuals have a similar view on the inkblot cards, which is why the responses of mentally stable individuals are usually the same. Therefore, once the individuals provide a unique view of ambiguous scenes, it can be a sign of disturbances in thought patterns. Furthermore, examiners take into consideration the amount of time the respondent takes to
give the answer. In fact, if the waiting time for responses taken more than 10 seconds, the person is suspected to be shocked.As of the assessment practices, there is a variety of versions which can be used to assess the result of the test. In the past century, the most commonly used assessment practices were the Beck system, the Klopfer system, the Hertz system, the Piotrowski system, and the Rapaport-Schafer system (Mihura & Graceffo, 2014). At the same time, the effectiveness of these systems emerged to be dubious when other scoring systems were discovered. Exner’s CS has been considered the most reliable way to interpret the results of the test for several decades, although the Rorschach Performance Assessment System (R-PAS) became its improved version.Criticisms of Exner’s CS and Comparisons to the R-PAS AdministrationAs one of the most widely used interpretation approaches to the Rorschach test, Exner’s CS has been used by psychiatrists and psychologists since the 1960s. This scoring system can be considered a tremendously difficult approach, as it includes numerous variables that should be measured with the help of different tools. However, a high level of validity is the main benefit of this scoring system.In terms of criticism, Exner’s CS has been discussed in relation to over-diagnosing psychotic disorders and subjectiveness. The presence of errors was the main cause of the poor reliability of this scoring system. In order to facilitate the process of results interpretation, scientists kept working on the development of an innovative scoring system even when Exner’s CS was introduced to the
world. As a result, R-PAS took into account the disadvantages of previous systems and improved them (Meyer & Eblin, 2012). For example, some of the variables were eliminated, whereas the others were analyzed from different perspectives.Nowadays, complexity, space integration, and space reversal are considered the most important variables of this assessment system, even though there are many other variables taken into consideration. At the same time, it has been confirmed that responses to the Rorschach test vary depending on the country. Therefore, R-PAS is based on a total of 15 adult samples, which makes this scoring system even more reliable (Mihura et al., 2013). In spite of the fact that the latest scoring system still requires improvement, it is regarded as the most valid method to interpret the results of the Rorschach test in modern society.CodingCoding Rorschach responses is one of the most significant stages in the process of results interpretation. In fact, the accurate coding of responses is expected to give psychologists and psychiatrists a brief understanding of the patients’ internal world and their mental health. At the same time, inaccurate coding of responses can lead to the prescription of ineffective treatment (Kimoto et al., 2016). Hence, scientists and psychiatrists usually code responses on the basis of 2 steps.The first step of coding requires examiners to take the information transcribed during the test administration (qualitative material), whereas the second step of coding is based on interpreting it into numeric scores (quantitative information). In turn, gained scores are used for the interpretation and discussion of health
components. Accordingly, the accurate interpretation of responses can help psychiatrists, psychologists, and counselors determine the health status of different population groups.ConclusionRorschach test is one of the most widely used assessment tools in the area of psychology. Despite the fact that it was developed almost 1 century ago, it still has vast relevance. Such considerable popularity can be explained by a high level of validity and reliability. At the same time, scientists still take appropriate measures to improve the quality of this test. In fact, taking into consideration that the discussed test results in spontaneous outcomes, some interpretations can be considered inaccurate. Furthermore, it depends upon non-verbal communication and its specific features. Motivational barriers are also included in the list of disadvantages associated with the Rorschach test.However, the accurate interpretation of responses is beneficial for the identification of particular psychiatric illnesses. It is the reason why this evaluation tool has been used for numerous decades in different parts of the world. In the future, scientists should improve the scoring system in order to offer examiners the opportunity to improve the reliability and validity of the received results. Thus, the Rorschach test can be regarded as an integral part of the process of psychological assessment, as it helps detect mental health issues and psychiatric disorders.
Bjurström, Erling and Hylland, Ole M. (Eds.). (2018). Aesthetics and Politics: A Nordic Perspective on How Cultural Policy Negotiates the Agency of Music and Arts . Springer International Publishing.This scientific work tries to find the primary sources of rock as a culture. The authors refer to the ancient Nordic society, analyzing their way of life, moods and character. Musical instruments and the role of music as a sphere of art in the life of the layman are considered separately. As a result, the researchers come to the conclusion that it is impossible to identify the only source of the genre, but it is worth considering the whole society as a whole. This, in turn, suggests that rock can be regarded as a worldwide condition, since different parts of the world in one way or another invented rock motifs and melodies. Thus, the writers emphasize that the genre should be considered as a separate stage in the evolution of art, and not only in the field of music.Mazel, Aron, Charette, Carole and Nash, George. (Eds.). (2021). Indigenous Heritage and Rock Art. Worldwide Research in Memory of Daniel Arsenault . Archaeopress Publishing Limited.The authors of this book conduct a worldwide and large-scale study of the role of rock motifs and certain musical instruments in the life of primitive societies. Further, the writers notice the cultural characteristics of the natives and Indians, as well as African tribes, emphasizing rock music as a tool for connecting with God. This allows us to conclude that the religious meaning in rock culture
moods and people comes from the distant past of civilization. One of the researches included in the article was the analysis of wooden and later electric musical instruments. The authors came to the conclusion that the choice of both the material and the tonality of the sound of such instruments is not accidental, but is intended to communicate to God, nature and the public about the most disturbing problems. It is this approach that is taken as the basis of the study, in which rock music is considered as a separate language of self-expression and cultural context.Šajnović, Melanija. (2021). Rebellious Sixties: Countercultural Values in Rock Music . Web.This book explores the relationship between culture and rock as a genre of music. It is remarkable that the authors take the basic sounds of English culture as a basis for studying and consider their introduction into the genre. Thus, the authors come to the conclusion that rock is not so much a relatively modern trend in art and culture as a collective image of different eras. Finally, the book provides theory and analysis of the origins of rock music and its development. This allows to understand the causes and key aspects of the whole process, as well as to reveal the relationship of the analyzed genre with world culture.
Rousseau’s discourse about the notion of self-love in its two manifestations is an appealing and insightful one. The philosopher differentiates between amour de soi-même (self-love) and amour-propre (vanity), distinct in their virtue. Indeed, on the one hand, self-love as a mere natural feeling of love toward one’s self is opposite to vanity. It might be defined as “a natural sentiment which moves every animal to be vigilant in its preservation and which, directed in man by reason and modified by pity, produces humanity and virtue” (Rousseau, 106). Vanity, or egocentrism, on the other hand, is an opposite sentiment, the one that originates artificially in society due to the coexistence of individuals with others. In particular, the philosopher states that it “moves each individual to value himself more than anyone else, which inspires in men all the evils they cause one another, and which is the true source of honor’ (Rousseau, 106). The two notions are different in the nature of desire, which is natural in the case of self-love, and artificial in the case of vanity.The natural form of self-love is deprived of comparisons to others and exists in the natural world as a mere characteristic of the need of an individual to strive and survive. Such a form of self-love implies that a person does not need anyone else to validate the value of his or her existence. Indeed, “each particular man regards himself as the only spectator who observes him, as the only being in the universe that takes an interest in him, as
the only judge of his own merit” (Rousseau, 106). Such a form of love is good since it leads to human happiness, promoting self-efficacy. On the other hand, vanity or egocentrism is a bad type of self-love since it promotes comparison with others in a society, which ultimately leads to atrocities. Due to vanity, people regard others compared to themselves and judge them as weaker, ultimately committing offenses.In the philosopher’s opinion, the cause of inequalities in different spheres of the life of societies is in the adherence to the bad type of self-love. Originally, all human beings belonged to a natural world where all species were equal until a physical transformation in their constitution occurred. It ultimately led to the differences in their physical and psychological state. In particular, “improved or declined and acquired various good or bad qualities which were not inherent in their nature, the others remained longer in their original state” (Rousseau, 33). Over time, with social ties, a moral or psychological inequality emerged due to the differences in property and wealth. The wealthy experienced more power and independence than the poor, which led to social, economic, and political inequality.In his novel 1984 , Orwell unfolds the intrinsic features of a totalitarian society. A totalitarian political regime is a system of state laws and conduct that presuppose one-party rule centered around a singular idea, which is commonly pursued by violent and oppressive means. To force the population to abide by the totalitarian rules, the rulers eliminate any opportunity for individual accomplishment and assert
IntroductionOn 17 February 2020, Mr. and Mrs. Illman submitted a proposal. They suggested a building plan of 4 affordable homes with one local needs home on land east of Beck stones and North of Thornthwaite, Keswick (‘‘The Keswick Reminder,’’ 2021). According to the plan, the homes consisted of four double-story buildings, and one bungalow within a paddock, all sharing a common parking area. The homes will enjoy the serene view and location on the feet of the historic hill.Summary of Local People’s ThoughtsThe affordable housing plan experienced massive rejections by local people in the proposed area. The local people had their reasons based on the valuable historical view of the national park, such as the lack of need for houses in such a lonely place with high natural vista value (Zhongming et al., 2020). Among other reasons for rejections was the insufficiency of the parking lounge, chances of flooding, and the likelihood of properties surrounding the area losing value (‘‘The Keswick Reminder,’’ 2021). There were 12 different objections to the idea submitted to the district planners following the proposals, with some opposing the plan and others siding with it.Some of the submissions included reasons for implementing affordable housing in the selected location. Some submissions indicated that it was apparent affordable housing had been chosen, as the plans were more likely to gain a sympathetic ear from planning officers, being the current highest area of need. The overriding consideration of the local plan was to give greater weight to conserving and enhancing natural beauty, wildlife, and cultural
heritage. Any acceptance of the plans would mean that, as the planning authority, they have not fulfilled their duty (Mackinlay, 2022). Other claims raised to the authorities included the serene location of the site, the project’s influence on the neighbors of the homes, and the possible threat the development would impose on protected species and ecology. In addition, some claimed the matter of the appearance the proposed homes would portray (‘‘The Keswick Reminder,’’ 2020). Consequently, eight letters were submitted to the authorities to support the proposed plan.One of the supporters said the plan would meet the drastically increasing need for affordable houses. A second supporter said that the local area would keep suffering, as there are no young generations in the villages. A third one said it was a massive surprise for the planning committee to object to the development plan, yet they were aware of the increasing need for affordable houses. Generally, the entire project faced various objections with significant issues rotating about the land’s serenity. Something that required maximal environmental conservation and the ever-rising need for affordable homes. The objections and support of the project by different parties lead to the authorization of a vague one. Every issue raised had some significant weight on the decision to be made.The Extent to which the Development Accords the Development Plan and the National Planning Policy FrameworkDespite meeting a couple of criteria set by the development plan and the National Planning Policy Framework, the development missed some that the same development planning body had set. The first
criterion involved regulating development plans to ensure such projects benefit the local area’s rural natural environment and landscape. These main aspects have played a considerable role in promoting tourism and the cultural preservation of history. The proposal submitted by Mr. and Mrs. Illman did not meet this criterion because rather than contributing positively to the area’s landscape, it tarnished the area’s serenity (Gkartzios et al., 2022). The affordable homes are located adjacent to a historical hill and a serene view of the National park. Therefore, the project would block the views tarnishing the area’s landscapes. As a result, the proposed plan is likely to affect tourism negatively, a central idea behind the planning of rural areas.Furthermore, the project would interfere with the environment because it is located on an undeveloped piece of land. As a result, it will imply interfering with the natural environment to ensure human needs such as roads are available to the homes’ occupants. The second criterion regulates authorization of remote land encroachment on whether the project will enhance the availability of the various services and community facilities. Some of the projects that may meet the requirement include setting up local shops, meeting places, places of worship, and public houses (‘‘Lake District National Park,’’ 2022). The project proposed by Mr. and Mrs. Illman met this criterion as the plan involved the construction of four double-floored homes and one bungalow. As a result, the project will play a key role in addressing the housing problem, which is rampant in the current world. Providing affordable
homes in rural areas will play a role in easing the population of people in urban areas.The third criterion used to authorize rural projects is how the project promotes the development and diversification of the various land-based businesses and agriculture. The plan proposed by the Illman’s failed to meet the criteria as the plan had no direct contributions to either business of agriculture. The plan stipulated the living homes, and therefore, there is no diversification, which will be realized as the plan lacks any idea of how to exploit the area economically. The fourth criterion was set on the authorization of rural land utilization as the project’s role in the sustainability of the businesses that exist in the rural areas. The proposed plan, in this case, would meet this requirement, as their migration to the rural areas would imply buying various services and goods traded within the locality, thus positively influencing the business.Assessment of the Issues Raised by the ProposalVarious issues arose following the proposed plan, where multiple parties had different views on the idea. Some of the problems were realistically leading to the decision to reject the plan rightfully, while others were unrealistic and should not even have contributed to the decision-making. The negative impact of lacking the young generation in rural areas was one of the critical issues raised by supporters of the plan stating it negatively affects various businesses and agricultural activities. As a result, it would contribute to the fading of the historical culture of the people. The idea has a sense
in it and should have been more considered over most of the ideas that led to the plan’s rejection (Walker, 2020). Once a person is born in the town, raised, and aged in the town implies they will not have exposure to the culture, which eventually fades away.Furthermore, destroying the view of the Hill and the National Park naturally was the other major issue that rose following the proposal. The idea was not as relevant on the grounds of the height of the hills and the park, and that which the homes would cover was insignificant. Still, the views were clear according to the various pictures submitted by the plan’s supporters to the authorities. Therefore, because the projected homes had insignificant impacts on the serenity of the area nor the views of the Hill and the park, the issue should not have played a role in rejecting the home’s construction. Another issue arose following the proposal regarding its role in decreasing the value of the properties that exist within the location (‘‘The Keswick Reminder,’’ 2022). The idea was significant to the proposal, bearing in mind the objective of making rural tourism better. The construction of the homes would cause the Hill to loosen its value. Initially, tourists would enjoy the serenity and loneliness of the hill, but once the homes are constructed, they will lose the loneliness and eventually discourage tourism.The Specific Decision the Local Planning Authority MadeThe local authority rejected the proposal bid majorly because it fails to enhance the natural beauty, wildlife, and cultural
society. RT actively distorts the truth, presenting it in a light favorable for itself, which is a condemned practice unworthy of the press.According to Hutchins, state control of the press is the loss of a primary defense against totalitarianism. In the context of RT and its coverage of news about Ukraine, it can be noted that this media tool is a direct instrument for spreading propaganda. All the dangers to the free press described by Hutchins can be highlighted in the work of this structure, which indicates its incompetence as a reliable source of information. Therefore, applying this report to the situation with RT and Ukraine, it can be concluded that this news resource does not belong to the free and responsible ones but promotes a clear political position sponsored by the Russian government.
Throughout history, interventions such as safety measures and quarantine were implemented to improve public safety. According to Rosenberg (2019), Mary Mallon was “the first “healthy carrier” of typhoid fever” recognized in the United States at the beginning of the 20th century, which made her infamous as Typhoid Mary (para. 1). This woman was found to be a typhoid bacteria carrier, and healthcare authorities accused her of 47 illnesses and three deaths, isolating her on an island for most of her life (Rosenberg, 2019, para. 45).Woolliscroft (2020) argues that the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic and people’s public health responsibilities are “a modern instance of a long-standing problem as exemplified by the celebrated case” of Typhoid Mary (p. 1141). The story of the coronavirus outbreak during the 2020 charity tournament of Novak Djokovic is a recent example of a mass disease spread. As Shapiro (2020) reports, four tennis players tested positive for COVID-19 despite the organizers’ effort to follow health guidelines and ensure safety (para. 1). In contrast to the Typhoid Mary situation, modern safety protocols and quarantine interventions allowed to limit the adverse consequences of the Djokovic case for the public.Overall, humanity has significantly improved public health measures since the Typhoid Mary incident in the 20th century. While the case of Mary Mallon raised ethical concerns and the issue of individual rights, it also highlighted the importance of infections disease identification in asymptomatic carriers to prevent massive outbreaks. The situation of Novak Djokovic illustrated how a timely response could reduce the adverse consequences of mass spread. Both instances raise the following questions: “What measures can be implemented to reduce outbreaks?” and “What role do clinicians play in disease management?” Based on the World Health Organization’s guidelines outlined by Salathé et al. (2020), I recommend “rapid diagnosis and immediate isolation of cases, rigorous tracking and precautionary self-isolation of close contacts” to control outbreaks (p. 1).Furthermore, Blais and Hayes (2016) underline the role of nursing in global health and disease prevention and management, namely, raising awareness, improving communication, and identifying solutions to challenges. People should accumulate knowledge obtained throughout history to improve public health and safety measures.
Being an international company with diversified sectors, Coates Chemicals developed an interest in fuel production because of the introduction of E10 fuel in the United Kingdom. The organization has a variety of sectors ranging from foods and beverages to pharmaceuticals covering most of its consumers’ needs. The urge for the bioethanol plant compelled the company to construct the plant and produce ethanol from glucose. This report stipulates step-by-step safety guidelines that made the construction and production of ethanol in Coates Chemicals.After conducting the comprehensive feasibility of the bioethanol plant, it was evident that 10000 terapascal of pressure was economical in ethanol production compared with the viability of the current marketplace. The organization was erected adjacent to River Trent. The main reason for the plant to be situated near the river is to cut down the costs incurred in case water areas are far away from the bioethanol plant. The manufacture and processing of ethanol require a lot of water in its processes (Velazquez-Lucio et al. 2018, 452). Thus, it is of great significance to have plenty of water during the manufacturing and processing processes. Besides its commitment to the manufacturing and processing sector, Coates Chemicals has put more effort into the organization’s sustainable development. Thus, this organization is accountable for its actions to its varied shareholders, like consumers and suppliers.As part of the company’s aims to serve their consumers the right package of end products from the various sectors under Coates Chemicals, the organization aims to achieve the following objectives by 2025. First, Coates Chemicals is
IntroductionThe multimedia developers are mainly concerned about the sample resolution and quantization when scanning a full-color photograph in digital processing. Digital processing digitalize images both spatially and in amplitude. The analog video signal is sampled and quantized by the digitizer. Continuous data is converted to digital form using sampling resolution and quantization. The spatial resolution of a digitized image is affected by the sampling rate, whereas the amount of grey levels in a digital snapshot is controlled by the quantization level. During processing an image, the size of a sampled image is presented as a digital value (Torii, 2018).Quantization LevelsThe quantization levels of the image should be high enough for people to detect small shade variations. When an image is quantized with insufficient brightness levels, incorrect outlines are the primary problem. The authors discuss color picture quantization algorithms that are adjustable and tapered. The goal of the research is to show high-quality color reproductions with small frame buffers. According to the research, various color images that normally need a frame buffer with 15 bits for every pixel could be quantized to 10 or fewer bits with little subjective deterioration. The images produced are usually superior to those created using uniform quantization (Torii, 2018).The Task of Color Picture Quantization is divided into Four Stages : 1. Obtaining color statistics from the original image 2. Using color statistics to select a color map 3. Mapping original colors in the color map to their closest neighbors 4. Redrawing and quantizing the original image.Sampling and QuantificationIf the camera or sensor’s
The school-to-prison pipeline is a phenomenon, which implies that expelling students can push them to face the criminal justice system. Cruel tactics of punishments resulting in suspension and the presence of police at schools contribute to this process. For example, in 2017, according to the Office of Juvenile Justice and Delinquency Prevention in the U.S. Department of Justice, “more than 230,000 children aged 14 and under were arrested” (Meek & Austin, 2019, para. 7). This situation is especially meaningful to children with learning disabilities and people of color. The pipeline is a critical phenomenon, which requires close attention as more and more people are influenced by this irrational situation, and ways for stopping or slowing it need to be found.The current school policy is one of the main reasons for the pipeline existence, as even minor violations of school rules are criminalized today. This strategy has received the name of “zero-tolerance,” implying that a person receives a severe punishment despite the circumstances (American Civil Liberties Union, 2020, para. 6). The youth faces the justice system in situations that should typically be handled at schools, for example, students may be expelled for bringing nail clippers (ACLU, 2020). The main cause of this phenomenon is the system of punishments, which allows student suspension. According to Letitia Basford, the associate professor at the Hamlin University, “when students are expelled <…>, they miss vital classroom time, fall far behind, and are more likely to drop out” (as cited in Kopas, 2020, para. 6). The research showed that when schools provide
Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde and Frankenstein are distinguishing works related to science and indeed, they have several things in common in terms of how the authors used science (Shelley; Stevenson). Creating pure evil from a monster made by a decomposing body, apparently, two scientists did not know how science would turn into a “horrifying” experience. This essay examines the works of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde and Frankenstein in providing messages about science and integrity, claiming that science is used as a tool for violence.To begin with, the majority of the scientists that launched research did not see the studies completed as the comparison between the two scientists suggested. Dr. Jekyll, for example, finds Frankenstein’s numerous scientific experiments and observations fascinating despite his abandonment. Notably, both scientists’ initial reactions to creation are quite clear and obviously different. Another message that Frankenstein’s abandoning of a scientific experiment sends is that the domains of science and integrity have distinct demarcations and bounds. For example, Frankenstein says, “My dreams were therefore undisturbed by reality; and I entered with the greatest diligence into the search of the philosopher’s stone and the elixir of life.” (Shelley, 65). A “supernatural creature can only comprehend certain intrinsic concerns,” and competing with such powers will be terrifying in and of itself. After giving life to the “monster” Frankenstein made, a horrible creature, the phrase is valid.There are selfish motivations regarding the scientific experience in both works. By the manner he exhibits his adoration and wonder of his new scientific discovery, Henry Jekyll, unlike
Frankenstein, is motivated by a sense of power and overpowering depravity. He isn’t completely honest about his desire to make a human being to disprove other biblical claims. The way the two scientists approach their research reveals a lot about their personalities.While both Jekyll and Hyde are enthused about their scientific research, Frankenstein decides to abandon his project, calling it a bad idea. In Jekyll and Hyde, it says, ““Utterson, I swear to God,” cried the doctor, “I swear to God I will never set eyes on him again. I bind my honor to you that I am done with him in this world. It is all at an end.”, showing the acknowledgment of his actions (Stevenson, 123). The other two scientists (Jekyll and Hyde) are shown as self-centered and egotistical, but Frankenstein is regarded as a man of integrity who is true to his ideals and objectives. Frankenstein is also more sorry for starting the experiment.What is clear is the doctors’ lack of accountability for their carelessness resulted in innocent people’s deaths. Both Frankenstein and Dr. Jekyll exhibit this lack of integrity by not telling the truth about the scope of their experiments and by obliterating the majority of the evidence of their respective scientific achievements. Some of the scientific experiments carried out by both Dr. Jekyll and Frankenstein are characterized by illogic and sheer evil. In the end, both scientists had to acknowledge that, despite their scientific knowledge and self-importance, they could not overcome some of life’s strange and incomprehensible conditions, such as creation.The
study. Human experimentation is a violation of integrity and scientific norms, notwithstanding the fact that Dr. Jekyll utilized himself as a subject in the experiment. The utilization of human cadavers by Frankenstein is also regarded as a complete breach of scientific integrity. Most of Frankenstein’s and Dr. Jekyll’s scientific experiments were conducted in secret, with willful disregard for the potential damage to society. This scientific research, in and of itself, should serve as an illustration of what happens when science’s integrity is questioned.To conclude, the topics of science and integrity in Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde and Frankenstein are shown from a side of “horrifying” as both led to a terrible experience. There was a violation of ethics in science and it demonstrates what will happen if science is practiced by people who do not follow the code of conduct and ethics. As such, Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde and Frankenstein illustrate how science can be a great tool for violence.
The scientific method allows scientists to study various phenomena by testing their assumptions built from observations of the surrounding world. As a result of exploring and attempting to explain the world, a scientific method process used by researchers was formed. It includes such steps as exploration through observation and questioning and testing hypotheses and predictions and their verification through experiments or additional observations. Despite the benefit and clarity of the scientific method, readers should still critically evaluate the information presented in articles.Scientific articles often address current problems of concern to society. For instance, an article serving as a secondary source and presented in The Economist describes a study testing measures for HIV prevention among young African women (G.C.). The original study was published by Baird et al. in the scientific journal The Lancet. In this work, the use of the scientific method is clearly traced. The authors observed that African women are forced to date and marry older men to ensure their own well-being, but such relationships contribute to the spread of HIV (Baird et al. 1320). The researchers hypothesized that providing additional financial assistance to young women would change their lives and not be forcing them to marry older men. Baird et al. conducted a randomized cluster trial to test their hypothesis. They held an experiment providing an additional income to a group of unmarried African women. As a result, the hypothesis was confirmed – financial independence reduced the incidence of HIV.When critically evaluating an article, it is worth noting that it has many advantages that testify to its reliability. In particular, its authors have Ph.D. degrees; the study was conducted under the auspices of The World Bank and published in a peer-reviewed journal (Baird et al. 1320). The authors acknowledge that the article has some limitations, and further research is needed to clarify the findings. However, their experiment has shown results and could be a critical step in reducing the prevalence of the disease.
The 1972 German massacre during the Olympic Games in Munich was shocking for the entire world. Although terrorism was already a renowned international threat in the 1970s, security during this event was not strong enough to prevent the invasion of the Olympic village by the Palestinian extremists (Hirsch, 2020). According to Spindlove and Simonsen (2018), on “September 5, 1972, eight members of the Palestinian Black September terrorist group entered the village” and “managed to secure … nine Israeli hostages” (p. 160). They demanded to release more than 200 Palestinian inmates from Israel’s prisons in exchange for the athletes, who would be killed if their request was not fulfilled (Spindlove & Simonsen, 2018). The leaders of the two affected countries decided not to accept extremists’ terms. Thus, the German military group opened fire on terrorists and their hostages, which resulted in the death of all of them (Spindlove & Simonsen, 2018). This accident strengthened Germany’s anti-terrorist agencies, while Israel responded with the Operation Wrath of God.Germany had to implement additional regulations that could control immigrating Arabs and their organizations within the country to prevent similar tragic accidents in the future. The main reason why terrorists were able to invade the village was that the Games had weak security that was unarmed (History, 2021). Moreover, theories suggest that Palestinian extremists received assistance from the administration of the Olympic Games, but this information was never confirmed (Reeve, 2018). Germany established a GSG-9 agency, which became an elite anti-terror unit (Spindlove & Simonsen, 2018). Its principal function is to defeat
SummaryAnthrax, a serious breathing illness, is forcing air currents out of Midwesterners, sending dozens of people to the doctors’ offices. The victims are wheezing and gasping for breath and more people are being infected. Researchers begin the investigation by speaking with Zeke, who was the first victim to learn what he used to be before becoming ill. Zeke stated that he began wheezing and feeling super tired shortly after leading a soundtrack training course for 50 participants at a Chicago music venue. He suspected he had caught the illness from one of the learners in the classroom or that he had managed to catch it on a return flight from Africa two days before. The agent that is responsible for the outbreak is highly probable to have been released at the music festival.Agent Responsible for the Breathless Outbreak in the MidwestAnthrax is a dangerous disease caused by the bacterial Bacillus anthracis. Anthrax is not spreadable. Individuals cannot catch it from some other individual in the same way that one can catch a bad cold. Anthrax can be commonly found in soil normally and can infect domestic and wild animals such as livestock, sheep, and goats (Figueiredo, 2019). When living things consume spores (bacteria) from polluted soil, they are often ill. People can become infected with Anthrax by managing diseased animal protein or inhaling anthrax spores from animal foods. People can also become infected with Anthrax by eating raw meat from infected animals or being subjected to pathogens by bioterrorists.Overview of the ConditionThe outbreak took place at
different locations in the United States; Chicago, Wisconsin, Illinois, and Milwaukee. A total number of fifteen individuals were infected, and emergency centers reported fifteen hospitalizations (CDC, 2022). In addition to that, there were seven reported deaths of the outbreak victims. These people have frequented emergency departments in the last two days with complaints of mild fever, tiredness, chest tightness, heart palpitations, and breathing difficulties. Numerous deaths have already occurred, and more people are on the brink of death.Current Condition of Breathless in the U.SThe situation in the United States is getting worse every day. There has been an unexpectedly high number of kids with coughs, colds, and breathing difficulties this season (Denny et al., 2018). This is according to Rachel Wolfson, an acute inpatient general practitioner who treats sick people at the University of Chicago’s Comer Children’s Infirmary, in which the eleven Illinois reports were recognized (CDC, 2022). Wolfson explains that some of the children in her care required only nasal spray remedies, while others were significantly more ill (CDC, 2022). The lungs of one patient were in a such horrible condition that medics had to attach them to a blood oxygen generator.Epidemiologic TriangleIn this part of the work, the principle of disease transition between the agent, host, and environment, also called the epidemiological triangle, is revealed. Anthrax is a deadly contagious disease caused by Bacillus anthracis, a gram-positive, rod-shaped pathogen. It is found naturally in the soil and frequently harms both animals and food worldwide. Fungal spores of the disease can survive in the ground
pathogen enters a host immune system of a mammal, the spores germinate, rapidly distributing pathogens to the blood system.Initiatives that Community Health Nurses Can Undertake to Prevent Re-OccurrencePatients with isolated epidermal Anthrax who do not have institutional participation or difficulties can be handled as outpatients with antibacterial drug standard treatment. Individuals presumably infected must wash with soap and warm water rather than detergent solutions; garments and proof should indeed be put into three plastic shopping bags. If pathogens are proven, a 1:10 dilution of domestic bleach may be used to disinfect any components or surfaces that have not been sufficiently scrubbed by soap and warm water.Whenever the case of disease is revealed, one must inform community medical officials and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention of issues reported. Additionally, a discussion with an infectious diseases specialist might be justified, though diagnosing patients with Anthrax is relatively simple. Individuals can lower their risk of Anthrax infection by being immunized. The BioThrax vaccine is the only FDA-approved anthrax vaccination. It is a five-dose vaccine sequence managed over an extended time when used as a preventive action. Products suspected of possessing biological agents are subject to special surveillance by or government.
Recently the self-driving technologies have been significantly developed by the researchers. Many companies consider self-driving vehicles as the future of supply chain management growth. Generally, self-operating technologies can minimize the expenditures on supplying the goods. Such technologies provide more fast delivery opportunities. Due to the large-scale implementation of such technologies, the whole transportation system will be changed. Despite the positive aspects of these innovations, self-driving vehicles have particular ethical considerations.Self-driving technologies can significantly improve the development of the transportation industry. The global supply data storage can be efficiently evolved into artificial-intelligence-based vehicles. As a result, the trucking industry and supply management will be more efficient and practically oriented. Thanks to these technologies, many expenditures for transportation will be reduced. It will be achieved by eliminating the driver profession because self-driven technologies require almost no human labor. Another positive impact of self-driven technologies is better customer services and more quick delivery. As a result, the total turnover of various companies will grow. Transportation using self-driving vehicles also contributes to more resiliency in deliveries. Some researchers believe that the automatization of supply chain management will contribute to the more profound partnership between companies (Kota, 2018). The expanded opportunities for cooperation will enhance cooperation through the quicker deliveries.The most dangerous adverse effect of self-driving technologies is global job loss. This is a significant ethically and socially vital issue that should be addressed before implementing technologies. Today the driver is one of the most widely spread and quickly gained professions. People worldwide work in the transportation industries to ensure the efficient delivery of products. However, when self-driven technologies are involved, all these people will lose their jobs. It is essential to develop special training programs for drivers to change their specialty.
a corrupt government that had killed its citizens. It sparked a revolution, overthrew the regime, and may even have caused the Americans to enter the Vietnam War. However, the monk himself most likely did not die for revolutionary ideas. His self-immolation was an act of rejection of the system and the inability to deal with injustice.Tunisian street vendor Mohammed Bouazizi set himself on fire in protest against harassment by local officials. The desperate act of the young man caused mass street protests in the city. The rioters demanded the resignation of President Ben Ali. His political regime faced long-term economic and social problems, resulting in unemployment, mostly among young people. Mohammed Bouazizi became a symbol of the Arab Spring; he gained followers in Tunisia and other Arab countries, which also led to mass protests.Most of the self-immolations did not impact the current situation; however, some of them played an important role in the political events in the country in which they took place. The actions of both men can hardly be called a specific call for revolution. Both cases can be compared, considering them as an extreme measure of disagreement with injustice. It seems that the men have no other means left for the official authorities to hear them. In one way or another, both events significantly influenced the course of history.
Service marketing is usually defined as a promotion of an intangible good or a service to a particular segment of the audience. It is distinguished from product marketing by such features as Inseparability, Heterogeneity, Intangibility, and Perishability. This paper will focus on the last characteristic, perishability, which implies the impossibility of any storage or repeated use of the service. In case the service is not used, it is most likely to be lost forever (Hole et al., 2018). Examples of such can be a concert or a sports event. Sometimes they can be canceled either by a performing party or by a consumer. In this case, the service does not take place at all. Perishability also underlines a limited time of their use, which is usually specified. For instance, a concert of classical music which lasts for two hours. Because of these time constraints, the consumers can reasonably demand more from the services than from the products.Another implication of this feature from the marketing perspective is the difficulties in regulation of supply and demand as it is rather unpredictable. Moreover, in case of poor marketing, economic losses are guaranteed. An example could be not a fully loaded plane or fifty percent of unsold tickets for a concert. As the service still occurs despite these facts, a part of the revenue will be lost. Also, the services cannot be returned in case of a consumer’s dissatisfaction in contrast to other commodities – it is also the feature of perishability. Thus, it also leads to a more demanding consumer as they cannot get a refund and should be considered in a marketing strategy. To conclude, in order to overcome the problems caused by the perishability of the services, it is essential to have proper planning, pricing, and flexibility.
one of the core roots of the issue. Girls in both matters grow much faster, which introduces the other side of the conflict to dissonance (Duncan, 1988). Boys with a lack of social and emotional development can show this interest in inadequate manifestations, not recognizing the damaging impact.Many students do not understand the essence and consequences of the problem due to their juvenile and inexperience. However, all negative experiences and unresolved traumas have a significant risk of development in adulthood. Such researches are essential to study the behavioral patterns of children to avoid any kind of abuse and bullying. The surveys revealed that the affected party had little faith in the administrative strength of the school and felt that they had to deal with everything on their own (Aguilar & Baek, 2020). It points to the current inefficiency of the school system and the urgent need for change.
It should be noted that drivers should not be allowed to use handheld devices when their vehicle is stopped at a red light. The driving process is highly demanding of one’s attention, which means that any form of distraction is a risk factor. Handheld devices are distractive, and thus, drivers lose sight and focus of the road and signals of movement. Therefore, handheld devices should be banned for drivers at all times because stopping at red lights also requires drivers’ attention.The red light signal is a critical element of road safety and efficient movement, especially at intersections. The State of Georgia implemented an act, which “makes it illegal for drivers to “physically hold or support, with any part of his or her body,” a wireless telecommunications device” (Dyke and Smith, para. 2). Only exceptions to the rule include making “calls to report a traffic accident, criminal activity, medical emergency, or hazardous condition” (Dyke and Smith, para 3). However, the red light signal is an essential part of road safety, which does not remove the need for a driver’s attention. A study suggests that “phone use during driving causes decrease in situation awareness and delays response to the events happening in driving environment which may lead to accidents” (Choudhary and Velaga 351). In other words, drivers will be slow to react to light changes from red signal to green one. This will cause unnecessary delays in the movement of traffic.In conclusion, on the basis of evidence provided above, drivers should not be allowed to use their handheld devices during the red light signal since attention on the road is required even during the stop. The delayed response time might cause unnecessary traffic and congestion. These factors increase the risk of accidents because not all drivers will be responding to changes in light signals at the same time.
The research shows that criminalizing pregnant women who use or misuse drugs is harmful to both them and their unborn children. It emphasizes the consequences of policies that penalize pregnant women who use drugs instead of providing adequate therapy or care (Thomas et al., 2018). The findings suggest that criminalizing pregnant women for drug use is inefficient and damaging since it can result in poor health consequences for mothers and babies (Weber et al., 2021). Furthermore, the regulations are frequently discriminatory, and harm reduction measures help to guarantee that pregnant women get the treatment they need.This is one of the reasons why criminalizing drug use by pregnant women is harmful to both moms and babies. Pregnant women who use drugs may be terrified of being arrested, detained, or imprisoned if they seek prenatal care or drug treatment. Furthermore, criminalizing a woman’s behavior during pregnancy breaches her fundamental rights, particularly her right to privacy and equal protection under the law (Carroll et al., 2021). It claims that it infringes on a woman’s freedom to procreate and bodily integrity. It penalizes women who want to go on with their pregnancy and encourages them to avoid criminal punishment to terminate their pregnancy. As a result, it is essential to note that specific regulations may favor abortion (Carroll et al., 2021). Furthermore, it discriminates against women in general since it does not penalize dads who engage in behavior that may harm an unborn child.
were also prevalent. Enslaved people consisted of Native Americans or Africans, with the latter brought to America against their will (Harris, 2018). However, indentured servants made individual choices to migrate, looking for economic opportunities and hoping to live better overseas (Delao, 2021). The servants often worked cultivating tobacco and building the economy, with indentured servitude influencing culture and society in North America (Delao, 2021). Colonial regions had varying labor, but some were forced to work while others did so voluntarily.To summarize, the practice of slavery was characterized by capturing people and considering them as a workforce. Regions often viewed enslaved people as goods for trading or means to make money but failed to regard them as human beings. However, labor was represented not solely by enslaved people but also by indentured servants who willingly arrived in colonial America seeking jobs to improve their lives.
illness. In the early stages of lung cancer, there are generally no signs or symptoms, although many people with the disease eventually acquire a mix of them. A chronic cough, coughing up blood, dyspnea, inexplicable exhaustion, weight loss, and an ache or pain when inhaling or coughing are all common symptoms of lung cancer.Although those who have never smoked can get lung cancer, smoking is the leading cause. This is due to the fact that smoking includes breathing a variety of hazardous compounds on a regular basis, and thus leads to almost 72% of cases (O’Keeffe et al., 2018). Treatment is determined by the type of mutation in the tumor, the extent of its dissemination, and a general condition of the patient. If the problem is detected early and the malignant cells are contained to a small region, surgery to remove the afflicted lung area may be advised. If surgery is not an option owing to the overall health, radiation to remove malignant cells may be suggested instead. Chemotherapy is frequently used when the cancer has developed too much for surgery or radiation to be helpful.
The construction of social reality is one of the concepts of great interest to modern scientific knowledge. Ultimately, science develops to make the acquired knowledge possible to implement technologically in the process of transformative practice for the benefit of man and nature. In this sense, social reality appears because of the corresponding technological approach, and the technical procedure appears as a social construction of reality (Lancet, 2013). The structure of social reality, both in the meaning of creating a public image and in the definition of technological transformation of the world, reveals the process of constructing a New World Order and its implementation through globalization processes. The main form of social structuring of reality is human activity, represented by material and spiritual productions. The purpose of social construction is to build universal models in which subjects and groups of people create the reality they perceive. Constructing social reality studies how people make social phenomena standardized and transformed into traditions.Undoubtedly, people adjust their self-image to appear to others as they would like them to be. For example, when applying for a job, people may attribute the merits that they did not receive. Thus, it can help them get the desired position. Social interaction is represented by the mutually conditioned influence of social subjects on each other. Each person has to perform many situational roles during their life. A person interacts with different people and social groups daily (Fleming, 2006). It rarely happens when they fully interact only with members of one group, for example, a family. Still, at the same time, they can also be a member of a labor collective, public organizations, etc. Being members of many social groups simultaneously, they occupy a corresponding position in each of them due to their relationships with other group members. This is also necessary in order to achieve a certain social role, for example, to get a job. Nevertheless, each person needs an individual approach, which dictates the need to change.
IntroductionThe appearance of material and monetary resources is the starting and initial point of forming a bottomless and wide gap between several people. From now on, the world has split into “two camps,” and individuals are classified not only by physical, personal or mental characteristics but also by the principle of having specific benefits. Today, there are both rich and poor citizens in any country, and sometimes the ratio between them is exceptionally remote. Nevertheless, each person is equal, less or more dependent on each other since they live in a society. Dedication is a vital sign of a spiritually rich, profoundly and broadly thinking person who has not lost human and compassionate qualities.Responding to the IdeasThe main idea and thought of the passage is self-feedback, dedication and selflessness, regardless of the amount of money and the availability of precious items. According to Andrew Carnegie, any wealth requires sharing and returning to those who need exceptional help and support. Everyone should recognize their qualities for the sake of the whole society. Accordingly, if the rich continue to get prosperous, ignoring the poverty of others, this will lead the entire society to decline, and the rich themselves will also suffer. Indeed, wealthy people should give part of their capital to the impoverished. They are obliged to use their skills and means to fight poverty and help needy people get out of deprivation.Undoubtedly, the achievement of wealth, if it is not inherited, will require a lot of effort and time. However, this does not always bring the desired happiness, and this reflection most often turns out much later. Many individuals, realizing that wealth does not make them happy, cannot give up their habitual way of life. Therefore, that is why it is worth understanding what one really wants. For instance, Carnegie realized that money is not a goal or even a means to achieve it, but only an accompanying attribute. Thus, the man collected the necessary amount to take his time, not chase money, live in pleasure, enjoy the calm flow of days and live one day.ConclusionIn conclusion, any good earned by a person requires dedication and devotion. Some people lack the opportunity to have enough money and funds for the best life because of external or internal factors. Undoubtedly, Carnegie worked a lot, but there is a high probability that the man got to the right time and place. He realized in time that wealth does not bring him happiness, and one can obtain joy and pleasure even simply with the help of “small,” kind gestures – sharing and dedication.
Carl Jung identifies the mother complex with an innate feeling of care at the center of the emotional attachment between a mother and a child. However, in the absence of such an attachment, an archetype develops where someone’s mother fails to satisfy the essential demands associated with the relationship. The outcome leads the victim, the child, to seek comfort elsewhere (Bobroff 35). At the core of the mother complex is the mother archetype, meaning that in every emotional attachment, between the child and the mother, on the one hand, an archetype nourishing and security image manifests. On the other hand, an archetype that devours possessiveness, deprivation, and darkness comes out (Bobroff 36). In the film Every Secret Thing , a complex emotional attachment between Alice and her mother exists and forms the underlying relationship between the two and the association with the kidnaps taking place.The complex relationship between Alice and her mother places Alice at the center of the kidnapping. Hellen is disgusted by Alice to the point of considering Ronnie her child of choice, a position that makes Alice deeply insecure. Moreover, the tension in interracial affairs is associated with the second kidnapping and having born a biracial child while in prison, and given it up for adoption, Alice becomes the primary suspect in the case (Berg). Alice’s mother, the mastermind behind the kidnap, in the first and second cases, and murder, in the first case, plants evidence to ensure Alice stands out as the main suspect. Hellen, through betrayal and deception, purposely Alice ends up in prison (Berg). Further, compared to the indifference in Ronnie’s parents, there is no emotional attachment between the parents and their daughters. As the film comes to an end, the audience learns that not only were Alice and Ronnie falsely imprisoned, the justice system failed to prove that Helen is the killer.

The disparities between the opportunities of simple citizens and the residents of the Capitol present the severe issue of social class differences in The Hunger Games. However, the worst thing that happens to people is that they are used for the entertainment of those from the upper class. Overall, Suzanne Collins highlights the social inequity between the residents of the twelve districts of Panem and the wealthier part of society in the Capitol, focusing on the cruelty of the so-called hunger games.To begin with, the story revolves around two characters, Peeta and Katniss, who live in the twelfth district of the Panem and suffer from the Capitol’s cruelty. To be more exact, their neighbors are starving and have to work hard to earn money just to provide for their families, “District Twelve. Where you can starve to death in safety” (24). Katniss’s family is beyond poor, so she is forced to hunt in illegal territories to get food for her sister and mother. The girl’s family has no conveniences in their house, so they cannot even shower or properly clean their clothes. What is more, the twelve districts are forbidden to interact in any way, so people cannot travel outside of their areas or purchase food, clothes, and other necessities in the different parts of Panem.In contrast, the Capitol is thriving while the people of Panem work hard to survive. As a matter of fact, the upper class does not share any worries about them lacking food, designer clothes, or technology to live their best lives.
seen and, besides, provided with necessities during the games if they are sponsored. Overall, the Capitol cares only about its well-being and uses ordinary people from the lower classes across the districts for entertainment, where they starve, escape traps from opponents, and kill just to survive this horror.To sum up, Suzanne Collins presents the reality that the people of Panem have to deal with on a daily basis, trying to survive and provide for their families while the Capitol thrives on their struggles. The capital residents consider themselves superior beings and think it is fitting to torture the same human beings as them just for their fun. The fact that everyone’s fear of the Capitol casts constant horror on Panem makes Catniss a selfless hero who fights for her people and does not fear losing her life in the process.
unfair, the continuous flow of funding provides an outlook on a stable future with a low level of poverty in the country. On the other hand, Medicare’s initial goal was to provide health care to senior citizens who have no funds for treatment to eliminate the obstacles to affordable medicine and have impressive results. Therefore, while social insurance programs may seem ineffective, exploring their initial purpose shows that they effectively fulfill their functions with limited resources.Social Insurance programs are closely connected with socioeconomic and political forces. For example, the first social security program in the form of pensions was offered to Civil war veterans, and the Great Depression caused a rise of questions on measures to increase economic security for the elderly. Socioeconomic and political forces can also affect social insurance programs as political and economic determine the longevity of social security programs. Social insurance involves the moral component of governmental administration and therefore depends on the government’s core values. The politics determine the working conditions, retirement age, and payroll tax rates in favor of prevailing economic conditions. Therefore, negative trends in the economy or governmental shifts that include changes in the administration’s core values can negatively influence social insurance programs.
related to this specific topic. When I scroll down ice-skating videos without watching them, they start to appear rarely in my TikTok field. The same algorithm works when I start skipping interesting videos and watching something I did. It becomes difficult to return videos that I like as the algorithm follows all my actions.Instagram and YouTube have the same algorithm system, and the proposed advertising is usually based on past Google research. For instance, recently, I have been looking for a new pair of shoes, and a huge number of advertisements started to be shown while watching videos on YouTube or while watching stories on Instagram. Moreover, some algorithms have the ability to remember audio, and while talking to someone, the systems catch different product names, and promotions can appear in the social media field. On the one hand, this technology might be helpful as people can see different information according to their interests. Moreover, advertisements might not be disruptive and sometimes propose needed products. However, as long as phones and other gadgets might hear what people are talking about and send this information to the artificial intelligence which produces algorithms, it might be scary for some people, and the trust level might decrease.
Black Lives Matter is one of the significant social movements affecting the human understanding of race. It is committed to eradicating systemic racism in America. This phenomenon includes, for example, racial prejudice among police officers and judicial injustice against black people. Black Lives Matter involves different branches in more than ten American states. A movement arose after the senseless murder of African American teenager. A year later, a court consisting of five white people and only one black woman acquitted the police officer. The court’s decision caused massive protests from the African American population.The Black Lives Matter movement is not about individual flaws but the perceived general injustice of the American system, capitalism, and white people’s supremacy. Black Lives Matter and its leaders were definitely part of the American tradition. Their values ​​and beliefs can be traced back to the history of democracy and individual rights founders. The current COVID-19 situation aggravated the Black Lives Matter conflict. In the United States, pandemic-related racial divisions have also exacerbated the general problem. Thirty percent of all infected in the country are people with black skin color (while the black population in the United States is approximately twelve percent).The Black Lives Matter movement can be described through the relative deprivation theory. According to Ferris and Stein (2020), this theory explains the action of the deprived or oppressed group of people trying to protect their rights. Compared to other groups, black people have been exposed to oppression from the government and society. This social movement is concerned with equalizing the
First, I argue that social movements do not simply use disruptive behaviors at times but are naturally disruptive. Social movements usually emerge when the existing institutions — elections, political parties, and government agencies — are unable or unwilling to solve evident issues. As such, social movements serve as an instrument of direct democracy that articulates certain positions and conveys them to authorities. By doing that, social movements disrupt an ideal model of liberal democracy, in which citizens vote for the candidates, who, in turn, represent them in governing bodies.Therefore, the disruptive nature of social movements allows marginalized and underrepresented social groups to speak and be heard. Moreover, this notion is valid for all sides of the political spectrum, which makes social movements valuable to the democratic political system. For instance, the anti-globalization movement encompasses a variety of issues — while its left-wing aspect is concerned about environment and labor rights, right-wing anti-globalism aims at safeguarding national sovereignty and restricting immigration (Greenberg et al., 2018). In this regard, social movements cover various identities and foster political pluralism.Secondly, it is necessary to separate the disruptive nature of social movements from specific disruptive tactics that they utilize to promote their agenda. For example, both followers of the Civil Rights Movement and Black Lives Matter (BLM) used disruptive methods in the fight against racism. The difference between them lies in the message — whereas Civil Rights Movement actively sought to attract people from the outside, BLM struggled with the message of inclusion (Clayton, 2018). In the end, Dr. Martin Luther King’s rallying cry “We Shall Overcome” attracted many non-Black sympathizers, so BLM would arguably benefit from a more inclusive approach.
One way in which sociology can make a valuable contribution to the understanding of the interrelation between race and health disparities is by coining a working definition of race that emphasizes its relevant aspects. Even today, when the idea of the social construction of race has long gained traction, the concept of race is often affected by the notions of physical anthropology and genetic inheritance. A proper sociological approach to the issue of race as related to health disparities may alleviate it by focusing on the stratifying principles of race, such as socioeconomic disadvantages and discrimination (Hummer, 1996). This approach will allow concentrating on the socioeconomic factors most relevant as social determinants of health and, by doing so, enable a better understanding of causal relations.Another and more specific way in which sociology may help explain the connection between race and health disparities is by focusing on the environmental context of health. For instance, sociology may be of great help when explaining the access to opportunities for a healthier lifestyle and, in particular, diet. Kwate (2008) offers an example of what can be done in this regard in the study of the interrelation between residential segregation and fast food density. His approach involves analyzing the population, economic, physical, and social characteristics of a neighborhood to identify why fast food outlets are built at a proportionally larger scale in segregated black neighborhoods (Kwate, 2008). By doing so, Kwate (2008) shift attention from the simplistic explanations and assumptions that can steer the discussion of the problem in a wrong direction – such as the presumption that blacks like fast foods more. Thus, as in the case above, the sociological approach allows focusing on the actual structural factors behind the interrelation between race and health disparities.
Software piracy passes as any act resulting in stealing legally protected software. The act’s impact on the individual and society increases productivity risks through security holes that cause users to experience glitches and bugs. The outcome of the experience is frustrations, lost times, and lost work (Parson, n.d.). Two, the absence of warranties with the pirated software means they are exposed to increased security risks with the software containing viruses and associated malware that affect computers (Parson, n.d.). Third, the individual or society is exposed to legal risks associated with pirated software when caught using it. Piracy results in economic risks that take away legitimate software sales to the software company. Law-abiding companies are forced to illegally share their work with others (Parson, n.d.). Further, with other companies outside the software industry willing to pirate and save money, software companies run losses amounting to billions of dollars annually.In the U.S., consumers searching for illegal content have a choice of proliferated platforms enabling them to stream pirated material. As posted on Viaccess.orca, Stout (2021) shows that 23 million from 9 million American households used a pirated IPTV subscription in 2021. Further, pirated video services value from accessed non-Pay-TV and Pay-TV consumers was projected to be more than $67 billion by the end of 2023 (Stout, 2021). To counter this form of piracy, among the most effective ways is removing incentives for users to look for pirated content. The other anti-piracy solutions are PR and education, where piracy is highlighted as a crime, and legal and enforcement, where countermeasures are implemented to remove and interrupt pirated content (Stout, 2021). By mention, the other anti-piracy measures are cooperation, technology and operations, and barrier to entry.
Income segregation and development prioritization are forms of social inequality that perpetuate poverty worldwide. On the macro-scale, the poverty redress policies emphasize the importance of economic growth while the issue of social inequality remains in the background (Basu & Subramanian, 2020). A wider emphasis on growth further deepens the income gap since the people in the bottom 20% of the per-capita income spectrum do not necessarily benefit from the overall development (Basu & Subramanian, 2020). Thus, the policymaker’s hesitation in concentrating on the equal distribution of mean income remains the ultimate macro-cause of poverty.On the micro-scale, there is an issue with ambiguous data on the poorest population due to no fixed income source, with money coming from multiple information sources that are difficult to document (Basu & Subramanian, 2020). The documentation complexity then undermines the availability of financial help. Furthermore, inequality in school environments contributes to socioeconomic achievement gaps, resulting in income segregation (Bischoff & Owens, 2019). Overall, the lack of socioeconomically integrated settings contributes to diminishing low-income students’ achievements, while the lack of proper documentation contributes to the challenge of acknowledging the scope of the problem.Institutional discrimination is manifested through different systemic treatment of people in education, business, and politics. Social inequality is commonly rooted in an exclusionary institutional approach to education distribution (Teng, 2019). Education distribution, in turn, can be exacerbated by systemic income segregation through varying education funding (Bischoff & Owens, 2019). Furthermore, the institutions tend to select and promote people whose values align with the institution’s role in maintaining the group hierarchy
In 2014, Sony Pictures Entertainment faced a cyber attack from North Korea prior to the release of The Interview, a film that discusses the personality of North Korea’s dictator, Kim Jong Un. In addition to the cyberattack that caused millions of losses for the company, Sony also faced a threat from the terrorists that several theaters that will show the film will be attacked. Sony’s response to the threats included canceling the film’s release and switching to video-on-demand outlets. Some suggested that canceling the film’s release creates a dangerous precedent of a large company submitting to terrorist orders. However, while the company’s solution partially allowed them to disobey the terrorists’ order, it also displayed how terrorists’ plans can be prevented through technological development.In my opinion, Sony’s response was appropriate for the situation, as it could be acknowledged as the use of the opponent’s weapon against him. Therefore, while the terrorists used cyberattacks to steal the company’s information and destroy their equipment, Sony switched the release to on-demand platforms and streaming services, allowing a speedy and widespread release of the film. As on-demand videos are easier to pirate, the film’s pirate copies quickly spread across the internet, making film easier to access and more discussed across different countries and segments of the population. In addition, the film’s plot turned out to be more appealing to comedy than satire, influencing the public’s opinion about the earlier threats from North Korea. In my opinion, Sony’s response to the attack was appropriate for the situation and politicly addressed several concerns.Furthermore,
Clark, Nancy L. “Gendering production in wartime South Africa.” The American Historical Review 106, no. 4 (2001): 1181-1213.Clark’s topic is the impact of World War II on the independence of South Africa. The thesis is that historians are limited in their understanding of the relationship between the Second World War and African independence. The methodology is the analysis of historic documents describing the period of World War II. This is a paper on history with a substantial addition of women’s studies. The author relies on statements, memorandums, and other papers to show factual information. The main point of the author is that South Africa’s history during and immediately after World War II is underresearched. The author’s goal is to show the uniqueness of South Africa’s economic and political development among African countries. There is a definite bias against political forces that instituted apartheid.The article is noteworthy for its attention to details found in old documents. Clark herself acknowledges the limitation that little research exists that supports her viewpoint. Nevertheless, the article is helpful in that it showcases the ambiguity of South Africa’s social trends as opposed to The Impact of World War II and Mwanikii’s article, which are notably one-sided. The article will help answer the research question by accentuating the uniqueness of South Africa’s post war years in comparison to other African nations.Grundlingh, Albert. “The King’s Afrikaners? Enlistment and ethnic identity in the Union of South Africa’s Defence Force during the Second World War, 1939–45.” The Journal of African History 40, no. 3 (1999): 351-365.Grundlingh’s
topic is the role of South Africa in World War II. His thesis is that South Africa’s historiography does not properly describe the country’s efforts during the war. Grundlingh’s work is a paper on history, with a definite military focus. The author analyzes previous historic books, articles, and military reports. The main idea of the text is that Afrikaners who joined the Allied effort during World War II had a significant impact on Afrikaner ethnicity. Grundlingh’s goal is to dispel the public misconception that South Africa did not participate in the Second World War due to nationalistic opposition. Some prejudice against Western historians can be observed in Grundlingh’s description of current assumptions about South Africa in the early forties.The paper’s strength is the abundance of evidence of Afrikaners’ participation in military effort. The article’s weakness is that the author does not propose any other way of confirming his hypothesis other than accepting his interpretation. The article is helpful because it showcases military efforts of Afrikaners, which are not covered by any other sources. The article’s detailed description of South Africa’s military participation in World War II will provide invaluable insight for answering the research question.Smith, Jean P. “Race and hospitality: Allied troops of colour on the South African home front during the Second World War.” War & Society 39, no. 3 (2020): 155-170.Smith’s topic is the importance of South Africa during World War II as a transport hub for Allies. The thesis is that South Africa served as an important node for training and transportation, which
contributed significantly to the military effort. The article is a work on history, with some insight from social science. Smith uses evidence from memoirs, governments’ reports, and books depicting South Africa during World War II. The main idea of the article is that South Africa’s hospitality of the Allies’ forces indicated substantial complexity regarding racial segregation in the country. The goal of the paper is to identify social nuances, which became particularly noteworthy while South Africa hosted the Allies’ military forces. It can be argued that the author is biased by the modern understanding of racial issues.The paper’s strength is the relatively new perspective on the relationship between Afrikaners and Allied military. The paper’s weak point is that the author assumes the positive nature of the relationship by labeling it as hospitality, which was likely more nuanced. The article further continues Clark’s and Grundlingh’s trend of highlighting South Africa’s role in World War II, which directly relates to the research question.Teer-Tomaselli, Ruth. “In service of empire: The South African broadcasting corporation during World War II.” Critical Arts 28, no. 6 (2014): 879-904.Teer-Tomaselli’s topic is the changes in the mass media rhetoric during World War II in South Africa. The author’s thesis is that World War II changed the messages conveyed my mass media, which would eventually lead to social, economic, and political transformation if South Africa. The methodology used by the author is comprised of the analysis of news companies’ reports and Debates of the House of the Assembly. The paper is primarily a study of
reinforce the population’s belief in capitalist values. On the other hand, the structural functionalism theory approaches society as a living organism, where each part of society plays its function in the viability maintenance of the whole organism. Therefore, even though the concepts have similarities in equally prioritizing the importance of stability in society, their differences can be more apparent through application to modern culture and society.In his theory, Adorno pointed at the obvious narrative of mass media products, such as films and books, where wealth is often associated with happiness. However, another example with a more apparent connection to reinforcing capitalism is entertainment for children. From a very young age, modern children are exposed to different sorts of media in the form of tv shows, cartoons, and animated films. In the structural functionalism approach, the entertainment industry for children presents a source of education and emotional development. In different forms, the children’s entertainment industry teaches them important moral practices of being kind and polite to other people, which serves as the foundation for security in the future society. However, in the industrial culture approach, modern children’s entertainment is focused on selling the merchandise of different characters featured in films. For example, one of the most influential companies, Disney, invented the business model of using cartoon characters to attract children to their theme parks (Clement, 2018). Now, the company strategically plans simultaneous launches of animated films and merchandise with the films’ characters to ensure financial benefit.
IntroductionWhenever an information gap or an unresolved scientific topic emerges, misinformation will likely arise as people attempt to reason, better comprehend, and connect the dots. This has been the case with COVID-19 vaccines, which have been met with both appreciation and skepticism. Recently, some celebrities such as Joe Rogan have found themselves in trouble for promoting misleading remarks about COVID-19 on his show. Rogan, who owns, The Joe Rogan Experience, the world’s most popular podcast, signed a deal with Spotify to have his content exclusively hosted on the streaming platform (Dickson, 2022). With pressure mounting on Spotify to eradicate misinformation on the platform and take decisive action against Rogan, examining how the bedeviled company can win the public’s opinion is imperative.The Joe Rogan CaseJoe Rogan’s podcast is considered the most popular worldwide, meaning that it attracts millions of viewers and listeners. According to Rolling Stone, Rogan’s podcast has approximately 11 million listeners per episode (Dickson, 2022). Without a doubt, any COVID-19 misinformation emerging from his platform can be catastrophic. Spotify faces a big challenge because Rogan was allowed to host Dr. Robert Malone, an anti-vaxxer banned from other platforms such as Twitter. Malone made anti-vaccination remarks throughout the episode, including pushing the narrative that hospitals are financially motivated to report false COVID-19 fatalities (Dickson, 2022). Rogan is under fire because he seemed to embrace these ideas, with more emerging evidence that he had made racist remarks in many of his earlier podcasts. Therefore, further actions from Spotify should seek to win public trust, primarily through effective
communication.Spotify’s Position on the MatterSpotify does not believe it has a duty to police content posted on its platform (Holtermann, 2022). This is a reckless statement from a public relations perspective. The company has assured the public that it will add content advisory on some podcasts. This is a welcome move but should be implemented faster. Spotify has not dismissed Joe Rogan or shown intentions to investigate him. This is a blatant show of irresponsibility and lack of concern for public safety. Finally, Spotify lacks a discernible policy to tackle fake news or misinformation. These missteps from the start of the issue have continued to shape a negative attitude and public opinion about the streaming company. Without a quick solution, the company’s troubles may not end soon.The Communication ProcessThe ability to communicate with one another is a fundamental feature that distinguishes humans from other species. The act of communicating is the ability to transmit stimuli – usually verbal – to other individuals to change their behavior (Lecture January 24). The purpose of communication often revolves around persuasion for three reasons: Shaping, reinforcing, and changing. According to lecture notes, shaping is helpful in creating a favorable mood (attitudes) or brand identity, changing for influencing behavioral transformation, and reinforcing (most commonly used) for strengthening existing behaviors (Lecture January 24). Therefore, the company should incorporate all three strategies to tackle its problems effectively.Communication and Action for PersuasionSpotify executives are under pressure to address COVID-19 misinformation spread on the platform. In response, the company has claimed that it has no
obligation to tackle the misleading information on the ongoing pandemic. Unfortunately, the public and various leaders have not received this well. As a result, some musicians have removed their content from the platform, and many others threaten to do the same (Holtermann, 2022). Many users also suggest that they intend to replace Spotify with alternative streaming companies. This underscores the urgency of deescalating the situation. Spotify can start by using three rhetorical elements to change, shape, and reinforce public opinion. These include ethos, pathos, and logos, as proposed by Aristotle.EthosAccording to Aristotle, ethos speaks to the audience’s moral status. Spotify has not come out openly and admitted that Rogan’s show violated its ethical policy. It has emerged that the company has no policy regulating fake news on its platform (Dickson, 2022). This needs to change, and Spotify must start appealing to the public’s moral understanding. As Spotify looks to improve its policy on misinformation, it should come out openly and declare Rogan’s remarks as unethical. This will show that the company has a moral stand. More importantly, Spotify must reshape its organizational culture to embrace accountability. The picture Spotify has painted currently is that it lacks accountability, which is highly unethical.PathosPathos refers to a communicator’s appeal to the emotions of the audience. Spotify’s actions have shown a lack of concern for people who have succumbed to COVID-19, including health professionals working tirelessly to beat the virus. The pandemic has occasioned an endless period of suffering globally, and a large corporation like Spotify should empathize with those
actions would reinforce people’s trust that Spotify is correcting its mistake.ConclusionIn summary, Joe Rogan has put Spotify in a precarious situation. The company risk damaging its reputation further it fails to tackle the issue effectively. This could also lead to huge losses in revenue from streams if many users make good at their threat of leaving the platform. At the same time, Rogan plays a crucial role in the platform because his podcast attracts millions of listeners worldwide. Notably, his podcast is currently the leading globally in terms of followers and revenue. Despite these impressive statistics, Spotify, like any other company, has a social responsibility of ensuring its existence does not threaten public wellbeing. Since this has happened, Spotify needs to move swiftly and reassure the public of its ethical and legal obligations. It can achieve this by implementing the persuasion strategies discussed in this presentation.
Studying the literature of various heads can not only bring new knowledge about the past times. Literary sources can also provide valuable information about what views people have on such aspects of life as love, human relationships, or faith. Therefore, Søren Kierkegaard’s in his work “Fear and Trembling” conveys his unique vision of religion, which in some way differs from conventional faith. Thus, this work examines the concept of faith and its connection with morality and reasoning in the work of the Danish philosopher.In his work, Kierkegaard tries to answer the question about the nature and true meaning of faith in human life. With his works, the philosopher made a unique contribution to such disciplines as theology, philosophy, and literature (Noble, 2017). Moreover, in his writings, the author gave a new look at the biblical figures in order to highlight their relevance in modern times. According to the Danish philosopher, Christianity carries paradoxes that are offensive to the mind (“Søren Kierkegaard,” 2017). The most important contradiction is following the opinion that the eternal God can simultaneously become a time-limited human being. Søren Kierkegaard determined that morality is a duty to God only if the Almighty determines it. Unlike the generally accepted Christian faith, where it is a divine ethical duty to treat everyone.In conclusion, this scientific paper considered Søren Kierkegaard’s work “Fear and Trembling.” Its peculiarity is that it represents an exceptional view of morality and reasoning. In addition, one of the differences from conventional faith is the opinion that according to the philosopher, if a person chooses faith, then they should not remove their mind. In fact, the author believed that individuals should believe in the absurd.
Caterpillar Inc. is a leading global equipment manufacturer for the mining, oil and gas, construction, railway, and industrial industries. The company has three operating segments: the construction industry, the resource industry, energy, and transport. The first and last segments generate the largest revenue in the company’s consolidated revenue structure. Caterpillar Inc. also provides financial and related services through a number of subsidiaries. The company regularly conducts external audits and SWOT analysis to assess its effectiveness. These measurements help to identify the shortcomings of the organization in time and promptly eliminate them. I think these measurements are practical, and the firm’s successful work in the global market confirms this.The company’s organizational structure is guided by a board of directors and a global management team who work on overseeing the company’s actions, performance, and management policies. Caterpillar Inc., having suffered from the actions of competitors in the mid-1980s, reorganized in order to establish internal accountability relationships. Caterpillar’s Board of Directors presently has 11 associates (Lysak et al., 2020). This number allows one to diversify the experience without hindering practical discussion or reducing individual accountability. Previously, if something went wrong, the heads of departments blamed the managers of the central office for everything. The clear accountability provided by the new structure has forced people to look for solutions to problems rather than looking for the guilty. Accountable employees of the company work in various departments, factories, and testing sites.The company’s organizational structure is closer to the traditional rather than Holarctic. The company does not form autonomous groups and teams
develop to meet the changing market. At the same time, internal factors make it clear to the company’s management how quickly it will be able to increase efficiency with increasing competition. In addition, understanding the internal environmental factors helps to understand the internal problems of the company and provokes work to eliminate them. The fewer weaknesses an organization has, the more chances it has to take a competitive position in the market and hold it for as long as possible.Caterpillar’s global presence, a wide range of products, a comprehensive package of related services, and financial strength allow it to occupy a leading position in modern competitive markets. The company responded to changes in internal and external environmental factors by introducing additional advantages in order not to lose its leading position. Among such advantages, there are such as equipment characterized by high performance reliability and minimal total cost of ownership over the entire service life (Lysak et al., 2020). As operational management improvements for Caterpillar, we can suggest expanding the number of middle managers. Thus, individual dishonesty will be divided into several more links, and errors in the work will be detected and eliminated even faster. Such an innovation will also have a positive impact on future business decisions since they will be made with the involvement of a larger number of interested employees.
expand their talent and act fast.Another crucial thing to remember is that strategic planning is not the same thing as business planning. Instead, these operations are separate parts of a bigger process. As Hauk (n.d.) states in her article, while the business plan describes what the company provides, how it does that, and who the customer is, the strategic plan explains the actions needed to achieve those goals. In other words, business planning involves imagining and setting goals, while strategic planning implies executing those goals and fitting that into the desirable timeline.To summarize, a strategic plan is a well-designed set of priorities and instructions needed to achieve the company’s goals. Strategic planning needs to exist outside the comfort zone, but the manager needs to study before he could perform it easily and quickly. Strategic planning is closely connected to business planning since these two build, structure, and execute everything stated in the global business idea.
disruptive mass tourism, and the global market urgently demands new destinations and sustainable technology. It also gives proper impetus to technical progress, the development of more advanced equipment, and profitable cooperation with existing global brands. The top 7 Surfing Brands Worldwide include Quiksilver, FCS FINS, Rip Curl, Billabong, Hurley, O’Neill, and Volcom (Surfing. Global Market Trajectory, n.d.). Collaboration with these brands and careful attention to global environmental trends can bring Sun City credit and public favor.The political side remains unequivocal, as the States is still a priority for the vast majority of local and foreign tourists and investors due to its stable global position (Wilson et al., 2021). A severe setback is the coronavirus pandemic, which continues to put the entertainment sector at significant risk. Any actions in this direction must comply with the general situation in the world, and global security protocols, and focus on the maximum safety of people over profit.
love is unrequited. Another heroine, Sarah Jane Johnson, spends her entire life imitating, pretending to be white when she is actually black. Annie Johnson, Sarah Jane’s mother, is a black woman who lives her life with the feeling of always seeing herself through the eyes of others.Thus, all these female characters are role models in their performances. An exception is only Annie, who, although she lives under the prism of someone else’s opinion, nevertheless accepts the burden of the reality of what it means to be a black woman in a world that does not accept race. However, in the case of Lora, Susie, and Sarah Jane, authenticity is punished in a male-dominated and anti-female world.It is noteworthy that with her self-deception, Sarah Jane challenges the limitations of her personality and a woman’s role in those times. Refusing to be a real lady or a real black, Sarah Jane plays a series of impersonations throughout the film. On the one hand, she matches the images of a rich musician, which she demonstrates for her white boyfriend. On the other hand, she is a sultry singer for sleazy nightclubbers.
IntroductionSustainability is among the fastest-growing ethical concerns for individuals, businesses, and governments. According to Mason (2022), “sustainability takes into account how we might live in harmony with the natural world around us, protecting it from damage and destruction.” This means that sustainability is where people can sustain themselves without harming the planet. As a result, the sustainability concept that resonates with me is reducing the impact of climate change. The concept relates to my desire to be a climate change advocate. It also relates to my goal of becoming an environmentalist. Therefore, everyone has a role in promoting sustainability to make the planet a better place for everyone, including future generations.SustainabilitySustainability is a contemporary concept that encourages consideration of ways to live in harmony with nature. It can be defined as attaining our needs without jeopardizing future generations’ ability to meet their own (Mason, 2022). In my view, sustainability is concerned with how we should live in harmony with our natural world and safeguard it against damage and destruction for future generations. In other words, it involves existing and developing without depleting the available natural resources for posterity. It also means operating in effective ways for everyone because all the actions we carry out affect the future. For example, persistent organic pollutants can have adverse impacts such as an extension of species and damage to the ecosystem. This means that the environment will not be conducive to the incoming generations.The primary things that sustain me are air, water, and food in the natural world. Although human
beings can go without food for some days, death is possible if it is prolonged. Food is necessary for human survival because it is the source of nutrients that provides energy for activity, growth, and all body operations. Water is also an important element for human survival. It is impossible for humans to survive without water. However, polluted water is harmful to humans and can be a source of illness. Apart from water and food, I also need quality air to survive. This means that the air I breathe should be free from pollutants. Therefore, I require quality air, water, and food to live on Earth.Personal Understanding of Sustainability in My LifeThe sustainability component that is relevant to me is reducing climate change impacts. According to United Nations (2021), sustainable Development Goal 13 aims to “take urgent action to combat climate change and its impact.” It is about developing ways or solutions to reduce the planet’s climate effect. Minimizing the impact of climate change, also called climate change mitigation, involves avoiding and lowering greenhouse gas gases into the environment to keep the planet from heating up to high temperatures (Ahmed et al., 2019). In addition, it necessitates a shift away from fossil fuels and toward clean, renewable energy. This is crucial because it helps prevent deforestation and restore natural habitats until carbon emissions are reduced to zero. As a result, reducing the impact of climate change involves engaging in activities that prevent climate change from happening.The sustainability component of reducing the impact of climate change is
important because it assists in alleviating the effects of climate change on the planet. Climate change is a significant issue because it has the potential to cause dangerous transitions in climate and weather (Ahmed et al., 2019). For example, many areas have seen changes in rainfall, resulting in an increase in floods, droughts, and intense rain and an increase in the frequency and severity of heatwaves. Based on this, this component provides important strategies to help lower the adverse effects of climate change. In addition, it offers different ways of reducing climate change at an individual, family, community, organization, country, and world level. For example, an individual is advised to monitor their carbon footprint.Reducing the impacts of climate change like other components of sustainability intends to achieve sustainability. The main purpose is to make the planet a better place for everyone, including future generations. As people reduce the impacts of climate change, they create a conducive environment for all. For example, lowering our carbon footprint minimizes the amount of pollutants in the environment. The component also relates with others, like creating affordable and clean energy. For example, when people shift from fossil fuel vehicles to electric ones, they reduce harmful emissions to the environment. In addition, creating sustainable cities, which is about investment in public transport, creating green public spaces have a common goal of making the world a better place.This concept is directly applicable to my life and my vision of becoming an environmentalist. I understand that everyone on Earth is vulnerable to the effects
of climate change. Despite the impact of climate change, people are slow at adopting the recommended climate change mitigations. We can begin to make changes by looking at ourselves and seeing what we can do to change, such as not littering and attempting to reduce our use of pollutants. We can also begin to encourage others to do the same in order to keep the environment healthy. These actions are all part of the great turning point, as we encourage others to assist in protecting our citizens and the future of our planet. Therefore, reducing the effects of climate change relates to my long-life goal of becoming an environmentalist.During childhood, I developed a desire to participate in the protection of the environment after a news report. One day, while watching the news together as a family, there was horrifying news of heatwaves in Europe. It claimed the life of thousands of people in Europe. This was the time I directly linked climate change to the death of people. From that moment, I developed a desire to learn more and talk about climate change to reduce deaths and diseases caused by climate change. As a result, the concept of reducing the impact of climate change resonates with my ambition of protecting the environment. In addition, the concept informs me that I can change the way I live and reduce the impacts of climate change. Thus, I reinforced my desire to help protect the environment when I learned more about climate change mitigation strategies.Connections to Active HopeAfter looking
hope that we can find a solution. Macy and Johnstone says, “our dreams and visions for the future are essential for navigating through life because they give us a direction to move in” (155). Based on this, reducing the impact of climate change is part of the solution for healing the world. As part of a society, I can start an initiative to protect the environment by working on ways of reducing the impact of climate change.ConclusionSustainability is an important aspect because it helps protect the environment and make the planet conducive to all. Sustainability is where individuals are able to sustain themselves without harming the environment. The growing impact of factors such as climate change is causing people to reconsider their actions and advocate for sustainability. Based on this, the concept of sustainability that appeals to me is reducing the impact of climate change. The idea is related to my desire to be a climate change advocate. It also relates to my ambition to become an environmentalist. As a result, it is crucial for us to change their mind and be part of a sustainable revolution.
Despite the structural strength or extent of focus in a team, there is still a need for proper managerial support. According to Savu (2019), team success relies on its ability to embrace collaboration, able team leadership, and proper motivation. A study looked into the link between managerial support and work performance and found a close correlation (Wassem et al., 2019). They concluded that managerial support led to a notable increase in employee retention and productivity (Wassem et al., 2019). The paper will focus on a local soccer team and look into managerial communication and team leadership dynamics and their subsequent effects on the players’ success. The managerial support of Mr. Albert resulted in the success of the Eagles United Soccer Club through restructuring the team and focusing on the individual weaknesses and strengths of each player while offering guidance on improvement.Eagles United Soccer Club is a soccer team and its primary purpose is to provide an avenue for nurturing and showcasing soccer talents through developing a competitive sports culture. The team’s ultimate goal is to be the leading and most successful men’s soccer team in Atlanta. The club was established on the 29th of January 2017 and has been operational for the past five years. The team comprises two boards of directors, three staff members (the club manager, the assistant club manager, and the club training manager), and twenty-five soccer players. Sports board members play a vital role in assessing the risk management processes, looking at the financial aspects, and in the appointment of the CEO
and managers (Cheng et al., 2021).In the Eagles club, the board members also offered a sense of overall direction and strategy. The team manager and assistant team manager provide the appropriate leadership, training, and motivation needed for the team’s success. The team also had a trainer and nutritionist whose jobs were to guide the players in improving their physical strength and agility. Musculoskeletal injuries and wounds are quite common among soccer players and result in a massive waste of time (Rollo et al., 2020). Therefore, the trainer and the nutritionist also helped players through injury rehabilitation and recovery.During the first year, Mr. Jones, one of the two Directors, was the team manager. Mr. Jones assumed the role automatically to fill the void as an interim manager as the board looked for a permanent replacement. Interim management is a strategy often used for a temporary duration as the leadership deals with a technical, economical, or managerial difficulty (Kisi, 2020). Also, interim management is a highly flexible, radical, and adaptive leadership style (Kisi, 2020). Mr. Jones was charismatic, highly focused, result-oriented, conscientious, and assertive. His able leadership and effective communication laid an excellent foundation for the team. At the beginning of the second year, Mr. Albert was hired as the new club manager, with six-month probation. Later on, he was promoted to the position of permanent club manager following his success in the job. He highly valued autonomy and feedback in his communication style.The first and foremost task of the team at the arrival of Mr. Albert as
IntroductionAn innovative home system is one of the unique modern technologies implemented by many intelligent systems: Ecobee Smart Thermostat – an intelligent design with software to control energy consumption. The device is medium-sized and consists of two parts: the thermostat with a glass display, a quad-core processor, and SmartSensor that picks up environmental signals. The thermostat has digital data transmission to the user and is compatible with the small detail and the user’s device. SmartSensor consists of air sensors (temperature, humidity, proximity, and occupancy) and a controlled voice assistant; it is automatically controlled by the thermostat and has built-in microphones, speakers, and speech recognition. Ecobee Smart Thermostat maintains a comfortable temperature and humidity in the home. The system allows you to reduce energy costs and regulate an environmental load of your home. The report describes the construction of the thermostat parts, their relationship to each other, and their control.A Detailed Description of the ObjectThermostatThe thermostat is the central part of a rather large-sized device that controls an intelligent system with sensors. This part can convert the signal received from the sensor using a powerful processor and record the data on a memory card. The next-generation Cortex A35 processor allows for high performance with less energy to run its costs. One can see the scheme of a processor in figure 1.Figure 1: Scheme of Cortex A35 processorDue to the economical operation of the processor, the thermostat runs offline for long periods. The robust process ensures interfacing with other home components such as electric light sources, heat pumps,
humidifiers, fans and dryers, and users’ mobile devices. The small RAM , which stores the currently running machine code, is enough to serve the device at high speed. The built-in memory is only 4 gigabytes, but this amount is enough to store the comfort settings set by the user. The thermostat uses communication channels to connect to Wi-Fi or Bluetooth 5.0. The allowable settings are Wi-Fi up to 5 GHz, the possibility of IP addressing, and the identifier of the device in the network is extended to static or dynamic (DHCP).Thermostat ConnectionThe thermostat consists of an enclosure with elements for communication with the house’s internal systems and a glass display, which provides digitalization of the data. The case size is 6.2 inches by 6.2 inches, and the display size is 4.29 inches by 4.29 inches – a compact enough unit that can be easily placed anywhere. There is a hole in the enclosure through which to run the cables for those elements of the house that need to be controlled: electricity, fans, and cleaning systems. Figure 2 shows the in-build elements below the thermostat display.Figure 2: Thermostat’s Elements under the DisplayThe available wire terminals are Rh, C, Y1 and Y2, PEK, O/B, and others. The AC connection is within 24 V via the C and Kc terminals, providing up to 3.5 VA of power. After connecting all the wires, the device must be started by allowing the internal settings to control the connected systems. The LCD display shows the corresponding characteristics : date, time, location, humidity,
Keeping track of student transcripts can be a heavy bureaucratic job that needs to be done away with as technology advances. Among these technologies are database management systems that allow creating an ordered library of student transcripts, as well as the students themselves, faculties, departments, and other essential entities within the university. The unique enumeration of students can help avoid confusion when having the same first or last name and implement transitions to other courses, keeping the student’s primary key identified. What is no less important is the ability to search and obtain quantitative knowledge control statistics for given keys of both courses, faculties, groups, and students individually, just like their work. Now requests will be available to all involved employees who may need this information: they will no longer have to submit relevant applications to the archive wait for a physical search.It is worth noting the security issues of this project, which consist of a possible data leak. This database should include only those data that are already in the public domain: no more than the name and surname of each student. Attackers can use any additional personal information in data leakage. While this database can be a handy tool for storing all student information, this should not be done for security reasons. This project is aimed primarily at more convenient accounting of student work, which is also protected by copyright and should not be available within the project. The papers themselves should be stored in other secure places of the university by the identification numbers used in the database for easy and quick retrieval. An explicit restriction of information in the project’s entities will provide a smaller amount of work and an adequate statement of the problem.
SummaryThe human brain is the most complex organ and system in existence, which has a highly limited regenerative characteristic making aging a major factor in its deterioration. The proposed research aims to assess how neural stem cells replace and differentiate into neurons and other cells of the brain to use them for therapeutic purposes. Working thesis: neural stem cells must be used as a therapeutic measure to slow or halt the aging process due to their rejuvenation and differentiation capabilities.Galiakberova, A. A., & Dashinimaev, E. B. (2020). Neural stem cells and methods for their generation from induced pluripotent stem cells in vitro . Frontiers in Cell and Developmental Biology, 8 , 1-20.The study explores how neural stem cells differentiate into different forms of mature neural cells, including neurons themselves. Pluripotent stem cells, or PSCs, are the best candidates for in vitro generation and cultivation of neural stem cells. There is a wide range of phenotypes when it comes to the differentiation process, which is why a strict condition setting is critical. The source will be useful for exploring and discussing how neural stem cells can be used in practice since the study focuses on in vitro mechanisms.Lazutkin, A., Podgorny, O., & Enikolopov, G. (2019). Modes of division and differentiation of neural stem cells. Behavioral Brain Research, 374 , 1-9.The research analyzes the process of hippocampal neurogenesis, where the emphasis is put on the neural stem cell lifecycle. The proposed neural stem cell maintenance, division, and differentiation models can occur in symmetric and asymmetric ways. Astrocytes play
Suicide is one of the serious problems of modern society, the relevance of which is typical for countries with very different socio-economic conditions, cultural, and religious traditions. One of the most suicidally dangerous ages is adolescence (Button and Marsh 13). When sexual and role identification is formed, unrequited love, conflicts with friends and parents, and school problems are acutely experienced. The prevention of suicidal behavior is one of modern society’s most critical and complex problems. Combinations of micro-social reasons and individual psychological features of the person, causing suicidal forms of reaction to psychologically difficult circumstances, assume individualization of work, especially with students at risk.When carrying out a conversation with the teenager thinking about suicide, teachers are recommended to take the following steps. First, it is necessary to listen attentively to the interlocutor, as teenagers often suffer from loneliness and the impossibility of pouring out the soul. Secondly, it is essential to formulate questions correctly, calmly, and lucidly to ask about the essence of the disturbing situation and about what help is needed. Thirdly, it is unnecessary to argue and not insist that his misfortune is insignificant, that he lives better than others. Teachers should not use statements that make the child feel unnecessary (Coleman 56). Besides, it is necessary to try to give the teenager hope. It should be realistic and aimed at strengthening his forces and abilities. If suicidal tendencies of a schoolboy are noticed, the following tips will help to change the situation.The first step is to listen carefully to the teenager who has
Tesla had entered the automobile market forcefully and, with energetic leadership, smart marketing, and high-quality products, carved a considerable share for itself. It inevitably puts the company at odds with other auto dealers, including the giants like Volkswagen and Toyota, who use a different retail model. While the competition and increased supply impact the range of choices that people have positively, monopolization still remains a possibility, driven by the same sinful nature that was already recognized in biblical times.Overall, Tesla’s entry into the automobile market impacted the situation for the better insofar as the ordinary customer is concerned. On the one hand, it added another car manufacturer to the list of those to choose from and, therefore, increased the range of options available to the customers. Apart from that, its emphasis on direct sales, as opposed to franchising, creates a different buying experience, which also facilitates choice.In terms of natural market forces, increased supply represented by Tesla’s entry into the market is also a positive factor. The dynamics of the economy ensure that, with an increased supply and roughly stable demand, the price equilibrium point will gradually move down, thus, making the goods more accessible. In this respect, increased competition also impacts the range of choices for the better, albeit indirectly, as lower prices ensure there can be more options for the same spending level.That being said, the drive toward monopolization, with all its detrimental effects for the consumer, still remains. The simplest biblical explanation for this drive is, of course, the sin of greed that
reliable based on two kinds of information. First, a test is called reliable if it is interference-resistant. When the test is administered under different conditions, it gives similar results. Second, a test is reliable if it is internally consistent (homogeneous). That is, there are no inconsistencies within the procedure itself, and the methodology for analyzing the results is chosen correctly. Test reliability is also closely related to random error.Like any human activity, testing contains errors. The following types of errors occur in testing: lapses, systematic, and random errors. Random errors occur when successive measurements of a constant characteristic yield different numerical values. When determining random errors, it is assumed that the measured characteristic does not change in time, and all deviations are caused by measurement inaccuracy. The boundary between random and systematic errors is conditional. The total error of any test consists of errors of these two types but in different ratios. The relative weight of each type of error depends on the test’s quality and the examination conditions.Test results always contain errors, no matter how carefully administered the test is. However, using methods of mathematical statistics, it is possible to estimate the magnitude of the total test error and use it to assess test reliability. Without a statistical evaluation of test reliability, measurement results cannot be considered reliable. Therefore, test reliability is a characteristic of the extent to which differences between test-takers reflect differences in test-takers’ properties and the extent to which they are a reflection of random errors.
Amendment does not have such a powerful impact on the everyday life of American citizens, it’s phrasing implicitly affects the limitation of human freedom. The Amendment states that involuntary servitude is abolished except for the cases of criminal punishment, and the lack of further explanation of this phrase currently leads to high imprisonment rates among racial minorities in the U.S.The 15th Amendment to the U.S. Constitution guarantees the right to vote to every American citizen regardless of racial affiliation (U.S. Const. amend. 15, § 1). Ratified back in 1870, this Amendment initiated a nationwide shift toward equality and the abolition of constitutional racism. Currently, nearly 15% of the U.S. population are Black, and securing their right to vote brings changes to the everyday life of all American residents, as 15% out of 300 million Americans is the number of votes capable of changing the political discourse of a country completely. Moreover, the 15th Amendment has served as a springboard for the elimination of racism not only on the constitutional level but on the level of individual relations.
The Allegory of the Cave by Plato is a work about how people perceive life and reality. Many people in today’s environment have a distorted perception of reality. Plato’s work is important and vital because it underlines the significance of reconfiguring oneself in order to discover the truth. Using extensive metaphors, powerful connotative language, and an elegant questioning tone, he furthers this purpose. Through distinctive rhetoric, Plato highlights his unique perspective on reality.First of all, Plato created the people in the cave captives in order to rhetorically appeal to the audience’s emotions and arouse the sensations that already exist in them, which, of course, already produces an intimidating image in the reader’s mind. Furthermore, the inmates symbolize all of the people who are confined, allowing viewers to realize that they may interact with the inmates and make them unhappy at the fact that they are genuinely stuck. Plato’s shackles elicit feelings of rage and despair in the reader by conjuring up vivid and terrible pictures in the reader’s imagination. He uses extensive rhetoric to visualize the scenes of the prisoners inside the cave, mainly the metaphors.Plato skillfully conveys rhetorical devices to support his point of view that individuals are frequently so oblivious to the knowledge that is freely offered to them that they lose out on the opportunity to acquire a new degree of understanding about reality. The Allegory of the Cave employs a number of metaphors to emphasize its point, as well as symbols to connect one notion to another. A cave with inmates confined
individual who cannot be corrupted. “Only those who are wealthy, not in currency and gold, but in virtue and wisdom, shall rule over the state…” – that is the main implication of Plato’s leadership thought (Plato). Overall, at the end humanity should come to realization of the importance of thinking, reasoning and pushing the knowledge beyond its physical meanings.Plato’s The Allegory of the Cave successfully conveys the concept that individuals are caught relying on their senses to establish impressions of the reality. Still, genuine knowledge and truth come from thinking beyond what the physical world delivers. One can discover what exists outside of the material world by using philosophical reasoning. Plato employed a variety of rhetorical strategies to elicit attention from his audience in order to make his arguments.
Plato is an ancient Greek thinker whose beliefs significantly affected the development of modern philosophy as a science. The myth of Plato’s cave is a well-known allegory that is considered one of the critical concepts of objective idealism. The metaphor of prisoners chained in the dark is a myth’s core applied to explain the hardship of attaining and maintaining a just and intellectual spirit. Plato’s Allegory of the Cave is a timeless characterization of the distinction between appearances and reality, prompting humanity to step out of the ignorance into the glow of sunlight.The Divided Line is another concept that separates the world into perceived and cognized. It can be considered a theoretical basis for the Allegory of the Cave , representing humankind’s experience in exploring the visible and comprehensible globe. The correspondence of the four phases of The Cave can be related to the four types of knowledge in The Divided Lines (Bonazzi, 2020). The visual world of the cave resembles the assumption about the mirror images, while the natural objects whose images cast shadows symbolize mathematical reasoning. The cognitive method of conceptual thinking is attributed to the parable of lines, and the perception of the sky corresponds in this scheme to the mind’s cognition.Allegory of the Cav e can be divided into several levels of awareness, each characterized by distinctive features. The first stage is the cave captives, accustomed to believing in shadows and illusions. Only a few manage to reach the second stage, liberation, attained through questioning, research, and study. Acceptance can be considered
the third and most challenging level because it involves abandoning previous beliefs. Plato assumed that the past determines the experience of the present, which is a reason for a suggestion that radical change in the way one understands things must necessarily lead to discomfort (Bonazzi, 2020). Finally, the return involves the culmination of learning between diverse realities. This level consists of disseminating new ideas that may cause confusion, contempt, or hatred for having the indiscretion to question the fundamental dogmas that structure society.The significance of Plato’s ideas has remained intact even after thousands of years. New interpretations and studies have emerged, but his allegories have not renounced their relevance among others. Their prominence is also evident in the twenty-first century when the issue of people’s attachment to social networks is especially acute. People spend a considerable amount of time on media and, realizing their attachment, cannot find the strength to stop. Once on a social network, people are immersed in virtual life, and the concern is that all of this fascinating, vibrant life has nothing in common with reality (Bonazzi, 2020). Therefore, social networks are a cave in which people are imprisoned, and all the photos, videos, posts are shadows reflecting on the walls of this cave.Creating an ideal image on the Internet is much more effortless, and that is why people try to escape from all the troubles and burdens to another globe. The concern is that this happiness is constructed on illusions and fantasies, which Plato urges to abandon. His allegory promotes an understanding
uncertain and constantly changing. The imprisoned ordinary people live in a world of speculation and illusion. At the same time, the former prisoners who are allowed to wander in the cave hold the most accurate view of reality possible in the shifting world of perception and experience (Bonazzi, 2020). Not everyone is willing to step out of the cave and strive for objective reality, as conformity to attitudes often seems the easier path to existence. The essence of this concept is what Plato tried to refute in his allegory, claiming that the world outside the cave is actual existence, filled with unchanging and ideal objects of cognition.The query of the limits of cognition and the relativity of mental abilities, once posed by Plato with The Allegory of the Cave , permeates all of modern society. It is the first time in history that the distinction between reality and its ideas has been profoundly and figuratively articulated. Plato strives to educate that the fundamental nature of things is complex, and not everyone can cross the boundary between the visible and the real. However, by taking this step, it is feasible to understand the world of ideas, break away from the illusory nature of everyday perception of reality, and cognize the essence.
Performance is not just the production of musical sounds, but the interaction of the musician and the audience through all channels, including visual ones. It is not for nothing that at the concert the musician is on a dais in front of everyone. At the concert, not only the musician’s ability to produce musical sounds is tested, but also the musicians’ ability to carry out complex action between them and the audience.The way musicians dress for a concert speaks volumes about their attitude towards the audience. Listeners express respect for the musician by keeping their attention and silence while the music is playing, and after that, they applaud or thank them with words. Musicians express respect for the listener by diligently and faithfully performing music and create a sense of the exclusivity of the event at the concert with their appearance and stage style.The musician’s wardrobe also influences the perception of performance, and it is important for performers not only of popular music, but also of classical music. Although, according to Epstein, instrumental music is an art form that is completely dedicated to what hear, the appearance of the musician is extremely significant. Thus, those who play in a symphony orchestra always observe a strict dress code. Appearance for performance is an important detail that requires special attention and approach. An artist’s concert attire should not only be elegant and appropriate for the performance situation, but it should also be comfortable that nothing distracts from the performance. However, among classical music performers, there are also lovers of informal appearance, for example, violinist Vanessa Mae and cellist Nigel Kennedy. Different listeners perceive the original appearance of a musician differently: some see it as nothing more than a commercial trick, others see it as a desire for innovation.
the discussion and analysis section. For instance, in the article mentioned above, the graph has summarized individuals virtually conducted most of the weddings in 2020 with few guests due to government restrictions on COVID-19 as other weddings were postponed.Contextually, graphs give a clear visual impression of the key aspects discussed, making the data understood by the reader or researcher. In 2021 the COVID-19 restrictions like social distancing were relaxed, and there was an improvement to 1.9 million weddings from the previous year. The decline in several weddings has worried countries’ fertility rates, as per the article (Osisanwo, 2021). Graphs are used to communicate information and entertain the article reader. Comparing the values of weddings in the nation for several years helps the reader predict the future wedding trend from the previous data. The reader gets a clear picture of the article presented. Besides, it covers large data on a smaller page.Simple, standard, and scalable are the critical items that make the chart valuable in the content of an article. Simply refers to how easy the variable can be interpreted. The title should be simple and to the point (Osisanwo, 2021). The data should be standardized and not complex for easy understanding. It also creates consistency across article organizations. In addition, scalable is another critical item that refers to a project’s ability to visualize the growing amount of data obtained. Individuals should use the right charts if the visual scalability is increased. Conclusively, charts are given the reader easy work in data comparison and analysis,
bankrupt or reducing the number of employees to survive the economic crisis. The Economist elaborates on the statistics of the unemployment rate and shares the amount of time it can take for the labor market to recover to its prior-pandemic state (para. 1-3). This issue is complex, so McConnell et al. cover the primary aspects that contribute to it in chapters 12, 15, and 18. The 12th chapter reveals the governmental response to the labor market and how it is regulated during a crisis or similar circumstances (McConnell et al.).The 15th part indicates the detail of job hunting, which is relevant to the topic, considering that people failed to land a job because of the severe economic situation (McConnell et al.). Finally, the last chapter includes the analysis of employment and unemployment and how they affect the labor market on the whole.The economist, Gary Becker, earned the Nobel Prize for outstanding contributions to the field of economy, applying the theories for human behavior to connect the notion to sociology, criminology, and even demography. He researched the incentives for actors’ behavior, aiming at grander wealth, recognition, and fame, to analyze how this psychological phenomenon pertains to investments and crime (The Nobel Prize, para. 2). The most significant part of Becker’s contribution is his investigation of the relation of the aforementioned concept to discrimination in the labor market in relation to people of other professions.
It is important to note that the bag market is a large one, where customers are highly segmented, and products significantly vary in both quality and purpose. Therefore, readjusting the bag price is essential in order to ensure that profits are maximized on the basis of collected data. The previously selected price was $250, which was based on high-end tote bag analysis findings of $65-$250. The product’s size is 9×11 made from leather, and it has a cost per unit equal to $36. The initial price choice was motivated by profit maximization, but it is evident that it did not account for price’s influence on supply-demand. Therefore, the newly selected price is $65, which is still almost twice as high as the cost per unit, and the expected profit from each bag is equal to $29.55% prefer to buy online, and tote bags are the fastest-growing handbag styles. Many low-end bags have prices below $65, but the selected product is made from leather and can be categorized as a mid-range, and thus, it cannot be lower than $65. The target audience is middle-class and higher-class mothers, but it should be noted that the brand is still unknown and requires proper marketing to build brand image. Thus, it is unjustified to select a high price range and risk lowering the demand, and it cannot compete with high-end bags and is not recognized as such.
and play a significant role in shaping the perception of the world around them. In particular, there are archetypes of people that help determine their character and actions, as well as motivation.Applying this concept to everyday life, one can single out special types of people who have a set of common and exclusive characteristics for them. They are formed both on the basis of the actions and inclinations of the person and depending on the environment. An example of an archetype in everyday life is the head of a large modern corporation, such as Elon Musk. He can be defined as a hero or creator who has the inspiration and courage to change the world around him. Other people perceive it in this way, which makes it a great example of an archetype. All his actions are motivated precisely by these characteristics, and his primary motivation is the transformation of the world.The presence of archetypes in everyday life allows me to compose a more comprehensive perception of people and events. In particular, based on the characteristics I know, I can determine the motivation and role of a certain person, which makes him more predictable. This is certainly more difficult than may be presented in the literature because people often have mixed features. However, in general, the concept of archetypes gives me the opportunity to understand the actions of people and their characters. I can later use this information to form my own relationship with them.
Bandung Conference was the first encounter between Asian and African countries that had gained independence from the western colonies. President of Indonesia Suharto invited the leaders from developing countries to Bandung, leading to a declaration on anti-imperialism and peaceful coexistence. It was hoped to unite emerging nations through collaboration in reducing their reliance on Europe and America.The conference aimed to promote Afro-Asian economic cultural cooperation and reject neocolonialism. The fundamental principles of the meeting were to respect territorial integrity and sovereignty, refrain from the use of power, have peaceful ways of settling disputes, and non-interference among the states. This nonaligned movement was founded to keep members from taking a side in Cold War politics, creating a solid rebellion. The outcome of the Bandung conference was that most of the Southeast Asian nations joined the agreement leading to the end of the Cold War. In addition, the Afro-Asian countries gained the opportunity to have a voice in world affairs, such as the representation of the Global South. The freedom to join the USA and the USSR Camp by the developing countries was achieved through the Bandung Conference (Lewis and Stolte, 2019). Although the movement aimed at discouraging members from participating in the War politics of the superpowers, most of the South and Southeast Asian countries were dragged into the Cold WarIn conclusion, the Afro-Asian conference, which represented twenty-nine nations from Africa, Asia, and the Middle East, condemned colonialism, racism, and the growing Cold War between the Soviet Union and the United States. The agreement was key towards protecting more nations from supporting the war. The core aim was political self-determination and mutual respect for sovereignty. This gave developing nations power in future politics outside the Cold War.
“Bang Bang Baby” can be labeled a science fiction musical as it incorporates elements of both genres in an exciting plot. After watching the trailer first, I was surprised by the energetic nature of the music and the characters in the film. The main protagonist of the movie is a young lady named Stephy. She dreams about becoming a famous singer; however, her alcoholic father disapproves of her dreams. The story’s setting takes place in 1963 in a small Canadian town, and additionally, the movie is stylistically reminiscent of the 1950-1960s era in American pop music (Perone 34). The dresses, hairstyles, costumes, and decorations all point out the teddy-boy trend that was common in the 1950s.However, after watching a film, it turned out to be a bitter and depressing experience as themes described in the movie are much more profound than they seem from a preview. First of all, the director managed to achieve the surrealistic and magical atmosphere by questioning the reality of the events through the scenes where Stephy wakes up from her dream. Sleep is used as one of the main transitional tools in the movie’s script as Stephy is sexually harassed when she falls asleep. Then she wakes up with Bobby Shore in her house, and the next time she wakes up in her bed, her whole life is different, and she is pregnant with a strange baby and sleeps with a man who raped her. Therefore, I think the film is about the maturity of Stephy and her sad story of letting go of her dreams of becoming a singer to the cruel external circumstances.Besides that, the film is filled with charismatic dialogues and jokes, mainly coming from the famous singer Bobby Shore. He is a stylish young man who looks like Billie Joe Armstrong and Elvis Presley. He is quick-witted and slick, but somehow he feels shallow as his intentions are vague. However, one of my favorite jokes in the film comes from this character when he says, “Yeah, people love casinos. They are great for gambling addicts.” It is dark and cynical, but it dramatically represents the type of man Bobby Holiday is.The music in the film plays a vital role as in every crucial point of the movie, the song starts. One of the most heartbreaking ones for me was when Stephy sings at the gas station when she finds out that all of her dreams are ruined and that she lives a life with a man she hates. Another remarkable thing is the purple fumes from the chemical plant near the city. Once they appear, everything in town and the life of Stephy becomes magical, and when the fumes clear, then everything comes back to the sad norm. The mutations of the city dwellers are grotesque, which represents a dream-like feeling of the movie. The camerawork in the film is also remarkable as it often uses the compositing techniques from movies of the 1940-1950s era.
The Crimean War of 1853-56 was the first major military conflict in Europe since the Napoleonic Wars and, as such, often attracted historians’ attention. Fought between Russia and a coalition of European powers together with the Ottoman Empire, the conflict demonstrated considerable advances in technology, communication, and the art of war. As the name suggests, an important part of the conflict was the campaign fought in the Crimean peninsula between the defending Russians and the expeditionary force of British, French, Ottoman, and later Sardinian troops. The most famous events of the war, such as the Charge of the Light Brigade, were associated with the siege of the Russian naval base in Sevastopol. However, this siege would have been impossible if not for the allied victory in the first major battle of the Crimean campaign. The battle of Alma, fought on 20 September 1854, opened the road to Sevastopol and proved the superiority of the allied arms and the French tactics over the cumbersome Russian military.Before delving into the battle itself, it is necessary to briefly cover its context. In 1852-1853 a seemingly trite dispute between the Orthodox and Catholic clergy in Palestine escalated into a diplomatic conflict between Russia and France (Tate 15). Alarmed by the Russian propositions to partition the Ottoman Empire, Britain began drifting closer to the French side. After the Ottoman Empire refused the ultimatum that would give Russia the right to intervene in its internal affairs on Christians’ behalf, war broke out in October 1853. Russia engaged the Ottomans on the Danube
and in the Caucasus, but with no decisive result, and was soon forced to abandon the latter theater due to Austrian intervention. Unwilling to see Russia upsetting the balance in both Europe and the Middle East, Britain and France began mobilizing and declared war on Russia in March 1854 (Tate 18). A combined French-British force arrived in Bulgaria and then, reinforced by some Ottoman troops, launched an expedition against Sevastopol, a major Russian naval base. After disembarking in Crimea on September 4, they marched toward their goal and soon encountered the Russian army waiting for them.The Russian force, up to 40,000 string and led by Prince Menshikov, an experienced veteran of the Napoleonic Wars, occupied a good defensive position between the allies and Sevastopol. The river Alma was not particularly deep but still constituted an obstacle, and its steep left bank, which was occupied by the Russians, made it even stronger (Baumgart 128). However, the Russian commander believed that the river slopes on his left flank were nigh impassable and only left a token force at this point (Baumgart 128). The allied force, up to 61,000, would have to cross the shallow river under the Russian fire and then scale the steep hills beyond. However, the French general Saint-Arnaud, who also held overall command of the allied army, noted what he saw as Menshikov’s fatal mistake. A veteran of the colonial war in Algiers, he considered the hills on the left Russian flank perfectly accessible for his hardened troops and decided to turn the Russian flank
there (Baumgart 128). As for the British commander Lord Raglan, he was charged with attacking and tying up the Russian right flank while the French did their part.Tactically speaking, each of the three armies represented a fairly different picture. The French, especially the light infantry called Zuaves, utilized their Algerian experience and fought in loose skirmish lines to maximize the effect of their rifles while lowering their own casualties (Baumgart 129). The British, still clinging to the tactics of Wellington’s times, marched forward in lines, which could deliver devastating volleys against dense formations but were also quite vulnerable to the enemy fire (Gowing). As for the Russians, they also used the tactics that served them well in the Napoleonic Wars and mostly fought and maneuvered in battalion columns (Baumgart 68). While fearsome in bayonet charges, these columns provided an easy target for the enemy fire. The majority of the allied infantry were all armed with modern rifles with an effective range of 500-600 meters, while outdated Russian smoothbores could not fire accurately beyond 250 meters (Baumgart 68). Artillery pieces were roughly comparable in all armies and fired solid shot on the distance of up to 3-4 kilometers and canister up to 600 meters, although the accuracy decreased dramatically with range.The battle began in the morning of September 20, with the four divisions of the French army advancing against the Russian left flank and center. As mentioned above, the Russians thought their left to be inaccessible and overlooked it, leaving only a single battalion there (Baumgart 128).
The French light infantry proved this estimation wrong, climbing the steep slopes by entire battalions and even dragging field guns up (Baumgart 129). Although Menshikov understood the threat and dispatched his reserves to the left, it was too late. Although the Russian artillery fired well and inflicted casualties upon the advancing French, its canister – the only effective type of round against infantry – had roughly the same range as the French rifles (Baumgart 129). It allowed the French sharpshooters to kill the gunners quickly, and after that, the cumbersome Russian columns with their outdated smoothbores were easy to engage from the safe range. Thus, utilizing their superior tactics and weaponry, the French decimated the Russian forces that opposed them and progressed forward. This movement turned the Russians’ flank and threatened their center, which was already engaging the other half of the French army.The British, who advanced against the Russian right flank, faced more difficulty than their French counterparts. While the Russian position there was more accessible, the Russians have erected field fortifications protecting their guns from enemy fire. As the British lines advanced, Russian guns inflicted progressively heavier casualties upon them. The fire was so intense that a British soldier who fought in the battle referred to it as a “hurricane of shot and shell” (Gowing). Despite considerable casualties, the first British line managed to assault the Russian positions and take the guns. However, the Russian infantry counterattacked almost immediately and drove them away from the artillery positions with a fierce bayonet charge. According to
siege of which would last for almost a year and constitute the most important part of the Crimean War.As one can see, the battle of the Alma River was an important engagement that demonstrated the superiority of the French and, to a much lesser degree, British forces. Antiquated tactics and outdated smoothbore muskets of the Russian army proved no match to the French assault. The British tactics were just as cumbersome as the Russian, but the redcoats benefited from having rifles with greater effective range. The decisive factor in winning the battle was Saint-Arnaud’s tactical skills that allowed him to correctly identify the weak point of Russian defenses and turn the left Russian flank. The battle of the Alma was not only a tactical but also a strategic and psychological success, as it opened the way to Sevastopol and instilled the allied troops with a sense of superiority.
IntroductionThe Battle of Ia Drang was the first large military engagement in the Vietnam War between the forces of the United States Army and the People’s Army of Vietnam (PAVN). Conducted as part of the Pleiku Campaign, the Battle of Ia Drang occurred in the Ia Drang valley in two stages on November 14-19, 1965 (Galloway, 2010). The battle, known for its first large-scale helicopter assault and consistent air support, established the model of further military engagements by American forces and their tactics in the Vietnam War. The purpose of this paper is to analyze the historical event of the Battle of Ia Drang from the perspective of the operational art and design concept, Joint Planning, and other appropriate joint doctrinal publications.Historical DataOn the morning of November 14, the troops of the 1st Battalion, 7th Cavalry, initiated a heliborne assault into Landing Zone X-Ray with the purpose of preventing an attack on the Plei Me camp discovered by intelligence earlier. Towards the end of the second day, after successfully holding positions, the U.S. ordered the first use of B-52 carpet bombings, striking key positions of PAVN forces. Accurate artillery strikes throughout the battle also served as critical support for the troops, holding back PAVN forces that significantly outnumbered the Americans. On the third day, PAVN continued desperate attacks on the U.S. positions until, eventually, L.Z. X-Ray was secured. The U.S. forces lost 79 soldiers and had 121 wounded, while 634 PAVN soldiers were confirmed dead, with an estimated another 1215 dead from long-distance artillery and airstrikes
(Cash, 2001).As L.Z. X-Ray was secured, and units were dispersed to other locations. Under the command of Lt. Col. Robert McDade, the 2nd Battalion, 7th Cavalry began its path towards LZ Albany approximately 2 miles northeast. McDade’s troops encountered the remains of the PAVN 33rd and 66th regiments, resulting in an ambush that spread the U.S. troops into small groups as the initial group marched in a single-file column. The battle lasted for nearly 16 hours near LZ Albany. Eventually, air support was able to bomb areas of potential PAVN encampments at a safe distance from U.S. troops while reinforcements arrived from other L.Z.s. In the clash at LZ Albany, 155 US troops were killed or missing, with 124 wounded, while 403 PAVN soldiers were confirmed dead (Cash, 2001).Operational Art and DesignCognitive ApproachOperational art is the cognitive approach used by military leadership utilizing their capabilities and judgment to develop strategies and operations to utilize military forces through the integration of ends, ways, means, and risks based on available information. Operational design is a methodology planner which provides the structure to support the operation and methods to address the problem (Joint Chiefs of Staff, 2017). American operations in Vietnam began with Operation Rolling Thunder which consisted mostly of air bombardments and support for South Vietnamese forces. There was no clear consensus on the end to be achieved, the means that ground forces were to use, and the eventual cost. Pres. Johnson initially sought to pursue a limited war theory approach and minimize involvement (Rosen, 1982). The American
commander in Vietnam, Gen. William C. Westmoreland, saw America’s commitment to military victory, and the initial troops of two battalions were present to protect U.S. airports.Design MethodologyOperational design in joint doctrine consists of three components understanding the environment, defining the problem, and developing an operational approach. There was a need for large numbers of U.S. troop presence, especially with a division with offensive capabilities in the Central Highlands, which included the Ia Drang Valley. The primary concern of the MACV commander was that the North Vietnamese conventional units amassing in the region were preparing an offensive. This attack would have had the purpose of either destroying the South Vietnamese government, splitting apart their forces along Highway 19, or carving out an autonomous district and establishing a Communist presence in South Vietnam (Schifferle, 1994).The three stages of the American campaign were designed to secure bases and L.Z.s for the deployment of forces, conduct deep patrolling in the vicinity of base areas, and conduct long-range search-and-destroy operations against enemy forces. All of this was meant to occur in four phases (Schifferle, 1994). Westmoreland understood the situation well that U.S. forces faced not only the threat from PAVN conventional forces but also massive guerilla warfare from the Vietcong, as well as insurgency among many rural populations, including that in South Vietnam. Operation Rolling Thunder also created the strategic requirement to guard and logistically sustain the bombing campaign. Westmoreland and other commanders believed in pursuing the ‘big-unit strategy’ with the aim of achieving the destruction of NVA main force units
in Central Highlands, despite the high costs of casualties and funding it brought (Schifferle, 1994).Finally, the operational environment (O.E.) is a key consideration for operational design. As highlighted in Joint Public 3.0, an O.E. is the combination of conditions, circumstances, and influences that impact the employment of military capabilities and the decision-making of command. This includes the physical space (land, water, air), information environment, and other factors such as social, political, infrastructure, political, and economic (Incorporating Change 1, 2018). The operational environment was hostile and challenging, with little information available; thus, the informational space was lacking. The U.S. troops had a basic understanding of the local geography but had little knowledge of the presence of PAVN forces until those chose to reveal themselves. The physical environment on land was in favor of the adversary, given the U.S. had not previously fought in jungle terrains, and most of the military preparations stemmed from the urban and open space warfare of WWII. However, the U.S. had the advantage of uncontested air space, which it could use to its advantage for surveillance, aerial bombardment, and heliborne assaults.Operational EndsEnd StatesEnd states are the set of required conditions that must be met to achieve the strategic objective. Some of the end states for the engagement were a full defeat and pushback of PAVN forces in the Ia Drang Valley to prevent any further potential or planned assaults on U.S. camps and airports. Another end state was to conduct a successful heliborne assault of ground troops deep into enemy-controlled territory with the
support of airborne strikes and artillery fire, being the first time the strategy was implemented into practice in this manner in Vietnam. Finally, the battle was meant to be the first primary engagement of U.S. troops with the NVA forces, marking a major escalation in the Vietnam War given that previously the U.S. engaged solely through bombardments or South Vietnam proxy forces (Warren, 2017).ObjectivesObjectives are objects that, by nature, location, purpose, and use, provide an effective contribution to military action. The objectives for the forces participating in the Ia Drang assault included securing key points such as landing zones in the area. The secondary mission was to locate and eliminate enemy forces, clearing the area for the potential further progression of U.S. forces and setting up camps for later assaults (Galloway, 2020).Operational MeansOperational ReachOperational reach is the distance and duration that a force can competently employ military capabilities. The U.S. forces were based in the Plei Me Camp, southwest of Pleiku. Gen. Westmoreland had secured the commitment of 300,000 troops; the build-up forces occurred in the summer of 1965. The U.S. forces were generally well-supplied as well as supported by South Vietnam battalions. U.S. aerial forces had an extensive range of several thousand kilometers at which they could conduct flights and bombardments. At Ia Drang, forces could be deployed either by foot or heliborne assault. However, they had to be located within a relatively short distance of the base camp to ensure the availability of reinforcements, supply chains, and otherwise effectiveness. It was an approximately 34-mile
round trip between L.Z. X-ray and Plei Me (Schifferle, 1994). As evident by the battle, the U.S. forces could hold out against PAVN even as a small force for nearly a day and longer once reinforcements arrived.CulminationCulmination refers to the point at which a military force is unable to perform its operations. It is difficult to gauge accurately what the culmination point would be in the Ia Drang offensive. However, the battle occurred near the Cambodian border with Vietnam, and regiments of NVA forces took sanctuary in the nearby country. L.Z. X-Ray was located within 10-15 miles of the border, with the assault going in that direction. It can be safe to assume that the culmination point was the border since supply chains were likely only set up in the radium of the heliborne assault.Operational WaysCenter of Gravity (CoG)The CoG refers to the sources of strength and balance from which the force derives its freedom of action and will to fight, the source of power on which everything depends. Therefore, both one’s own force and the adversary have a center of gravity. For the U.S. forces in Vietnam, the operational center of gravity was its airports and the points dislocation for the aerial forces, critical to the U.S. strategy in the country and vital support for any troops on the ground. These had to be protected in the long term. The CoG of the adversary was, ironically, time. From a military strategy perspective, time is a significant advantage to weaker forces, particularly in defending their own
territory. As a stronger force, the U.S. fighting abroad faced a much higher chance of decisive victory, the shorter the duration of the conflict, both the Ia Drang assault and the war in Vietnam in general. Otherwise, the more prolonged the conflict becomes, the time favors the PAVN as they can wear down U.S. forces little by little by hitting at hurtful points in infrastructure and troop morale (Hughes et al., 2018)Decisive PointsOperational ways focus on the ‘how’ objectives are achieved. The decisive point of an operation is a place, event, factor, or function when acted upon, allows commanders to gain a marked advantage over adversaries. For Gen. Westmoreland, the Ia Dragen assault was the first step to hit at the NVA CoG, which is time. The assault was meant to be rapid and to secure key areas for a deeper assault into enemy territory. In a manner of speaking, the blitzkrieg type of warfare would have benefited U.S. forces while simultaneously achieving all key objectives of pushing back the PAVN, protecting military bases, and establishing positions of control in enemy territory.The RiskRisk is absolutely critical and central to the planning and execution of operations at any level. Joint Risk Analysis defines the concept as the “probability and consequence of an event causing harm to something valued” (United States Army War College, 2020). Using the model of ends, ways, means, and risks examined in this paper, it is necessary that all are balanced, meaning that leaders must weigh options to achieve desired objectives with the likelihood
society.However, the ongoing trends in American society indicate a negative change in the readiness of people to engage in social networks and interact with others for social problem resolution. Within the past decades, the number of clubs, organizational associations, unities, religious networks, and other forms of civic engagement has significantly reduced. One of the reasons for such a deterioration in social capital is the development in people’s mobility and homeownership, which implies moving frequently and the lack of necessity to form strong social bonds. According to Putnam, “mobility, like frequent re-potting of plants, tends to disrupt root systems, and it takes time for an uprooted individual to put down new roots” (72). Therefore, changes in Americans’ lifestyles have led to diminished social capital and network involvement, which might ultimately negatively impact advancing democracy in the USA.
interrogative environment when the investigator was talking to Williams in absence of his lawyer (Brewer v. Williams, 1977). The defendant was mentally challenged and the police statement drew out incriminating statements leading to his induction. The evidence was wrongly collected and revealed at trial because the defendant’s right to counsel was violated.The case was determined at the Supreme Court in a 5-4 decision and majority opinion held that adversary proceedings had started in absence of the defendants’ counsel violating the Sixth Amendments’ rights (Brewer v. Williams, 1977). The Supreme Court also assumed that the officer who raised the “Christian burial” topic was deliberately violated Williams rights. This is because the officer had written a concordance statement not interrogate the suspect on his way to meet with his lawyer. Robert William was exonerated since the evidence used against him was wrongfully admitted in the court.
The case of Bridgestone vs. IBM presents an example that displays the importance of communication in cooperation between businesses. In brief, the American subsidiary of Bridgestone requested IBM to develop an extensive business system that will be capable of processing a large volume of orders. Due to several complications, the system developed by IBM was released behind schedule yet way earlier than the last steps of development, which resulted in millions of financial losses and the deterioration of both companies’ images. Analyzing the details of the case provides an understanding of common complications in significant projects and how improper execution of extensive projects can influence the reputation of collaborating companies.First, in defining what each side could do differently to improve the outcomes, one could notice immediately that both companies had issues hindering their work and left them undiscussed. IBM had trouble working with a project already attempted several times by other vendors, which caused additional obstacles not previously discussed by the management. The obstacles resulted in delays in system release, and due to a lack of understanding in communication, Bridgestone proceeded with the release of the unfinished system. The simplest solution for Bridgestone that could have sufficiently improved the outcomes, in this case, was to postpone the release and give IBM time to finish the system. While delaying the system release could have resulted in additional expenses, the order data could have been saved without any threats to the existing customer base. Moreover, it seems that IBM insisted on running a testing launch of the system.
Car theft constitutes an important problem in the United Kingdom and the countries of North America. The number of stolen motor vehicles has prompted lawmakers to obligate car manufacturers to make mechanical security more sophisticated. Although the theft rate has decreased, perpetrators found new ways to appropriate vehicles. The most prominent strategy is stealing keys, which give offenders access to cars. It is therefore essential to understand what ways of obtaining keys are used by car thieves.The main source of information on methods of key theft are offenders themselves. Incarcerated individuals, who were involved in car theft one way or another, participated in interviews. The respondents differed in race, age, and overall criminal record. The goal of interviews was to ascertain the intent of offenders, employ methods of car theft, and other crime-related details. Although all respondents engaged in a car theft at some point, most of them were arrested for activities unrelated to car theft. It implies that stealing cars is a situational crime in many cases.There are several reasons for perpetration, presented by the offenders. The first is alert opportunism, which means that offenders did not intend to engage in cart theft, yet they recognized an easy opportunity. Such actions are not pre-planned, require minimal effort and have low risk. An important feature of alert opportunism is the responsibility of car owners, who fail to ensure basic security measures. Alert opportunism also does not imply that perpetrators were not planning to commit any crime at all. It is entirely possible that a person with
the intent of burglary found keys and took advantage of them.Another reason, which leads to auto theft, is active search. Unlike alert opportunists, who were not planning on stealing initially, active search presupposes criminal intent in the beginning. It should also be noted that car owners are once again responsible for presenting offenders with a theft opportunity. Active searchers seek open cars with keys left in them. Offenders also use people’s lack of caution to their advantage, by searching in highly populated areas and in places where alcohol drinking is rampant. In some cases, it is easier for offenders to wait until an opportunity arises, once again taking advantage of people’s carelessness. Some active searchers employ a more direct approach, such as infiltrating homes with the express intent of stealing car keys.Both active searchers and alert opportunists avoid meeting car owners. However, there is a different strategy, which presupposes establishing contact with the owner. One way to obtain keys is to threaten owners with weapons. Another method is to use substances, which prevent victims from resisting a carjacking attempt. In both cases, a perpetrator meets a car owner and obtains keys from them with the use of objects that put victims’ lives at risk.There are various reasons for the offenders’ decision to engage in a carjacking. Sometimes, perpetrators are not skilled enough at stealing cars, which propels them to use force to obtain keys. Carjacking may also be the result of alert opportunism when offenders resort to presented carjacking opportunities while committing other crimes. Naturally, some
offenders purposely seek an owner with the desired car, physically confront them and obtain keys by force. Such an approach is an example of an active search for carjackers.However, meeting a car owner does not necessarily presuppose carjacking. Some offenders use manipulation techniques to persuade car owners to allow them in the vicinity of keys. It is important to understand that manipulation requires substantial preparation on the perpetrator’s end. In some cases, manipulators replace real keys with forged ones, which is initially unnoticed by owners. In other situations, offenders use clay to make a mould of keys. However, sometimes, manipulators convince owners into actually giving them keys or leaving the offender alone in a vehicle with keys in it. In all cases, manipulators use conversation techniques to keep a victim distracted and unsuspecting of a potential crime.Keys are essential in starting a car, but obtaining one particular set of keys may not actually be necessary to do. There are keys that fit different models, which are known as master keys. These keys are obtained from official car dealerships under the pretext of accidentally locking a car with keys inside. Master keys are subsequently copied and distributed among other offenders. Another way of creating a set of master keys is by modifying an existing car key. Although using master keys is primarily limited to some cars manufactured in the 1900s, it does substantially facilitate car theft.Historically, the most preferred way of auto theft prevention the is mechanical improvement of security of cars. As vehicles become increasingly sophisticated,
In general, the business case for the Centers for Diabetes appears to be positive since the project is closely aligned with the needs of the community and the targets set by the Affordable Care Act (ACA). However, there are potential risks, as outlined in detail in the SWOT analysis, which has to be considered before the final decision is made. This note will detail the risks for the Centers for Diabetes and propose potential ways of mitigating them.First and foremost, the idea of a community health center that addresses the community health needs is closely aligned with the value-based care and the community focus that are the targets set by ACA. Moreover, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and Healthy People 2030 report cites the need to focus on how health issues are managed from a community perspective and not an individual perspective. Hence, there is a threat of other healthcare facilities that receive reimbursements from Medicare and Medicaid in the county choosing to create a similar initiative. This is because diabetes is a common problem in the United States, affecting 10% of the general population and 14% of the Hispanic and African-American community.The only way to mitigate this risk is to begin marketing and outreach activities as soon as the project is approved and there is funding to support the further stages of operations. In this way, the community will become familiarized with the hospital and the Center, and even if other similar initiatives arise, this Center will already have an established brand image,
IntroductionArt is a phenomenon encompassing the innovative expression of humanistic dimensions on contemporary elements. Over the decades, the evolutionary cycle fostered advancement and adjustments of the practice across different domains. In this case, distinct regions uphold dynamic perspectives concerning artistry despite its distinctive sections. The UAE and more broadly the Arabian Gulf’s art scene has evolved in substantial ways over the past decades. As this part of the world witnessed exponential growth in infrastructure, industrial development, and the influx of talent, so has the landscape of modern and digitized art. This has led to a boom of artists, both locally and internationally, who are challenging the old models of curatorial interpretation and audience engagement and leveraging a robust ecosystem that offers greater support for their work (Amiri, 2021). The contrast between traditional and modern art fosters derivation of imminent challenges towards promoting evolvement in the artistic spectrum. The research problem entails assessing the dynamic matters influencing emerging artists and the promotion of inchoate art scenes.Research QuestionWhat are the challenges facing emerging artists in modern art scenes?Thesis StatementThe contrast between modern and traditional art is one of the significant challenges facing artists in the emerging art scenes due to the optimal evolutionary prompt for innovation and creativity.Literature ReviewThe Evolution of ArtThe Flemish art period between the fifteenth and seventeenth centuries involved significant and dynamic events in the historical mark in the field of artistry. The different events that proficiently attributed to the Flemish concept encompassed Late Gothic, Renaissance, and Baroque. During these eras, pioneers portrayed profound insight
into the evolution of frameworks in the art world. One of the major evolutionary gradients during the Flemish art period engulfed the optimal use of oil for painting. According to the researchers, the initiative steered the in-depth use of realism perspective in the paintings’ shaping, texture, and structuring (Fong & Ng, 2020). In this case, the artists integrated daily livelihoods with artistry to enhance real-life experiences. Primarily, the renaissance, also known as rebirth, fostered the prominent consideration of humanism in the field of art that rendered the integration of modernism and the Greco-Roman cultural frameworks.Renaissance is a major historical event during the Flemish art era between the fifteenth and seventeenth century, posing significant insight regarding artistry. According to the researcher, the Flemish art period set off with the late gothic era encompassing (Al Khayyal et al., 2020). The late gothic era enshrined the emergence of distinct architectural designs, such as ornate, flying buttresses, ribbed vaults, the window glasses stained with different colors (Akhmetshin et al., 2018). The architectural designs render the optimal consideration of the dynamic cultural representation across Europe, mainly in Britain, France, and the Netherlands. The late gothic period formed the foundation for the emergence of the renaissance era mainly as a result of the integration of various early renaissance ideologies for the architectural structures. Apart from the late gothic era, the baroque period involved the utilization of bright colors (Amiri, 2021), miniatures, and stained-glass windows. Essentially, the late gothic and baroque contributed to the introduction of the renaissance period through the evolutionary aspect
in the painting practice.Abstract versus Realism in ArtArt is a vital factor of practice mainly as a result of the prominent integration of visual and real-life experiences. During the early and mid-gothic era, the artists focused on contemporary objects during the drawings. However, the emergence of Flemish art encompassed the alteration of the perspectives, mainly the incorporation of humanism. Humanism is the practice of integrating artistry approaches with the significance of people and the dynamic philosophical constructs (Erie, 2019). An excellent example of a renaissance artist is Michelangelo, an Italian whose famous work is the Sistine Chapel, demonstrating theology’s rebirth. According to Michelangelo, it is crucial to use art as a visual depiction of reality (Li, 2021). Therefore, the expert utilizes the religiosity approach to enhance humanism and realism within the artistic spectrum.Studying renaissance under the spectral view of humanism and realism fosters a profound overview regarding the interdependence between artworld and contemporary issues. Previously, Flemish art regarded the prominent use of abstract images, posing minimalist meaning to artworld mainly because of the lack of relevance to integral real-world endeavours. In this case, one of the elements of the real events during Flemish art encompassed intensifying the significance of artistry to people and the community (Salisbury, 2020). Michelangelo focused on enhancing the visual meaning of Jesus’ feast with his disciples through the painting of entities on the Sistine Chapel wall. The initiative fostered the appreciation of art locally and globally due to the humanistic perspective on ideological practices. Primarily, Michelangelo spearheads the evolutionary scale in theology
based on integrating historical accounts with visual perspectives.Gradients promoting Art’s Aesthetic ValueRenaissance fostered the alteration of the dynamic philosophical constructs in the innovative and creative perspectives. Apart from painting using oil, the artists incorporate distinct values on using various colors to enhance the visualization of the realm. In this case, colorations fostered the abstract meaning of life and the environmental mainframes articulating the individualistic personality. A researcher agrees that a different event that fostered socio-cultural and economic growth and development is capitalism (Salisbury, 2020). The concept enshrines the private ownership of property and wealth accumulation hence the individualistic essence in the international community. The rebirth era prominently influenced the dynamism of interactions among personnel and business competence. While the art world evolved along the gradient of humanism and realism, society exploited the capitalist approach to boost the living quotient among individuals. Fundamentally, the Flemish art intensified the visual and contemporary perspective regarding the interdependent relationship between artistry and business performances.A significant percentage of the global population focused on innovation’s integral aspect, hence the intensification in business competence. In research, the author indicates that the reflection of the individualistic nature among people spanned through the artistic and economic structures. During the renaissance period, societies focused on intensifying economic growth, hence adopting dynamic frameworks and the emergence of social classification perspectives. The researcher further argues that technological advancement is an initiative that attributed to the rebirth of the Greco-Roman era that involved intense business operations and trading activities (Kryzmowski, 2022). The integration of the ideological perspectives regarding enterprise
transactions enhanced the overview and enhancement of people’s attitude on diversity. Creativity and innovation significantly contribute to boosting the living conditions among community members. An excellent example is the utilization of innovation in the architectural industry to render the construction of sustainable structures and settlement areas. Dynamism is an integral feature towards promoting growth index across distinct societies.Art Practices in Different RegionsInnovation and creativity bridge the gap between modernism and traditional appeals across the different facets of human activities. The Flemish art significantly affected the key articulation of individualism despite the profound emergence of mainframes and concepts through various phases, namely late gothic, baroque, and the renaissance to establish realism (Li, 2021). As a multidimensional phenomenon, Flemish art enhances the integration of modernism with the Roman aspects on architectural designs and the Greek’s philosophical overviews, Napoleonic constructs. As a result, the study of the concepts fosters an insight into the evolutionary process among people while advocating for the emergence of modern society. Hong Kong and Singapore are excellent examples of countries that proficiently integrate traditional and contemporary art.Asian countries prominently use traditional medicine to treat different diseases in the modern era. The approach renders the profound impact of conventional art despite the evolutionary process. Xin et al. (2020) postulate that a significant percentage of Chinese mainly prefer conventional practices as remedies to alleviating illness. Although current medications pose distinctive effects, the majority of Chinese rely on traditional aspects. In a different spectrum, Singaporeans highly value dynamic aspects of art, mainly portraiture and ink painting. Fong and
Ng (2020) establish that the Singapore government optimally invests in conventional art as a strategy of promoting the country’s social identity while incorporating modern perspectives for better preservation of the aesthetic value. On the one hand, the initiative renders an adept opportunity to market conventional art internationally. On the other hand, the mainframe fosters a risk of acculturation. Aesthetically, it is vital to integrate modern and traditional art to appreciate the implications of the evolutionary process. Art exists in different forms thus the importance of appreciating the transition from the classical era to the present artistic structures and perceptions.Relevance of Art’s Evolutionary in UAEThe UAE is one of the members of the Gulf Cooperation Council hence attaining optimal support concerning economic development. As an Islamic state, the government highly regards Muslims and their beliefs despite the incorporation of diversity-based religious practices and policies. The UAE administration further advocates creativity and innovation under the spectrum of distinctive elements, such as sports and architecture (Al Sallal et al., 2018). Historically, the Emiratis were nomads living in an arid and semi-arid area. However, technological advancement and unity fostered growth and diversification of socio-economic and political domains. Emerging artists are representatives of UAE entrepreneurs utilizing conceptions as formative strategies to intensify business practices within the country and abroad.Over the decades, one of the significant challenges affecting the distribution of benefits in the UAE entails gender disparity in the participation scale concerning business growth and development. Evolution steered by technological advancement fostered the necessity of equity despite gender identity. UAE is
one of the countries due to the focus on enhancing sustainability practice across the enterprise world. As a result, different government institutions focused on achieving the primary goal of boosting business performance against the outlying essence of independence. The emergent concept that stimulated the emergence of UAE as one of the safest countries globally is the advocacy for the participation of all parties. In research, entities rendered implementation process of entrepreneurial empowerment initiatives among men and women to enhance gender equality. The UAE government seeks to establish an economy that empowers locals with optimal productivity while appreciating the globalization mainframe (Salisbury, 2020). Globalization emerged as a result of effective technological advancement. In this case, individuals from different states significantly exchanged information and networked, causing a global village loop.It is the responsibility of government institutions to implement policies that steer social justice and equality. Ethnicity and gender differences negatively affected the quality of interactions among personnel, causing an uproar among the UAE. Therefore, the UAE government implemented business policies to improve a sustainable enterprise environment for investors despite gender differences. Different indicators attributed to the establishment of competent business and entrepreneurs’ empowerment, such as advancing infrastructure and talent management among residents. Dubai is one of the cities that encounters a significant change in determining the quality of interaction among locals, promoting sustainability. As one of the ideal tourist destinations globally, the UAE government offers incentives among men and women to intensify the trickle-down effect of accrued benefits among the residents with minimal revenue leakage (Salisbury, 2020). Despite
the influx of clients in the country, the nation faces an increase in foreign workers whose salaries are transferred to their respective countries’ bank accounts. As a result, it is crucial to appreciate UAE entrepreneurs’ empowerment in the spectral view of entrepreneurial opportunities.In the digital era, online business boomed fostering a prominent impact on national economic growth and development. Research by Krzymowski (2022) establishes that the digitization of dynamic economic activities demands the implementation of policies empowering entrepreneurs in the UAE. The researchers further illustrate that promoting gender equality within the entrepreneurial world is an opportunity within the UAE economic spectrum to enhance profitability and growth. Apart from advocating for empowerment, it is crucial to establish key variants that influence men and women involvement in business establishment and management. Empowerment encapsulates the indication of major factors enhancing effective decision-making. There are dynamic government interventions that elevate the performance of business entities. However, it is vital that the parties involved focus on promoting sustainability by appreciating productivity within the scope of distinct problem-solving perspectives.The personal traits of an individual attribute to the capacity of investing in entrepreneurial opportunities. In the study by Erie (2019), the research indicates profound results regarding the personality values that foster the emergence of entrepreneurs. The investigation encapsulated assessing the core factors that render students as entrepreneurs. In this case, the factors derived included entrepreneurial confidence, orientation, cultural support, and learning institutions’ support for entrepreneurship. Despite the dynamic indicators, Erie (2019) established that entrepreneurial confidence is significantly attributed to engagement in entrepreneurship. Primarily,
the research indicates that effective entrepreneurship empowerment enshrines advocacy for entrepreneurial confidence among distinct parties. Optimal integration of values fosters proficiency in appreciating individuality and the development of a productive investor across the UAE.It is the responsibility of the UAE government to incorporate measures that advocate equality within the scope of entrepreneurial empowerment. UAE is one of the Asian countries highly developing mainly because of prominent investment in infrastructural development. The intensification in urbanization attributes to the establishment of a suitable investment environment for foreigners. Empowering entrepreneurs in UAE is an approach that fosters equipping individuals with proficient skills and knowledge for innovative and business perspectives (Pauceanu et al., 2021). Apart from advocating for the influx of foreign investors in Dubai, it is important to intensify the pool of residents engaging in entrepreneurial opportunities. The strategy elevates the trickle-down effect on accrual benefits based on the participation of residents in business practices. Major initiatives that promote entrepreneurial empowerment include financial literacy and determining distinct government intervention techniques. The advocacy for entrepreneurial empowerment is a multidimensional aspect that enhances optimal business competition and the adoption of innovative techniques elevating standards of operations.Analysis FrameworkSocial growth and development is an entity that encompasses the interplay of dynamic elements to boost performance outlier. The different ideologies that render an understanding to challenges facing emerging artists include functionalism and Marxism that profoundly establish a relationship between human behavioral patterns and virtuosity (Akhmetshin et al., 2018). Functionalism defines society as a multidimensional phenomenon whose advancement depends on the coordination among all stakeholders.
be partners with and choose them carefully (Klein, 2022). As a result, the processes in this area slow down significantly, and the primary focus on self, as opposed to interactions with others, justify the changes which happened to this part of human life.ResponseEvidenceThe examined article is an effective piece of writing due to the inclusion of evidence from numerous sources, both of qualitative and quantitative nature. Thus, Klein (2022) refers to multiple studies related to the subject under consideration, including surveys conducted among the target population and statistical data gathered by official institutions. More importantly, she analyzes the current tendencies in the relationships of Gen Z through the lens of the experience of previous generations (Klein, 2022).This approach to the task makes the findings more credible compared to a possible orientation on the information received from the participants and, consequently, confirms the reliability of conclusions for conducting further research. The overall extensiveness of this publication is also supported by the inclusion of personal opinions alongside the studies mentioned above (Klein, 2022). In this way, the selection of appropriate instruments for the purposes of this article is one of its main advantages.External and Internal Factors
the negativity of the slope and the curve for the concentration of the moles per liter against time in seconds (Du et al., 2021 p 3154). Rate is equal to the negativity of the slope over time in seconds; this brings the instant rate and the difference between them, which gives the instantaneous rate.The reaction rate calculates the average over a time interval by dividing the moles’ concentration change per liter overtime per seconds’ period by time interval. Getting average is by observing the difference in the reactant’s concentration using the equation where the brackets mean the attention of the reactant. A minus sign applies when the rate is of a positive number from the previous equation. Nevertheless, the minus sign is not needed to calculate the used products’ average rates. Getting the average from B to G is by adding all the concentration intervals and dividing them from B to G to get the standard. To conclude, at the beginning of the reaction at point A and time 0, the concentration of moles per liter was high, while at point G, the engagement was low.
The choice of ship is connected with the running costs of transportation. Stopford (2009) claims that the best way to reduce costs is to select newer ships, which require fewer crewmembers, less maintenance, and are more reliable. While all of these points are true, they do not automatically make newer ships the preferable choice for shipping costs. As it stands, 65% of all cargo ships in the world are over 14 years old, meaning that competition for newer ships is intense (Cheng, 2021). High demand means increased costs, which was demonstrated by the increase in cargo rates in 2021, and previously in 2016 (Cheng, 2021). Both of these surges saw a rise in demand for older ship services.As a rule, the offered costs of shipping by older vessels are cheaper. The reasons for that are the lower costs of purchasing a ship, which means lower pressure to repay the interest in time (Ros Chaos et al., 2021). In addition, companies running older vessels are aware of their disadvantages, thus needing to compensate for them by offering a more advantageous price. Finally, certain running costs for older ships can be mitigated by utilizing low-grade fuel, which these ships can still run on (Ros Chaos et al., 2021). In addition, while repairs and maintenance for aging vessels are more frequent when compared to newer ships, the costs of these repairs are often lower. New ships have expensive and sensitive equipment, which requires more time and money to repair and replace (Ros Chaos et al., 2021). Older vessels are less high-tech, meaning more straightforward and cheaper maintenance.Overall, with two-thirds of the world’s cargo being ferried by older ships, Stopford’s conclusions about newer ships being better are rendered moot. While, on paper, such a conclusion seems obvious, in reality, a company has to contend with changing transportation rates (which are higher for newer ships), availability, and a myriad of other factors. If shipments are frequent and cannot afford delays, the shipper will have to go not with the best possible solution but with what is available at hand. Chances are, it will be an older ship.
Nursing Theory Case StudyThe measurable nursing desired outcome related to improving the chronic obstructive pulmonary disease patient’s condition is to retain respiratory stability with concise respirations. Another anticipated result is for the patient to exhibit behavior patterns that strengthen airway clearance, such as coughing successfully and expectorating secretions. Additional goals regarding the above include the advancement of the patients presenting improved respiratory rate, personal autonomy in self-care operations, improvement in exercise prejudice, and nutrient requirements that meet calorie consumption. The present research looks at frequently utilized quality indicators such as pulmonary function, overall health, exercise performance and activity level, dyspnea, acute episodes, the multifaceted BODE rating, and death rates. The current clinical practice is producing the intended care outcomes. The 75-year –old Native American has shown some improvement in his exercise performance activity level and overall health.One of the theories of care that have been developed to help direct nursing and improve the outcomes for the hospitalized patient is the ‘care-based on-oxygenation’ (CBOO) theory. This theory focuses on providing the best possible care to the patient based on the level of oxygenation in his blood. The concept is founded on research that shows that giving the best possible care to the patient leads to improved consequences. Moreover, it is also a way of delivering care focused on the needs of the COPD patient and oxygenation to achieve the very best possible results for the client.Concept MapThe International Council of Nursing (ICN) and the World Health Organization (WHO) developed a nursing theory that asserts that the nursing
profession is an interrelated phase of human experience that provides, but not restricted to, the socioeconomic, structural, and universal healthcare framework. Nursing theory is essential to understand the nursing assistant’s role, feature, and procedure concerning a person, household, and community. The patient care role, purpose, and practice environment are characterized as an interconnected core of personal experience that provides the interpersonal, structural, sentimental, psychological, religious, and cultural milieu of the particular participant. According to this theory, nursing practice is not limited to the context and placing of the health care system.Nursing theory provides a basic understanding of core concepts, allowing many in the career field to clarify what they are doing for sick people and why they do it. This is especially essential because it enables nurses to express information that proves the methods and techniques that underpin their profession (Suthasini, 2018). They also discover critical thinking skills, which allow them to recognize and apply data, scientific proof, and concepts from a wide range of sources and layouts.An individual who has studied nursing theory as a registered nurse has influenced their practice. It is time to delve slightly deeper now that they are in nursing education. Critical thinking and problem-solving are central to health care since both have been established through a comprehensive examination of the base of information and applying theory in the healthcare setting. Individuals can use their critical thinking skills to recognize research gaps, investigate multiple viewpoints, and summarize fresh concepts as critical thinkers.Nursing theory teaches everyone to think like a nurse by
to provide comprehensive care.One will have to use their clinical experience, expert opinion, and skills to provide vision and management to the staff nurses and other representatives of the multidisciplinary teams, which include doctors, medical assistants, and other medical professionals, in the care of experience in a wide range of severe, critical care, and long-term care settings. The primary goal is to provide the best medical service to sick people.Understanding nursing theory concepts and how they can be used to continue improving the nursing interventions and procedures is one of the most crucial matters nurses can do to improve the patients’ services. The nursing care plan is an essential aspect of nursing. It is an integral part of the patient’s medical record used to plan nursing home care for that particular patient. The nursing care plan could satisfy the needs of specific groups or individuals. The nursing care plan guides the nurse and other medical professionals.
Global climate change, as has now been proven by the latest research, is caused by human activity. Awareness of the seriousness of the situation is gradually penetrating into world public opinion. There is still an opportunity to mitigate the consequences to avoid the worst. People can all unite in order to change the situation, even though this process may be gradual and take some time.The main difficulty is connected with the extremely uneven distribution of greenhouse gas emissions between developed and developing countries, large and small. However, it is possible to change the situation by taking small steps. For instance, the population should use public transportation instead of cars. When using cars, there is an enormous amount of exhaustive fumes released in the atmosphere. This initiative can contribute to lower gas emissions, further reducing the consequences of global warming.Additionally, people can start saving energy by drying laundry on a rope, not in an electric dryer. One may also set a lower switch-on temperature on the heating system thermostat ( What Are the Solutions ). What is more, meat production entails significantly higher greenhouse gas emissions than chicken production, growing vegetables, fruits and cereals. Therefore, people should start eating more of those to live healthier and more aware.In conclusion, global warming is a severe threat to modern society and is likely to affect the entire planet. Consequently, people should unite to solve this problem together in order to prevent the spread of emissions and litter, and promote a healthy lifestyle. By saving energy, eating proper food, and leading healthy lifestyles, individuals can contribute to the change of climate. These easy solutions can significantly boost the planet’s immunity to global problems.
some level of disrespect. According to the scholar, many times, silence might also suggest a critical and keen thought process. Notably, the scholar explains that proper coaching would help managers and leaders realize such situations and help in the growth of both the junior staff and his or her supervisor.It can be argued that the author holds a general assumption that coaching only involves the manager. This is due to the fact that significant amount of advice given is directed to the supervisors. The role of the junior staff should also have been explored due to the nature of coaching. He explains that several elements, referred to as question masterclasses are critical for good coaching. The first question, also called the kick start question is critical. The author explains that it is a question “in which you discover the power of an opening question that gets the conversation happening fast and deep” (Bungay, 2016, p. 36). It can be argued that listening is a key element of any type of coaching. This can be linked to various studies that have been done on the same topic. Bungay (2016) uses this as his conclusion and it can be debated that it sums up the topic well.
At the moment, AIDS is becoming quite widespread, despite all the preventive and familiarization measures carried out in educational institutions. Thus, in order to improve the situation, college administrations are introducing various measures to combat the problem. The educational organization, Camden County College decided to install dispensers with condoms in the toilets. Henceforth, this work aims to prove that condom dispensers are an effective measure to lower the incidence of AIDS in adolescents, increase the credibility of college and develop sexual education and awareness.Therefore, as already mentioned, Camden County College decided to install special dispensers in the toilets of the educational organization. The main problem was the ambiguity of opinions about this decision. However, this work believes that this initiative can play a positive role in changing the dynamics of sexually transmitted diseases and acquired immunodeficiency syndrome or AIDS. At the moment, it is noted that the age of sexual activity is significantly reduced. Research shows that “in a nationally representative survey of college students, only 58% of sexually active students reported condom use at last vaginal intercourse” (The Condom Dispenser Initiative para. 1). Further, one of the sources indicated that “The contributing factors are the cost, lack of convenient access, social norms, and lack of knowledge on how to use a condom effectively” (Turner 2). These indicators are disappointing since, at the same time, the risk of contracting a dangerous disease increases. Moreover, feelings of shame or lack of money can also influence the decision of young people to neglect contraceptives.Limited access to protective equipment
be met with contempt or vice versa with abuse of the opportunity provided.In addition, it will contribute to maintaining organization in this process, where students rationally and responsibly use the resources provided by the college. Thus, when introducing awareness about sexual education and the importance of observing AIDS-related preventive measures, college students will treat the installation of dispensers as vending machines. Therefore, the almost animal instinct that leads to a wrong attitude to initiative and ridicule will be absent.In conclusion, this work was engaged in the study of the effectiveness of the installation of dispensers with condoms at Camden County College. The main argument given for this measure is the reduction of cases of infection with AIDS and other sexually transmitted diseases. Moreover, it will contribute to strengthening the credibility of the educational organization and the development of sexual education in it. In addition, the argument supporting the initiative implies an increase in the availability of contraceptive measures for young people, who sometimes do not have the opportunity to purchase them on their own.
The following paper briefly compares and contrasts the corporate social responsibilities, ethics, and diversity in Walmart, Amazon, and Apple Inc. Walmart is an American multi-global retail corporation that is presently the world’s largest business entity as per Fortune Global 500 in 2020. On the Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) front, Walmart believes in promoting the business and benefiting consumers and society. Firstly, the company emphasizes sustainability to make the world a better place by creating sustainable products, conserving nature, and eliminating dangerous emissions and sources of waste (Walmart, 2022). Moreover, the entity promotes volunteerism amongst its employees and engages in charity globally, including participating in food donations, conducting food security campaigns, and offering financial support to the needy.Amazon, founded by Jeff Bezos, is an American multinational company that delves into technology, artificial intelligence, computing, streaming, and e-commerce. Like Walmart, Amazon is also heavy on environmental sustainability initiatives as a CSR function. During the COVID-19 pandemic, the entity ramped up CSR programs to further include the provision of food relief, educational support, and housing (Amazon, 2022). Nevertheless, some criticism arose during the pandemic concerning its working conditions and PPEs for workers.Like Amazon, Apple is another American multi-global technology enterprise that focuses on online services, software, and consumer electronics. According to Apple Inc. (2022), the company is also big on environmental initiatives through its active engagement on climate change issues, environmental sustainability and strategy initiatives, after-sales services, and a global recycling program. Apple is a leading player in the Product Red initiative that supports the global fund to combat
though Apple’s management continues to stress its adherence to ethical standards, numerous complaints of unethical practices exist. These complaints touch on political influence, anti-social finance, irresponsible marketing, arms and military supply, and environmental pollution. In 2019, the Guardian reported accusations against Apple from the Democratic Republic of Congo where children died, and many others suffered severe injuries while working in cobalt mines on Apple’s behalf. Over time, issues also emerged concerning Apple’s limitations on users’ freedom of expression.All three companies boast diversity in their global and local workforce. For instance, Walmart does not discriminate against potential employees based on their gender, race, and creed, as per their statement. Indeed, its American workforce has a rich mix of whites, African Americans, Native Indians, Latinos, and so on. Amazon also claims to receive its diverse perspectives from a pool of employees of various ages, genders, races, national origins, professional and life experiences, education, culture, and sexual orientation. The company has over 13 employee resource groups and about 90,000 employees in hundreds of branches globally (Amazon, 2022). On its part, Apple claims to be an accurate reflection of the contemporary world. According to figures from 2020, the company significantly increased the number of employees from underrepresented communities, including Black, Hispanic, and female employees (Apple Inc., 2022). Thus, being multinational entities, the three companies have good employee diversity.
The main impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on businesses is reflected in the havoc that this pandemic has caused to the global supply chains. Mainly, many suppliers could not produce goods for a while due to safety restrictions. Others could not deliver them due to overloaded ports, extremely high freight rates, and displaced shipping containers, among other issues. Although the pandemic’s effect had lessened over the last year when the vaccines were introduced and people were allowed to leave their homes, the effect of this global catastrophe on the supply chains prevails.The most significant impact of the pandemic and the changes within the business environments are seen with small businesses. This can be seen in the example of Amazon’s growth, which was picked during the beginning of the pandemic. As people were ordered by their governments to stay at home, the majority of consumers chose online shopping to satisfy their needs. Hence, the customers ordered most of their items online, including groceries, clothes, personal items, and other things. Amazon was thriving with its ability to deliver goods through its developed system of supply chains, while small brick-and-mortar stores were forced to close because they could not sustain not having profits for months. Moreover, these small businesses did not have the finances to invest in establishing websites and delivery services. Apart from this, Amazon has been accused of using data from its small suppliers to popular copycat items and selling them under Amazon’s brand. Hence, the internet retail giant has the resources and capabilities to overshadow any
As at 2nd March 3, 2022 the number of COVID-19 global confirmed deaths are 437,333,859 (World Health Organization). Elsewhere, the number of deaths in the whole world are 5,960,972 (World Health Organization). In the United States of America, the total number of COVID-19 infections case so far are over 79 million, while deaths are estimated to be close to 952,000 (World Health Organization). In European countries such as the United Kingdom, the total COVID-19 cases so far are 19M, India 42.9M, Brazil 28.8M, and France 22.2M (World Health Organization). In term of deaths, India has 514,000 cases, Brazil has 650,000, France 136,000, and United Kingdom has 162,000 (World Health Organization). In Africa, and other developing countries, case of COVID-19 outbreak and deaths have increased drastically since the virus was reported in China. For instance, in Kenya, there are 323,000 reported cases so far and estimated 5,639 deaths (World Health Organization).It reported that half of the total mortalities in the world are from developing countries. In relation to vaccination statistics, one should note that at least 10.7 billion of coronavirus vaccines have been administered so far across 233 locations in the world. This has been so far been achieved in 184 countries. In the United States, a total number of 553 million doses have been administered while 140 million doses in the United Kingdom (World Health Organization). In Africa as a continent, only 587 million people have been vaccinated so far, an indication that African countries are far and wide experiencing numerous challenges in as far as
vaccinating its people is concerned.The United States pharmaceutical companies-Pfizer, Moderna, and Johnson and Johnson should be required to expressly share their COVID-19 vaccine recipes as well as the technology with other countries especially developing ones. This has been a shared feeling since last year specifically as it concerns Moderna, which was the upstart biotech firm that was by far involved in complete manufacturing and development of vaccines using billions of dollars from taxpayers’ money (Nolen and Stolberg). In essence, it does not make sense when the developed countries are more than three quarter fully vaccinated in term of the whole populations while the developing countries particularly in Africa and other part of the world have vaccinated less than 10% of its people. This explains why the United States health officials feel that the three companies have a greater responsibility in addressing the present global vaccine shortage (Nolen and Stolberg). In his word, President Biden highlighted that he believes America will never be same unless other parts of the globe are safe and their people are vaccinated from the virus.In reality, it makes no sense when some countries have made serious positive steps in term of vaccination while others are still lagging behind. COVID-19 is easily spread and if the developed countries do not take a serious initiative towards addressing the current issues, it will reciprocate and affect such countries. The silver lining in all of these issues is that President Joe Biden’s administration has urged these pharmaceutical companies to enter to joint ventures where it would
government contracts for the purpose of medical supplies to deal with national emergencies such as COVID-19.Specifically, President Biden should direct the pharmaceutical companies to strictly expand their production of COVID-19 vaccines to developing countries to deal with the present low vaccine uptake crises in the mentioned regions. The Defense Production Act would require the said companies to fund projects in order to expand domestic production of supplies and agree partnership with existing private companies (Siripurapu). Last but not least, in relation to World Powers Act, the three pharmaceutical companies would be granted some form of monetary compensation considering their efforts to ease an ongoing global pandemic.In conclusion, it is clear that COVI9-19 pandemic has severely affected every part of the world. However, there seems to be a massive disparity in terms of vaccine administration between developed and developing nations. Countries such as the United States should be at the forefront in directing and encouraging their leading pharmaceutical companies to share their technology with private companies in developing countries to deal with the existing disparity. In the end, it would mean that a collective responsibility would be the key towards dealing and complete management of the pandemic.
networks profiles, and personal sites. As a result, “the line between fact and fiction” is blurred because inexperienced Internet users can find irrelevant sources and believe in imaginable crimes (Surette, 2011, p. 217). These “fake news” can also frame readers’ perception of the event or of a particular problem in a false way based on inaccurate information.Finally, the modern trend is that political polarization sustains the ideological differences among media sources. It creates the situation when one criminal case can be interpreted in different ways in different media. The vivid modern example is the case of Kyle Rittenhaus, who fatally shot 2 men during protests but avoided prison because of the court decision that it was self-defense. In far-right Breitbart news, the story was framed in the way to emphasize that Rittenhaus tried to stop violence rather than provoke it (Pollak, 2021). At the same time, left-wing media MSNBC published the blog with the title “Kyle Rittenhouse trial was designed to protect white conservatives who kill” (Jones, 2021). It is evident that the way how an average person will interpret the case will be influenced by the choice of media outlet. Thus, the political polarization impacts the way how crimes are understood in society.
Gulf Coast Management Area are discussed in this study. A summary and overview of each fishery are included, and information on how the fisheries are managed and fishery performance and escapement from 2016 to 2018. This report is provided by the official department that controls fishing activities in Alaska. However, it should be noted that this source can be considered reliable as it provides statistical information. All this will undoubtedly be useful for research since it is necessary to take into account official data.The intricacy of variables that restrict or encourage diversity in Alaskan fisheries, one of the world’s most important fishing locations, is examined in this case study. They looked at changes in participation and portfolio variety in Alaskan fisheries over three decades using a mix of harvest statistics and literature reviews. The four case studies looked at how fishers, fleets, and communities responded to various interconnected stressors, such as biological decreases, market and pricing dynamics, and fisheries privatization. Experts also verified this article, which is reflected in the reliability and accuracy of the information provided. It will be useful for research because it reflects current trends and factors affecting the spread of sport fishing.
History and Impact of Employing Women and Minorities in Law EnforcementLaw enforcement shows how laws are enforced and public order is maintained. White men have been disproportionately holding positions in this field for a long time. Nowadays, the situation is different, and more women and minorities are encouraged to join law enforcement professions to reduce the impact of bureaucracy and other biases. The first women and African Americans were hired as police officers in the middle of the 19th century. In the middle of the 20th century, the Civil Rights Act removed other discrimination-based debates and supported equality in public accommodations. Racial diversification of law enforcement organizations is favored to increase confidence in the police and improve police-minority relations (Sever et al., 2018). Women in law enforcement also promote decreasing in the use of physical force and misunderstandings in communities (Sever et al., 2018). Although men prevail in law enforcement employment, changes and respect cannot be ignored today.Various Roles of Law EnforcementLaw enforcement is a vital activity of the government to enforce the law and control communities’ behaviors and relationships. The major roles of this profession are to maintain public order and manage public safety. It is expected to see how individuals suspected of criminal offenses are treated and how investigations are organized. The courts aim to ensure that suspected criminals receive fair trials and that their guilt or innocence is properly determined. The correction system, in its turn, focuses on altering behaviors to make people socially acceptable and legally abiding. When an offender is caught by the police (a law enforcement representative), it is necessary to make sure that no unnecessary violence is applied. The courts analyze each detail and conclude that all rights are considered and no mistakes are made. Corrections help people change their behaviors and understand what they should and should not do within the frames of the existing system and society.
economic ground. From the plaintiff’s letter, it was obvious that the plaintiff did not understand the purpose of the claim and commenced it without respect to the court, guided by emotions that, at the same time, did not have a reasonable basis. In addition, the absence of the defendant’s claim surprised me as well, as he has more evidence that his career, personal life, and mental health were affected by the plaintiff’s actions. At the same time, what was new to me is the accuracy of investigation in relation to particular aspects. For instance, the fact that the plaintiff was not pregnant was supported not only by a negative test but with evidence provided by gynecologists in two different European countries, however, even the confirmed fact of pregnancy was not directly related to the claim as the plaintiff did not reject his financial responsibilities. At the same time, I would like to learn more about “frivolous” and “vexatious” claims as I did not face these definitions prior to reading this case.
Shown above is a schematic of the electron transport chain (ETC) in a typical animal cell. NADH (not shown) donates electrons to Flavin mononucleotide (FMN), and FADH 2 donates electrons to an iron-sulfur complex (FeS), which donates them to ubiquinone (Q).How does transfer of electrons from one carrier to another in the ETC generate a proton gradient across the inner mitochondrial membrane?Electron transport along the transport chain is associated with a redistribution of charges in the mitochondrial membrane, resulting in excess or insufficient potential locally in certain areas. Protons tend to make up for the insufficient potential, so they will migrate to places of decreased charge or move away from places of increased charge.There are poisons that can specifically block or hinder either FMN or the Fe-S in complex II that accepts electrons from FADH 2 . Which poison (against FMN, or against the Fe-S in complex II) will have a more detrimental effect on the proton gradient, and why?FMNH2 poisoning is expected to have a more deleterious effect on the proton gradient because one of the primary chains of electron migration within the membrane is disrupted in this case. In addition, FMNH2 is involved in the release of protons involved in migration through ATP synthase, so disabling FMNH2 would result in the loss of this proton action to a greater extent.Would the poisons described above increase oxygen consumption, decrease it, or have no effect? Explain.Oxygen consumption occurs in one of the last phases, particularly in complex IV. The poisoning of any of the phases from the previous assignment will affect electron migration, rendering the action of complex IV ineffective. This will be realized as a cascade reaction in which the problem occurred long before the oxygen use site.Which electrons have more energy—those accepted by Q, or those accepted by cytochrome c (Cyt c), and how do you know?Q takes electrons (two pieces) from the first complex and two electrons from the second complex; the total is four. Cyt c takes only two electrons from the third complex. Therefore, we can assume that Q has cumulatively higher energy than Cyt c.From which, and into which cell compartments are electrons pumped during electron transport in cell respiration?Q receives electrons from FMNH2 and FAD(II) and gives them to QH2, after which they migrate to complex (III), whereas Cyt C receives electrons from complex III and gives them to complex IV.What would be the effect on ATP production of decreasing the pH inside the mitochondrial matrix? Explain.If the intramitochondrial matrix decreases its level of acidity, this will lead to a reduction in the number of free protons inside. As a result, the mitochondria will transfer large amounts of protons into the intermembrane space, leading to the formation of ATP.
The first wave of rock music met its demise due to the combination of two factors. First of all, at the end of the 1950s, rock and roll lost several important figures. In particular, Little Richard quit music and became a minister, Elvis Presley was drafted into the army, and Chuck Berry was convicted of a prison sentence (Covach and Flory 105). The fate was especially cruel to Buddy Holly, who was killed in a plane crash along with Ritchie Valence and the Big Bopper on February 3, 1959. The loss of so many popular artists significantly weakened the early rock and roll scene.In addition, the growing popularity of rock and roll threatened the business interests of the major record companies and labels. At the beginning of the 50s, major labels recorded and released the most hit pop records (Covach and Flory 106). The early rock and roll stars reversed this trend by recording their songs on small independent labels and paying the DJs to play them on the radio. Payola , or practice of paying a DJ to play the records, was common in the music business. However, major labels and pop-song composers could not tolerate rock and roll, a genre disrespected by many in the music industry, encroaching on their market share and popularity. The following payola scandal resulted in the removal of rock and roll from radio station broadcasts. Alan Freed, a DJ who played a big role in the rise of rock and roll, lost his job for taking payola gifts.As a result, rock music changed drastically by the beginning of the 1960s. Music business professionals who effectively ended the first wave of rock and roll saw the commercial potential of youth culture and rock. The industry sanitized the product by promoting clean-cut, nonthreatening, much less independent artists (Kot). Major labels focused on producing teen idols, and no big names emerged in the 60s rock until the Beatles and the British Invasion.
Construct Development and Scale CreationOperating DefinitionOperational definition of depression: a mood disorder characterized by depressed mood and anhedonia for more than two weeks, which is often accompanied by a decrease in the ability to perform daily tasks and a feeling of helplessness, including reoccurring suicidal thoughts. Guillot-Valdés et al. (2019) note that depressive disorders are clinically diagnosed when a patient has depressive symptoms for more than two weeks, one of which is low mood and anhedonia. Nguyen et al. (2018) identify depression “as persistent sadness, a loss of interest and energy, an inability to carry out daily activities, a change in appetite or sleeping time, poor concentration, hopelessness and thoughts of self-harm or suicide” (p. 2). Garcı´a-Batista et al. (2018) underline that depression is also associated with “decreased concentration and decision-making ability, loss of self-confidence, feelings of inferiority or worthlessness and guilt” (p. 2). Additionally, depressive disorder is related to manifestations of fear and anger, as well as symptoms of anxiety (Guillot-Valdés et al., 2019). Comorbidity between depression and anxiety disorders is a significant challenge in developing definitions and symptom measurement instruments.Items used to Sample the Domain 1. Manifestations of depressed mood including feelings of sadness, worthlessness, hopelessness; 2. Loss of interest, including a decreased ability to experience pleasure and joy; 3. Reoccuring suicide thoughts; 4. Disorders in daily activities including decreased concentration and decision-making ability; 5. Manifestations of symptoms of anxiety including fear, anger, and irritability.Method of ScalingThe method of scaling appropriate for the described domain is an indication of the extent of the patient’s
symptoms, including never, sometimes, often, very often, constantly. These items, in turn, are associated with numeric scaling from 0 to 4, where 0 is never, 1 is sometimes, 2 is often, 3 is very often, 4 is constantly. This scaling method was chosen because it makes it easier for the patient to interact with the test. By noting the frequency of occurrence of symptoms, they will be able to assess their emotional manifestations more deeply. For the therapist, this scaling allows to assess the general picture of the patient’s psychological state and obtain a result that is suitable for measurement. Additionally, this scaling helps to determine not only the presence or absence of symptoms of depression but also to assess their severity preliminarily.Instrument to Query RespondentsHow often do you experience manifestations of low mood, including feelings of sadness, worthlessness, hopelessness?  * Never;  * Sometimes;  * Often;  * Very often;  * Constantly.How often do you note the loss of interest, including a decreased ability to experience pleasure and joy?  * Never;  * Sometimes;  * Often;  * Very often;  * Constantly.How often do you note the presence of suicidal thoughts?  * Never;  * Sometimes;  * Often;  * Very often;  * Constantly.How often do you experience a decrease in the ability to complete daily tasks, including decreased concentration and decision-making ability?  * Never;  * Sometimes;  * Often;  * Very often;  * Constantly.How often do you experience symptoms of anxiety,
including fear, anger, and irritability?  * Never;  * Sometimes;  * Often;  * Very often;  * Constantly.Interview or Self-ReportThis instrument is more appropriate for patient self-reporting, as it implies a more superficial identification of the manifestation of symptoms. Stuart et al. (2014) report that “61% of the study population identified as having a history of depression using the SCID / NP also self-reporting past depression” (p. 868). Thus, this instrument can be used to determine the presence of symptoms and indications for a more detailed interview with the therapist. It provides not sufficient amount of specific information to be used in interviews.Analysis and JustificationNorm and Reliability ScoresThe definition of norm scores for a scaling instrument allows you to determine the influence of background factors on the test results. Such aspects include gender, age, educational level, and others respondents’ characteristics. Roelofs et al. (2013) argue that a multiple regression analysis allows fairly reliable determining the predicates of the norm, as well as establishing possible interactions between them. Thus, the use of this approach provides the norm score for a more accurate interpretation of the results.Reliability is a measure of how well test results reflect reality. Nolte et al. (2019) note that this criterion consists of “internal consistency and test-retest reliability” (p. 2). There are special coefficients for measuring these specific items and checking the questionnaire for reliability. In particular, Cronbach’s alpha is used to assess internal consistency, and the intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC) is used for test-retest reliability (Massai et al., 2018). Cronbach’s
alpha allows you to evaluate how each of the items included in the test meets the purpose of the assessment. If the value of the coefficient is equal to or greater than 0.70, then the test is sufficiently reliable (Taber, 2018, p. 1293). However, when using Cronbach’s alpha, a higher ratio means more reliability, which also reflects the quality of the questionnaire. In the case of a test-retest reliability study, it is also necessary to select a model corresponding to the type of ICC questionnaire (Qin et al., 2019). For the scale presented, ANOVA Model is appropriate since it allows the researcher to consider the non-attachment of test results to time frames. Thus, reliability can be described by two coefficients and signal the need for adjustments.Number of RespondentsThe number of respondents depends on the purpose of patient testing and may vary depending on this aspect. In this case, it is important to identify whether the test will be used for individual diagnostics or for collecting statistical data. For example, this questionnaire can be used to examine the predisposition of certain populations to depressive disorders. It can also be utilized to collect statistics on the possibilities of self-reporting questionnaires. Therapists can also use this scale for individual rapid testing of vulnerable groups or people who suspect symptoms of depression. Thus, the number of people who will be asked to undergo testing depends on the goals of its development. However, within the proposed scale, to assess the effectiveness of this test, it is necessary to offer it to
at least 8-10 people.Characteristics of RespondentsThe characteristics of the respondents can be diverse since the symptoms of depression are inherent in completely different people. As in the case of the number of respondents, their characteristics depend on the purpose of using the questionnaire. In particular, the study can be conducted for members of a specific group that has distinctive features in the form of gender, age, or conditions. For example, there are studies that target medical students, women with endometriosis, patients aged 65-80, and the general public of a particular country (Nguyen et al., 2018; Ceran et al., 2020; Djukanovic et al., 2017; Garcı´a-Batista et al., 2018). Within the proposed scale, the main characteristic of the respondents may be the suspicion of the presence of symptoms of depression. With a sufficiently large sample of patients with different backgrounds, the norm score will help make the study more relevant. In general, the spectrum of people to whom this scale can be applied is extremely wide, but it is necessary to take into account the characteristics of patients when applying it.GeneralizationGeneralization helps researchers to establish patterns that are determined based on the results of participants and apply them to a broader population. The population to which the results can be generalized is the “totality of elements or people that have common, defined characteristics, and about whom the study results are relevant” (Polit & Beck, 2010, p. 1452). Thus, this aspect directly depends on what goals the testing pursues and who its respondents are. In the case of the
symptoms of depression have already been established.For a more accurate measurement of validity, Confirmatory factor analysis (CFA) is also used, which aims to identify the relationship between items and the construct to which they belong. This model makes it possible to assess the extent to which the respondents’ answers correlate with the characteristics they possess (Orcan, 2018). In this case, using CFA, it is possible to find out how much the choice of a particular answer to each item correlates with the frequency of manifestations of symptoms of depression.Item SelectionThe selection of items for compiling the questionnaire was conducted by the rational method. This approach is based on the analysis of empirical data available on the topic under study. In this case, expert knowledge plays a key role in the compilation of the questionnaire (Oosterveld, 2019). The rational method involves several stages: 1. Concept analysis within which the researcher analyzes the available in the literature information and creates the operational definition of the construct; 2. The item production stage involves selecting items based on known data using informal and intuitive criteria; 3. The scale construction involves evaluating items by an expert based on their face validity; 4. The evaluation includes an assessment of validity and reliability, as well as a comparison of test and clinical examination results.Cut-Off Scores
Confusion about Art Deco and Depression styles is common even among scholars who fail to notice the significant differences in the artistic directions. Art Deco is a French stylistic trend that stems from the Lalique, Art Noveau, and works of the famous artist Picasso. In contrast, the Depression style presents the difficulties of poor mental states of working people and seeks for them to find comfort in Depression art. Overall, even though the aforementioned artistic directions are sometimes mixed into the Deco style, they are entirely different and carry distinct meanings to society.To elaborate, the styles are dissimilar in their primary characteristics, materials, colors, and shapes. Thus, Art Deco is more provocative with bright tones and attractive ornaments, such as triangles, zigzags, and even trapezoids. This direction is loud and eye-catching, considering that the art is in some way chaotic with all its different motives and influences, but still beyond outstanding. Furthermore, Art Deco is about manufactured materials when it comes to sculpture and architecture, which is evident from the interior of Radio City Music Hall at the Rockefeller Center (Soren, 2018).In contrast, the Depression direction pertains to negative or melancholic feelings, as presented in the design of Hotel Ambassador in Bucharest (Soren, 2018). Moreover, the art is rather minimalistic and less provocative compared to Art Deco since it does not particularly burst with color and countless geometric influences. In fact, as the founder of the Depression style, Raymond Loewy, says, the style is appropriately balanced between the lack and outburst of detail (Soren, 2018). By and whole, Art Deco and Depression differ in their characteristics and their meanings as they bring unlike messages to the viewers.
of arrested individuals go on to re-offend, while 26% of those forced to leave/ separated re-offended, and 18% of those placed under counseling re-offended (Karmen, 2020). The data suggests that arrests effectively reduce re-offending rates, which goes a long way in protecting victims. As such, mandatory arrest policies requiring the police officer to arrest wherever there is probable cause that violence happened are most critical. Such laws act as effective deterrence against DV, as the data suggests.Furthermore, mandatory arrest policies place the entire burden of arrest on the police. Hence, the already traumatized victim endures less pressure concerning the arrest of their spouse, enhancing the chances of perpetrator reforms and preservation of the marriage. According to Karmen (2020), mandatory arrest policies importantly remove the immediate source of danger from home, protecting the victim. Mandatory arrests separate married couples to allow them time to reflect on their marriage and find the way forward. In many instances, the policies remove the need for retribution against the offender by the battered spouse. The offender’s removal protects both the offender and victim from further crimes and homicides. According to the National Institute of Justice, mandatory arrest laws are the most prevalent in US states, indicating a widespread agreement on their effectiveness.
In her book Doughnut Economics , Kate Raworth discusses the main aspects of the modern economy, the challenges of economic growth, and changes to be promoted in society. Despite my desire to find a purpose in economics, reading economic literature is not always easy to follow. Most books and articles contain various complex terms and definitions that confuse and frighten a novice reader. I admire the approach chosen by Raworth that differentiates her from other theorists by analyzing economics from new perspectives that can be interesting to non-economists. It is always a responsible step for me to learn the first chapters and realize if the whole book could attract my attention with time. At this moment, I got a chance to investigate the preface “Who Want to Be an Economist?” and the first chapter, “Change the Goal.” Each section has its purpose, and my major discovery is that it is necessary for modern economists to change something right now to achieve positive outcomes with time.A preface of the book is a great opportunity for me to understand the main questions raised in the book and develop several personal and professional expectations. Raworth (2017) begins her discussion by mentioning the name of an ordinary student, Yuan Yang, who decided to study economics and got frustrated about her choice soon. On the one hand, I have many questions concerning such a dubious decision to begin the book about economics with severe criticism of economic theories and education in general. Raworth (2017) states that students either “walked away from
economics or swallowed its theories whole and built a lucrative career out of their qualification” (p. 2). I think that not many individuals would like to proceed with studying the subject after such honest and provocative statements. On the other hand, I notice that the author challenges the reader and herself with the necessity to prove that economics is worth attention and research if correct priorities are set. Therefore, I wanted to continue reading the section and find out Raworth’s attitude toward economics that allowed her to create the Doughnut concept.The financial crisis, student protests, and a symbolic revolution of economics are the themes that increase my desire to continue reading. I believe that, instead of supporting the readers in their choices to study economics, Raworth (2017) deliberately underlines that it is high time to reveal confusing old ideas and replace them with new ones for inspiration. I agree with the decision to address statistical facts, including the number of people who live in poverty, unemployment issues, overpopulation, and climate change, to support her position (Raworth, 2017). I like the idea of combining environmental, social, and economic concerns to show why to study economics from a new perspective. Mentioning such economists as John Maynard Keynes, Friedrich von Hayek, and Paul Samuelson makes me surf the web and improve my background knowledge about the importance of economic history and theoretical background. At the end of this section, I learn the essence of Doughnut Economics, with seven ways to think about a modern economist. They include changing the
OutlineThe ecology of literature is very similar to humanities in that a person’s worldview directly affects everything they do. Many people disagree and believe that each worldview should be personal and not influence decisions made in a public setting. To understand literature, a reader must first try to understand the writer’s worldview because getting to know the author will help them interpret the main idea of the writing. A person’s life experience shapes their worldview and getting to know the writer and the world around them can assist in understanding and interpreting literature. Thus, humanities, the disciplines that study societies and cultures, in combination with literature, serve as conduits for the author’s values and beliefs, which helps to better understand the writer’s work and its supposed effect.IntroductionLiterature is an integral part of social life and human existence. However, it is not just an amalgam of history, cultures, creativity, and possibly, psychology. This field allows people to reach the writer’s thoughts through their words and ponder the deep meanings and lessons the author wants the reader to comprehend (Steinberg). Moreover, it can shed light on the author’s way of thinking and his perception of life and the world. Writers’ works, as a result, affect people’s perception of the world as they start to apply specific literary images to their everyday lives. Thus, literature must be discussed from a sociological point of view.The premise of human nature is likely to be affected by society and various trends since people, being social creatures, tend to mimic the behavioral patterns
of the majority. Sociological studies, therefore, claim that people are inevitably affected by what they hear and see because imitating this information is a part of the “social glue” or processing of social information. It is, therefore, logical that writers hold power to influence people and their perceptions with the help of the images they create in their writings. From a biblical sense, it can be seen how much influence the Bible has on cultures, nations, and communities (Green). Such a connection between the author and readers resembles the relationship with the Bible (Dockery). The combination of words, phrases, ideas, and images helps shape the message, which can resonate with billions of people.Consequently, the power of words and the story behind the work is among the most crucial tools. It is entirely rational to synthesize and analyze the given information in the piece of writing through the prism of the writer’s life and experience. This is necessary to dwell on such information in order to define how specific images now viewed and applied by people were created.Biographical CriticismThere are many ways to analyze a work of literature, but all of them are based on the principle that the piece of writing is interpreted through either the lens of the reader or the writer. In the first case, an individual analyzes and assesses the given information according to their own set of beliefs, opinions, or experiences. There might be many variants of interpretation of a specific phrase or piece written by the author, depending on the worldview
of a reader. However, in the second case, the main idea or message only makes sense if examined together with the author’s biography.Biographical criticism implies that the writing cannot be analyzed separately from the authors’ biography or worldview because the events taking place in their lives help decode the meaning behind the work. Therefore, taking a look into the author’s worldview allows readers to perform a critical analysis of the writing. Among the examples can be the book The prince warrior s written by Priscilla Shirer. Priscilla Shirer is an American author and Christian evangelist. Thus, it is essential to use this fact while analyzing this author’s works.The given work depicts the lives of Xavier and Evan, who, along with their friends, encounter a mysterious world, Photos. During their stay in the land, the young men battle evil and save other warriors with the help of a guide (Detwiler). While reading this book, a reader can identify specific allegories. For example, the guide that navigates the boys in their struggles and unfamiliar setting can be seen as a spiritual force or God’s help. The path of the young men can be interpreted as a battle of people on their way to the spiritual realm.Another example is the book The Lion, the Witch, and the Wardrobe , written by Lewis. In this piece of work, the author focuses on the adventure of siblings who discover the wardrobe with a path to a different world (Lewis). The path of the children is filled with struggles and encounters with
see the complete picture and possible hints or allegories of the writer. The result of this can be a wrong interpretation of the writing or a distorted version.ConclusionHence, literature is a way for writers to reach the minds and thoughts of readers. With the help of their writing, authors can share their values and ideals with people. However, deciphering the messages of the writers can be a challenging task since many writers use allusions or allegories as conduits of their ideas. As a result, it is necessary to pay attention to the writer’s background and set of beliefs. In this situation, the analysis of the author’s identity and worldview is not only the means of enriching the understanding of the text but also the tool that helps understand what effect this text should have had on the reader. Without the necessary information, the reader might not fully understand the message or create a distorted version of it.
Before the outbreak of COVID-19, Panama was one of the countries in Latin America and the Caribbean that had the strongest growth rate. Its growth performance increased at an average rate of 4.7% between 2014 and 2019 before suffering severe damage from the pandemic, leading to its labor income being reduced by 18% in 2020 (Matus et al., 2021). Panama Solidario assisted the country in maintaining its poverty rate at 14.9% instead of the estimated 18.8%, posting a rise from the initial national poverty rate, which was at 12.2% before the crisis (Matus et al., 2021). Panama’s wealth is located mainly among the high-class individuals who live in urban areas, while those who live in rural areas are six times poorer than the richer.Globally, the unemployment rate increased drastically after the COVID-19 epidemic. Panama’s unemployment rate rose from 7.07% in 2019 to 18.55% in 2020, resulting from the damage imposed by the virus outbreak (O’Neill, 2021). In 2021, it was at 10.17%, a fall from 2020 (O’Neill, 2021). The United States had an unemployment rate of about 8.3% in 2021 (O’Neill, 2021). Comparing the two countries unemployment rates, it is vividly clear that by 2020, Panama had a higher number of the labor force that did not have jobs but were currently looking for work compared to the US. Thus, the US has most of its citizens employed, making Panama worse off.Panama has its own official currency, known as the Panamanian Balboa. It has equal value to the dollar; in other words, one dollar is equivalent
only when it has a form that makes it impossible for the premises to be correct and the judgment to be wrong. According to the explained three types of deductive arguments, a valid statement does not need to have actually trustworthy premises. Still, it must have ones that, if they were accurate, would guarantee that the conclusion is proper.Example: 1. All metals are heavy 2. Tin is a metal 3. Tin is heavyA sound argument must have both a valid form and true premises. Valid arguments can be unsound, but they will have wrong assumptions.Example: 1. All dogs are cats 2. All mice are dogs 3. All mice are catsWhat makes this a valid statement is not that it has trustworthy premises and a proper conclusion but the logical necessity of the judgment, given the two assumptions. The argument would be just as valid if the premises and conclusion were wrong. However, it is essential to determine that the purpose of argumentation is to establish the truth of a judgment. An invalid argument does not achieve this goal, so it cannot be considered sound (Besnard & Hunter, 2018). A sound argument has a valid form and true premises; thus, it cannot be invalid in all cases. If the argument is invalid, then the beliefs thoroughly do not matter, and, in fact, only the conclusion remains. Therefore, this means that there is no argument in this case, especially a sound one.
The Crucible play written by Arthur Miller is a myth story of the Salem witch trials believed to rise in the Massachusetts Bay territory in 1692. The show employs apprehension of witchcraft in America that led to the increase and spread of socialism. The personalities display the destructive power of lies and corruption that preface the severe tragedy of citizens. The main aim of the story is to warn audiences about the consequences of present-day disloyalty that causes ordeal to people.The play exposes lies when Abigail talks to other girls and tells them not to admit to anything during their adventure in the forest. The experience was associated with sorcery which the people are struggling to eradicate. In addition, the characters accused each other of practicing witchcraft and finally subsidized hatred. Further, Abigail and her friend Tituba accuse various villagers of consorting to the devil hence creating suspicion in the entire community. Lack of sufficient data on such circumstances premier injustice for the plaintiff. It is crucial to convene information from various targets to prove the deceit of the convicts.In present-day society, people have distinctive beliefs regarding culture. Socialism and tribalism have increased due to the falsehoods and faiths that some communities retain mysticism. People have lost their lives while others have lost property because of these lies and ideologies. In addition, untruths have led to an increment of wedlock divorces since people have become tribal and unfaithful to their partners. Children are most affected psychologically by family disputes in the world. Parents need to execute
mindset and goals to maintain trust.Despite the allegation of graft and witchcraft in society, the justice system in Salem examined the matter and assembled enough evidence. Judge Danforth prosecutes the case by reiterating Proctor and the other accused individuals confess and later send them to jail. According to (Saragih pp.131-138), various approaches to legal justice, such as state constitutions stand adopted and applied to solve criminal activeness in the nation. The Justice system plays a crucial role in controlling citizens’ rights and freedoms. Territories have agreed to enforce measures to minimize fraud cases through court systems. Few nations that have resisted implementing corruption regulations effectively should be arraigned. The gathering of statistics from different sources to prove the conspiracy is essential in serving justice. A proper justice system in the fellowship can diminish crime and create a friendly environment for people.Deception has increased, and it has become a threat to society. People have developed misconduct to benefit unlawfully through corruption. People have lost lives and property due to deception from fraudulent individuals. It is crucial to eliminate criminality by convicting the culprits lawfully regardless of their positions. The judicial system should enforce strict laws to safeguard citizens’ rights. The leaders should formulate plans that benefit the people by increasing aid to boost citizens’ projects. Courts should congregate sufficient data before sentencing the offenders according to the law. ‘
The rapid development of Internet communication technologies requires a substantial legal base that will address all minor aspects of the line between personal data privacy and borders for governmental inspection. It appears that in addition to providing the governmental agencies all users’ information upon request, ECPA (Electronic Communications Privacy Act) allows conducting inspections in an undercover way, which violates the citizens’ rights from the First Amendment. Furthermore, several details affect the progress towards more relevant legal regulations basis for online activities.Firstly, creating a new legal base for electronic communication requires a complex approach, as due to the fast development of communication technologies, the legal base can lose its relevance in a short period. Secondly, the data communicated and stored in the online space is exposed to several threats such as hacking and theft. Moreover, Internet communications present a potential threat to society, as dangerous groups use internet communications to sell prohibited substances and weapons.The potential threat to society is generally lower under governmental supervision; however, the limitation of citizens’ privacy leads to lower levels of freedom in the country and poor protection of citizens’ safety. While the failure to gain private information about citizens can decrease the safety levels, the prohibition of gag orders will allow the citizens to be aware of the state’s interference in their personal information. In addition, people who deliberately pose a threat to society generally can use different kinds of untraceable communication. Thus, it is essential to include the warrants for state inspections in the new legal basis to deprive the
The companies should protect consumer rights more actively as due to legislative process complications, there is no hope for ECPA revisions in the nearest time. The company’s primary goal is to protect the customers’ interests and rights provided by the First Amendment, as customers’ support ensures the media companies’ income. With the growth of cloud technologies and the widespread use of servers in other countries for data storage, the US government is already experiencing trouble acquiring data from big companies. If the current legal base is not reviewed in the nearest future, the companies will start using more servers in other countries to guarantee privacy for their customers. Therefore, either way, the government will inevitably face the consequences of the ECPA revisions and potentially lose access to critical information that will decrease the citizens’ safety.
AnalysisIt is important to note that electronic health record systems and related healthcare data collection instruments are highly effective tools, which can improve the nursing practice by assisting nursing professionals as well as improving patient outcomes. Therefore, relevant policies should be implemented in order to enhance the general process of nursing care, and the given assessment will primarily propose a policy for a specific situation, which is drug administration. The policy is based on making electronic health records or EHR systems a sole platform for drug administration, medication monitoring, treatment adherence, and substance abuse screening conducted by nursing professionals in order to advance the evidence-based practice or EBP into EHR.EBP in EHROne should be aware that there is a major need to integrate core EBP elements into EHR. It is stated that “delays in moving new EBP practice changes into the EHR are significant. These delays are sources of frustration and job dissatisfaction” (Chipps et al., 2020, p. 136). The same research also identifies that five themes, which act as a barrier for EBP and EHR merging, are EBP is not a primary goal, structure of an organization and its governance, EHR change prioritization, limited ability of nurses to change EHR, and delays and wait times (Chipps et al., 2020). In other words, the tool is not utilized to its fullest extent, and thus, the tool can be evaluated as poorly related to EBP, but giving more freedom to nurses can facilitate the merge.Work Setting and Strategic PlanThe current work setting in EHR can also be
evaluated as limited, where there are potential risks for patient safety, such as copy and paste practice. It is stated that “copy and paste can promote note bloat, internal inconsistencies, error propagation, and documentation in the wrong patient chart” (Lehmann et al., 2017, p. 12). In other words, the current EHR capabilities undermine the core principles of EBP, which can be even more problematic in regard to drug administration. In addition, EBP information used in drug administration is of paramount importance, and the current state of EHR is indicative of the fact that it is not realized to its fullest capability since nursing professionals can use EHR for all drug-related practices as well as evidence-based use of data, such as screening (Alemi et al., 2018).Efficient Workflows, Interprofessional Care, and Patient SatisfactionA thorough analysis of EHR reveals that there is a need for its optimization in order to improve workflows since many essential functions, especially for nurses, are poorly available or unavailable. For example, the copy and paste option is a prime example of how drug administration and recording can be prone to errors due to a lack of ways to identify which parts are copied and which are inserted manually (Lehmann et al., 2017). Interprofessional care can also be enhanced in order to improve, which is even more relevant in nursing since the communicative element of EHR is critical for promoting EBP principles of care, which can lead to better patient outcomes and satisfaction due to orderly and timely care delivery (McGonigle & Mastrian, 2018).In conclusion,
innocence become a prevalent theme at the end of the poem and will be especially vital in understanding the thematic analysis of both works by the author.The second poem, also by Szymborska, Hitler’s First Photograph , provides various imagery of Hitler as a newborn and is heavily contrasted by allusions to his future as a dictator and contributor to a genocide. The poem suggests uncertainty through statements that wonder if Hitler could have been a doctor, priest, or worked at the Opera House in Vienna (Szymborska, lines 3-7). Only his present as a child is known in the poem that creates an illusion of the past. Hitler as a newborn is referred to as a little boy with teensy hands, a little angel, and a lucky fortune. Szymborska recalls how no omen of death or signs of the future prior to his birth were visible (line 13), which supports her thesis that no person is born evil. The normalcy of Hitler’s youth is supported through images of him being alike with other children in family albums and prone to regular child-like behaviors of crying when waiting too long for the photographer to take a picture.
Sula is a novel by Nobel Prize-winning author Toni Morrison, written in 1973. It is an African American literary fiction that reveals deep concepts of love, morality, and moral principles. The novel has some symbolic elements through which the author reveals one’s outlook on life. A characteristic feature of the novel is duality in some aspects; for example, some die from drowning and some from a fire. Due to such techniques, Toni Morrison was able to accomplish the novel’s purpose of conveying the duality of the world. The double structure of the novel, along with its end, symbolizes the optimistic aspect due to the representation of sincerity, important values of life, and the deep meaning of the “circles of sorrow”.One may notice the representation of the duality of the world, namely good and evil, and at the end of the novel, despite all the previous events, the sincere impulse of Sula’s friend formulates a culmination. Thus, one may notice a strong Nel’s reaction: “It was a fine cry—loud and long—but it had no bottom, and it had no top, just circles and circles of sorrow” (Morrison, 79). Namely, this event implies Nel’s duality of emotions, since all the time, the hero seemed to miss Jude, Nel’s husband. However, in a burst of sincere sadness at the end of the novel, Nel realizes that the melancholy is caused by the time spent without Sula. Just like all the citizens of the city, that would seem that they hate Sula. However, no one realized that the heroine was
the reason for their solidarity.Duality is also represented in the novel’s symbol, namely the mole above Sula’s eye. The change in the mole’s appearance symbolizes the heroine’s maturity and the gradual rejection of social conventions. In turn, it is also the opposite feature of Nel’s character, which accepts all the norms. Further, there was an ambivalent perception of the mole by different characters: Nel thought it was a rose, representing love, feminine beauty, and friendship. Jude perceived it as deceit and seduction, that is, dual and opposite to Nel. Thus, the author was able to express the ambiguity of the world and material and non-material things. In addition, Toni Morison was able to immerse the reader in the idea that the perception of things largely depends on how one sees them.The duality of the novel also characterizes the end of the book, which at first glance seems tragic. The heroine’s death, sadness, tears, and depressive impulse do not seem to belong to an optimistic perception. However, the author’s main motive was to display a ray of light in the form of a sincere outburst of love and friendship through Nel’s sadness. This formulates the circles of sadness: the first, implicit, displayed in the entire storyline. Namely, all the negative events and the environment of the heroes: connection with husbands, difficult living conditions, and the murder of children by the mother. Finally, the second obvious circle of sadness symbolizes the main aspects of human life, namely sincerity, self-sacrifice, love, and friendship. All this was expressed in a
The story of the extreme rise and the following fall of the Enron Corporation still interests many people. Not everyone is aware of all the circumstances and factors that affected the company’s struggle, and only some people know how many resources, including places and people, were involved in the corporation. The record-breaking bankruptcy of “the seventh largest company in the United States and the sixth largest energy company in the world” was surprising for the society (The Nigerian Professional Accountant, n.d., para. 2). This company was founded in 1985, and its first year in the market was already characterized by a huge loss and an enormous amount of debt. However, thanks to the changes in American governmental policy related to the natural gas industry operations, Enron managed to rise. Now, it is necessary to analyze this case and evaluate the fatal mistakes that the corporation made.There is an extended number of different theories and assumptions about the reasons that Enron struggled and then filed for bankruptcy. First, the projects that the corporation invested in turned out to be too risky and failed, which resulted in the inability of Enron to pay its debts (The Nigerian Professional Accountant, n.d.). Other issues like abuse of accounting and utilization of SPEs to hide the corporation debt added to the major problem that may be defined as an identity crisis. As noticed by researchers, there were two ideological systems that competed and dictated how Enron was supposed to function (The Nigerian Professional Accountant, n.d.).The first ideology, known as the asset-light strategy, was supported by Jeffrey Skilling, while Rebecca Mark was a proponent of asset-rich infrastructure development philosophy. Both leaders could not agree on whether the return on investments was a long-term process. Their actions were too different and competing, but many projects in which Mark invested large amounts of money failed later, adding to the corporation’s huge debt. Overall, this disagreement is the main reason why the Enron Corporation has been struggling for many years.
In his text entitled “The Entitlement Theory”, the philosopher Robert Nozick speculates on a truly just economic structure in the ideal form of the state. Nozick focuses on the issue of property, its transfer and ratification, offering a model for claiming just entitlement (Vaughn, 2019). Real justice, according to Nozick, consists in the appropriation of holdings or their original acquisition, their fair and consensual transfer and the protection of the right to their property.According to the principle of fair acquisition, people can take possession of property if they do not take it from others and do not worsen the situation of others in the process. The principle of fair transfer implies the right to donate property or voluntarily exchange it. Nozick imagines a world in which free exchange will abolish the existence of a value-currency intermediary – that is, the needs of people will be perceived as primary in the exchange of goods. The principle of ratification implies that a person who has unfairly taken possession of a holding is obliged to return it to the owner. According to Nozick, no one except the owners mentioned in the first two principles has the right to property. The author finds a fair transfer of property only in those cases when the property was originally acquired fairly and all subsequent stages in its transfer are the same.The author calls this principle of fair distribution historical, in which it is through the circumstances or actions of acquisition that one can judge the fairness of the possession of a thing. Borrowing from John Locke’s principle of the self-property of people, Nozick says that people represent a set of talents that belong to them. Combining these talents with the surrounding world, they can encroach on the acquisition of part of this world by agreement, that is, to acquire property.
The Alabama State constitution strives to provide and protect a wide array of citizens’ rights. Most notably, some of these rights are replicated in the American Bill of Rights. Like the American Bill of Rights, the Alabama State constitution is equally detailed and has different sections that are dedicated to enhancing and protecting citizens’ liberties. The standout element within the Alabama State constitution regarding the protection of rights is the freedom of speech. Within the Bill of Rights, The First Amendment guards the citizens’ freedom of speech as it enables them to not only express themselves through speech but also via protest groups (Weinberger, 2019). The Alabama State constitution echoes similar sentiment as Section 4 prevents the development of any laws that would curtail the citizens’ freedom of speech. To this end, the Alabama State constitution supports the Bill of Rights and emphasizes protecting the freedom of speech for the citizenry.Both the Fourteenth Amendment and Equal Rights Amendment deal with a similar concept of discrimination. On the one hand, the Fourteenth Amendment was adopted to prevent former slaves from discrimination. Subsequently, black persons who had been formerly enslaved were conferred equal before the law (Young, 2018). On the other hand, the Equal Rights Amendment is an extrapolation of the Fourteenth Amendment as it guarantees equal treatment of all American citizens irrespective of their gender. At the time of its writing, women were often considered second-class citizens and were faced with numerous legal restrictions (Bleiweis, 2020). Therefore, while both the Fourteenth Amendment and Equal Rights Amendment were developed to target discrimination, their scope of application in terms of the people they covered differed as they were based on race and gender, respectively.
IntroductionPeoples’ behaviors and decisions are often the central scope of sociological inquiry. Flint (Michigan) water crisis can be seen as an illustration of such decisions and behaviors that have led to severe issues with multiple implications. To understand the causes of the crisis and ways to prevent such problems in the future, it is possible to employ the Marxist approach. The class concept of this paradigm best fits into the analysis of the situation as a conflict between two major groups is apparent.Flint (Michigan): DemographicsIn the middle of the twentieth century Flint (Michigan) was a rapidly developing and prosperous city that hosted such giants as General Motors. However, in the 1980s, the town started to degrade due to the severe oil crisis that hit the automotive industry (Pauli, 2020). The city saw tremendous demographic shifts because thousands of people left searching for better employment and living conditions. At present, the city’s population is slightly over 96 thousand people (Data USA, 2021). The majority of residents are Black, and a third is White. The poverty rate is relatively high and reached 39% in 2020, while the median age is quite low (35,5 years). These figures suggest that the socio-economic situation in Flint is alarming, and significant changes are needed.Water Crisis in Flint (Michigan)The crisis started in 2014, and officials in collaboration and supervision of the public and scientists could not solve it until 2019. In 2014, officials had to change the water source due to the difficulties with maintaining the existing infrastructure (Krings et al., 2018). No
rapid measures to improve the infrastructure were implemented. The same year, people addressed officials due to their dissatisfaction with water quality, which remained unattained. After several studies and data publications regarding extreme violation of water quality standards (high lead level, harmful bacteria), the officials were forced to take action. As a result, pipes were replaced, and the necessary improvement to the infrastructure was made with the help of the federal budget funds.Water Crisis in Flint (Michigan): CausesOne of the central issues that caused the crisis was the city’s constraints related to infrastructure. Flint’s budget could hardly ensure proper maintenance of pipes and other infrastructure components (Pauli, 2020). Due to the economic situation in the city, the public had less control over the actions and decisions of an emergency manager and Governor Rick Snyder. Residents addressed the authorities, but their claims received little attention as the authorities concentrated on the economic development of the city rather than public health or safety.Flint Water Crisis: Social Concept AppliedWhen addressing the causes of the crisis, it is necessary to apply the concept of class. Although various scholars note that class is a subjective construct created for analytical purposes, this notion is a relevant component of population stratification (Neilson, 2017). People identify with a particular group, such as workers (proletariat) or big business owners (bourgeoisie). In Flint, this stratification is relevant as there is almost no middle class. Apparently, officials concentrated on the needs of big businesses rather than workers.Marxist Theory: ClassAccording to the Marxist theory of class, human society is
mainly divided into the proletariat (laborers) and bourgeoisie (those who usurp laborers’ resources). The former are working people with little resources as they are taken over by the rich (Neilson, 2017). These two groups are in constant conflict, and their resolution can be achieved by revolution. The revolution can be implemented peacefully in terms of the coalition with a part (minority) of bourgeois and proletariat or due to violent struggle. Marx believed in the victory of the proletariat and the establishment of communism with its justice and proper distribution of resources.Marxist Perspective Regarding the CrisisIn the situation in Flint, the officials took the side of the bourgeoisie, paying no attention to potential outcomes. Authorities made some decisions to allocate funds to boost the development of the economy supporting business. However, the proletariat was the class deprived of higher living standards as poor people had to live in older communities with old water pipes contaminated considerably. Water was the resource that became central to the conflict between the two classes. Proletariat won the struggle, which could be explained by the success of the peaceful revolution with the coalition of workers and some part of business owners.Marxist Perspective Regarding the Crisis (Social Concepts)The discussion of the crisis from the Marxist theory of class perspective makes it possible to take a closer look at such concepts as civil society and race. Civil society is regarded as a construct bringing society to balance and ensuring that all groups’ interests are addressed (Neilson, 2017). Race is another social concept that can
the big business struggled for resources. However, workers, unemployed people, small business owners, big business owners, officials, scientists, and others were communicating and collaborating. These interactions helped the groups solve an issue that had adverse effects on all of them.ConclusionMarxist and Bourdieu’s perspectives can be both applied to analyze the Flint Water crisis. It becomes clear that classes are objective constructions, although they are not clear-cut. Workers, entrepreneurs, big business owners, merchants, scientists, and employees have diverse interests, and they may sometimes be in conflict. However, the needs of people pertaining to different groups can be achieved by collaborating. The Flint Water Crisis is an illustration of the conflict and its resolution. Although the focus was initially on the interest of businesses and economic growth at the expense of public health, people managed to force officials to make the right choices and address the water issue. The representative of different classes and clusters of society formed the civil society that became the power bringing the solution. The authorities had to implement appropriate measures to solve the problem. It is clear that civil society can be a supervisory force to ensure that officials make proper decisions.
The four goals of anti-bias education are forming identity, promoting diversity, teaching justice, and fostering activism. Identity formation presupposes that each child sees himself or herself as an individuum who associates himself with a certain family group. Diversity presupposes learning to respect differences between individuals and cultures. Teaching justice means teaching children to understand where wrong is done and to behave respectfully to all people (Derman-Sparks & Edwards, 2019). Activism is about educating children to be self-confident and not afraid to speak out for themselves. These goals are valuable since they allow us to educate people who will respect others, be responsible for their actions, and be ready to call attention to the wrongs that are done.The challenges of anti-bias education are making children behave respectfully even to those individuals they may not like, overcoming shyness in class, and teaching them to differentiate between right and wrong. When I was a child, I was very shy and it was a challenge for me to speak out for myself. What helped me to cope was the friendly atmosphere created in class and the respect for differences instilled in us by our teacher.Sometimes teachers can be biased too and not realize it. Some teachers may give better marks to students they like and worse marks to those they do not. Some teachers believe that introverted students keep silent because they do not know anything. It is important to recognize and mitigate these biases since they often limit educational opportunities for children. To combat biases one should put oneself in the place of other people, look at the world from their position and consider all possible options. The whole society benefits from combating biases as people become more tolerant towards each other.
Aristotle made a discovery fundamental to all logic by introducing variables. Thus, it was shown that logic is not just a specific doctrine of specific things or terms, but the science of the laws of syllogisms, such as modus ponens or modus tollens, expressed in variables. Studying various judgments, formal logic abstracts from their specific content, revealing a structure common to objects of different content.Syllogism is the discovery of Aristotle and is the main and most original part of his logic. In the theory of syllogisms, Aristotle defined syllogism and distinguished its types, defined working and non-working types of syllogisms, and established three figures of syllogism. I find it particularly interesting that Aristotle was the first to make reasoning methods the subject of scientific research. He introduced the methods of reasoning as integral formations and not just certain reasoning components. Everything that was done in logic before Aristotle just attempted to understand individual methods and principles without any systematization and unification into a single coherent system. Thus, such concepts as Modus ponens and Modus tollens laid the foundation for understanding the definition of the truth of thinking. Thus, I am amazed at how accurately Aristotle introduced the concepts of conclusions that approach science by the rules of inference, the laws of contradiction, and the exclusion of the third.Modern logic as an independent field of knowledge arose from such different sciences as philosophy and mathematics. Being indeed a highly advanced concept, modern logic, however, lacks some characteristic philosophical features – it is more straightforward and technical. Modern logic is often called mathematical logic, thereby emphasizing the originality of its new methods compared to those used previously. In this sense, it is of less interest for discussion because it relies on exact sciences and computer technologists and avoids ambiguity. Thus, modern logic is built on artificial language and intelligence, which in itself is rather boring compared to traditional concepts.
IntroductionThe study of philosophy boosts a person’s problem-solving skills and opens one’s imagination to aspects of life beyond material science. Philosophical skills allow scholars to examine ideas, definitions, arguments, and issues that directly affect the perception of life (Blanshard 12). Such skills add to the ability to organize thoughts and concerns, cope with matters of worth, and extract what is vital from vast volumes of information. Through its demands on intellectual engagement, philosophy contributes significantly to the educational endeavor. This essay is based on the theme that philosophy is crucial as it opens the scholar’s mind in higher education to world views on thought frequency, vibration, and energy. In higher education, philosophy entails becoming acquainted with significant figures and improvements in antiquity, mastering current techniques, and accepting philosophical issues. Exposure to the concepts in philosophy helps scholars develop critical, analytic, and observational abilities that may be considered the most valuable in the greater scheme of life.Fundamental Traits of a PhilosopherPhilosophy makes a critical contribution to achieving four criteria that should be foundational to any institute of higher learning. The foundational skills include instilling basic thought patterns in students and improving their text interpretation, writing, and good communication skills. These skills are essential in developing cultural identities and encouraging scholars to engage critical questions about reality, knowledge, and relevance (Rick 583). Specific fundamental traits make a scholar a good philosopher ready to engage in constructive arguments that shape decisions in daily life. The most common characteristics include open-mindedness, skepticism, and a systemic thinking approach.Open-MindednessOpen-mindedness is one of
or dependability of these statements by inquiring about the principles upon which they are founded or what they genuinely establish. A critical mindset will aid the scholar in requiring a rationale for the ethical claims of others. Additionally, the scholar will eschew appeals to authority in favor of considering all perspectives.Systemic Approach to ThinkingA good paradigmatic philosopher must also show signs of systemic thinking in their approach to issues in life. Consistent with systems philosophy, systems thinking is concerned with comprehending a system by examining the relationships and interactions between the system’s constituent pieces. Systems thinking is especially beneficial when confronted with complicated or wicked problems (Blanshard 12). In philosophy, systems thinking better predicts future outcomes based on a deeper grasp of the surrounding structure and its constituents than on previous occurrences. A few philosophers have demonstrated some of these trains, including Socrates, a Greek philosopher from Athens credited with establishing Western philosophy.Argumentative Case for SocratesSocrates emerges as a paradigmatic scholar who understands philosophy as applying logic and reason to pursue knowledge. According to Socrates, such knowledge may be gained by contact with the surrounding (Blanshard 22). Socrates established that philosophy is concerned with the topic of investigation, even though such a study seldom understands the subject. Plato’s Socratic dialogues demonstrate that philosophy is a process of self-examination, examination of other aspects of life, and recognition of known limitations.
IntroductionI selected the Gardens by the Bay because of their unique design and Singapore’s innovation to develop a city within a garden. The buildings also posit a potential future that entails integration between nature and urbanization, showcasing the possibility for future generations to coexist with flora (PMP, 2022). Its beautiful design and elegant structures also have an aesthetic pull that motivated me to research their architect and inspiration for making them. Before taking this class, I knew about the Gardens by the Bay; however, my knowledge was limited to their location and accolades collected over the years.Architect and their Motivation to Carry out the WorkThe Gardens by the Bay were designed by two firms working in tandem, the Wilkinson Eyre Architects and Grant Associates. When the Supertrees are lit at night, they look like cocktail glasses. The structures’ lead design director, Andrew Grant, claimed he drew inspiration for this form after visiting his brother in Australia and going to the Valley of the Giants. He saw aerial walkways that permeate a canopy of tingle and karri trees (PMP, 2022). Additionally, it is important to consider the influence of Singapore’s national flower, the orchid. This master plan emphasizes the beauty of these flowers via the exotic gardens while expressing their physiology via the structures’ distinct infrastructure to manage water, energy, and waste. It is also important to consider Singapore’s motivation for this attraction as it involved plans to create a ‘city in a garden, raising the life quality through intricate flora and greenery in the city.Form and
FunctionIt is Singapore’s national garden and a leading horticultural attraction for its citizens and international visitors. The gardens are a showpiece of garden and horticulture artistry, illustrating a novel way to view the plant kingdom. They integrate nature and urban living, intertwined in a mutually beneficial way (Gardens by the Bay, 2022). Additionally, the Gardens by the Bay was developed as a form of entertainment while it educates visitors on plants that many people around the Asiatic region rarely see. It combines plant species from cool regions, temperate climates, tropical habitats, and forests. The Gardens by the Bay is the world’s largest garden with supertrees.Personal Reaction to this WorkThe Gardens by the Bay is one of the world’s most unique and environmentally-friendly structures. The supertrees mimic ecological functions, using technology to illustrate similar properties as plant photosynthesis (Gardens by the Bay, 2022). The structures collect rainwater, further illustrating the impressive commitment by Singapore to protect the environment. Its choice to plant exotic plants in an education-designed attraction is also a noble feat. While the country gains monetary value for its structures, it helps protect some plant species and elicits interest in younger generations about the beauty of diversity. The exotic plants help individuals in the region glimpse the natural greenery and horticulture in other places; few locations can boast of attempting such a feat.Influence on the Work’s View based on Architect Knowledge and Structures’ UseThe structures’ use in Singapore has a major influence on how I view the Gardens by the Bay. Additionally, I do not
Kaplan analyzes the portrayal of women in a film using Laura Mulvey’s The Male Gaze theory and psychoanalysis. Kaplan argues that historically women have only been the focus of attention in the melodrama genre, and while melodrama exposes the limitations that the family places on women, it also forces women to accept those limitations as inevitable and normal. Kaplan argues that culture is deeply rooted in male and female dominance-submission patterns. The male gaze calls for a sexual, political gaze and offers a sexualized way of looking that empowers men and objectifies women. In the male gaze, a woman is visually positioned as an object of heterosexual male desire. Her feelings, thoughts, and sexual desires are less important than her framing of male desire.The Postman Always Rings Twice (1946) is a famous example of the male gaze. The viewer is introduced to the main character of the film, Cora Smith, focusing on her sexuality. Indeed, the viewer knows that Cora is sexy even before knowing her name. Using close-ups, the camera forces the viewer to look at Cora’s body. It creates a way of looking that is sexy and connected to the point of view of the male protagonist. In terms of contemporary examples, the Transformers film series (2006–2014) presents women as desirable sex objects.Filmmakers often try to avoid portraying female characters as just sex objects by giving them complex backstories, strong motivations, and an active role in the plot of their story. However, the male gaze is still common. Catwoman in The Dark Knight Rises (2012) has important personal motivations, but she is still clearly there to be looked at.
The Grand Canyon is one of the most grandiose sightseeing spots in the world. It took quite some time to discover and explore this natural work of art due to the structure’s immense size. Over time, the Grand Canyon became one of the symbols of the United States and the State of Arizona in particular. It is crucial to investigate the past of the Grand Canyon in order to realize its potential and see how this natural wonder could affect human lives beyond traveling and sightseeing. The current paper will conduct a thorough study of three articles on the topic of the Grand Canyon to validate that idea.First, it must be noted that the history and culture of Americans living in the area are directly connected to the Grand Canyon. For example, Sara Maverick suggested that the rich human history could not be left behind since Native American tribes and numerous miners and archaeologists visited and explored the Grand Canyon throughout the years (“The Grand Canyon,” 2022). Maverick talked about how the Anasazi became one of the biggest groups to populate the Grand Canyon in an attempt to protect themselves from nomads. Nevertheless, it is believed that a severe drought has forced the Anasazi to leave their houses carved inside the Grand Canyon (“The Grand Canyon,” 2022). The rich history of mining also haunts this natural wonder to this day, as some of the mines located in the Grand Canyon produced silver, copper, and uranium oxide.Conversely, one should pay attention to the geological history of the
author is JK McKnight, who created Art of Impact to genuinely engage Gen Z and millennials by positively impacting their lives and communities. He founded the Forecastle Festival, a three-day celebration of music, art, and environmental activity. The article was published on December 3, 2021, on Lane Report, a website that specializes in business news (McKnight, 2021). The paper’s target audience is employers interested in having Gen Z and millennials working for them. McKnight wrote the article when most workers were leaving jobs they could not enjoy. At the same time, the pandemic situation contributed to this because when employees returned from isolation, they felt exhausted and dissatisfied with their careers (McKnight, 2021). This factor caused most of the workers, especially Gen Z and Millennials, to begin searching for jobs where they could satisfy their desires.It is significant to mention that the purpose of the article is to inform employers about which factors can encourage the younger generation to work for their company. McKnight has also included some essential advice that is beneficial to recruiters. The author’s central thesis is that there are changes in the workplace now, and successful employers should conform to the major trends in order to retain workers (McKnight, 2021). The article completely achieves the purpose of informing employers of the processes and steps that need to be implemented to ensure that work satisfies the expectations and desires of employees.
IntroductionA large portion of different societies is structured and administered according to a set of rules, ethics, morality, and laws. Interestingly, when ancient civilizations evolved, they depended on rules and codes to maintain order throughout the empire. The Code of Hammurabi, written on stole stele and clay tablets, was the earliest written system of laws, consisting of 282 enshrined rules. The set of legislation was coined by Hammurabi (r. 1795-1750 BCE), the Babylonian monarch who invaded and subsequently governed ancient Mesopotamia. The codes are considered to have had a significant impact on the lives of Babylonians, spanning from political significance, ensuring fairness, economic significance, as well family and criminal legislation.Justice and ProsperityThe codes have acted as an inspiration for creating justice in various civilizations. Hammurabi had a broad view of justice for all people. In conclusion to The Code, he claimed, “The great gods have summoned me, and I am certainly a shepherd who is bringing peace and whose sceptre is righteous.” While attempting to address future leaders, The Code asserts in the epilogue: May the ruler selected in the land examine the just words I have carved on my monument for a long time to come. As an element of the idea of justice, Hammurabi also asserts that he would defend the vulnerable against injustice by the strong.As a portion of his idea of equality and justice, prosperity is addressed. When Hammurabi asserts that he has provided “wealth to the population forever,” he is talking about welfare concerning economic prosperity and the well-being of his
people. However, considering the focus dedicated to private ownership, contracts, salaries, and markets, it is possible to argue that Hammurabi was interested in the economic challenges of the Babylonians. Thus, Hammurabi sought to create an institutional framework appropriate for economic growth by prioritizing prosperity alongside justice.Recognition of Economic ActorsAgriculture and international trading was the primary activity in Hammurabi’s domain. The Code relates to merchants acting via an agency in international commerce instead of themselves. The merchants fulfilled specific tasks of banking in the Babylonian economic system. One component of banking is receiving deposits and serving as custodians of these funds. For example, in order to deposit expensive items such as silver and gold, The Code requires that an agreement be written out in the company of witnesses. According to law 122 of The Code, if a man intends to offer gold or silver to a man for safe custody, he must present whatever he provides to witnesses. Similar to today’s legal system, The Code establishes the necessity of witnesses and unbiased judges. The law makes it apparent that there can be no viable claim without an agreement or a witness.Recognition of Private PropertyAccordingly, The Code recognizes private ownership in the sense of land and personal assets. In the absence of private property laws and their execution, the Babylonian economy, with its agents, merchants, and landowner-cultivators, could not operate. Violations of property rights carried severe punishments, including the death penalty. According to Law six, if a man steals something belonging to a deity or a kingdom, he
should be sentenced to death, as shall everyone who receives the stolen stuff from his hands. The law makes no difference between an innocent recipient of stolen goods and a knowing recipient of stolen things. The death penalty is sentenced to both the offender and the recipients of stolen items.Enslaved people were considered property under The Code, and enslavers’ privileges were vigorously enforced. Law 15 specifies that if a man allows an enslaved person or slave girl from a palace to escape, he should be sentenced to death. The Babylonian society considered robbery attempts as a grave offence. According to Law 21, if a man breaks into a house, he should be put to death and hanged. Additionally, firefighters who attempted to seize the assets of the fire victims were also sentenced to death. According to Law 25, if a fire breaks out in a man’s house and the individual who goes to extinguish takes an item from the house, that man should be flung into the flames. Thus, it is apparent that The Code regarded property rights breaches seriously and punished them with the death penalty in most cases. Hammurabi’s Code establishes particular punishments for various offences, as with modern laws.Sanctity of ContractsThe Code and various clay tablets and stele from the Hammurabi period demonstrate that no transaction was deemed legal without a documented contract. Once the agreement was signed, all parties were obligated to abide by its provisions. Any infringement was subject to dire consequences or sanctioning. According to Law 36, a chieftain’s farm,
garden, and residence cannot be sold. These are comparable to feudal estates in that they are bestowed by the monarch in exchange for royal service and are thus permanent in the sense that they cannot be auctioned. If someone purchases these properties, they will incur a financial loss. According to Law 37, if a man purchases the field, plantation, or home of a runner, his transaction is void, and he loses his money; the field and plantation. Strict conditions of agreement control the relationship between the landowner and the tenants.Economic Value of ChildrenThe Code places emphasis on the economic value of having children. The Code presumes that marriage is for the intent of childbearing. This is evident when The Code permits a man to wed another lady if his first wife is barren. It was also usual for a childless mother to acquire a slave-girl for the partner to conceive children. Law 145 states that if a man has married a woman and fails to supply him with boys, he should marry a slave-girl and accept her into his home. Law 147 is clear about the role of the slave-girl in giving birth to boys. The law reads that if she fails to give birth to boys, the man’s first wife may sell her. 15 Children were meant to have economic worth, given the Babylonian economy’s agricultural predominance. For upper-class landowners, sons were likely sought not for their work but for their assistance in administering the estate and subsequently as successors to the inheritance.Concept of EquityThe
Code puts focus on equity as well as price fairness. Law 108 is an illustration of the equity principle. The law reads that if an alewife refuses to receive grain in exchange for liquor but takes silver by the heavyweight, they must condemn her and hurl her into the water. The Code anticipates that farmers would be cash-strapped between planting and harvesting but will have significant free time to spend at the pub. Additionally, as stated in the Preface, The Code ensures that the powerful do not abuse the weak. This is evident in how it establishes compensation responsibilities for people who suffer losses, orphans, and widows.Upon the demise of her spouse, the widow is obliged to the dowry and any agreement he made for her. Law 171 specifies the first wife to retain her bride prize and the settlements her husband allocated to her in writing on a tablet and reside in her husband’s residence. Law 172 goes a step farther in protecting the widow against her sons’ plans. If her spouse does not form an agreement with her, they are required by law to make good on her dowry and give her a share of her husband’s assets equivalent to an heir. If her sons continue to persecute her to force her out of the dwelling, the judges shall arbitrate her case and impose a sanction on the sons; that lady shall not leave her husband’s home. Similar to today’s court system, Hammurabi’s Code establishes the procedure for conducting trials. Hammurabi ensured that widows
and orphans were protected with this set of inheritance rules. What’s remarkable is that Hammurabi achieved his purpose of protecting the vulnerable through inheritance rules, not welfare state programs.Control of PriceGiven that The Code is a mirror of the Babylonian system, it is reasonable to conclude that the Babylonian economy operated under stringent control under Hammurabi. Law 215 establishes a fixed charge for doctors and surgeons. In it, it is stated that a surgeon who saves the life of a free man by making a deep incision in his body with a blade of bronze is entitled to ten shekels of silver. However, the charge is determined by the patient’s social hierarchy position. Five shekels are required of a free man, while an enslaver is required to pay two shekels for an enslaved person.The Code, on the other hand, penalizes medical negligence severely. According to Law 218, if a surgeon makes a deep cut in a person’s body with a bronze blade and provokes the person’s death, they must amputate his forearm. As a result, a surgeon who has been found convicted of malpractice will be unable to continue with the profession. If the victim is enslaved, on the other hand, the punishment towards the surgeon is less harsh. It is not restitution but rather compensation for a discrepancy in type. Suppose an enslaved person dies while under the surgeon’s care; the slave will be replaced by the surgeon. If a surgeon accidentally removes the eye of an enslaved person, the physician is liable for half
In this chapter, Joseph Campbell writes about the significance of female figures in the adventures of heroes. More specifically, he states that “The Lady of the House of Sleep is a familiar figure in fairy tale and myth” (Campbell, 2004, p. 101). This claim means that the narrative would be incomplete without such a character, and the men would not be motivated to pursue their goals in adventures in the absence of ladies. Indeed, the end target is essential for overcoming hardships on the way, and the granted reward should be comparable to the challenges. Hence, the thesis confirms that the specified characteristic of heroic stories is one of the cornerstones of the narrative of this type.In order to support this standpoint, the author puts this quote in the context of popular legends. For this objective, he traces the origin of this approach from the ancient Irish oral tradition and, more specifically, “the tale of the Prince of the Lonesome Isle and the Lady of Tubber Tintye” (Campbell, 2004, p. 101). This method helps him determine the common elements of all similar literary works and, consequently, underpin his suggestions with credible evidence. In this case, these components include the challenges one faces to make them start a journey, the detailed description of hardships on the way, and the ultimate victory, accompanied by meeting a beautiful woman.Considering the context and the general meaning of the quote, it can be stated that the selected phrase implies the presence of similarities in all fairy tales and myths across different
The immigration stations of Ellis Island and Angel Island are sites with great historical significance. Until this day, these places keep stories of millions of immigrants that passed through the doors of the stations between 1880 and 1930. In this period, Ellis Island was the largest and the busiest immigration station for people coming to the USA, mostly from Europe. It was interesting for me to learn that many women were detained by the Ellis Island officials, as before World War II, women were not allowed to enter the country without men. It was also interesting to learn that since 1907 children under 16 were not allowed to enter the country without a parent. Those who arrived at Ellis Island alone were sent back to their home countries. People who did not pass medical inspection were also sent back home from the station.It seems astonishing to me that the station officials managed to inspect so many immigrants daily. The photos and video footages that have been preserved in the archives of the station show that the number of people passing through was incredibly high. Another fact that seemed interesting to me is that the station officials could separate children from their parents if they did not believe that they were, in fact, related. For example, when Lucy Attarian recalls the day she and her family were passing the inspection at Ellis Island, the official did not believe that she was related to her parents. 1 Her hair and general appearance were different from theirs, and the
The global pandemic has severely influenced the typical style of living people were used to before the strike of the harmful virus. The research paper focuses on the mental repercussions of the infection on students in Saudi Arabia. To be more precise, the authors aimed to investigate whether the transition to a new lifestyle due to the pandemic has impacted the anxiety levels of university youth.Naturally, the researchers needed to convey practical analysis to obtain data to form conclusions regarding the alterations in anxiety levels among students. That is why Khoshaim et al. (2020) surveyed 400 students from different universities on an online platform, asking the participants about their mental state and whether they noticed any changes in their behavior or perception because of COVID-19. It seems significant to mention that questionnaires were sent to the youth from March to June in 2020, which is the pandemic’s peak around the globe (Khoshaim et al., 2020). Still, Khoshaim et al. (2020) concluded that 35% of the surveyed students were suffering from moderate or extreme anxiety, which severely complicated the course of their studies. By and large, this research is focused on an important topic, considering that students are still affected by the changes to global education as a result of COVID-19.Unfortunately, the results of this research cannot be claimed to be reliable as the students could experience anxiety due to different reasons that could not be omitted in their answers to the online questionnaire. Still, this work is a solid foundation for further studies with more narrowed scopes that could investigate the mental issues among the youth as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic and the following restrictions. In addition, the government can use the obtained data to assist students in overcoming their anxiety to enhance their academic performance and well-being.
In the modern world, when all countries are closely interacting with each other, such events as war can have a significant impact on the global economy. Even though the Russian invasion has just started, it has already caused a number of economic issues. The major problems include the increasing transportation costs and disruption of the global supply chain. Also, since Russia is considered to have one of the most substantial cyber warfare capabilities, worldwide cyber aggression may become a major economic threat.In the present moment, the main concern for the global economy is the disruption of supply chains that are caused by Russia engaging in the war. Russian suppliers are distributed all around the globe. More than 2100 the U.S and 1200 European firms have at least one direct supplier from Russia or Ukraine. However, regarding indirect suppliers, the number of affected organizations increases significantly, reaching about 200000 firms in the U.S. and 150000 firms in Europe. Therefore, the indirect impact of the conflict on the global supply chain is profound, which results in soaring prices for various materials and goods.The war has a significant impact on commodities and materials. Firstly, Russia is the biggest wheat exporter, and Ukraine is among the world’s top exporters of corn. The result of their economic isolation can be a price shock on food in the countries that depend on Russian and Ukrainian exports. Secondly, the invasion impacts the supply of metals and raw materials from these countries, which is a significant threat to some manufacturing companies. For instance, Russia
Drug ClassArtemisinin class drugs.DescriptionArtesunate is an antimalarial drug for injection, artemisinin derivative, and is used to treat malaria in patients of various ages. The effective action of Artesunate is supported by its advantage of a hydrophilic group (Khanal, 2021). Artesunate is a first-line treatment followed by an entire course of malaria treatment.Mechanism of ActionArtesunate metabolized into dihydroartemisinin (DHA), which contains the endoperoxide bridge responsible for combating Plasmodium falciparum, a parasite that causes malaria. DHA reacts with heme resulting in free radicals, which inhibit proteins and nucleic acid synthesis.Drug Administration and DosageArtesunate is supplied as a white powder for further dilution with sterile diluent and production of a colorless solution. Recommended doses of Artesunate are 2.4 mg per kg of body weight for adults and children are heavier than 20 kilograms, and 3 mg per kg for children less than 20 kilograms (Kitabi et al., 2021). The drug is administered intravenously at 0, 12, 24 hours, and after that – daily.Drug InteractionsThe drugs ritonavir, nevirapine, or UDP-Glucuronosyltransferase (UGT) inducers may reduce the antimalarial effects of Artesunate (FDA, 2020). UGT Inhibitors can enhance the side effects of Artesunate drug action. These aspects need to be monitored with the simultaneous use of Artesunate injections and mentioned drugs.Potential Side Effects/Adverse Effects/ToxicitiesAccording to FDA (2020), clinical trials of Artesunate drug have identified potential side effects and adverse reactions:  * hemoglobinuria;  * acute renal failure requiring dialysis;  * jaundice;  * anemia;  * thrombocytopenia;  * lymphopenia;  * neutropenia;  * pneumonia;  * diarrhea;  *
et al., 2020). If the GDP declines, this indicates the beginning of an economic crisis that negatively affects both: the target and business.Inflation is another economic indicator to track the level of a country. The process can begin for various reasons, including a shortage of goods on the market, monopoly of large firms, currency instability, and so on. Inflation has a huge impact on the economy and all types of financial instruments. Inflation is a steady rise in the general price level. However, this is the severe process of devaluation of paper money due to a violation of the laws of monetary circulation. Buyers have a limited ability to pay for purchases, and the business will suffer large losses from this. In addition, inflation also affects the purchase of raw materials, goods for sale, payment of employee salaries, and so on (Dvorský et al., 2020). The higher the inflation rate, the more unstable the market situation for businesses and customers.Macroeconomic indicators are the central indicators of the economy, with the help of which it is possible to determine the state of the economy as a whole. Critical changes of any of the indicators can portend a sharp change in a situation on markets and with currencies. Therefore, leading economists, brokers, and traders are constantly monitoring the latest macroeconomic data to update the state and the relevant strategy.
Essentially, the cause is the independent variable; its value is unchanged by the other factors in the research. The effect is the dependent variable, and changes influence its importance in the independent variable. The relationship between the independent and dependent variables is the primary focus of the research (Pokhariyal, 2019). The independent variable in the research idea is the situation that makes people feel nervous and unsure of themselves. Hence, the dependent variable is people’s level of conformity when facing stressful situations. Moreover, conditions affect whether people are more likely to exhibit conformity.The two most important features of any research are reliability and validity. According to Cypress (2017), the rigor of research equals the ideas of reliability and validity, which are all crucial components of quality. The more the number of times a study’s findings can be duplicated, the more stable or trustworthy the phenomena are deemed to be (Cypress, 2017). The scientific element of reliability presumes that repeated measurements of study, with the same results, using objective procedures prove the truthfulness of the observations.Therefore, to measure the validity and reliability of the research idea, it is crucial to investigate the consistency of obtained data regarding situations and people’s reactions and tendencies to conformism. The use of research techniques with consistency and care results in reliability, which is evident in the transparency of research practices, interpretation, and findings. Reliable research should demonstrate what occurs and is factual, and a valid instrument or measurement should evaluate what it is intended to examine (Cypress, 2017). Additionally, the research data, goals, and ideas should be accurate, factual, and up-to-date. The secondary data and previous research could be compared to the primary data obtained. The situations and conditions and the measurement instruments chosen for the study should not change during the investigations to correctly evaluate and compare the level of conformity.
The case tells about an elderly lesbian interracial couple Ruth and Janice. They have been living together for 42 years in a small town in a Southern state. However, due to a car accident, Ruth suffered a life-threatening condition and now the couple faces a challenge that entails complications in the various fronts of life. As Ruth has to receive long-term nursing care through Medicare and Medicaid, the couple faces a financial issue associated with healthcare. In addition, during the process, Ruth and Janice had to deal with issues associated with their identity of being a lesbian interracial couple. This included issues with internalized homophobia and institutional heterosexism.After leg and shoulder surgeries, Ruth was placed in the nursing home, where the couple faced first complications, such as a heterosexual bias of workers, and the forms, which had to be filled out, did not recognize the long-term lesbian relationship as an option. Hence, there was no legal way that Janice could be legally recognized as Ruth’s official next of kin. This fact and the background of keeping their private life secret caused the couple to conceal the fact that they were in long-term intimate relationships with the staff. Nevertheless, Janice delivered clothes and personal items to Ruth and remained present in her room daily, which caused concerns among the nurses who treated her with coldness.The second challenge was financial and property concerns. As Ruth and Janice could not get married legally in this state, such a life-threatening situation made them vulnerable to the loss of property due to the death of one of the women. Hence, they had to find alternative solutions to ensure that the house they shared would belong to one of them after the death of their partner. Overall, the case resembles how vulnerable sexual minorities can be and how many more obstacles and challenges they face to receive what is considered a norm for heterosexual people. The emotional burden of a life-threatening accident was doubled by the internalized homophobia experienced by the staff and anxieties regarding the lack of legal confirmation of their relationships. Luckily, Joseph was able to help Ruth and Janice to find solutions to their challenges and protect them from institutional heterosexism via timely intervention.
Overpopulation is a concerning factor considering it has led to adverse environmental and societal effects. The consequences of overpopulation include the depletion of natural resources and climate change which have hindered the conservation of natural resources such as water and animals (Weber & Sciubba, 2019). Therefore, there is an urgent need to control overpopulation considering the fact that it will lead to the planet’s conservation (Weber & Sciubba, 2019). Therefore, everyone is obligated to control human population growth since it has steered increased extraction of resources from the environment, such as overfishing, contamination of water, and soil degradation, leading to depletion.Water has become a scarce commodity due to activities such as the over-pumping of groundwater. People consume large amounts of water as their population increases, leading to its depletion. Other activities, such as water contamination through industrial wastes and marine dumping, have reduced water levels (Weber & Sciubba, 2019). Another situation caused by the growing population is the depletion of natural resources such as fish due to the increasing demand for these aquatic animals (Weber & Sciubba, 2019). When the demand increases, activities such as overfishing become normalized, resulting in extinction.Soil degradation is another regressive indicator that signifies the change in the ecosystem. Activities that promote soil erosion include the over-cultivation of land for commercial agriculture to sustain the growing population and the overgrazing of animals (Weber & Sciubba, 2019). These activities lead to the reduction of soil quality, which has promoted the loss of biodiversity. All the activities mentioned have resulted from the pressure to sustain the demands of the growing population (Weber & Sciubba, 2019). Everyone is responsible for stopping this menace, considering that human activities destroy the ecosystem. Reducing the population can be promoted by advocating for family planning programs and adopting new conservation alternatives such as not dumping in the oceans.
Religion is one of the most significant elements for immigrant groups. Religious beliefs and rituals unite people with common roots in the United States. The religion of the Jamaica West Indies people is the chosen cultural element to consider. The Jamaica West Indies, according to the interviewee, practice Methodist and Anglican traditions which are branches of Christianity ( Methodist vs Anglican , n.d). These two directions are connected with each other more than with other religious Christian traditions. Methodism is more common as it offers a greater focus on spiritual practices, as the Anglican Church is more formal. Jamaica West Indies immigrants additionally bring features of their culture into the Christian religious traditions, which is reflected in the integration of music into worship, which is not characteristic of the original branches.In the home country of the interviewee, the Methodist and Anglican traditions are extremely common. It is noted that in the country more than 60% of the population professes the Christian religion, while the rest practice local directions, including Rastafarianism ( Faith , n.d). The historical roots of the Christian faith in Jamaica come from Europe and, along with the Methodist and Anglican churches, there are “Roman Catholic, Baptist, Presbyterian, Pentecostal, Seventh Day Adventist, Moravian” ( Faith , n.d). It is also important that the island has more churches per square kilometer than any other country. This fact emphasizes how important the Christian faith in its various traditions is for the local population ( Faith , n.d). Moreover, several educational institutions in Jamaica, as well as
US has taken on some changes that exemplify transculturalism. An important feature of the Jamaican religious tradition is the “incorporation of music and praise and worship” (Beacom, n.d). Mostly drums and trombones are used, and in West Indies churches music is used to set the rhythm for the entire service. Thus, immigrant groups now merge traditional Christian edits of Methodist and Anglican tendencies with native features. The incorporation of music and musical instruments into worship is one of the most prominent characteristics of Jamaica West Indies religious practices. This change identifies the need for immigrant groups in congregations that would have a set of specific characteristics.Thus, the religious traditions of the Jamaica West Indies are similar in both the United States and Jamaica. Jamaica is a country where Christianity in all its forms is extremely widespread, which makes religious practices quite common for this group in the United States. However, despite the practice of Methodism, Jamaica West Indies brought a special feature to their worship in the form of the use of musical instruments. Jamaica West Indies bands use music to set the rhythm for religious services, which distinguishes their practice from traditional branches.
An alien invasion is a famous plot in the literature, but Ndedi Okorafor enriches it with a few important details. In his Lagoon, the author chooses Lagos, one of the most populated world cities, as a center of invasion. In particular, the invasion of aliens begins at Bar Beach that is described as a place of mixing (Okorafor, 2014). This statement denotes that the world is full of contrast, and one state can quickly turn into another one. For example, Okorafor (2014) mentions that sand mixed with the ocean, while the poor mixed with the wealthy. This information reveals that the narrative will focus on a change. The given topic is also discussed in the prologue to Chapter 1, but the inclusion of Bar Beach to convey this message is a less direct but still significant way to do it.Ayodele is an alien that comes to Earth to establish contact, and the author relies on specific means to describe the character. In particular, the focus is on how Adaora responds to the alien’s presence to show what Ayodele is. According to Okorafor (2014), Adaora experienced both attractive and repellent feelings while talking to the alien. On the one hand, this information means that Ayodele is a human-resembling character, and this feature is attractive for others. On the other hand, the alien has an idealistic appearance and exaggerated mannerisms, and these facts make people believe that something wrong is with Ayodele. It seems that Okorafor (2014) has decided to make the given character contradictory, and Adaora’s reaction
decisions. This information demonstrates that the literary work under consideration perfectly fits with other pieces representing the same genre.Finally, Chapter 7 includes the line “we are changed,” and the author perfectly explains the essence of the genre through these words. Every science fiction text relies on the idea that technological advancement could change the way of living. For example, time travel, limitless bioengineering, extraterrestrial life, and others could be possible if people invested much time and effort in improving their knowledge and skills. Okorafor’s Lagoon is not an exception from this list because sophisticated technologies made alien invasion possible. Consequently, it is possible to mention that the present literary work is aligned with numerous other texts that represent science fiction. All this information indicates that Okorafor enriched her work with both the features that are traditional for the genre and specific elements that make the novel peculiar.
The Lessons from Yusufiyah article retells the events surrounding the infamous 2006 massacre at Yusufiyah. The tragic story involved four American Soldiers who in drunken rage entered an Iraqi Civilian household, gang-raping the daughter and murdering the whole Family. This would have been not discovered and covered up if not for the bravery and moral agency of Pvt. Justin P. Watt, a young member of the platoon who privately investigated the unfolding events and eventually chose to report it in order to bring those responsible to justice. In his time in Iraq, Pvt. Watt faced a potentially morally injurious experience serving as an indirect witness to the massacre, which created psychological distress and ethical challenges for him, and an action plan for renewal is discussed.Morally injurious experiences (MIEs) define as events, exposures, or triggers that transgress or violate an individual’s deeply held moral beliefs or values, associated with psychological distress as a response. The MIE which affected Pvt. Watt was the massacre. He was not present, but he was a second-hand witness, first hearing the story from Sgt. Yribe and later receiving greater detail from Pfc. Howard. Pvt. Watt was also on radio guard the night of the massacre, and he used the pieces of information to determine the approximate context of what had occurred. Pvt. Watt realizes his platoon friends with Green and potentially others had raped a teenager, murdered a Family, and covered up evidence. Furthermore, that Sgt. Yribe failed his responsibility as team leader to attain justice despite knowing the facts, and is
help Pvt. Watt in this case is connection. He feels isolated and hated, receiving death threats for his choice. This is an event that he likely keeps private for his own safety and feels that there is no one he can trust. A connection should be established, most likely with other soldiers who had served, witnessed some form of similar MIEs targeted against Civilians or innocents, and who share similar views and concerns. Trust and belief in mankind must be re-established as a means of healing, for the Soldier to understand that they are not alone, and their choice was correct. Another appropriate repair response is a dialogue with a benevolent moral authority. The aim is for the Soldier to verbalize the MIE and how it affected them and what they believe the consequences to their life should be. This can be a conversation with a real being or not, potentially if the individual is religious, with God or a representative of God, such as a pastor. The entity on the receiving end must not want the Soldier to suffer excessively and move towards forgiveness and restoration.During his service, Pvt. Watt faced a morally injurious experience by being an indirect witness and investigator to his platoon members and friends committing a horrific massacre of innocents at Yusufiyah. This creates psychological distress and puts the Soldier in a morally compromising position. He should utilize the renewal resources of connection and dialogue with moral authority to aid in processing these events.
IntroductionCulture is, in essence, a collection of common beliefs held by a group of individuals. Certain behaviors are deemed normal and correct by cultural standards, whereas others are deemed weird or incorrect (Tombleson et al. 16). In some traditions, personal relationships and unofficial arrangements are significantly more enforceable than any contractual obligation. Cultural interaction refers to the use of speech and other expressive tools by individuals and societies to carry out their operations and responsibilities through symbolic resources (Tombleson et al. 21). Regional diversity affects every area of global interaction. Even the medium of communication chosen may have cultural implications (Tombleson et al. 22). For instance, it has been observed that industrialized countries increasingly depend on computer technologies and place a premium on written text over spoken or face-to-face contact.How Cultural Communications Affect Lockheed Martin’s Managers Globally CultureIn certain countries, conflict is seen positively, while others want to prevent it. Although confrontation is not generally encouraged in the United States, individuals are encouraged to resolve disputes immediately (Wilce et al. 243). In many Eastern countries, it is preferable to resolve disagreements privately. Furthermore, regional diversity would influence how Lockheed administrators approach activities. There are various reasons for this, including disparities in resource distribution, differing perceptions of time, and divergent views on how partnership and task-oriented labor should coexist. For instance, Asian and Hispanic civilizations focus on group processes at the beginning of the project and divert their attention to the ultimate goal as the program unfolds (Wilce et al. 243). In contrast, European-American cultures place a
premium on the task at hand and leave connections to evolve naturally.Decisions are commonly transferred to a junior in the United States. Self-determination is highly prized in several Southern European and Latin American cultures. In group situations, popular sovereignty works best in the United States, as in the case of Lockheed, whereas concurrence is preferred in Japan. Additionally, some cultures prohibit emotional engagement, the reasons for a quarrel, or private information (Ferraro 72). While specific inquiries may seem casual to a person, they may be inappropriate to someone from another culture. Thus, Lockheed managers would acknowledge this before they can gain a firm grasp on the perspectives and objectives of the individuals with whom they deal. Finally, diverse societies have varying perspectives on knowledge acquisition (Ferraro 72). Europeans value information obtained by numbering and quantifying more than data collected through other techniques (Ferraro 73). On the other hand, certain African cultures place a premium on information acquired through symbolism, while certain Asian cultures place a premium on knowledge acquired through transcendence.Reason and passion both play a part in international commercial transactions. The one that prevails determines individuals’ effectiveness, their propensity for expressing feelings, or people’s emotional neutrality (Wilce et al. 241). Citizens of collectivistic cultures do not communicate their emotions openly but rather keep them strictly regulated and suppressed. In high-affect societies, individuals express their emotions openly by smiling and occasionally crying or yelling (Wilce et al. 241). Additionally, some civilizations regard time as a linear resource that may be saved or squandered. Other cultures perceive
Shakespeare’s play Macbeth has been filmed dozens of times by great directors from all over the world. The film analyzed here was released in Britain in 2010 and directed by Rupert Goold. In fact, the British gave the world the most significant number of Macbeth ’s adaptations. This version of Macbeth is not considered to be the most viewed and discussed one. However, it has a lot of great qualities to be in the range of the best movies based on Shakespeare’s plays.The major attractive part about this film is the actor that plays Macbeth’s role in the movie. It is Patrick Stewart, the well-known actor for his role in the X-Men film series. Stewart has performed a tremendous work to feel the depth of Shakespeare’s Macbeth. In the gestures, the way of speaking, and delivery, one can feel the two-sided nature of this Scottish general. While Stewart demonstrates Macbeth’s power and force, there is also a sense of vulnerability and uneasiness in character. As for the other actors, I was not familiar with them before watching the movie. The actor whose style and play I liked is Kate Fleetwood as Lady Mcbeth. She looks really evil and frightening because of her icy manner.The design of the costumes and locations is really modern, which makes this adaptation to be highly changed from the original. While Shakespeare’s play happened in the 11th century in Scotland, the movie’s design is more similar to the events of the 20th century. It is unusual to see such a kind of
unsettling feeling through the play’s plot. This music couples with the sudden and frightening noises that can appear at any film stage. Different screams, sudden distortions, and just loud sounds keep the horror aesthetic on a high level. Concerning the effect of lights, there is no single scene where there will be no black-colour dominance. Another peculiarity is that the director tries to show the ambiguity of the characters by using white-black costumes. It creates the colour dichotomy, which seems to have a hidden meaning.To sum up, the 2010 version of Macbeth demonstrates the astounding mix of medieval Scottish history and 20th-century nefarious events. Rupert Goold managed to “refresh” the classical play and made viewers reflect on the actuality of the story in Macbeth . At the same time, it seems that Gould has not managed to move away from the central figure of Patrick Stewart. Other actors, except Kate Fleetwood, were in the shade of the great actor.
In addition to the titles of academic journals and articles, it is possible to determine which field of science an article belongs to from its content, the language used, and the focus of the study. For example, an article from the humanities explores people’s relationships of communication, satisfaction, and beliefs (Willoughby et al. 1631). These parameters are quite abstract and relate more to the field of human perception than to precise measurements. The article from the field of social sciences already uses the study of correlations, describing the relationship between phenomena and their influence on each other (Geist 1).Additionally, the researchers use more different graphs and numbers and focus on social and economic contexts. An article from the field of natural sciences no longer uses statistical data but the study of various phenomena through the construction of systems and models. For example, Schacht and Kramer consider the human mating system through the lens of its influence on evolution (2). Thus, these articles use a more experimental design with application to the global development of the human species.Within the framework of the differences in articles that relate to various fields of science, a number of features can be distinguished by which a scientific area can be identified. First of all, the humanities pay more attention to the perception of a particular phenomenon and use surveys of participants for research. The social sciences are characterized by the search for correlations between phenomena and the social context, as well as the identification of statistical patterns. Finally, for the natural
sciences, an experimental study is important that can describe one or another phenomenon of nature or humans.Articles also differ in organizational structure depending on the field of science to which they belong. Thus, an article from the humanities field contains background information, a description of the research methodology, including the measurement procedure, presents the results, as well as a discussion. The social science article contains background information, data and methodology, results, discussion, and conclusion. Notably, the social science article clearly lists the data that will be used to find correlates. At the same time, in an article that refers to the humanities, various characteristics are used that are identified through various survey points.The article from the natural sciences is a literary review, so its structure reflects the description of key concepts related to the influence of monogamy on the evolution of the human species. Compared to other papers presented, this paper focuses solely on the biological factors that shape the behavior of an entire species. The structure of the article reflects its focus and describes correlates such as concealed ovulation, testis size, sexual dimorphism, and others.Looking more closely at one of the articles, important writing techniques can be used in other papers. In particular, Willoughby et al. use their research and its results to test existing views and models of marital centrality. The authors use existing theoretical knowledge as a framework to shape their own research. This technique allows them to make their paper more evidence-based while also offering significant correlates that already exist for research
For the political and legal system to operate properly, all their elements should align. Although U.S. states have large autonomy and have their own constitutions, they should not contradict the federal U.S. Constitution, including the first ten amendments to it – the Bill of Rights. The former outlines responsibilities and rights of different branches of power and the latter contains a list of basic human rights. If the state constitution contradicts the federal one, it might signal a lack of unity and democracy within the country. The paper aims to analyze Article I of the Florida Constitution in terms of its correspondence to the U.S. Constitution and, specifically, the Bill of Rights.Each article of the Constitution of the State of Florida covers different legal aspects. Article I contains the declaration of rights guaranteed to all the state’s citizens and is presented in 27 sections (The Florida Senate). The present analysis will focus on the three of them: religious freedom, rights of accused and of victims, right of privacy. Each of them is presented in separate sections of Article I.Religious freedom is one of the basic rights that ensures democracy. It is enshrined in Article I’s Section 3 of the Florida Constitution, which states that no law will make people follow any religion or prohibit or penalize its free exercise (The Florida Senate). It corresponds to Amendment I of the Bill of Rights (U.S. Senate). Moreover, the Florida Constitution highlights that “religious freedom shall not justify practices inconsistent with public morals, peace or safety” (The Florida Senate).
Key Players and Business ModelsMedicare Advantage (MA) provides beneficiaries with health plans covered by Medicare-approved private companies. In Los Angeles, CA, the key players are Humana, UnitedHealthcare, Blue Cross Blue Shield, CVS Health, Centene, Cigna, and Kaiser Permanente (Freed et al., 2021b). Six large health systems account for half of the total market, but the market share of each system does not exceed 11% (Yegian & Connolly, 2021).Major business models in MA in Los Angeles are the partial and complete downside risk, with the full risk being used by UnitedHealthcare and Humana (Galewitz, 2018). In particular, a part of UnitedHealthcare called Optum has full-risk contracts with about a half million people in Los Angeles (Yegian & Connolly, 2021). Insurance companies also employ or are affiliated with physicians and integrated physician organizations; for example, Optum employs more than 7,000 physicians in Los Angeles (Yegian & Connolly, 2021). Physicians take clinical responsibility and risk through fixed per-person per-month payments called capitation.The Impact and DriversMA’s impact can be assessed in the number of people enrolled in the plans. In Los Angeles, 50.5% of people were enrolled in MA plans in 2019 (Yegian & Connolly, 2021). Furthermore, the share of people enrolled in special needs plans are increasing (Freed et al., 2021a). These outcomes are driven by such factors as federal reimbursement, Medicare population growth, decreased employer-sponsored retiree insurance, ease of entering the MA business, and the growth of SNPs (Blum & Hsieh, 2020). Although patients are mostly satisfied with the coverage, they may sometimes be losers because of such issues as high deductibles, limited provider networks, and surprise medical bills (Pollitz et al., 2019). The winners in the market are healthcare providers included in the network and insurance companies.
Today, the research department at Merrill Lynch represents an inclusive environment where much attention is focused on talent development and work culture. I think that I would feel very comfortable working in this type of environment, mainly because of the fact that junior analysts are valued as much as senior analysts. In addition, working at Merrill Lynch would provide me with an opportunity to learn from other analysts and knowledgeable professionals, participating in collaborations and working in teams with them. The culture of research department at Merrill Lynch is based on making people feel as a part of something important, encouraging them to learn and accomplish their goals.As mentioned above, collaborations are an integral part of Merrill’s research department. Candace Browning, head of Global Research at Merrill, puts great emphasis on developing initiatives to promote collaboration among the research analysts. Browning intended for the company “to move from a star culture where everybody operates as their own individual silo to a Merrill Lynch franchise culture where no one analyst is bigger than Merrill Lynch” (Groysberg & Vargas, 2007, p. 4). To achieve this, the research department had to increase transparency and communication between analysts. The main obstacles and challenges to this were related to the difficulty of encouraging local industries like retail and real estate to collaborate on a global level. Thus, some of the major challenges in this context included “different time zones, currencies, and accounting standards” (Groysberg & Vargas, 2007, p. 6). Despite these challenges, the company continued to work on developing different forms
feed him; later, Gregor dies of poisoning.Therefore, “The Metamorphoses” can be easily attributed to current society. Research shows that “it no longer follows the methodical analysis of souls, but seeks the inner disorder, the secret of the character’s existence” (Balaban 235). One of the most striking is the problem of loneliness of people. Despite the fact that the main protagonist had a family he took care of and supported, he was left alone in the end. Even at the end of the work, the author shows a picture of a happy walking family, according to which it is impossible to understand that they only lost one of their members. In the modern world, people are also suffering from loneliness, which is especially provoked by the development of new technologies. Individuals are increasingly locked into their separate worlds and cease to interact even with the close people themselves.In conclusion, it must be underlined that Franz Kafka created his works during such a period as modernism. It is characterized by the destruction and confrontation of established social norms. Therefore, the author of “The Metamorphosis” focuses on the problem of lack of love and loneliness of people, which can be related to the modern world. Despite the fact that this problem cannot be immediately identified, many experiences internal suffering from having such feelings.
As the Mongols expanded their territory, not only did they become powerful, but they also left behind a trail of pain to those that resisted their rule. In the account of the Abbasid Empire and Section 7: The Rise of the Mongols, one trait associated with the Mongols is that in their approach and stopped at nothing to achieve power. For example, in the account of the Abbasid Empire, the Mongols used negotiations and instructions to compel the Muslims to submit to their rule.However, when the Muslims neglected the call for military reinforcement against the Persians, Hulagu murdered the people in Baghdad and depopulated the city only to recover decades later. In their rise, Genghis Khan realized the Muslim states were powerful, like his grandson, Hulagu, who tried to negotiate with Afghanistan and Turkestan instead of hitting them head-on. However, on declining the request, Genghis Khan attacked the Turkestan, killing every living thing in his wake.One contrast between the two reads us that in section 7 when Chinson Bayan invaded Southern China, Kublai Khan led the Mongols to allow the Southern China Empress to live pleasurably inside an opulent palace. When her husband, the Song Emperor, heard how they treated his wife, he returned to China only to be seized and beheaded. On the contrary, the invasion of the Abbasid Empire saw Hulagu lead his horse riders in singling outhouse of learning for destruction. The people were massacred by the bushel, Abbasid Caliph included. Contrary to Genghis Khan, who poured molten gold down the throat of the sultan, Hulagu ordered his men to roll the caliph up in a carpet and rode their horses over him.
The stories written by Edgar Allan Poe always intrigue and fascinate the reader for various reasons. His “Murders in the Rue Morgue” is a unique narration of how a non-human murderer could disclose serious shortages in criminal investigation and underline the importance of observation and attention to the details. The intrinsically perplexing crime causes the reader to ask a multitude of questions about the seemingly contradictory evidence, a lack of means and motive, and superhuman mutilation; through these complexities, the reader is moved around the chessboard of mystery at the mystery of Dupin – the analyst with all the answers.When a crime scene is analyzed, people focus on the presence or absence of evidence, and Poe complicates the case by contradictory facts and notes. Using a metaphor of chess frivolity, the author recognizes reflective intellect as a useful tool in detective stories (Poe, 1841). Dupin emphasizes the necessity of using such elements as voice quality or the placements of subjects in the room to prepare the reader for moving another piece on the chessboard.Despite a lack of motive, police officers prefer to arrest at least someone to demonstrate the effectiveness of their actions. Dupin does not want to follow this questionable and ineffective example and make another decision to remove blunders (Poe, 1841). Most criminals are motivated at least by some personal interests and needs, and the offered situation missed any reasonable or even unreasonable motive.Finally, examining the murdered bodies reveals non-human mutilations, which should be considered before accusing someone of the crime. The police were paralyzed from the facts, demonstrating Dupin’s success through impartial and analytical attitudes towards the case (Poe, 1841). It is one of the last steps in the chess game that allows finding the true answer.Human murders turn out to be a symbolic visiting card of Poe’s stories. His evaluation of criminal minds and detectives is unpredictable and tempting. Addressing contradictory evidence, a lack of motive, and inhuman mutilations helps Dupin solve the case. Although his success remains a mystery for other characters, the reader, who observes the whole situation on the chessboard, learns that analytical thinking and no fast conclusions may be enough to reveal a truth.
“Coronation of Poppea” describes how Poppea, who has an extramarital affair with the fifth Roman emperor Nero, becomes an empress. Nero promises to bring her to power and makes her his bride despite being married to Ottavia and conflicts with Seneca (Tommasini 34). The opera could be considered problematic since it celebrates adultery rather than the sanctity of marriage. Based on historical events, it shows how a powerful man can betray his spouse and even make her exiled from her land without punishment or social condemnation.Arias, recitatives, and choruses are three separate terms from the music field. An aria is a type of musical composition that represents a song for a solo performance and is usually a part of a larger composition, such as an opera. Arias can be performed with or without accompaniment from orchestras, but the term refers to melodies rather than works that share similarities with common speech. Recitatives are works that are commonly used in operas but do not possess the features of formal musical compositions, for instance, rhyming or repetitive lines. In general, recitative parts performed by vocalists are closer to common speech accompanied by music, with a range of options on the spectrum from conversational to more melodic pieces. Unlike the previous terms, a chorus refers to a musical phenomenon on another organizational level and represents a smaller subsection of a song characterized by emphasis and repetitiveness. Also known as a refrain, a chorus is often contrasted with the remaining parts of the piece and may involve the use of additional instruments that offer more depth and dynamic development.In the Baroque period, the musical instrument selection for orchestras facilitated the creation of complex and multi-layered works. Baroque orchestras commonly used string instruments, including violas, violins, or double basses, and instruments from the woodwind family, such as bassoons, oboes, or flutes. Continuo instruments, for instance, organs, were implemented to balance the other components and add depth and dynamics to the performed works. Orchestras also actively implemented components from the percussion family, for example, kettledrums, to support musical pieces’ rhythm while also adding harmony. Finally, brass instruments, including Baroque trumpets, were another common feature of Baroque orchestras.
Patients at any point need an advanced care and proper safety at all times. According to the Joint Commission, hospitals should focus on seven patient safety goals for 2021 (Clarkson, 2021). The organization uses new evidence on emerging patient safety issues to inform its goals for the coming year. This data inspires other Joint Commission Center for Transforming Healthcare initiatives and teaching materials. Listed below are some of the hospital’s goals and how they align. When delivering care, treatment, and services, make sure to use at least two methods of identifying the patient. Misdiagnosis and mistreatment of patients can occur at any stage of the process.First, the person for whom the service or treatment is intended must be reliably recognized. A person’s name, a government-issued ID number, a phone number, or other unique identifier is permitted. Unable to speak, babies have fewer identifying characteristics (Clarkson, 2021). Misidentification led to serving a mother’s breastmilk to the wrong newborn, posing a danger of transmitting bodily fluids and possible diseases to the newborn. In this case, all providers must use the same identifying scheme.In perioperative and other procedural settings, mark all medications, medication containers, and other solutions entering or leaving the sterile field. A syringe is a medication container, while medicine cups and basins are others. Unlabeled containers of medications or other solutions make it impossible to track down the contents. Mistakes occur when drugs and other solutions have been transferred from their original containers to unmarked containers, some of which have been catastrophic. Despite the dangers of this
This week focused on the second chapter of the textbook that discusses the nature of people and culture. The first key point is the understanding that culture is the framework of life and influences the aspects of life for every individual (De Melendez & Beck, 2018). Therefore, everything a person does, how they perceive things, their dress code, likes and dislikes, approach to social and political issues, and interaction with others is influenced by one’s culture. This understanding will improve how I view and relate to people at work and in social spaces because different cultures will create different life approaches and styles.It is crucial to find an explanation for classroom behavior among learners. The second point from the text states that students’ manners, conduct, and reactions can be attributed to their culture (De Melendez & Beck, 2018). As such, acceptable acts by one learner may become unacceptable to another or to the teacher. Since children begin to learn their culture from birth, most of them will have the behaviors adopted from parents, older siblings, and other close relatives. This knowledge will help me to understand my students and plan the best experiences for every learner in the classroom.Lastly, although culture belongs to society, there are differences between individuals in the same cultural groups. Such distinctions are seen in a classroom where each learner has a unique way of expressing themselves and reacting to various topics. Therefore, even people within the same family or community may exhibit varying behaviors and manners (De Melendez & Beck, 2018). Such differences originate from socialization and individual distinctions. After reading this chapter, while in the classroom, I will treat each student as unique and culturally different guarantee each of them receives the best attention and directions during the learning process.
or burial attribute. Commonly, bust sculptures in Ancient Egypt were “assigned to the realm of private ancestor worship in the domestic sphere or in the context of burials” (“The bust,” para. 21). However, it indicates the high status that a woman could obtain in ancient Western civilizations, where she could perform as the head of a state.The sculpture has a significant cultural and historical value due to its indication of the appraisal of the figure of Nefertiti by society. Moreover, in the context of history, this artifact is invaluable because it was preserved in a very good condition, allowing for examining the materials ad techniques used meticulously to create this masterpiece. The professionals working on the artifact noted that the paint looked as if freshly applied. Therefore, apart from the cultural and historical importance, the bust has an artistic value as a fine example of sculpturing mastery. It might be relevant to expand the discussion of this artifact in the context of women’s role in ancient Egyptian politics.
The constitution of each state enshrined provision for the protection of individual rights of citizens, which also applies to New Jersey. In particular, the state constitution contains 21 provisions in Article I, which describe the rights and freedoms of individuals ( 1947 State Constitution , n.d). In particular, people are defined as free and independent by nature, and the freedom and security of the individual are paramount values. Additionally, every person has the right to participate in political life and has innate political power. At the same time, it is clarified that state institutions can restrict freedoms if the public good requires it.An important point in the protection of individual rights is freedom of speech and expression. However, it is also emphasized that a citizen “may freely speak, write and publish his sentiments on all subjects, being responsible for the abuse of that right” ( 1947 State Constitution , n.d, para. 8). Thus, a citizen can be held liable for defamation if it is proven, which identifies a restriction in favor of the freedoms of another individual. The remaining paragraphs of Article I provide individuals with the protection of rights in the context of criminal prosecution legal proceedings, as well as in relation to fines and bills. Additionally, the constitution provides protection for public gatherings and deliberations if they are for the common good.Thus, the New Jersey Constitution provides for the protection of the basic individual rights of citizens. At the same time, in many aspects, it is specified that these rights are a priority if they are consistent with the goals of the good for society. In this case, every citizen needs to keep in mind the restrictions that the freedoms of other members of society impose on their actions.
The article describes a recent Chicago hot dog restaurant incident that can be considered an ethical issue. The incident involved a man who was asked to wear a mask to use the restaurant’s services (Sutton, 2022). In response, the man offended the restaurant employee by throwing snow in their face several times (Sutton, 2022). Additionally, the offender broke the glass door with an unknown object (Sutton, 2022). This incident can be considered an ethical issue because the offender’s actions were disproportional to the situation, apart from the obvious property damage offense. Furthermore, throwing snow at an employee might not count as illegal; however, it is blatantly disrespectful toward an individual.A utilitarian point of view would consider this incident wrong by examining the consequences of the offender’s actions. The seeming reason behind the offender’s behavior is the employee’s request to wear a mask, which is the state’s mandate. Utilitarianism would view the restaurant visitor’s decision to commit an offense against the employee and the restaurant’s property, starting with the consequences of these actions. Since the result is a broken glass door and an innocent employee that suffered, the consequences are harmful. As such, from the utilitarian point of view, the actions can be considered wrong. The Kantian moral theory views an issue as irrational since following the moral law and duty is rational behavior. Offering an innocent individual and damaging the restaurant’s property can be immoral. As such, dismissing the moral law renders the offender irrational in the eyes of a follower of a Kantian moral theory.I believe that utilitarianism is the most logical way to conclude this ethical problem. The reason for that is that negative consequences for anybody can be the best moral compass for almost any decision. The Kantian moral theory is based on moral law, which can be subjective in some people’s minds. As such, according to Kantian theory, some people might disagree that the incident is an ethical issue. In contrast, according to utilitarianism, a negative impact on any individual renders an action wrong.
In Liu and Asimov’s short stories, the authors define human beings and how artificial intelligence differs from the human mind. The author of The Algorithms for Love , Liu Ken, writes that humans are too young and too immature to understand the global laws of the universe. However, it seems to many that human self-sufficiency and autonomy in desires and actions is prohibitive. Asimov’s Liar is unique in that it is one of the author’s first attempts to reflect from different angles on the modern world’s clash of high technology and morality. Liu and Asimov approach the problem of artificial intelligence differently, but they agree that there is a strong similarity between the thinking of robots and humans.Liu Ken wonders where the boundary is between artificial and natural intelligence. He is interested whether the robot’s self-learning program can be considered a person (Ken 5). After all, in essence, the decisions it makes are based on experience and knowledge – humans reason the same way. The author goes on to ask his readers whether humans can be considered robots with artificial intelligence, in case one considers that there is no essential difference between the latter and people (Ken 5). Thus, Liu Ken brings readers to his final question of who programmed humans in this case.Ken’s story is about a young woman named Elena, a programmer and designer for a company that creates unusual toys – robot androids. Improving from model to model, she finally manages to create a robot that can easily cope with the Turing test,
Technological advance has resulted in business transitioning online, which, in turn, requires efficient market placements online through media. Naturally, traditional sources people are used to are now outweighed by the numerous benefits of new media. To be more exact, legacy media targets a broad audience, which is, obviously, ineffective and leads to companies wasting their money on a few integrations. This type of promotion focuses on old news presentations, such as billboards, television commercials, or printed materials (Vara-Miguel, 2020). Therefore, the audience that sees the advertisements is not narrowed correctly, meaning that most viewers do not find the commercials exciting and do not buy the presented products.In contrast, new media is adjusted to the modern view of society that is constantly engaged in interaction with various technological devices. In addition, Generation Z is more likely to be motivated to purchase the advertised goods when seeing the advertisements on social media (Vara-Miguel, 2020). That is why new media is mainly positioned on popular social networks, such as YouTube, Instagram, Twitter, and especially Tik Tok (Vara-Miguel, 2020). The influencers partner with many companies, advertising their products or service online to their followers, which is apparently more efficient than the old methods of legacy media. By and large, people are more likely to buy the items that are recommended by their favorite bloggers, models, actors, and other celebrities or accomplished social-media influencers.
the internet, in which they encounter the best and worst of what people put down in words” (Heaven par. 2). Since the given tool from OpenAI relies on learning from all sources of English texts, it is used to produce highly offensive and toxic language. However, the new update minimizes such a problem by a significant margin, which generates less erroneous, misinformed, and offensive texts.It is important to note that GPT-3 is still in its rudimentary stage, which means that its implications are minor as of today. However, the improvements, such as InstructGPT, create leaps in AI’s learning process, accelerating its maturity as a usable product. Future business implications are massive, where any form of repetitive and non-creative text-generating jobs will become obsolete since GPT-3 will be able to perform these tasks much more effectively and efficiently.In conclusion, I think that GPT-3 is a highly promising instrument, which requires learning assistance conducted frequently. I agree that GPT-3 should not rely solely on self-learning, and professionals should direct the AI. The text generator is of paramount importance when it comes to making a substantial shift in progress toward automating many text-related jobs, which also include programming. Although the tool will not replace all software developers, it will make the mundane elements of code generation highly efficient.
traits such as improving his mind by constant reading, observing the surrounding nature, and being interested in many research fields (Bowta & Puhulawa, 2018). Because of these habits, the character is quite believable and trustworthy as well.Viktor Frankenstein’s character can be considered a trope of warning, especially in several central situations in the novel. For instance, after creating his monster, the researcher simply escapes this creature and tries to hide because of the posed threat and a scary appearance (Bowta & Puhulawa, 2018). The situation in the novel does not end up well for the main character; hence, this situation can prove that running from someone’s fears, problems, and difficulties without fighting them did not prove to be effective. In addition, in the example of Frankenstein’s character, the researchers may see that not all inventions are really demanded by society and can bring more risks than profits. The monster had the ability to feel, think, understand, and even pronounce some words, which can be considered a type of artificial intelligence (Agustina et al., 2020). However, the invented creature turns out to be a threat to Frankenstein’s life which proves that people need to be careful when trying to substitute their loneliness or inner struggles with their artificial “friends’ ‘.
Treating people is a difficult job, and even the most competent doctor will not manage to do it alone. Nurses are an essential link in the work of the medical system and the process of saving the lives of the population. Thinking about my past, I find events that led me to the profession of nurse. The people’s experience significantly forms their character and thoughts, which determines many life choices (Woźniak, 2019). My experience in various circumstances helped me realize my vocation. These situations in my life may seem ordinary, but for me, they have become pivotal and those that prove that all events are not coincident at all.Issues of difficulties and challenges people face, for instance, global problems and similar concerns, have occupied my mind since childhood. I kept wondering what could be done to change something. In response, thoughts arise about changing the world, environmental protests, the invention of technologies that will save the ocean. However, although these activities are critical, they seemed unsuitable for my character, and I wanted to do something more practical and influential. These thoughts are the first reason that led me to the profession of nurse. For me medicine and care change the world for the better. Moreover, without them, humanity would have never reached the modern standard of living. Changing the lives of even one patient for the better is also important as changing the whole world.Many of us had some experience of illness and even being in hospitals in childhood. Such a situation happened to me –
second reason that led me to the profession of a nurse – I understood that there are many people in the world who, like me then, need the same support and comfort, and I can give them.We have to deal with diseases and injuries not only in hospital conditions but also in emergencies in any circumstances. Family members, friends, and even strangers may suddenly become ill or injured, and it is necessary to take action quickly – after all, saving a life can depend on a few seconds. As a teenager, I witnessed my friend break his arm. We were lucky, and there was a person nearby who could provide aid, and the ambulance reached quickly. However, for a few minutes, I felt helpless and confused – I strived to help but did not want to harm. This event was another reason that prompted me to decide to become a nurse. First aid skills, and even simple help in measuring pressure, can be life-saving.Thus, several important events and long reflections when making decisions are behind my decision to become a nurse. I see many advantages in the work of nurses and believe in their particular importance. Saving lives and giving comfort and care to many people is what I want to do. Kindness, attentiveness, and support are what our world needs, and these features can bring wellbeing to the population.
The visual argument will be published in a one-page spread of a newspaper. The visual argumentation will target the general population to address ocean dumping. The audience values environmental preservation in the oceans and understands the threats of sea dumping on aqua life and the environment. There is, however, less awareness of deep-sea drilling and the impacts on the habitat and human life in the oceans and along the coasts. The augmentation will create an apprehension of the environmental effects oil companies drilling close to water bodies have on human and aqua life. The theme of the argumentation is to stop deep-sea drilling. To make my request clear and direct so that the audience would comprehend it without any misunderstanding or appearing of additional questions about the content of my visual argument, I will use an image with a help of the text reflecting on deep-water drilling, threats to habitats, and life. People unevenly feel the impacts of ocean drilling, and the newspaper spread should enhance awareness among the general populationThe core of the argument is the environmental impacts of deep-sea drilling. The core argument should challenge the human/environment dichotomy. Deep-sea drilling creates very high risks of oil spillage that is disastrous to marine wildlife and contributes to climate change. The continued utilization of the extraction method causes a rise in the sea level, extinction, and decline in marine life and threatens the landscape environment and human life. The core argument will highlight the possible future calamities following extensive deep-sea drilling. The visual argumentation will be
good formatting and avoiding clutter. A simple conventional typeface in the slogan will improve the readability of the augmentation. The slogan will be relatively large to emphasize the critical idea. The color selection in the image will be catchy and communicate the concept behind the design in the visual argumentation. The color will create deep meaning and reflection of the image. The slogan will summarize the image to pinpoint the core argument. Each first letter of the saying will be capitalized to catch attention and create a persuasive effect.The image will display a coastal area with drilling rigs and large oil barrels leaking to a large water body and marine life soaked in oil. The water body’s surface will be covered with oil, and besides the barrels will be individuals covered with oil-like substances. The image should evoke emotions of sympathy and horror in the viewers. The image will demonstrate the direct impacts of oil spillage resulting from ocean drilling on human and marine life. The marine life soaked with oil will create an emotional appeal to the suffering inflicted on the animals. People covered in oil demonstrate the reciprocating effect ocean drilling can have on human life. By depicting significant risks, the relevant authorities should respond to put environmental considerations over the monetary benefits of oil extraction (Meyer 5). The image should appeal to the broader audience to abandon oil dependency and embrace sustainable energy sources.
anything sacred, or they start merely with a vow to preserve medical ideals. Moreover, Dr. Louis Lasagna stresses one vital moment “I will not be ashamed to say “I know not” ( Various physicians oaths , n.d.). In my opinion, it is crucial to understand that nobody can know everything, but there is always an opportunity for improvement.Additionally, in the original oath, a doctor is seen as a body carrying out its duties. They also swear to keep themselves away from the “seduction” of their patients, “be they free or slaves,” which seems inappropriate ( Various physicians oaths , n.d.). Contrary to this oath, in the modern version, a doctor is seen as “a member of society” who, in turn, not only performs their duties but respects their patients ( Various physicians’ oaths , n.d.).Hence, the Oath of Hippocrates does consider the interests of the patient, but it is accustomed to the realia of that time. In comparison, the oath by Dr. Louis Lasagna reflects my ideals and values more. I put the patient’s interests first and believe that it is necessary to remain humane and respectful while performing my duties. Moreover, I also see the part of not being ashamed of personal unfamiliarity as vital since it can always give impetus to learning something new.
All colors are naturalistic as the painter tried to create an accurate image of these two outstanding figures. Thus, the use of oil and tempera adds some specific roughness to brushstrokes and makes the painting look unique.The image also managed to create a clear illusion of depth as the background depicts a particular landscape that also looks realistic. The main figures are in the center and at the bottom of the composition, which helps to find them, seeing the background at the same time. All lines are clear and well-defined, and many details are given to clothes, faces, and other objects depicted in the image. At the same time, the figures look soft and tender. In general, the picture fits with the stylistic period when it was created, as such motifs, colors, and shapes were typical for artists of that period. The artist wanted to show the human nature of Jesus and, at the same time, emphasize the purity of the whole family.Altogether, Madonna Adoring the Child is a picture perfectly demonstrating the style and ideas of that period. Its central theme, which is depicting the Virgin Mary and Jesus, is one of the frequently used motifs of that period. The choice of shapes, colors and the whole composition is similar to other works painted by artists who worked during Renaissance.
order to build policies based on the concept of equity.A similar sentiment is expressed in Aginam’s essay, where the author introduces an example of a situation that requires the force of WIS to address the problem of inequity. Specifically, according to Aginam, the focus on the transcultural economy and involvement of a greater range of global participants into the trade process will allow leveraging some of the existing inequalities (247). Specifically, by seeking partnerships and business expansion opportunities with foreign communities, one will be able to focus on building socioeconomic equality and raise the voices of the victims of colonialism.The idea of supporting minority countries in the post-colonial economy with the help of WSIS and the related organizations appears to be quite promising. However, ensuring that the actions taken by the involved parties are based solely on the principles of ethics and diversity suggests introducing practical control tools. For this reason, creating a global communication channel for post-colonial communities will be necessary.
general meeting of shareholders. To a large extent, income formation occurs at the expense of the first concept, dividends. It follows from this that the more shares, the more income the shareholder receives.Dividends can be expressed in a specific amount or as a percentage. Moreover, this indicator is regulated by the statutory documents and the decision of the Board of Directors. The shareholder will receive capital gains only if the shares are sold at a higher price. If this does not happen, then the income is unrealized. Capital gains can even be negative when stocks have been sold at a price lower than they were bought.In conclusion, the profession of a shareholder is suitable for anyone who knows the specifics of this work. The main thing is to have an identity document. To get a position as a shareholder, you need to purchase shares from their owner or contact a broker (intermediary). If an investor owns shares, then he is a shareholder. In most cases, investors hold most of the money in stocks in investment portfolios since this method of storing money provides the greatest profit.
The global firm is PwC India, a company located in India. The company focuses on vital areas, including the government and public sector, digital services, and technology consulting. PwC India is on its optimization level as per the global project management maturity model (Naim et al., 2021). Such is attributed to its maturity stage, which is also considered the highest regarding capability maturity model integration. By implementing a global project management framework, PwC India has benefited highly from a series of events. Firstly, the firm has evolved and continues to improve its operational processes radically. Secondly, the implementation has resulted in a noticeable improvement in the innovation sector. According to Naim, Alahmari & Rahim (2021), innovation has resulted in key development, which has contributed greatly to the performance. Finally, the framework has enhanced the building of people’s capabilities, which have instituted effective delivery of high-quality complex information and technology programs on a timely basis—actions that have improved Indians returns on IT investments.Being on the final and topmost level of global project management, I would recommend PwC India firm actively engage its staff on managerial aspects. The move will aim to maximize the relatable instance that could jeopardize the operations and operation systems (Naim et al., 2021). Furthermore, since the firm is in its last stage, absolute improvement and consistent observation will be instrumental in retaining the company for the next 2-5years.
My discipline is Networking and I have chosen two articles related to the modern technology. The first article is written by Benzaid and Taleb (2020) published in IEEE Network, and it examines how artificial intelligence influence 5G network. The second article is by Zhang et al. (2021) and it analyzes the interoperability of BIM software tools and addresses the problems in the process of data exchange. It was published in Computer Applications in Engineering Education journal. In addition to researchers, the audience of the first article is data security agents as it provides some insights on how the use of artificial intelligence to 5G can be venerable to external attacks. The second article’s audience is educators in engineering education as it discusses about the method of teaching engineering. This paper examines articles of Benzaid and Taleb (2020) and Zhang et al. (2021).To begin with, there is a need to understand the content of each article. Both articles are scientific and made by the use of quantitative and qualitative research methods. Benzaid and Taleb (2020) warn the audience that to fully reap the benefits of 5G, it is critical to develop robust and long-lasting security mechanisms that can deal with the ever-changing threat landscape. They suggest that traditional security measures are not enough. This is because of given the growing number of vulnerabilities, the sophistication of cyber threats, the high volume of traffic, and the diverse technologies (e.g., SDN, NFV) and services that will shape next-generation wireless networks. According to Benzaid and Taleb (2020), a new security
measure that needs to be considers is the adoption of Artificial Intelligence (AI). They describe AI as a method that would enable intelligent, adaptive, and autonomous security management, allowing for prompt and cost-effective detection and mitigation of security threats. Their description provides an impression that AI is a promising direction. Moreover, Benzaid and Taleb (2020) illustrate AI’s positive aides, such as its ability to identify hidden patterns in a vast set of time-varying multi-dimensional data that allow faster and more accurate decision-making.With regards to the second article of Zhang et al. (2021), it reports a case study of the development of the new capstone project for engineering major students. It is based on team-based learning (TBL) combined with the 360-degree evaluation feedback method to increase students’ BIM competency. Data is collected and analyzed using a mix of qualitative and quantitative methodologies in order to assess students’ learning outcomes and BIM competency. The findings show that TBL, when combined with 360-degree feedback in the capstone project, can significantly improve graduates’ BIM expertise. This research examines the interoperability of BIM software platforms, data sharing issues, and recommendations for improving the course and BIM team collaboration. Compared to the first article, the second one is based on a study and has significant evidence to support their claim. The article of Benzaid and Taleb (2020) appeals to the audience by considering all potential security scenarios and analyzing specific aspects of AI and 5G network.The study of Zhang et al. (2021) discovered how students’ professional capabilities may be increased through a
capstone project, and educators can use the BIM course to build engineers that closely match industry needs. The paper makes a case for using the capstone project to help engineering students improve and cultivate their BIM proficiency in MEP systems. This research established a new paradigm for using TBL and 360-degree feedback in engineering education. In terms of the support for each article’s claims, Zhang et al. (2021) is more reliable as it has a specific case.In terms of the format of both articles, they are both heavily theoretical, meaning that there are numerous citations and the use of previous literature. Benzaid and Taleb (2020) provide images of how AI and 5G work, interpreting their explanation. It was done to make easier understanding for the audience. For example, they illustrate mapping of the adversarial ML attacks to the ML5G high-level architecture. Meanwhile, Zhang et al. (2021) provide descriptive statistics and t test results as a table while making a comprehensive analysis of the data. As such, it can be assumed that both articles rely on logos rather than pathos as they are written scientifically, meaning that they are based on facts. In both articles, there was also a logical progression of ideas and claims that were supported by a great variety of numerical facts and evidence.The importance of AI in encouraging security in 5G and beyond networks was highlighted in Benzaid and Taleb (2020) article. Meanwhile, it emphasized the security concerns that may accompany the anticipated AI benefits if unscrupulous actors take use of their potential
or flaws. We advised many defense measures while advising on which components of the ML5G unified architecture they may be implemented in order to increase resilience to AI attacks. Despite their merits, each of the recommended countermeasures has its own set of limitations, and none of them can be considered an all-in-one solution for dealing with all AI dangers. As a result, one possible research avenue is to investigate how those countermeasures could be combined to satisfy both security and performance goals.Zhang et al. (2021) are trying to convince their audience that applying TBL and 360-degree evaluation feedback is suitable for engineering education. If Industry 4.0 is to be effectively embraced across the construction industry, enhanced BIM competencies for the AECO sector are critical; engineering educational programs play a significant role in achieving this important goal. The unique combination of TBL and 360-degree evaluation feedback as part of the engineering capstone project plays a vital role in developing, evaluating, and acquiring educational capacity in undergraduate engineering majors, according to this empirical research study. The relationship between 360-degree assessment feedback and TBL integration to enable BIM competences in MEP systems for engineering students is the subject of this study, which is the first of its kind. The findings of the case study analysis show that BIM competencies are developed through all-around evaluation feedback and practice. The findings also show that collaborative ability has a significant impact, particularly in the cycle of evaluation, feedback, and improvement through reflection, which is critical for students’ BIM competency development.The contents of
both articles provide a comprehensive approach on their topics. The goal of articles is to inform the audience about their findings. The articles also want to convince the audience in importance of their work. The organization of articles is similar to each other, yet Benzaid and Taleb (2020) article has many sub-topics that help readers to understand the text properly. For example, there are various sb-topics related to 5G network management and risk assessment. The paragraphs of both articles are long and contain factual data along with their analysis. Each paper provides in depth literature review that states about the state of scholarship for the current time and some insights on aspects that were addressed in the literature. These previous scholarly works were cited by the use of Harvard citation style. From a reader’s perspective, the chosen citation style was suitable and convenient to check the sources.The used methodology in both papers differs as they examine substantially different topics. Zhang et al. (2020) research study’s framework is separated into five sections. The study started with a look at BIM education and capstone projects in MEP systems, as well as TBL and 360-degree evaluation feedback in education. Second, in the BIM capstone, the TBL educational approach was devised, which was integrated with 360-degree evaluation feedback. This BIM capstone project approach (i.e., TBL paired with BIM 360-degree evaluation feedback) seeks to assist students and teachers through MEP systems teaching and practice, and its teaching content can be tailored to various engineering specialties’ needs. Third, TBL was paired with
360-degree evaluation feedback in the BIM capstone, followed by the use of 360-degree evaluation feedback to evaluate students’ learning outcomes and BIM competency, using a university in China as an example. Finally, the students’ teamwork, professional qualities, and BIM expertise were discussed, as well as the benefits of the BIM capstone project and suggestions for improvement.The experimental research method was used in this work, and a case study method was used to describe the BIM capstone project in detail. The goal is to use the new capstone project in conjunction with TBL and 360-degree evaluation feedback as an intervention measure to see how it affects BIM capability. It was not possible to construct a control group due to the small number of students in this major, the same learning resources and environment for all participants, and the need to complete the requirements of the graduation audit and graduate easily. As a result, we used a series of experimental designs for comparative testing to determine the impact of the new capstone program’s implementation. The comparison of the experimental design’s learning effect aids in the exploration of the potential usefulness of new teaching techniques and curriculum innovation, which is appropriate for this study’s experimental setting. A semi-structured interview, evaluation criteria for capstone results, capstone scores and comparative test scores, and a review of the capstone process logbook are all part of the data gathering process for this study.With regards to Benzaid and Taleb (2020) study, unlike Zhang et al. (2021), they provide potential actions of attackers to 5G
Historical OverviewMultiple religions characterize Brazil as the Church emerged due to the Portuguese conquests. It is believed that the first religion to enter Brazil with the Portuguese was Catholicism. The starting point is the Catholic Mass of 1500, verified by some of the first colonizers. Subject to the strong influence of colonization and the rigidity of their forces, Brazil struggled to cope with the religious onslaught. Missionary and educational activities helped strengthen Catholicism and the formation of elite communities. Although the influence was strong, early Catholicism intertwined traditional motifs and cultural beliefs.Catholicism spread to Brazil for two centuries: monasteries and indigenous church schools. By 1551 a separate diocese was formed, and then the first bishop became the head of the religious current. By the end of the 17th century, Bahia became the seat of Catholicism, followed by bishoprics in Rio de Janeiro, Pernambuco, and Maranhão. Bishops, orders, and holy clergy led the Catholic Church to unite the people. During the period of Catholicism, the citizens of Brazil fought for their independence, trying to find a way to overthrow the colonial system. Brazilian independence was declared in 1822, after which the first Brazilian constitution was adopted. The constitution regulated the rights and freedoms of Brazilian citizens and freedom of religion. It led to the Roman Catholic Church becoming the state church, so believers were legally protected. In 1889 Brazil declared itself a republic, after which the Church was separated from the state.Until 1930, the Catholic Church had a strong influence on the population’s life. The Church intervened
a country of tolerance, including racial-religious, tolerance figures for minority religions are still far from ideal. In general, the state preserves the rights of citizens to freedom of religion, but there is a pronounced aggressive attitude toward people of Afro-Brazilian faiths. Discrimination cases are pretty frequent, but there are still hotlines, human rights organizations, and structures to promote other religions.The number of churches in Brazil is nearly 300, with dioceses and archdioceses. Often churches as organizations are vital instruments of pressure on social life. It creates more prejudices about religion, leading to new social conflicts. Although the political situation with religion is unstable, support for the educational aspects is strong. Despite the decline of Catholicism, more than 30 universities in Brazil are supported by the Catholic diocese. The Pontifical Catholic University of Minas Gerais is recognized as the best among the private universities, providing predominantly academic training but with a permanent message of social inclusion.Competition and discrimination between movements caused Catholicism to surrender to the influence of other denominations. Protestantism in Brazil is growing steadily, the crucial branch being the Pentecostals. Their number reaches about 22% of the country’s population. In the 21st century, we can state that the religious agenda is returning to Brazil. The expansion of the new heavyweights of religious-political space – Protestants and Pentecostals in particular – will be a defining trend in the religious sphere in Brazil in the coming years. With their resources and influence, the Protestants are likely to seriously challenge the traditional player, the Catholic Church.
The Rise of the Trans-Atlantic Slave Trade in Western Africa, 1300–1589 is a book by Toby Green that examines conditions in Iberia and West Africa in the 14 th and 15 th centuries that set the stage for the subsequent complex interactions between Europeans and Africans. Despite the title, the book mostly focuses on 1460 to 1589, when Cape Verde Islands hosted most of the trade. The book will interest Atlantic explorers and the general public curious about European expansion and maritime trade (Shumway 731). However, it may not be the most accurate predictor of the subsequent historical events. Green thoroughly analyzes Cape Verde as becoming a place where European colonizers shipped, traded, and used enslaved Africans for agricultural cultivation. He then portrays the settlers from Iberia, mostly New Christian Jews, arguing that their prior exposure to violence and exclusion in Europe influenced how they based a new society on slavery and the slave trade in the new location. The narrative then compares the African situation with other slave trades, including Islamic slave-owners engaged in the trans-Saharan trade, Mandinka diaspora, and early slave trade from Upper Guinea by Portuguese. Drawing on archival sources in Europe, Latin America, and the Caribbean, most of the narrative focuses almost exclusively on coastal and island locations of the Iberian trade. Additionally, inland Africa and places in Europe and the Americas connected to Cape Verde by sea trade are occasionally mentioned. Green covers the earliest European maritime activity and settlement phase in the Cape Verde Islands and the West African coast
picture: for instance, the Upper Guinea slave trade before 1589 represents only 1-2 % of the total slave trade. Greene’s desire to ‘redefine’ the entire transatlantic slave trade and emphasize the dominant role of Cape Verde and Upper Guinea discredits the extant historical work of on the early slave trade from West-Central Africa. Furthermore, the exaggerated claim about Atlantic colonization impacted by the African slave trade habits calls for additional analysis. While the narrative certainly contributes to a historical understanding of the Atlantic world formation, it doubtfully advances one’s understanding of later world histories, such as the colonization of Africa and economic globalization (Shumway 730). Moreover, Green claims that historians have failed to appreciate the impact of the extermination of the Native American population on the subsequent forced migration of Africans to the Americas. Such a claim is untrue – there is prevailing acknowledged information on America’s labor shortage and its’ impact of increased colonists’ demand for slaves in public education (Shumway 730). Overall, The Rise of the Trans-Atlantic Slave Trade in Western Africa, 1300-1589 contributes to the historical understanding of the beginning of the European slave trade in Africa and places the Cape Verde Islands at the center of its history.
The work Promises and challenges of Blockchain in education by Jae Park examines the blockchain concept, which has the potential to become a leading socio-economic technology in the context of network neutrality and big data. This study suggests that current trends in the Internet space will set new standards for digital ownership and storage. A comprehensive study of industrial and financial blockchain will greatly contribute to crypto education, crypto administration, human resources management, financial procurement, and other related fields.The principal purpose of the study is to observe the proposed tasks set by blockchain technology and the challenges expected in this direction. Blockchain was originally developed to operate with digital documents in 1991. In 2009, the technology started to be used in terms of cryptocurrency and has been proving its effectiveness for a long time (Park, 2021). The leading purpose of blockchain technology is to sidestep the violation of identity and information transmission. Avoiding any suspense is conducted with the help of blockchain. The technology preserves all data regarding the virtual identity and transactions, which is transparent to all parties involved but severely secured by well-built cryptography. The paper also explains the successful usage of blockchain in any aspect of intellectual property, copyright, and licensing. It describes the advantages and mechanisms of blockchain application in industrial sectors and education systems. Despite the proven effectiveness of the technology, the main challenge is the lack of promotion of learning on the blockchain. It can be supported by the evidence of other research papers such as the work by Delgado-von-Eitzen et al. (2021). Technological learning requires large financial investments, continuous intellectual effort, and directives, which currently face a lack of focus on sustainability.Blockchain technology has a great potential to provide benefits to society and collective interests. Blockchain courses can become an integral part of any educational content for positions in government and political sectors of work (Bartolomé et al., 2017). The paper of Park claims that now the main charge is to create a stable educational program regarding technology with an emphasis on cooperation and social responsibility.
the rest of society. However, there is still no consensus on free will and responsibility.Causal indeterminism is the theory that free actions do not have to be caused by anything, nor do they have any intrinsic causal structure. It argues that free actions must be uncaused, while others admit they can be caused by non-deterministically. The main disadvantage of such a theory is that the individual’s luck argues it (Pleasants, 2019). According to this argument, if some previous events cause action, it is not up to the person to perform it. Thus, based on this theory, many people can justify their actions only by chance while exonerating themselves from responsibility.Speaking of free will, one should also say about how it moves, namely, about the soul. The human soul remains responsible for all committed actions since they have reasons for them. It is much more difficult to give a clear definition of the concept of the soul than of matter (Pleasants, 2019). Since ancient times, it has been believed that the physical shell of the soul, the human body, acts as matter, so we can easily define matter. We can define the soul as the consciousness of matter, its mental world, responsible for it.
SummaryThe analyzed research was dedicated to discussing the essential role of nurses in diagnostic error prevention. The researcher estimated nurses’ engagement in the diagnosis process based on the empirical literature review. Then, they proposed the conceptual framework of how the medical organization can reduce diagnosis errors. The conceptual framework was oriented toward designing and offering the model to expand the nurses’ engagement in the diagnostic process. The last step was to present the results of the framework appliance. Based on the theoretical literature review, the research authors provided an extensive model of full nursing engagement called the tripartite framework (Baker et al., 2017). The model included three essential components: interprofessional teamwork, patient empowerment, and the nurses’ engagement in identifying the diagnostic signs (Baker et al., 2017). According to the practical model appliance, the outcomes showed a decrease in diagnostic errors and misses, increased diagnosis time, and total growth in patient safety rates (Baker et al., 2017). The model also emphasized the role of the patient experience and engagement in the diagnosis process through the nurses.The structured literature data presented in the form of the framework was applied within the particular organization. The empirical results contributed to the formulation of the four potential barriers to nursing engagement, including culture, education, regulation, and operations (Baker et al., 2017). Scientists also provided the solutions to mentioned challenges as an additional part of the conceptual framework. Concerning the cultural barrier, the psychology of the nurses’ self-identification was a vital problem. A vast percentage of nurses and clinicians supposed that nurses
overcome, the subsequent framework appliance is supposed to reduce diagnosis errors.Variables and TheoryDuring their investigation, researchers provided the practical scientific experiments results which were conducted earlier to prove that the solutions are reasonable and relevant to the topic. Such theoretical variables showed that the medical providers managed to reduce the diagnosis risks by applying some of the frameworks’ concepts. Therefore, the researchers combined the results of the developed framework research and the comparative analysis of other scientific experiments to design and structure the barriers for their model appliance. The conceptual model included specific guidance to increase the nurses’ engagement in the diagnosis. Due to the extensive literature review, the model was detailed and easy to use in practice. As a result, its implementation within a separate medical organization was a comprehensible task. However, the question of whether it will be working on a broader range of variables arises.
StorytellingMost leaders and those who want to become one have heard about the importance of leadership qualities. Often, these abilities include various skills related to communication, emotional intelligence, professionalism, confidence, and ethics. However, not all leaders consider the powerful tool of storytelling. People view the world from their point of view for most of their lives. One point of view will never give a complete picture of what is happening. When a person hears the story of the interlocutor, he feels this different point of view, built on other beliefs, on a different life experience (Snyder et al., 2017). In this case, if a person is imbued with history, he is imbued with a new point of view and is already transforming his beliefs. In the hands of leaders, such a tool can change the mindset of their mentees for better results.In order to break the status quo of prejudice and stereotypes, a leader must do more than just tell a story from his life. Any leader’s narrative contains a conflict, structure that is understandable to the interlocutor, and often hidden morality that prompts people to take the necessary action. Today we will talk about how storytelling from the mouth of a leader can become one of the main tools of leadership processes and why everyone benefits from it.AdvantagesStories are memorable, inspiring, and naturally transform often dry information. It often turns out that storytelling is the only possible way to convey thoughts to people. Graphics, printed materials, messages are devoid of the emotional and natural component
that a person always puts into his stories. First, the leader demonstrates his humanity by telling stories that, for many employees, the boss’s fear is a step forward towards a relationship of trust. Second, storytelling is creativity, and to some extent, even art. The same story told by two people can sound completely different. In addition, this tool promotes inclusiveness and diversification within the team since storytelling is a fundamental phenomenon for all nations, societies, and cultures and has taken place since time immemorial (Denning, 2017). Third, this tool demonstrates the experience to avoid mistakes in the future. Any story itself comes from the outside, and only through the mouth of a person, its meaning is told. A leader can communicate the vision and mission of the company through their stories, thereby engaging employees in work processes more and more. In mergers and acquisitions, storytelling for new hires is critical, far more important than salary and schedule (Orr & Bennett, 2017). Finally, stories work in situations where direct orders are ineffective (van Hulst, 2017). People cannot become creative and obey obscure rules until they know what is behind these decisions. A leader’s story is a highly reliable source in this situation. As a result, a simple human life story builds trust and relationships between leaders and employees.ImportanceOther tools for building trust between managers and employees include the following. The first tool is open communication and feedback built on fairness. In part, this tool is the flip side of storytelling in the sense that in the story,
a person shares his emotions and beliefs, and in the case of feedback, he is ready to accept the feelings and opinions of another person. The result is a complete cycle essential for the healthy development of the atmosphere and efficiency within any company. The second tool is the introduction of company values ​​and the encouragement of appreciation. The tool is built on the foundations of corporate ethics and current trends in social responsibility. Employee values ​​can also be instilled through storytelling, transformational leadership models, or training (van Hulst, 2017). As a result of these activities, both the involvement and the satisfaction of employees in the workplace increases.Do you have a story?Let me share with you a story to illustrate an unpopular point of view. Leadership qualities and all related tools can be applied not only in organizations and companies. Good governance is equally vital in simple everyday situations and complex disasters outside the office. Serious problems can arise in various spheres of human life, where the confident calmness of the leader is required. One story told by a friend of mine made a strong impression on me and fully reinforced this idea.My storyI once spoke with a close friend of mine who is very interested in Eastern philosophy and travels the world searching for answers to eternal questions. Fate brought him to Bombay, one of the largest and most resilient cities in India. On the streets, in houses, and in slums, there is always some activity very different from the traffic on the roads, for
refused to do so in fear of ruining the company’s reputation, risking many infants’ lives (Mooney, 2008). It took New Zealand’s government’s intervention for the Chinese company to admit contamination and recall the products (Mooney, 2008). As a result, more than fifty thousand children have been diagnosed with kidney stones, while four have died, according to the known statistics (Mooney, 2008). Thus, Sanlu cannot be considered a socially responsible corporation.Sanlu’s milk contamination scandal negatively affected many other parties as well. Since one of the reasons behind melamine’s usage for powder milk is the cap on prices, the government can also be blamed and criticized for the incident (Mooney, 2008). The government’s pressure also caused a delay in the recall of the products. Most milk suppliers who traded with Fonterra and Sanlu suffered significant losses in the process; some of them were arrested for adding melamine. The shareholders of Sanlu and Fonterra pressured the companies to keep quiet since they would lose all the money if the news of the contamination spread (Mooney, 2008). The media did not participate in investigating the stories of sick children due to the government’s ban on any negative news and reports that might affect the Olympics. The case of tainted milk provides evidence of how media can be pressed in manipulating crucial information flow.
the latest birthday date became the participant.Each sample consisted of a minimum quota of 400 cellphone respondents and 600 landline respondents per 1000 national adults (Saad 2012). During the research, a total of 1038 adults living in the U.S. were interviewed.The subjects were contacted via landline telephones and cellular phones. As the respondents were chosen randomly, several interviews were led in Spanish for respondents who primarily speak Spanish.The survey was conducted in December 2012; the researchers led telephone interviews with U.S. citizens from December 19 to December 22. The analysis of the collected sample was conducted after the interviewing part based on the collected data and official reports from 2011.The poll reports computed design effects for weighting as margins of sampling error. Moreover, question wrongdoing and diverse practical difficulties faced by conducting surveys can lead to error or bias in the results of opinion polls.The estimation supports my answer about the margin of error in the section f.In this experiment, the process of taking ant venom capsules each day for one week will be the explanatory variable, while a lower degree of swelling in the arthritis sufferers is the response variable.

The experimental question is whether having thumbs helps people with their daily routines more efficiently and, thus, be able to survive in case of emergency. 2. My null
tend to rely on thumbs more for handwriting. At the same time, taking the top off the soda and putting it back showed the same result for both conditions. Apparently, we do not necessarily need to use our thumbs in some activities such as this one. 9. One error occurred when I opened a book on page 56 and crumpled the book’s pages. Hence, the next time I tried to open it without using my thumbs, I could do it faster than I might have done if the pages were not crumpled. Moreover, it took some time to adjust my handwriting when writing my name in cursive without a thumb. Therefore, I think that if I had practiced at least once before the experiment, the result in the second condition would have been a little faster.
Seasonal Agriculture Worker Program (SAWP) is a governmental program that allows Canadian farmers to hire employees from the Caribbean and Mexico. Foreign workers receive temporary visas during the seasons of planting and harvest. Migrant farmworkers face problems of abuse during their working season. There are many cases of violation of labor in migrant employees, and it is essential to examine how SAWP undermines accommodations for Caribbean and Mexico migrants and seek an efficient solution.Many struggles exist in SAWP that should be fixed. For instance, migrant farmers work up to fourteen hours a day and receive a small salary. Work conditions are horrible, but workers’ complaints do not help fix the situation. Moreover, the workplaces for immigrant workers are often overcrowded; many employees report violating attitudes towards them. There is no free access to medical equipment and attention; COVID-19 is ignored, and people have to infect each other.Lack of proper resources such as masks, sanitizers, and gloves makes the work unsafe for health. Places where migrant farmworkers sleep are called bunkhouses. These bunkhouses are overcrowded with people, and workers have to sleep very close to each other; it raises the risk of infection with COVID-19 (Mojtehedzadeh, 2020). It is important to note that many workers are elderly; it is known that older people get infected and bear the disease in a far more complicated way than young people. Thus, the 55 years old Juan Lopes Chaparro died because of coronavirus when he got infected on the farm (Dubinski, 2020). “Lopez Chaparro’s death has caused shock and devastation
of Canadian employees. Moreover, migrant people often fail to find a job in their countries, and migration is the only option for them for work purposes. Many articles prove a violation of human rights and terrible working conditions (Dubinski, 2020). Many employees come “with no grasp of English and little formal education,” which allows dishonest employers to manipulate (Mojtehedzadeh, 2020, p. 3). Though these reasons are inhuman, programs such as SAWP continue to invite foreign workers.Some activists say that migrant workers should have more rights and abilities to have necessary resources and a proper day schedule. Some sources state that Canada is creating a program to avoid abusive workplaces (Mojtehedzadeh, 2020). Probably, one of the best options is to implement supporting programs that will honestly assess employers. Moreover, it is worth arranging periodic checks of the living and working conditions in the workplace. Many people strive to help migrant workers, for example, local volunteers. These people often are connected with the public administration, and in case rules are violated, volunteers can report, as migrants often do not know English. Volunteer programs might help improve the situation with abusive workplaces through checks, gathering reviews and complaints, and voluntary help if needed.
operation, increasing the speed of performance and the effectiveness of actions that are more beneficial. Their project to computerize and update all sorts of areas of the company’s activities should be fully implemented in 2022 (ADNOC, 2020). This underlines the firm’s commitment to anticipating and adapting to the future. The company strives to develop a forecasting model that would include the largest possible amount of statistical data.The results of big data processing show that ADNOC has significantly accelerated the speed and the number of financial transactions through its software. Based on the logic of increasing the turnover of money, one can conclude that this software improves the financial performance of the company. In addition, it should be noted that as part of the accelerated exchange of money, an innovative blockchain technology is used, which provides a permanent digital transfer of currency. The program’s ability to make smart business decisions is already reflected in its $ 1 billion worth of stocks (Arabian Business, 2020). The varied opportunities for financial enrichment brought by this program are potentially enormous.
The second industrial revolution, also commonly referred to as the technological revolution, denotes a period of enhanced industrialization, mass production, standardization, and scientific discovery. The first industrial revolution’s end resulted in a slowdown in essential inventions. However, the advent of the second revolution sparked numerous manufacturing innovations, like steel production, the manufacture of interchangeable parts, and innovations in the machine tool industry. Many historians dated the second industrial revolution from 1870 to the First World War in 1914.The second industrial revolution played a critical role in urbanization. Initially, up to 80% of humankind resided in rural areas and depended on animal husbandry and farming (Huberman et al., 2017). The staggering expansion of telegraph and rail lines, gas, sewage systems, and water supply led to a population boom in concentrated regions, resulting in urbanization. The simultaneous introduction of novel technological systems like electrification led to massive migrations to industrialized areas/ towns. For instance, about 10% of Britons resided in London at the end of the 19 th Century, while regions like Manchester also experienced vast population influxes.The surge in urbanization resulted in the exploitation of the working class. As industrialization picked pace, there were no laws regulating worker conditions, and power belonged to a few wealthy individuals as the factory working class suffered. Many slums emerged in the urban areas, and child labor became commonplace. During the population boom in urban regions, contagious diseases became more prevalent. Thousands of people died of ailments like cholera and tuberculosis in centers like London (Kennedy, 2020). At the same time, the industrial revolution led to an unprecedented increase in consumerism and materialism, especially with the technological advancements that produced new goods and services for the masses.The most pronounced impacts of the industrial revolution and urbanization were pollution and environmental destruction. New machines needed large amounts of energy to operate them, resulting in the massive burning of fossil fuels which caused air pollution and smog (Eisen, 2018). The release of industrial effluent and untreated human waste into rivers and the clearing of forests to create space for settlers led to unbridled environmental damage. The period also marked the production of chemicals like plastics, dyes, and pharmaceuticals, which impacted human and ecological health.
The Signal and the Noise by Nate Silver reveals a heartfelt approach to statistical interpretations and predictions of data. The text explains why so many predictions fail and how researchers fall victim to masses of data while finding important signals is mostly a matter of caution, diligence, and correctly assessing one’s abilities. The text asserts that most predictions are wrong because the investigators poorly understand uncertainty and probability. A certain statistical problem is presented and evaluated; then, a tentative solution is offered.The author also suggests that statisticians can often benefit from applying multiple perspectives toward a problem. However, while it might be possible to obtain multiple data sets for something like weather forecasts, such an approach becomes more challenging with a field like economics or politics. Silver (145) argues that many statistical errors occur when researchers attempt to predict too accurately and are overly confident in their abilities. He implies that while economic and weather forecasts are equally coarse, economic ones attempt to predict polls and rates in exact numbers rather than settling for an expected range of outcomes (Silver 146). Thus, combining multiple attempts with various predictions will yield a more accurate result.Furthermore, the current overabundance of nearly any data type results in muddling the real signals. Given the human tendency to seek patterns, people perceive them where they do not exist and build predictions based on false alarms. Silver (155) reminds the readers that “correlation does not imply causation.” For instance, with the sheer multitude of economic indicators, some coincidental correlations are bound to
wrong to believe that applying an ideal and universal model to a given problem is possible, given the often intermixed and incomplete nature of the real world. However, Silver (327) notes that imperfect predictability is not an excuse to abandon action altogether – he draws on the example of climate change, admitting the uncertainty in climate models. However, this uncertainty justifies the need to focus on climate change mitigation because the potential risk of the problem being worse than anticipated entails much more negative consequences than in the median case.In conclusion, The Signal and the Noise encourages its readers to honor the Bayesian, ‘probabilistic,’ way of thinking regardless of whether it may seem uncomfortable at first. The narrative calls to know where the prior beliefs and future assumptions are coming from to make truly careful and exact predictions. Furthermore, Silver (368) encourages statisticians to try and err, making many attempts and tests of the ideas that come to mind. The author ponders human perceptions of predictability, warning the researchers against the common bias of thinking that they are better at prediction than in reality. Overall, this book presents a powerful argument supporting scientific mindset and critical thinking using reliable data analysis.
The social determinants of health are the conditions in the environment in which people live, learn, work, play, worship, and age. I agree that the social environment in which people live can affect their health status. Health outcomes are not determined solely by biological factors or access to quality health care (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, n.d.). Resources that improve the quality of life can significantly impact the health of a population.Examples of these resources include safe and affordable housing, access to education, public safety, availability of healthy food, local emergency services, and an environment free of life-threatening toxins (Office of Disease Prevention and Health Promotion, n.d.). I also support the recent shift in the view that it is solely up to the individual to influence their health in favor of recognizing the significant impact of external influences on it. In the modern world, very little depends on the individual. At first glance, he can choose what to eat, whether to exercise, and whether to seek medical care in a timely manner.In fact, most of the choices that affect health are made by the marketing machine, the government, and life circumstances. For example, modern advertising presses from all sides, forcing one to choose specific products that are often not conducive to a healthy lifestyle. The need to work hard to earn money for these products pushes people to sacrifice a healthy sleep schedule and exercise. This chain has many links, but the result is always the same: people’s health is largely not up to them. External factors also indirectly affect health, such as health inequalities. When I read the CDC (2022) report on these inequalities, I was most surprised by the racial and ethnic inequalities. In an era of globalization and liberalization of society, a phenomenon like racism must be eradicated. The field of health care is one in which treating people equally is sometimes vital. That is why I believe that racial and ethnic discrimination in this area must be eradicated in the first place.
several provocations tightened relations with the country on the eve of the war.The liberation of Cuba seemed like a financially attractive prospect for the US and provided strategic advantages. In addition, the American empire was then just gaining momentum and already had a successful experience in appropriating other territories of the Western Hemisphere (Kagan, 2019). The American government portrayed the unleashed war as a battle for the interests of Cuba and relied on the facts of human rights violations to legitimize military action.In April, a ten-week war began in which the United States defeated the Spanish army and navy. Under the Treaty of Paris in 1898, the United States gained control of the island. In 1899, the island was occupied, and a few years later, the government received permission to place naval bases. The position of the American government is technically just, but in essence, it turns out to be a less cruel form of occupation of the island. Using the facts of the oppression of the Cuban population, the United States enlisted the support of the rebel movement. It acquired the moral right to occupy the territory for its purposes.
related to the indigenous population of America, as they contribute to the development of the ecosystem in which they live, which makes them extremely important. The indigenous population also has a legend that spirit bears could swim deep underwater and bring people to a magical place. Spirit bears can often be found in the Great Bear Rainforest, with almost seven million hectares of rainforest (Langlois, 2017). Another feature of these animals is a particular love for salmon. In addition, bears eat berries, insects, plants, fruits, and nuts (Service, 2017). Kermodes are also very shy and mystical, which also causes the difficulty of finding them and the rarity of finding people. In conclusion, Spirit bears are rare representatives of bears who, because of their unique white color, are considered to be holy and sacred by the indigenous population of America.
set clear goals and objectives which it can use as a guide in its business operations. The company also needs to limit its threats which include competition from other firms dealing with the same product line. It can do this by producing high quality surf boards which can give it some competitive advantage. The company can also take advantage of its opportunities by looking into the possibility of expanding its product line to capture a large market (Teoli et al., 2021). It can venture into producing low value boards for the lower section of the market.The purpose of SWOT analysis is to help the company to identify its strengths and weaknesses, opportunities and threats in the market. It can also be used to help the organization to identify the best way to achieve future growth or handle a current situation to propel the business in the right direction (Visual Paradigm, 2022). SWOT analysis will help Sun City Boards to realize the importance of setting goals that are derived from its mission and vision statements. The company will also realize the importance of having mission and vision statements as a planning tool. The SWOT analysis will help the company to understand its position and encourage it to create ideas and decisions on how to build on its strengths, capitalize on its opportunities, limit its weaknesses, and help in the creation of business opportunities.
The main topic of discussion is the Supreme Court’s cancellation of vaccines and weekly check-ups against the coronavirus mandate for businesses. According to the mandate, OSHA would become the regulatory body for compliance with the rule at any enterprise with more than 100 employees. Contrary to the acute coronavirus situation, the Supreme Court recognized that OSHA exceeded its authority since the right to comply with such a mandate should remain with the employer.One of the points of view is that the COVID situation is getting worse, and the mandate was a logical continuation of Biden’s policy to combat coronavirus. According to CNBC’s analysis of Johns Hopkins University data, more than 731,000 new daily infections were registered in seven days, which is 4% more than the previous week (Kimball, 2022; January 25, para. 11). However, during the discussion, the point of view was expressed that the decision to comply with the mandate should not be binding but remain with the employer.The main argument is that such measures are too radical, and the picture of the disease cases is not considered entirely. The Supreme Court also agrees with this opinion, which concluded that ETS went beyond the regulation of workplace safety and entered the territory of broad public health measures (Bickel et al., 2022). The court also explained that coronavirus infection was included in universal risk diseases and could be compared with the risk of everyday dangers, which has nothing to do with the employee’s workplace (Bickel et al., 2022). The final argument against the mandate’s introduction may be that OSHA did not have enough historical practice to conduct such a broad experiment. This leads to the logical conclusion that the court’s decision and the point of view expressed in the discussion are fully justified and have much more negative sides than it seems at first glance.
Today, the importance of technology makes many people prefer to scroll through the timeline rather than get a few hours of sleep. Teenagers who are deprived of controlling their free time or filtering information coming from social networks are especially susceptible to this. Absorbing all the information that the Internet introduces, teenagers tend to stop evaluating the acquired knowledge sensibly. This leads to a deterioration of mental state physical health and increases the risk of falling into the hands of fraudsters. Since the spread of the Internet provides easier access to extensive knowledge and carries hidden harm, research has been conducted to analyze the impact of the Internet on adolescents. These studies were aimed at identifying the dangers that teenagers face on the Internet, finding their causes and measures that can help overcome them. This paper examines some of the main effects of new technologies on adolescents and young people, including deterioration of the physical and mental condition, increased risk of becoming a victim of a fraudster, and the gradual loss of moral values in an entire generation.The interest of young people in social networks has specific consequences in the form of mental and physical health problems. For example, sitting in a constantly uncomfortable posture while checking social networks leads to the deterioration of the neck and back, provoking chronic pain in these areas. Moreover, bright light contributes to the damage of vision and sleep disorders, such as lack of sleep or even insomnia. Online interactions affect a teen’s emotional state, which can never be restored
vision of tobacco and alcohol, technologies, where not all information is filtered and suitable for children and adolescents, also harm moral values.The growing popularity of technology among young people has also led to an increase in their involvement in the sex industry, leading to a rise in crime and the experience of traumatic experiences by adolescents. Viewing prohibited materials causes the appearance of curiosity, which means the risk of harmful sexual contact even with the right person is becoming possible. New technologies and poor awareness of teenagers have also led to an increased risk of sharing an intimate photo on the Internet with an unfamiliar person. The possibility of involving children in the porn industry is also greatly simplified, which sometimes happens by the voluntary consent of a teenager due to the influence of the availability of sexual content (Senadjki et al. 63). As a result, the number of sexual crimes, where the victims are teenagers, is increasing because of the lack of filtering information in social networks.From all of the above, it follows that the Internet has a huge negative impact of unverified information on the still unformed personalities of teenagers. All this leads to the understanding that the quantity and quality of resources viewed by teenagers must be controlled. Moreover, it is worth raising awareness among young people about the dangers and risks that await them with excessive use of technology.
agree that the telescope can be the conduit of information for astronomers, and with its help, they can gather new data and make new discoveries. Nevertheless, I disagree that it is the only source of achieving such significant results in the astronomy.Consequently, as has been mentioned by Van Helden, different methods of encouragement of telescope makers were used. There are also other sciences that contribute to the development of engineering. For example, physics and chemistry focus on the appliance of knowledge about forces, pressure, and chemicals and their combination. The most recent developments might include the development of new technologies like phones or modern motors for vehicles. Moreover, while the advancements have been so big, there are no fields of engineering which are prohibited. Specific developments might be prohibited if they jeopardize the health or lives of people. The activity of engineering is, therefore, controlled by special laws.Hence, the development of telescopes and the improvement of the lenses gave an impetus to the advances in astronomy. While the telescope was first used as a terrestrial tool, it soon became astronomers’ tool. With the help of telescope-makers and developments of lenses, it was possible to make discoveries. However, other kinds of sciences, such as physics and chemistry, contribute to the technological advancements of our time. While there are no strong prohibitions of engineering, it is unlawful to jeopardize the health or lives of people.
they were a band groomed by the entertainment industry with an emphasis on television performances which took away much of the authenticity, even when compared to their counterparts The Beatles, who although made visual content, focused on their own music strongly (Covach and Flory 212).Television drastically went on to change the landscape of the music industry. First, a split formed among artists and fans, with one side focusing on the pop-oriented, performance-focused television music, while the other, typically older audience was drawn to serious-minded music of rock which continued to be played on the radio rather than TV. Television also brought about the phenomenon of fictious bands, such as the popular Archies, a cartoon drawn band popular with young teens (Covach and Flory 214). This has never been done before and similarly created a new genre of music-television entertainment. However, until the advent of cable-network of television resulting in dedicated channels such as MTV, the television phenomenon in the 1960s had its limitations. Most TV sets at the time had poor audio and visual quality, and as recording and radio sound quality improved with hi-fi recording and FM, the disparities were noticeable. Television is not by nature of design a sound medium, and the musical experience is meant to be enveloping leading to the split in the fanbase, where younger audiences who generally cared less about sound quality appreciated the visual medium to their music (Frith 279).
Artificial intelligence in marketing is a method of using customer data and AI concepts, including machine learning, to predict the next step of the consumer and meet his needs, even those that the consumer has not yet formulated. The evolution of Big data and advanced analytical solutions have enabled marketers to create a clearer picture of their target audience than ever before. It is advisable to consider in more detail the tools of artificial intelligence used by large companies for a deep understanding of consumers.Marketers are trying to understand the vast repository of data understand the root cause and likelihood of repeating certain actions, so machine learning platforms are needed to help identify trends or common events and anticipate key ideas and reactions (Ma & Sun, 2020). Machine learning can be used not only to reveal previously hidden ideas but also to teach and implement open ideas in new PR campaigns, optimizing consumer reach, focusing only on relevant users.Big data is a concept of the ability of marketers to aggregate and segment large amounts of data with minimal manual consumption. In the digital economy, there are thousands of data points attached to the target audience that can be accurately analyzed by bots to understand which message someone will like (Wirth, 2018). Marketers can then use this data to deliver the right message to the right person at the right time on the chosen channel.Numerous elements and factors are now influencing the current reality of companies in the market. They’re complicated, highly connected, and can be tough
RN with a current New York license that has moved to Texas and applied for a Texas license. On application, she wrote that she was convicted of Medicaid fraud ($ 5,230.00) four years ago be off probation in six months. In this circumstance, the nursing board will examine the case as if it were any other. According to Texas Board of Nursing policies on fraud, will thoroughly investigate various factors surrounding this event. However, the board clearly defines fraud over $5,000 as a felony (Stowell et al., 2020). In such a situation, the board will advise the nurse because it will most likely deny the practice license based on this information. If the nurse license is approved, it will very certainly come with conditions, such as the nurse not being allowed to work with Medicare patients.
The theme of education is not central yet tightly woven into both “Everyday Use” by Alice Walker and “Sonny’s Blues” by James Baldwin. Exploring this theme in two short stories revealed that Baldwin made a more significant focus on education comparable to Walker. Nonetheless, both stories contain similar notions, topics, and perceptions of education. Both works highlight and discuss the impact of education’s presence or absence on the characters’ lives.These short stories tell about siblings: Walker’s work narrates about two sisters while Baldwin describes the life of two brothers. In both stories, one of the siblings graduated from high school while another lacked education. Thereby, it seems that stories aim to compare the lives and intelligence of siblings. Initially, in both stories, the authors emphasize the success linked to education and the necessity of school attendance. Sonny’s brother claims that Sonny is “going to be sorry later” if he does not finish school (Baldwin 34). Sonny’s brother meant that education was the only way to prosper and forget the disadvantaged past; that is why finishing school was a condition that the narrator has set for Sonny (Baldwin 34). On the contrary, Mama, the narrator of “Everyday Use”, mentioned “a lot of knowledge we didn’t necessarily need to know,” referring to her daughter’s Dee education (Walker 50). She does not exaggerate the importance of education because she was not educated but had a lot of valuable knowledge and skills.Interestingly, in both stories, uneducated siblings appear wiser and more aware of specific topics and issues. Back in time, education might create a delusion about one’s intelligence, overstating the significance of existing knowledge and competencies. Education was perceived as a privilege in the stories, and those who could attend high school and graduate seemed to be given the right to condemn less fortunate people by default. Stories of Walker and Baldwin revealed the truth: particular skills, worldly knowledge, daily human experiences, and understandings of life frequently cannot be achieved in high school.
Ethical egoism is a normative theory that advocates that a person’s own good is consistent with the concept of morality. Ethical egoism also does not require moral agents to prejudice the interests and well-being of others by making their moral choices. Thus, ethical egoism claims that actions whose consequences benefit the performer of these actions are ethical. A possible moral choice in the situation can also be interpreted from the point of view of the theory of existentialism and hedonism.Point of View of the Theory of Ethical EgoismOn the one hand, it seems that Nora’s impulse to copy off a friend’s report is consistent with the basic concepts of ethical egoism because she will benefit from this action. However, the concept of ethical egoism does not necessarily entail that, in pursuit of one’s interests, people should always do what they want if the fulfillment of momentary desires can negatively affect a person in the future. A thoughtlessly written off report entails quite tangible consequences, and getting a poor mark is only one of them. If it is possible to choose a good variant without harming others, then it is the right choice. Setting up a friend in this way will not lead to a good outcome for Nora: she will lose her trust and ruin her reputation. Thus, from the point of view of ethical egoism, Nora must weigh the risks and make a choice in favor of the minimum negative consequences for herself, taking into account the possibility of a damaged relationship with the friend,
loss of reputation, a poor mark, as well as possible shame for what she did.Point of View of Other Ethical TheoriesOne of the most advantageous theories applicable to the whole situation is the ethical theory of existentialism. Evaluation of Nora’s moral choice is impossible from the point of view of theories based on the result obtained during the analysis since it is unpredictable in this situation. If Nora writes off the work, she and her friend will be in danger of being punished. However, everything can go well, and no one will notice the decommissioned work. There is another option: if Nora honestly tells the teacher that she does not have enough time to finish the work, the punishment can be mitigated. Nora can also ask her classmate for help; perhaps together, they will have enough time to do something before the deadline. From the existential point of view, the very fact of having a free choice makes a person exist, which means that it is not so important whether the choice is good or bad. On the other hand, the concept of hedonism puts the pleasure of the individual above anything else; the attempt to avoid punishment and the possible benefit, as well as the pleasure of resolving the situation, can be worth deception.Ethical Issues of Using DronesIn the 2010s, the US administration adopted a drone program; over several years, five hundred and sixty-three drone strikes were carried out in Pakistan, Somalia, and Yemen, killing more than 800 civilians. Naturally, questions about the ethics of
using such weapons quickly arose in society. The moral question, not based on legality, is whether it is morally good or bad to use drones. The main moral issue regarding drones is the ambiguous impact of this technology on the pilots’ health.The government’s point of view suggests that remote weapon drones are a good solution for minimizing physical costs in the military. Indeed, drone pilots are not physically present on the battlefield. However, although the pilots are not near the drone, they play a major role from the ethical side of the issue. Moreover, the risks to human life and health are not limited to physical damage. Many cases of psychological stress of operations’ participants have been registered, and the harm of moral injuries negatively affects health as physical ones. Some may argue that the psychological harm to the drone pilot is exaggerated, but technology does not standstill. Rapidly advancing technology in general calls for a rethinking of many ethical issues (Quinn, 2020). As this technology improves, RPA pilots will see the target not as mere pixels but as a person; therefore, increased psychological consequences are inevitable.One more ethical issue is associated with the use of drones related to the difficulty of the decision to start a war on the part of the state. The possibility of remote warfare makes the decision to start a war too easy. Therefore, any decision to start a war under such circumstances may be unfair. Another ethical complication is how far the goals of such a war justify the means:
civilian casualties and danger to the pilot. Of course, casualties among the population are inevitable in the conduct of any war; with drone technology, casualties can be minimized, but it does not occur. It is still impossible to imagine a war completely remote from all sides. Even if the drone pilot himself is safe, the person supporting the operation from the ground is in mortal danger. Thus, the assumption that long-range combat capabilities lead to risk-free wars is empirically untenable.The Drawbacks of the Utilitarianism Ethical TheoryThe standard definition of utilitarianism is that actions are defined as ‘right’ or ‘correct’ based on their ability to promote happiness. If any action causes a backlash, it can be called ‘wrong.’ Such thinking assumes that the goal justifies the means to achieve a particular result. Utilitarianism suggests that if an action brings more happiness than any other available alternative, that choice is considered the right one. From a utilitarian point of view, actions are considered right only if the outcome of the decision maximizes what is classified as good versus what can be considered bad. Thus, utilitarianism comes from the assumption that happiness is always good for a person. The concept of utilitarianism has several disadvantages: not considering the unpredictability of future results, the subjectivity of the concept of happiness, the features of feeling happiness, and the possibility of absolute dominance of the majority.One of the main drawbacks of utilitarianism is that it focuses on the outcome of a choice rather than the action itself. There is no moral judgment
‘Global complementation’ refers to a process that restructures production plants from being local producers of a good into being able to create the same product for export. This concept was first seen during a crisis situation occurring in a Toyota manufacturing plant in Thailand. Sales of Toyota cars dropped by fifty percent within a month in terms of local sales. Toyota made the decision to refurbish this plant into an export-focused facility. It took time but resulted in a beneficial outcome, with the Thailand plant being able to manufacture products for non-local sales. Toyota representatives stated that if the plant was initially designed to switch between local and international sales, the loss would be minimal.The phrase ‘global complementation’ was coined by Toyota themselves and essentially can be summarized as a strategy that transforms old manufacturing plants to be able to shift between producing cars for local markets and manufacturing for export. It prioritizes flexibility and adaptability while minimizing the loss and time cost of restructuring plants only after observing market fluctuation. Toyota themselves described the strategy as a crisis that was turned into an opportunity.The strategy has a number of advantages and disadvantages. The strategy is an expensive and time-consuming process as Toyota will have to restructure every plant they have in the world to be prepared for their losses in any market. If they continue to observe market failures, their transformation of the plants will have no value as there will be no demand for their products. However, this strategy also allows for plants to continue working instead of simply being shut down and thereby continue to provide jobs and profit. Additionally, the initial flexibility of new plants can be beneficial in the long term.
In order to better understand the higher prevalence of diabetes within the county, it is essential to observe both national and local trends of the illness. According to the CDC (2022), while new cases of diabetes have steadily decreased over the decades, the prevalence of the disease among people aged below twenty has not. Similarly, the prevention and management of diabetes among older adults is largely unsatisfactory and could be vastly improved. A number of socio-cultural factors also influence the prevalence of diabetes. For instance, individuals with Hispanic backgrounds are more prone to have the condition. Other factors such as age, smoking, physical inactivity, and obesity among residents could also be impacting the prominence of diabetes.Within the setting of the county, it is likely that age, elevated hypertension, and Hispanic backgrounds are the main risk factors for residents. While age and increased blood pressure are more common risks for type 2 diabetes, the Hispanic background component may be a more recent development that is influenced by a number of social factors (National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases, n.d.).While Hispanic individuals have a mild genetic predisposition to diabetes that may be affected by traditional foods that are rich in carbohydrates, lack of access to healthcare is the most prominent risk factor. A study has found that health insurance disparities, low income, and lacking awareness of the condition among Hispanic individuals have played a role in an increase in cases of diabetes (Bauer, 2017). As such, the collected information suggests that many individuals currently lack education and knowledge concerning preventive measures for diabetes. This would require the formation of appropriate information regarding diabetes prevention and management.
Panama is a developing country with a fast-growing economy located in Central America. It has one of the highest GDPs in Latin America but is not devoid of domestic economic problems, such as income inequality and poverty. This paper aims to review two current news articles about Panama, which reveal the issue of the high unemployment rate in this country, which continues to increase and has taken the form of a crisis.The first article appeared in a Panama news outlet called Newsroom Panama . It reports that, in 2021, 108,975 people in Panama were searching for a job, and the unemployment rates among women were higher than among men (Newsroom Panama, 2022). Unemployment results from a lack of new jobs, and the government has to pay subsidies to its citizens to help them survive (Newsroom Panama, 2022). This article is consistent with my findings that, despite fast economic growth, Panama has been experiencing increasing unemployment rates in recent years.The second article was published in Valley Post and is entitled “Job Creation is a Challenge for Panama.” It reports that COVID-19 has significantly affected employment in the tourism, retail, real estate, and construction sectors in Panama (Arzu, 2022). This source is consistent with my findings that the majority of the population in Panama is occupied in the service industry. When the main economic sectors cannot operate as usual, the country experiences a rise in unemployment.In conclusion, Panama is an export-oriented country, and services constitute the basis of its economy. Although the country’s economy is growing, this growth is not noticeable to its citizens, many of whom cannot find a formal full-time job. In order to address this issue, the country needs to increase the qualification of its labor force and create new jobs, for example, by investing in infrastructure.
The devastation and challenges of World War II were tremendous. The U.S. faced severe and significant objectives that would define the future state of America and European countries. It was essential for the U.S. to oppose Communist expansion in Europe and Asia, so there were specific policies that addressed this aim, and evaluating their efficiency and success may provide valuable insights.First, it is essential to discuss the policy of containment that was adopted by America and its allies. The purpose of this strategy was to prevent the spread of communism and respond to the Soviet Union’s moves to expand its influence in a number of countries by providing struggling nations with more funding (Corbett et al., 2014). It is possible to say that this policy was effective because the U.S. managed to protect several countries from being coerced into communism.The second successful policy is the Marshall Plan aimed at several positive changes. The main idea behind this policy was to provide financial support to the struggling European nations, giving them $13 billion in economic aid (Corbett et al., 2014). The countries that received financial help were united and managed to undercut the political popularity of communism. The third relatively successful reform was the Vietnam conflict (“Domino theory,” 2018). In this war, South Vietnam and the U.S. acted against North Vietnam’s communist government (Corbett et al., 2014). Though the U.S. did not manage to protect South Vietnam from communist forces, its spread to the rest of Southeast Asia was blocked, and it is possible to consider this reform effective. Finally, one would state that the United States should not have feared international communist subversion during the Cold War era. The reason is that America’s strength allowed it to resist communist forces, and the fear could have undermined the nation’s confidence.
Writers’ use of various semantic meanings in their creative works is traditionally associated with the author’s internal desire to carry a particular thought through that image. Readers who study literature independently tend to interpret these meanings through the prism of their own experience, which means that it is highly likely that the use of the same elements by different authors and even in different books by the same author may not be understood in the same way. On the contrary, it is often the case that different authors seek to bring similar meanings to works using the same semantic imagery. Among these, the role of contrast, which is achieved on the integration of dark and light images, is particularly noteworthy. The most notable use of dark styles is found in John Milton’s Paradise Lost and William Shakespeare’s Othello . In these classic works of poetry, dark imagery is used extensively by the authors to reinforce opposition to light styles, but additionally, the playwrights showed that darkness should not be taken unequivocally. This essay aims to qualitatively explore the use of such meanings in the two works mentioned.One of the central themes of Shakespeare’s classic tragedy is the juxtaposition of contrasts. The reader is made aware of this almost from the very beginning when the protagonist Othello is introduced as an African of Moorish descent. For sixteenth-century British poetry, the use of dark-skinned characters in prominent plot positions was novel because racist slogans in public sentiment were still strong. This is perfectly illustrated in Othello , when
a grim ignoramus whose motives and actions are associated with self-serving evil. Thus, it is correct to say that the use of the image of darkness in the work of Othello was also necessary to reinforce the boundary effects between good and bad.Dark styles to enhance the contrast with white imagery are used effectively in another work post-Elizabethan England, namely Paradise Lost by John Milton. Milton uses dark colors in his biblical subjects to signify the Devil’s powers. The use of dark colors to heighten the ominousness is particularly evident at the beginning of book three when the playwright uses words such as “obscure,” “eternal night,” and “darkness” (Milton 45). This is used for the apparent opposition to the luminous angels and God, which Milton describes in terms of divine-luminous shades. These thoughts are borrowed from the evangelist John, who literally wrote that “…God is light; in him, there is no darkness at all” (1 Jh. 1:5). Thus, the use of dark imagery in Milton’s work is implemented to heighten the contrast between light and darkness, good and evil.
The Walmart Foundation is a major provider of funding that uses the advantages of being a part of the Walmart business chain to create opportunities for people and make the world a better place. The foundation works in different fields, providing grants to those who share Walmart’s philanthropic priorities. The proposal guidelines are available in open access, and organizations willing to receive a grant can quickly check if they are eligible to do it and inspect the application rules.The Walmart Foundation funds many projects, and its philanthropy is based on diversity, equity, and inclusion. Thus, the organization focuses its support on specific areas, namely those associated with creating opportunities, advancing sustainability, strengthening community, and advancing racial equity (Walmart Foundation, 2022). People can qualify for grants in the fields of economic opportunity in retail and diversity in the talent pipeline. The Walmart Foundation’s sustainability programs include climate, waste, natural resources, and people working in supply chains. The organization supports local communities, promotes healthy food, and uses its resources to identify upcoming disasters and help people prepare for them. Furthermore, the foundation has its own Center for Racial Equity to fight racism and accelerate change in society (Walmart Foundation, 2022). Organizations operating in the areas mentioned above have a high chance of receiving grants from the Walmart Foundation.Although the foundation does not focus on education, it supports the corresponding programs to advance racial equity. In October 2021, Walmart Inc. and Walmart.org announced several initiatives related to increasing access to education for Black and African Americans (Walmart Foundation, 2022).
only exception is the field of local community support, which works according to the principles of open application (Walmart Foundation, 2022). Thus, a standing-out submission should extend the foundation’s focus areas and illustrate a concept containing new ideas and approaches that align with the program’s giving strategies.Overall, the best way to receive a grant from the Walmart Foundation is an application that follows the proposal guidelines and aligns with the principles appreciated by the company. Those principles are diversity, equity, and inclusion, and the applications complying with them have considerably higher chances of being approved. Although the Walmart Foundation focuses its support on specific areas, they are extensive and can cover many aspects of societal life. In other words, an organization’s grant proposal that follows Walmart’s philanthropic priorities may be appreciated and approved even if it is not entirely concentrated in a particular area listed in the guidelines. A desire to make the world a better place and sharing Walmart’s values and fundamental beliefs can help organizations build successful relationships with the foundation and gain an opportunity to reapply in the future.
IntroductionThe white-tailed deer can be found in Canada and most of the United States, excluding Hawaii, Alaska, and the Southwest. It has a grayish-brown coat in the winter and reddish-brown in summer. The underside of its tail is white hence the title “white-tailed deer.” The nose, throat, belly, and areas around the mouth of a white-tailed deer are also white. The coat of a young deer less than six months old is covered with white spots. Males contain horns or bony antlers that fall off every year in January or December and grow back in April or May.HabitatWhite-tailed deer is highly adaptable and thrives in different habitats. A mixture of croplands, hardwood, pasturelands, and bushlands provides the most suitable environment (Ballard 36). They opt to stay in bushy areas, croplands, forested woodlots, and meadows. However, newborn fawns require a habitat different from adult deer, which leads to different habitat arrangements and types. The survival of fawns is a vital part of population growth compared to adult survival because they are susceptible to environmental extremes and predation.ReproductionThe breeding season of a white-tailed deer starts in late autumn to early winter, with a gestation period of approximately 202 days. Female deer generally birth at around one and a half years of age (Bartylla 65). Females bred as “yearlings” birth one fawn while older females birth twins throughout their lifespan, which may continue to approximately 10-15 years in the Adirondacks. Most fawns are born in early June or late May and weigh around 3-6 pounds at birth (Bartylla 67).
The newborns also have a full coat of reddish-brown fur with white spots. Their eyes are open and nurse from a standing position when they are less than 24 hours of age, even though they are somewhat unsteady on their legs. At about one year of age, bucks begin growing their first antlers, and a new set will grow yearly. Antlers will continue to grow every year until around six years of age and then decreaseApproximately 60% of the body growth of a deer occurs in the first year of its life, and at the age of about three years, long bone growth is complete. Fawns have a slight odor at 7-10 days old and tend to move less except to nurse and react to disturbances like approaching predators by remaining still while flattened on the ground (Dewey). At 3-4 weeks old, fawns begin to consume vegetation and accompany females. Weaning is usually by four months but can take up to 6 months or longer. The winter grayish-brown replaces the spotted pattern in fawns from September to October. White-tailed dears attain sexual maturity at 1.5 years though many males will not breed until older.Food and Feeding BehaviorWhite-tailed deer are herbivores and follow well-used trails to their feeding grounds. They feed in the morning and late afternoon hours, and their diet varies with the season and habitat. In fall, they feed on acorns, corn, and other nuts, twigs of woody plants and buds in winter, and green plants in summer and spring (Gallina and Lopez 7). The
white-tailed deer is a ruminant hence has four stomach chambers for digesting food. Food is mixed with bile to form cud in the reticulum and rumen chambers. The cud is then regurgitated, re-chewed, swallowed and passed to the omasum through the rumen, where water is removed. The food finally enters the abomasum, where it is directed to the small intestine, and the nutrients present in the food are absorbed.An adult white-tailed deer needs around 5-7 pounds of food every day. Energy needs are different with seasons and are greatest for males in autumn. Lactating and pregnant females require more energy in severe winter weather than other deer (Bartylla 83). Metabolism, however, decreases in wither under control for the photoperiod and increases from late winter to summer. During the winter period, fat and browsing reserves provide energy needs. When deep snow cover exceeds a hundred days, starvation can cause massive death compared to moderate Adirondack winters.Activity and MovementIn the spring, the white-tailed deer are mainly active at twilight or crepuscular, while in summer, they are active during daylight hours. Bouts of activity occur equally in late autumn, at the beginning of the rut, and throughout this period. In winter, their activity is more likely in the afternoon (Ballard 40). Activity may be reduced by storms at any time of year, with increased activity happening before and after inclement weather. In late winter and spring, general levels of activity increase as the day length increases in summer and late autumn. When inactive, deer bend down or stand quietly.
Increasing metabolism and day length are overlapped by long periods of snow cover. Starvation is caused by a lack of nutritious browse and depletion of fats, although they can lose 25-30% of their body and still survive (Ballard 43). Fawns from the previous year are most likely to starve since they lack enough time to store fat before winter. Severe winters impact the productivity of females and the survival of white-tailed deer.RangeThe home range of a deer is generally less than a square mile. Deer collect in family groups comprising a mother and her fawns, and a doe is solitary when she has no fawn (Bartylla 15). Excluding the mating season when the males are solitary, the male bucks live in groups comprising three or four individuals.PredationDeer are mainly managed by hunting parasites, and diseases also increase with the increase in their population, hence having few natural predators. The white-tailed deer is prey to mountain lions and gray wolves. A coyote is another predator of the white-tailed deer, but dogs and humans are the main predators (Gallina and Lopez 8). Deer populations can sometimes go high for their environment due to fewer predators, but they can starve to death. However, this can be controlled through hunting which is often allowed when their population grows out of control.AdaptationsThe hollow hairs on a deer’s coat help it to remain insulated during cold weather. The deer can camouflage better due to the coat of colors changing seasonally. Due to their spotted coats, the fawns can also hide on the
arrests. The rights granted to the defendant are always a disadvantage to the prosecution which has to prove its case against the accused. This position is biased against the prosecution and makes its work even more difficult. The system encourages a scenario where both entities to a case contest with each other to win a case. This scenario makes it easier vulnerable to acts of deception and legal tactics that are questionable instead of using facts to settle cases. It is a potential ethical problem that can be solved by allowing both parties to present facts before any judgment is made to avoid injustices.If a black man is found committing a similar offence like a white woman, he is five times more likely to be arrested. It is a tendency that has been brought about by racism in the American judicial system and racial inequality in policing. Moreover, the black man is more likely to be convicted than a white woman who has committed a similar crime. According to a report by the United States Sentencing Commission, a black man who is found the same crime as the white man have a potential of receiving nearly 20% longer prison term (Ingraham, 2017). These disparities are due to cases of racism and bias found within the American criminal justice system.
colors and light in this painting is truly impressive. The sun is shining on the figures from the background, casting a shadow. The strokes of colors are warm, bright, and vibrant, mixed together with the muted grays of the woman’s dress. It reflects a whole range of colors around her: the blues of the sky, the yellow of the flowers, and light, complementary strokes of purple (Joy of Museums Virtual Tours). Monet uses these colors and careless brush strokes to convey an atmosphere of a breezy summer day.Woman with a Parasol is a genre painting, which is a type of art that depicts ordinary people and their everyday activities. Thus, the painting gives the impression that the mother and son were interrupted during their daily walk in the field. It can be suggested that the woman’s dress, veil, and parasol symbolize her status, and the grassy slope symbolizes the countryside that Monet preferred to the cities and industry. Overall, the painting creates a unique mood of a fleeting memory captured in the moment.
need to study the religious worldview in order to understand how the world around them works. In turn, the study of Christianity is the basis for considering Liberal Arts (2). The study of God and his interaction with humans is necessary both for understanding the existing world and for its development in the future.The universe consists of three essential spheres, which through interaction with each other, form the complex world. They include the physical, rational, and human spheres, each of which has its own elements (Spanjer 10-13). Additionally, each of the mentioned areas of the functioning of the universe is governed by its own laws. As part of the study of Liberal Arts, students need to take a comprehensive look at aspects of each of these areas and understand how they work together.The main idea of ​​this chapter, therefore, is the need to understand the laws of the subject of study. Spanjer emphasizes that it is impossible to understand the principle of operation of a particular sphere, ignoring its natural laws. This view, within the framework of the study of Christianity, seems to be the most effective since it allows us to integrate the consideration of the human essence and morality into a broader context. In this case, it is important to understand that human beings are also part of a larger system. Studying Liberal Arts allows you to structure knowledge about the world, depending on their levels and relationships.
Theodore Roosevelt was one of the youngest American presidents known for his progressive ideas and the desire to change society, addressing the existing distrust and helplessness. The decision to promote progressive ideas was not spontaneous, and he saw the movement as the possibility to protect the real rule of humans (Roosevelt, 1912). The characteristics of a progressive are the intention to stand for social justice, achieve good for all people, and improve the environment in which individuals should grow and develop. Being a progressive means being optimistic about every initiative and participating in problem-solving processes. There is no need to hide behind or keep silent but to act and become passionate about changes and transformations.Despite the desire to support progressive thoughts, there are also some examples of anti-progressives. Roosevelt (1912) called them the people with narrow vision and little sympathy. Anti-progressives are never stirred by the mistakes or failures made by other people (Roosevelt, 1912). Individuals who are consumed by their selfishness are not able to appeal to conscience. Everything they can do is to support oppression and use reforms that work for the leaders’ success, not the public one. The activities varied from employees’ exploitation to the promotion of capitalism that bounded society and imposed limitations on creativity and progress.Roosevelt wanted to make people believe in his ideas and goals. Thus, he described progressivism as the movement that aimed at underling the real rules and freedoms of society. It was high time to deliver justice and equality by explaining the worth of power and development. Following his rules, multiple achievements can be revealed, including the ability to select leaders through open and free voting. Addressing the areas of politics, social welfare, and decision-making relevance, progressives can succeed as the movement and Roosevelt as the leader. As soon as people analyze their options, they can make policies and laws to improve different aspects of their life.
that is connected to inflammation and affection of the thyroid gland. The thyroid gland, formed on the front side of the neck and underneath the laryngeal prominence, produces hormones that regulate metabolism. Hashimoto’s thyroiditis, postnatal thyroiditis, and subacute thyroiditis are the most prevalent types of thyroiditis discussed by practitioners and researchers (Quintero et al., 2021). Thyroid dysfunction manifests itself in a triphasic illness pattern in the majority of cases of thyroiditis (Quintero et al., 2021). Referring to the categorization of particular phases, subacute thyroiditis is a well-known clinical disease that generally develops several weeks following viral infection (Franquemont & Galvez, 2021). Hashimoto thyroiditis is an immune illness that can emerge as hypothyroidism with or without indications, including a painless thyroid problem, and is linked to increased thyroid peroxidase autoantibodies (Quintero et al., 2021). Individuals with Hashimoto thyroiditis and observable hypothyroidism are usually prescribed thyroid hormone treatment for the rest of their lives (Quintero et al., 2021). When a woman’s thyroid part starts being irritated after giving birth, it is known as postpartum thyroiditis.Treatment of thyroiditis should be concentrated on specific symptoms and manifestations. Screening, observation, and medical follow-up are suggested in all instances of thyroiditis to evaluate alterations in thyroid function (Quintero et al., 2021). Acute symptoms can be treated, and thyroid function will normally recover and remain stable over time (Franquemont & Galvez, 2021). A common technique for diagnosing thyroiditis is to palpate the thyroid gland throughout a medical assessment.
send them to doctors.Moreover, clinical office assistants use Todoist , which allows monitoring task statuses in one place. It synchronizes with other applications and makes it feasible to form the daily schedule and plan the work (Helms, 2021). Thus, one can intelligently distribute the available time on the number of tasks and assess productivity at the end of the day. No less critical tool is NueMD , a medical billing software with electronic record capabilities. It includes an online patient portal, electronic prescriptions, and labs; furthermore, the tool has custom reporting capabilities (Helms, 2021). Its prominence is hard to overstate, as using NueMD bypasses paperwork and preserves data in a secure place in the cloud. With its aid, assistants can quickly find the proper document or record, organize the work process and reduce the number of skipped appointments.The clinical office assistant is often the first person to interact with patients and familiarize themselves with their needs. The Medical Assisting Pocket is a tool that enables them to improve and give immediate and quality service (Helms, 2021). An accurate pocket guide provides access to medical abbreviations, billing tips, and insurance coding. It also has several handbooks and training in administrative and clinical skills, allowing one to improve mastery and reduce the time it takes to complete the tasks. Thus, there are many tools for time management, but those mentioned above are considered the most appropriate for assistants.
measures (Cenizo, 2020). In addition, Toyota pays particular attention to the quality of its customer support, ensuring that service center employees have all necessary problem-solving skills. The company offers an immediate and free examination of a vehicle in the case of its dysfunction. However, one of the most peculiar strategies of the brand that contribute to consumers’ delight is the MyToyota app (Toyota Sustainability Report, 2020). It provides multiple benefits for its clients, including exclusive offers, online service booking, and discounts for hotels or sporting tickets, therefore, influencing their perception of performance.As a matter of fact, it is genuinely challenging to choose an automobile company that simply reflects positive satisfaction and is not flexible enough to work with negative feedback. However, according to the 24/7 Wall Street review, Volvo has 33% of customer loyalty (Suneson, 2019). A considerable number of Volvo drivers do not plan to purchase this brand’s products again, and auto reviewers suggest better options. However, the company does not implement any efficient strategy to improve consumer satisfaction and influence the opinion of experts. In general, not only the price and quality form customer loyalty, but the brand’s responsiveness to any complaints or suggestions contributes to people’s delight and brand awareness as well.
Executive SummaryToyota Motor Manufacturing UK should focus on the United Arab Emirates as its next market. Following a macro-environment evaluation, the country has a stable environment, which is conducive to the company. The country has a stable government, a growing economy, and a well-developed infrastructure (Guéraiche, 2019). Furthermore, because of the low unemployment rate in the UAE, a large number of citizens can afford a Corolla Hybrid model. Therefore, a joint venture, exportation, and foreign direct investment are all options for the company to enter the country. However, in order to mitigate the potential risks associated with the entry strategies, the company may want to consider increasing its research and putting more emphasis on the quality of its products.IntroductionToyota motor manufacturing in the UK is one of the best-performing Toyota manufacturing plants. The level of UK production has made Toyota a major player in the country’s manufacturing industry, with most of its output being shipped overseas. The company was incorporated in 1989 to consolidate Toyota’s market base (Toyota Motor Manufacturing UK, 2022). It is located in Derby and is part of the motor vehicle manufacturing industry. The company employs more than 2,725 employees and generates about $3 billion in sales. One of the company’s core products is Corolla Hybrid because it offers outstanding value to the customers in the market (Germain Toyota of Columbus, 2022). As a result, the rationale for going into the United Arab Emirates (UAE) is to gain a competitive advantage in the motor vehicle manufacturing industry.Analysis and DiscussionThe Core Product of the
CompanyCorolla Hybrid is the core product of Toyota motor manufacturing based in the UK. It is among the first model of Toyota Corolla’s new version. The model integrates an award-winning compact sedan’s proven formula with a hybrid powertrain (Germain Toyota of Columbus, 2022). This gives it the ability to deliver remarkable efficiency in the market. In addition, the vehicle comes with features of a contemporary vehicle, such as a smart key system and Toyota safety sense. With these features, the vehicle will attract more buyers.Figure 1: Corolla Hybrid from (Germain Toyota of Columbus, 2022)PESTEL Analysis ModelPESTEL analysis model plays an integral role in analyzing the external environment of a business. The model has advantages and disadvantages that should be considered when analyzing a macro environment (Madsen and Grønseth, 2022). This one helps organizations figure out and look at the main factors that lead to change in a strategic business environment. The tool also helps them respond to changes in the environment more effectively and efficiently. On the other hand, the model does not provide essential information, such as the degree of competition in the environment. Despite the challenges, the PESTEL model is important in understanding the macro environment of an organization.Political FactorsThe UAE is a constitutional federation and among the most stable governments in the Middle East. It comprises of Abu Dhabi, Ajman, Dubai, Fujairah, Ras Al Khaimah, Sharjah, and Umm Al Quwain (Guéraiche, 2019). Each of these emirates is ruled by a leader, whereas the Federal Supreme Council, the UAE’s supreme constitutional body, comprises all
seven leaders. Abu Dhabi is the UAE’s capital and operational hub for most government operations. The UAE is a significant player in the Middle East and holds considerable influence on a global scale (Guéraiche, 2019). It maintains strong diplomatic and commercial ties with the US, Saudi Arabia, India, China, and other nations across the globe. Based on this, Toyota motor manufacturing UK can effectively operate in this environment.Economic FactorsThe economic environment is a critical aspect of the analysis of the UAE. The country is part of economic and political groups. First of all, it is the world’s 29th-largest economy. Its GDP is expected to be more than $400 billion in 2022. (Hammour and Mckeown, 2022). Petroleum, gold, and diamonds are some of the main things the UAE sells outside of the country. India, Japan, China, Oman, and Switzerland are the top places to send your products. Most of its imports on major products, such as automobiles, come from China, India, Germany, the UK, and Turkey. This means that Toyota manufacturing UK can easily get market for its Corolla Hybrid. The company is likely to benefit from the country’s economic performance.The UAE is one of the wealthiest countries in the world in terms of per capita income. Over the years, it has made considerable economic progress from its abundant natural resources, economic diversification, innovation, and foreign direct investment inflows (Facchini, Jaeck, and Bouhaddioui, 2021). In addition, it has developed a diverse range of industries, such as tourism and real estate development, that assist it in maintaining its
position as one of the world’s wealthiest countries. However, the company’s excessive reliance on the petroleum sector is a flaw. This indicates that the country’s economy might decline if petroleum is diminished. Therefore, although its reliance on petroleum is dangerous, the UAE’s economy is stable and provides a conducive environment for foreign companies to operate effectively.Social FactorsThe United Arab Emirates is one of the most liberal countries in the region. Dubai, in particular, is a thriving international business hub and a very dynamic emirate (Schilirò, 2021). It is technologically advanced and well-connected to the rest of the world. The UAE’s population is estimated to be around nine million people. Emirati nationals account for roughly 20% of the total population, making the country one of the most immigrant-heavy in the world (Abaido, 2020, p.350). As a result, the UAE is home to people from different cultures and countries, making it one of the world’s most cosmopolitan cities. The leaders of the company are assured of a conducive environment to conduct their research and operate.The Emirati society is characterized by luxurious lifestyles, in which the possession of lavish goods reflects an individual’s personality, social image, and social position. Family members and peers influence personal purchase decisions. The number of Emiratis pursuing higher education continues to grow (Ashour, 2020). Expatriate workers are a significant factor in the UAE’s national identity and social demographics. For example, foreign workers account for a sizable portion of the UAE’s national workforce, resulting in disproportionate population demographics. The country attracts people from all over
the world, which makes it a business hub. More vehicles will be required to take people to their destinations. As a result, labor markets will almost certainly face new regulations to reclaim national identity.Technological FactorsTechnological factors play an integral role in running businesses in the UAE. The UAE’s people are tech-savvy, allowing companies to leverage technology (Aminova, Mareef, and Machado, 2020). This indicates that an organization can use technological operations, especially when marketing its products. For example, most Emiratis use social media, making it easy for an organization to reach them. In addition, the government has invested heavily in ICT, which provides a good platform for contemporary organizations. Organizations can access internet services and use available infrastructure to support their operations. Therefore, the UAE’s technological environment is effective because it supports the activities of modern businesses.The United Arab Emirates invests in cutting-edge technology, which leads to new technology-based ideas. The country is at the top of global rankings for networked readiness and internet use, with well-connected schools in all areas (Dutta and Lanvin, 2019). This has helped build a more technical workforce that can help the economy grow in many different ways. The UAE’s information and communication technology (ICT) market are competitive. The government has taken a number of initiatives to foster the growth of a knowledge-based economy. For example, Toyota motor manufacturing will use the existing ICT infrastructure to effectively run its operations, especially in the area of marketing. As a result, the country is a major importer of new technological equipment to transform its
operations and adopts innovations.Environmental FactorsThe UAE is the most visited country due to its infrastructural development. However, with this massive development comes environmental issues. The country is experiencing the impact of rapid development and the effects of climate change and globalization. The UAE’s rapid economic growth has led to serious environmental problems (Gill, Viswanathan, and Hassan, 2018). These problems arise from the high rate of population growth, the need for more energy, and the rapid development of cities, which releases a lot of greenhouse gases and other pollutants into the air (Al-mulali and Che Sab, 2018). For example, when many visit the country, they are more likely to hire vehicles to take them to the hotel and different areas, which pollutes the environment. Therefore, the country’s economic development contributes to climate change.However, the protection of the environment is among the topics that get the attention of the UAE government. As a result, the government is introducing measures to reduce its impact on the environment. For example, the emirate’s government stated that Dubai intends to lower its carbon footprint by 30% in eight years (The New Arab Staff & Agencies, 2022). As a major regional, business, and logistic hub, Dubai contributes a greater percentage of the country’s overall carbon footprint. In addition, the net-zero goal of 2050 made by the UAE government is part of the Paris Agreement, which asks countries to come up with long-term plans to cut greenhouse gas emissions. Thus, the UAE government has a roadmap to reduce its carbon footprint.Legal FactorsThe legal environment
is one of the factors used to analyze the UAE. The country is a federal constitutional monarchy led by a king who is head of the country (Zhao, Naidu, and Wallis, 2019). It has a labor law that applies to all staff and employees, no matter where they come from. The maximum amount of time an adult can work is eight hours a day. However, it can be a little different based on the type of business. In addition, people who live in the UAU are very safe because there are not many crimes in the country. It shows that rules and regulations in the country are very strict. Therefore, the legal framework of the UAE provides a conducive environment for the operations of businesses.The Analysis of The PESTEL Model In UAEThe company should enter the United Arab Emirates (UAE) to widen its market base. The UK has been one of the major markets for the company. Following Brexit, the company is likely to experience a number of challenges, such as labor shortages, economic impacts, and many more. To counter this impact, the company should consider entering the UAE. This country is becoming a major investment hub for most companies across the globe (Aminova, Mareef, and Machado, 2020). One of the reasons is its growing economy over the years. It has a bright future and presents a lot of opportunities for organizations. In addition, the country’s government has heavily invested in economic growth to boost its performance. As a result, the country can be a good
market for the company when considering outside Europe.Porter’s Five ForcesPorter’s five forces model is among the best tools used to understand the external environment. One of its benefits is analyzing the competitiveness of an industry in an organization (Kay, 2019). In addition, it shows the degree of rivalry in a sector to allow an organization to make an informed decision. The other aspect is determining the influence of major stakeholders on an organization, such as buyers and suppliers (Kingsnorth, 2019). However, the tool ignores the influence of government in an environment.Table 1: Porter’s Five ForcesPorter’s five forces                         Explanation                                                                                                                                      
                                           * There are many buyers in the market. Due to the low unemployment rate, most people living in the UAE have the ability to Corolla Hybrid.  Bargaining power of buyers (High)              * Buyers can easily switch from one brand to another, especially when their needs are not met.                                                                                             * The customers do not threaten backward integration (Kay, 2019).                                                 
                         Bargaining power of suppliers (Low)            * There are many suppliers in the market. For example, Toyota motor manufacturing UK can get their suppliers within and outside the country.                                               * The suppliers do not pose any threat of backward integration.                                                                             The threat of new entrants (Low)               * A large amount of capital is required to enter the industry.                           
                                                                                                 * Existing automobiles have established brands and image.                                                                                   The threat of substitute (Low)                 * The existing alternatives, such as trains and buses do not provide convenience as personal vehicles.                                
     The intensity of competitive rivalry (High)    * There is a moderate number of competitors in the market. For example, General Motors, Jaguar Land Rover, and many more.                                                                  * Customers are often loyal to their brands. For example, those used to Jaguar Land Rover may not shift to Corolla Hybrid.                  Other Factors to Consider When Analyzing UAEDemand and Supply of LaborLabor is one of the crucial factors required for effective operations of an organization. Without labor, it is impossible to run business operations and achieve the set goals. In the UAE, non-nationals constitute most of the workforce in most jobs because of demographic imbalances. Most of the time, the private sector in this country determines the workforce number. The federal and local governments hire about 19% of the overall labor force (Hijazi, Saeed, and Alfaki, 2019). This leaves about 80% of the country’s private sector’s labor market. As a rule, most of the government jobs in the UAE have been held by its citizens. Based on this,
most private organizations have been run by employees from other countries across the globe (Hijazi, Saeed, and Alfaki, 2019). As a result, the labor market growth in this country has reduced, reducing the number of jobs.The Availability of InfrastructureUAE government has invested heavily in building modern infrastructure. As a result, the country is surrounded by beautiful buildings, roads, airports, and many more. UAE has the best road network that promotes smooth movement from one destination to another through the road. A global competitiveness report issued by World Economic Forum indicates that UAE is in the seventh position globally in terms of road quality (United Arab Emirates, 2022). In addition, the country is home to beautiful hotels and buildings. For example, Jumeirah Al Naseem is a UAE hotel that provides excellent services. With this infrastructure and facilities, international businesses can find a conducive environment to perform their operations.The Appropriate Strategies for Entry into UAEExportingExporting is when an organization sells products to customers in a different country right from their business. It is one of the most common ways to get into a new country and the least risky (Samiee and Chirapanda, 2019). It may also be cheaper because an organization does not need production facilities in the chosen country. For example, Corolla Hybrid will still be manufactured in the home country and taken to UAE for sale. In the near future, however, transportation costs are likely to rise, which will raise the cost of exporting. Most of the costs of exporting come from marketing costs. An organization
needs to work with a transportation company, warehouse, and the UAE government most of the time.Foreign Direct Investment (FDI)Foreign direct investment is a strategy that the company can use to enter into UAE. It is a type of cross-border investment where an investor from one country has a long-term interest and a lot of power over a business from another (Konara and Wei, 2019). FDI can be done by creating a new venture or acquiring an existing company in the UAE. For example, the company can choose to set up a new business. The main advantage of this strategy is that it gives the company the ability to control its operations directly. It also increases a company’s income because they do not have a share of other companies. However, this requires a lot of capital to cater for costs such as premises, human resources, infrastructure, and other areas (Konara and Wei, 2019). Therefore, despite the challenge of cost, FDI can benefit the company.Joint VentureA joint venture is one of the strategies that the organization can use to enter into UAE. It is a business arrangement where two or more parties agree to pool their resources to achieve a specific objective (Nippa and Reuer, 2019). After the agreement, the parties involved form a jointly-owned business. In this arrangement, one of the parties must be a local business. For example, the company can work with Al-Futtaim Motors, a firm selling used Toyota vehicles in UAE. The parties create a management team and share the control of the new
business. With this strategy, the company uses local knowledge and shares costs. However, there are some problems, such as figuring out who should invest what and how to split the profits can be hard. Although the strategy has some disadvantages, the benefits are more.Risk Minimization StrategiesTable: RisksInternational entry strategies  Risks identified                                                                      Minimization strategies                         Exporting                       Changes in tariffs, economic sanctions, and decreased demand for the product.           * Invest more in research.

about the market, they can go ahead with either FDI or a joint venture. However, with FDI, the company should set aside more funds to effectively run its operations in the UAE. For instance, due to a the country’s labor shortage, the country can consider hiring the best employees from other countries across the globe. With a joint venture, the company should be careful when choosing a partner to work with. The company should conduct an extensive background check to determine whether they can be trusted or not.ConclusionUAE is the best market for Toyota motor manufacturing UK’s Corolla Hybrid. The country has an effective environment that can support the company’s operations. For example, the country has a stable government, a growing economy, a good infrastructure, and many more. In addition, with a low unemployment rate, many UAE citizens can afford a Corolla Hybrid model. The company can enter the country through a joint venture, exportation, and foreign direct investment. However, to mitigate the possible risks experienced through the entry strategies, the company should consider increasing its research and focusing on the quality of products. Extensive research enables leaders to make the appropriate decisions. In the long run, this will have a positive impact on an organization.
form of ensuring the security of the phenomenon under study is the establishment of specialized technologies to ensure physical and electronic security and confidentiality. Violation of these aspects may entail judicial punishment and be considered improper behavior by judges.Therefore, unauthorized access to confidential information for the purpose of further dissemination may entail legal consequences in the form of compensation for the company’s loss. Also, an injunction may be imposed, stopping the production of products under a stolen trade secret. Criminal penalties include imprisonment or an unlimited fine. These sanctions can be applied to both forms of protection of the company’s trade secret. To obtain legal access to a trademark, it is necessary to obtain an agreement from its holder, so the owner of the secret can appoint a particular person to access and use the trade secret information. At the same time, a non-disclosure agreement between the licensor and licensee is signed and strictly observed.
Welcome to the Geological Time Machine, the one-of-a-kind invention that allows people an opportunity to visit past geologic times with sightseeing tours. Our unique product offers three types of tours designated for three geological eras. In general, the geological eras represent the distinct changes that the planet Earth and its environment faced through the course of history. The following travel guide will provide more detailed information about the characteristics of each era and its main attractions that you can visit through our tours.Paleozoic Era TourTime period: Paleozoic Era began 541 million years ago and ended 252 million years agoFigure 1. Image of the ocean landscape during Devonian Era (Andrejs Lazovskis, n.d.Figure 2. The image of animals that went extinct after the Permian period (Penn, J., & Deutsch, C., 2018. The tour takes place during two of the most exciting and extraordinary periods of the Paleozoic era: the Devonian and the Permian periods. The Devonian part of the tour focuses on displaying the life of various marine animals that lived in the ocean. On the other hand, the Permian period part of the tour illustrates what animals could live on the planet if the Permian excitation did not occur.The Paleozoic Era defined the beginning of modern life and is characterized by the creation of various life forms and organisms. The Paleozoic era began with significant growth and development of new life and ended with a massive extinction of most creatures known as the Permian extinction. The processes of global warming caused the Permian extinction.Figure 3 Image of
Social isolation induces behavioral and emotional changes in human beings and animals. Cho et al. (2017) conducted a study to determine the treadmill exercise effect on depression. This study used female and male Sprague-Dawley socially isolated rat pups. Researchers ensured that the procedures used aligned with the National Health Institute and Korean Medical Sciences Academy. The delivery day was designated day 0, and the rats were categorized into four. The groups included: the social isolation group, the control group, and the exercise and social isolation and exercise group (Cho et al., 2017). The social isolation group’s rat pups were housed individually. On the contrary, the exercise and the control groups’ rat pups were housed under standard conditions and with their mothers. Each day, every rat pup was injected with 5-Bromo-2′-deoxyuridine (50-mg/kg BrdU) (Cho et al., 2017). This was conducted sixty minutes from postnatal day 21 to 26 before starting the treadmill exercise.The researchers used different methods and materials to conduct the study. In the treadmill exercise protocol, the rat pups ran on the treadmill once a day for half an hour from the 21 st to the 34 th day. Additionally, a forced swimming examination was conducted to determine the rat pups’ degree of depression. Tissue preparation happens by anesthetizing the animals with Zoletil 50 to start the sacrificial process (Cho et al., 2017).A response absence prompted the researchers to use 50 mM phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) and 500 mM phosphate buffer. Cho et al. ( 2017) expound that the researchers also aimed to evaluate tryptophan hydroxylase
its perspective. As mentioned above, Jainism rejects the belief in a Creator or God. This belief is held up by several philosophical questions that are even asked in atheistic circles. These include contradictions in typical monotheistic religions such as God being both perfect and creating an imperfect world or God loving all life but still allowing suffering. Jainism even poses a logical fallacy, which suggests that if everything in the universe had to be created, would God not also need to be created? This worldview is surprisingly modern and potentially controversial for its time.Ethics is another vital component of any philosophy or belief system. Jainism establishes five distinct principles of ethics which are Ahimsa (non-violence), Satya (truth), Astheya (non-stealing), Brahmacharya (chastity), and Aparigraha (non-possession). I am especially interested in Ahimsa which is the core of Jainist ethics. This is because I believe that many religions excuse violence due to their beliefs, which is inherently immoral to my values. Jainism proposes that non-violence is a priority and therefore inexcusable.
of religion by reducing it to a single local model and then declaring it universal. Midgley (1981) emphasizes that it is not prohibited to judge other customs. However, one should not set up barriers and must understand one’s own culture before assessing another. Furthermore, one of the leading points of the article is that there are no separate isolated societies; they are all constantly integrating, especially in the modern world.Therefore, Mary Midgley refutes the concept of moral isolationism and gives her interpretation of the ability to evaluate other civilizations. The capacity to form one’s own beliefs and make judgments about other cultures is crucial; however, one must never forget to be respectful and avoid crude opinions. All cultures are diverse, but the world was created as a whole, and that is why no barriers can exist.
Major League Baseball (MLB) player Tyler Skaggs died several years ago. He was found in his team hotel room in Texas, choking on his vomit, on July 1, 2019 (Wagner, 2021). The main cause of death was ruled as “an intoxication from the substances,” including fentanyl, oxycodone, and alcohol (Wagner, 2021, para. 8). Fentanyl is a fast-acting opioid, which is 50-100 times more powerful than morphine and 30-50 times than heroin (Han et al., 2019). This opioid drug is frequently used in medicine to manage severe pain in cancer patients and perioperative pain. However, it is also used outside of clinical settings and often leads to fatal overdoses. The case of Tyler Skaggs serves as a reminder of the problem that is crucial in the United States nowadays – the opioid crisis.The opioid-related deaths are not new, and one of their reasons is illicitly produced and distributed opioid drugs. The U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) is responsible for reducing “the Aggregate Production Quota (APQ) of opioids each year since 2017” (Schatman & Wegrzyn, 2020, p. 2629). According to the DEA’s 2020 report, the “total domestic opioid production has decreased by 53% since 2016” (Schatman & Wegrzyn, 2020, p. 2629). Still, the number of deaths from opioid overdose continues to increase, and Skaggs’s death is one such case. Since the baseball player did not receive the drugs from his doctor, the DEA began to investigate his overdose-death in general and the source of the drugs in particular.The DEA is responsible for the health and safety of American
communities and neighborhoods. That is why the organization is involved in investigating Skaggs’s death. The main goals of the DEA are to identify and affect the sources of illicit drugs and reduce drug-related violence (DEA, 2021). Moreover, it aims to assist and contribute to local drug use prevention activities and bring justice to the families of persons who died because they did not know what drugs they used (Nishida, 2021). Thus, the DEA created the Overdose Justice Task Force to investigate opioid-related deaths, most of which were caused by fentanyl (Nishida, 2021). Since Skaggs’s death was also caused by fentanyl overdose, the DEA interfered with his case and started its investigation.When it is clear why the DEA is involved in Skaggs’s death investigation, it is still unclear how it is involved. Thus, federal law enforcement agents interviewed other team members, friends, and relatives of the victim, trying to discover how the man obtained the drug. The investigation showed that fentanyl was detected everywhere, “even in marijuana” (Quinn, 2019, para. 5). Thus, the DEA started its cooperation with law enforcement to reduce domestic opioid production and drug-related deaths. The organization’s investigation led to Eric Kay, who worked in the communication department of the baseball team where Skaggs played. The man was charged for supplying Skaggs counterfeit drugs with fentanyl that caused the player’s death and distributing oxycodone and fentanyl since at least 2017 (Castillo, 2022). Although Kay’s fault has not yet been proven, the DEA’s contribution to this investigation is significant.Skaggs’s death is a reminder of the
It is common for businesses to develop and grow differently, so there is a vast number of ways that companies may evolve. It usually depends on the management, industry, objectives, and specific leadership vision. These structural types have their own advantages, weaknesses, and challenges. For example, many firms face issues while allocating work and then coordinating diverse efforts after dividing responsibilities among groups of employees. The former process is called differentiation, and the latter is known as integration, and both play an essential role in organizational structure.To begin with, differentiation is a process of separating a business into key components like units or departments. This division is especially common in major corporations because the larger a firm grows, the more challenging it becomes for a single leader to control all its operations. Thus, highly differentiated companies provide autonomy to their departments and units, making it easier to organize productive and effective work in all components. Noticeably, the corporate environment and culture may vary significantly in different units, which sometimes brings additional issues. Amazon and Apple are examples of companies that successfully differentiate their operations and have many different units.Further, when firms apply differentiation, they still need to effectively perform their various tasks, which is why the process of integration is also significant. Overall, integration is the specific coordination of differentiated responsibilities and the work of all components. In other words, an organization that is highly integrated can have many various departments that are still closely connected and do not have much independence and autonomy. For instance,
and policy, authority, and control and panning methods to coordinate the work of the staff. For example, authorized leaders have to make sure that action is aligned with the objectives and strategy of the firm. They make decisions, solve issues and conflicts, evaluate performance, and reward or punish employees. They also develop rules, policies, and planning and control systems so that the staff knows the work conditions and follows the standardized procedures. As mentioned above, all operations and decisions of McDonald’s are controlled by a small group of authorities, which is why it is possible to say that this company uses the vertical type of coordination.Further, lateral integration uses task forces, meetings, gatherings, coordinating roles, matrix structures, and networks to control the efforts of the different units. Coordinating groups gather to negotiate and help dovetail the efforts and tasks of various departments. Spontaneous informal meetings make it possible for workers from different divisions to discuss some issues. Additionally, tasks forces allow the collaboration of diverse specialists when a rapid solution for a problem is required. The animation studio Pixar is an example of a company that integrates lateral coordination and does that extremely successfully: the informal connection between the workers and the three main groups allows them to develop more ideas and solve issues quickly.
The current wealth distribution patterns in the U.S. are far from the embodiment of justice. One occupation that I feel is underpaid at the present time is the registered nurse in various healthcare environments. Based on things learned from my acquaintances working as hospital RNs, the degree of responsibility for patients’ well-being does not align with the average financial compensation that these specialists receive. One profession that I believe is overpaid is the National Football League player. Prominent clubs’ growing profits and football matches’ increasing accessibility due to technology advancements probably explain why footballers’ wages are extremely high.The reasons for selecting these examples pertain to compensation sizes’ desired dependence on the work’s degree of social importance. Specifically, utilitarian ethics could be applied to justify the selection of examples. The central pillar of utilitarianism is an emphasis on actions and choices that maximize well-being and promote the happiness of a substantial number of individuals (Woodard, 2019). In accordance with utilitarianism, an action is good and important if it brings benefits to the masses. Products that RNs and NFL players bring to society cannot be equal in significance. If there were no RNs, hospital inpatients would receive treatment from doctors but would be left without care and constant supervision, resulting in more frequent hospital infections, post-surgery complications left unnoticed until it is too late, and preventable deaths. In contrast, if there were no NFL players, sports fans would have fewer choices when watching sports, which is incompatible with the benefits from RNs’ work. Paying less to footballers and more to RNs would maximize society’s well-being by prioritizing survival over entertainment.Correcting the injustice addressed above would be challenging but still possible. One hypothetical way is the use of petitions for limiting NFL players’ wages or introducing new taxes for the representatives of overpaid occupations. Imposing profit use rules on large sports entities to make them obliged to donate a considerable part of profits to charity is another controversial but possible opportunity. In these circumstances, large leagues and teams would have to restrict wages. Another way of correcting the injustice would involve petitioning for legislative action to increase minimum wages for RNs. For this step, society’s support would be gathered with the help of arguments that higher wages intensify competition, and competition would lead to increases in care quality, thus promoting better public health outcomes.
the integration of mathematicians and created more effective windmills, which would drain marshes and an entire lake.Human beings are wired to demand more even when they have enough. The quest for a better life and earning prestige are the most critical drivers who have played a vital role in propelling humanity towards inventions. Competition and the drive of power and prestige among human beings have been crucial elements in propelling innovations and development to create a new and better life to appear different from others.Human beings have always desired to have a better life. People have always desired to have prestige and have a better life when compared to others. Successive scientific inventions and the development of old technology have played a vital role in transforming the world to its current economic, social, and political success (BBC, 2). However, noble people and successful, wealthy business people had the desire. They funded scientific experiments to invest the technology in their territories and businesses to benefit from it.This scientific question was vital in understanding earth with its relations to the universe. Indeed, the hypothesis of this question was a key driver in understanding earth and connecting it to the universe so that the world would be developed with effectiveness and efficiency. Indeed, the experiment that started in ancient Greece was a key stepping stone in understanding the world and its relation to the solar system.
Unemployment is a significant social and economic problem. Not always positive aspects of enterprise development contribute to a decrease in the percentage of unemployed. The negative impact may be cumulative along with phenomena such as inflation external factors, including the pandemic. Difficulties in obtaining an education for low-income families only widen the gap between the rich and the poor, which in America is already the largest in the world (Telford, 2019). Consequently, the leading causes of unemployment are inflation, advanced technology, and lack of education or skills for employment.Inflation drives up prices in the economy. Naturally, the price of both products and the materials they have produced increases. Employers seek to recoup the costs of inflation by constantly increasing the financial performance of sales. One of these methods is to increase the gross profit ratio by reducing the cost of production. As a result, the company seeks to optimize costs by reducing wages and saving on various employee benefits. This unfair practice leads to layoffs.One of the vectors of technology development, which is now the most crucial unemployment, is automation. The replacement of human labor brings the company to eliminate the human error factor, the ability to operate robots around the clock, reducing jobs. From an economic point of view, many of yesterday’s professionals consider their position obsolete and remain without skilled work. A possible way out of this situation is to retrain as a consultant to maintain such machines.The lack of skills can be caused by several reasons, from income inequality that limits access to education to the narrow specialization of a company that requires training. On-the-job training requires, in turn, the cost of human and time resources, which can affect the company’s operations. As a result, many companies do not train employees but want to get a qualified specialist with a high salary immediately. Applicants lacking these skills are forced to remain unqualified, contributing to rising unemployment and shortages.
Americans have a relatively low rate of education in the U.S. High dropout rates by African Americans, the exorbitant cost of education, and poor performance in public institutions compared to private schools contribute mainly to the education gap. Education is directly consistent with the employment status, especially for high-skill jobs causing structural unemployment (Gezici & Ozay, 2020). The majority of the black labor force is restricted to low-skill jobs, mainly affected by cyclical and frictional unemployment.The education disparities mean that African Americans have lower chances of getting jobs and the opportunities available to them are mainly in the blue-collar sectors. Differences in the labor market across racial ethnicity are attributable to racism and low education for African Americans. Racial profiling, the unequal opportunity to education, and lack of policy to curb referral employment. More aggressive legislative policies and action are required to combat systematic racism and educational mismatch to bridge the unemployment gap between black and white Americans.
the former group still can be blamed for their ignorance because many of the customers of such services consider view prostitutes as an object. This, in turn, leads to the inability to be compassionate towards these women.In order to address this problem, as was mentioned before, the government, especially in places with high women trafficking, should ensure that women are aware of how to avoid being captured. Additionally, in my opinion, the governments should have full control over a few sexual resorts and often supervise their businesses. Finally, as for trafficking in third-world countries, the U.S. should actively participate in the attempts to halt this activity and urge other countries to join the efforts. In this regard, I think that only by combining the work of all the states can humanity stop sex trafficking.
Television has “helped change the differential Negro into the proud Black,” has “given women an outside view of their incarceration in the home… enhanced their aura and prestige (Nye, 2006).” I selected this quote because it illustrates how technology can be used in the educational system to teach students by watching educational programs on television. This resonates with the educational system because television helped a black American to transform into a proud and self-esteemed person in society because of the educative programs he or she watched on television. This aligns with how technology can be used in schools to support learning. The wisdom that this quote provides when one thinks of using technology in the future is incorporating it into learning. Students learn to conceive technological solutions to issues that affect them, and in doing this they change their imaginations (Nye, 2006). Technology in modern times applies to many sectors, including manufacturing, education, health, and governance. Currently, technology is being used to shape this world.Globalization and innovation waves have generated both losers and winners. The winners’ group comprises entrepreneurs, investors, and high-skilled workers that have embraced new inventions and fast-growing markets. The losers are individuals who depend on high-cost labor markets because their skills cannot match the pace of globalizing markets and technological change. Therefore, technological advancements such as the use of robots lead to disruption in the job markets. Robots are used in many fields comprising medical, and education. Robots play a critical role in the operation room where they assist with complex surgeries like
Vaccination is one of the most effective medical interventions that save millions of lives from diseases and suffering. It reduces the level of social inequality, increases access to health services in general, and even helps to reduce poverty. To ensure a high and fair level of vaccination services, it is necessary to understand the obstacles faced by population groups where this level is insufficient. This academic work focuses on approaches designed to improve health among young people.To make vaccination accessible, acceptable, convenient, and attractive for young people, it is necessary to consider both individual behavioral factors and contextual and social mechanisms that influence their behavior. Psychological analysis shows that young people use, often unconsciously, simplified rules of thumb to process incoming information and make decisions. Such mechanisms are helpful because they allow young people to react quickly to situations that arise in everyday life. However, they can lead to a distorted perception of risk and a bias towards vaccination and health-related information.When developing interventions to increase the use of vaccination services among young people, it is necessary to consider these psychological mechanisms and how they affect individual behavior. At the same time, the above considerations should not encourage health authorities to focus only on personal aspects (Paul et al., 2021). Moreover, they should not rely on providing information as the only way to influence young people’s vaccination behavior. Such an approach will lead to only minor positive behavioral shifts. It is based on the assumption that if young people have sufficient knowledge or receive well-thought-out messages,
they will inevitably make the “right” decision.However, it should be noted that other essential influences on behavioral aspects are ignored. Scientific psychology proves that directly motivating young people to get vaccinated can have a more significant impact than changing what they think and how they relate to vaccinations in theory (Dubé et al., 2018). Therefore, systemic factors such as policy, provision of medical services, costs, and logistics are essential aspects of influencing the behavior of young people to vaccination. One of the most effective approaches is the Tailoring Immunization Programs (TIP) developed by the WHO Regional Office for Europe.The Tailoring Immunization ProgramsTailoring Immunization Program considers national and global health goals and contributes to their achievement. The solution of ambitious tasks to ensure immunization compliance with the principles of justice requires specific actions of both young people-patients and medical workers. TIP contributes to determining the optimal ways to support and motivate such actions, helping health authorities achieve their goals (Dubé et al., 2018). TIP processes aim to achieve a high and appropriate level of vaccination services, and the desire to ensure equality in vaccination issues is a vital principle of the TIP approach.TIP covers individual and social elements and offers a conceptual framework and methodology for analyzing and describing a wide range of factors affecting vaccination rates. In such a conceptual framework, the most crucial moment in the decision-making process on vaccination is the patient’s contact or the child’s parents with medical professionals (Dubé et al., 2018). This approach favorably changes the attitude of this population group
et al., 2021).To make vaccination possible, desirable, and positive for young people, interdisciplinary health professionals interact with them and listen to them. In this way, they respond to the needs of young people and form policies accordingly, organize vaccination services and carry out effective communication (Dubé et al., 2018). Understanding the interests of young people allows interdisciplinary medical professionals to adapt services, strategies, and investments to their needs.Joint work contributes to forming an atmosphere of ownership and ensures shared responsibility. The convening of a group of stakeholders who usually do not participate in structured discussions on vaccination issues can be of additional benefit, which will provide new insights that are valuable for both participants and organizers (Paul et al., 2021). Various levels of interaction with stakeholders are provided, for example, through seminars, in-depth interviews, and the activities of special working groups.
embody Canadian culture, where most people from developing nations might not fully understand that a mere fast food restaurant chain is not such a thrilling occurrence for regular consumers. The book also states that “Westerners are shocked and confused by that, but it’s a case of the West reaping what it has sown. The colonial powers carved Africa, put the black man to work, and did not properly educate him” (Noah 194). Similarly, many assume that Canadian people are excessively polite as part of the culture, but I would want others to know that it is not the case.One of the most interesting aspects of the book is how certain tyrants are not perceived as such in other places due to the lack of their relevance, which is why it is true for current leaders in Canada as well. The text states: “so in Europe and America, yes, Hitler is the Greatest Madman in History, In Africa, he’s just another strongman from history books” (Noah 196). Although Canada did not have such tyrants, many people outside Canada perceive that our leaders are perfect and representative of true democracy. However, it is not always true because they also face challenges for power struggles and do not always behave in the nation’s best interests, which are becoming more evident in recent events.
This essay will explain the value and sexuality of women in the Islamic religion compared to Christianity. One central concern is the deflation of individuals or the suppression of people under the defense of religion. Religion has emerged to be a central tool of abuse in terms of treating different gender. Throughout Islamic holy books, women are subject to oppression, which Allah accepts. This is almost similar to Christianity since they devaluate the same women (The Holy Bible). However, there are incredible differences that I will be addressing in this essay. My argument is that women in the Islamic religion and Christianity have different values and treatments.Firstly, I will analyze and elaborate on the motives of oppression directly from the holy books. I will analyze how some pages of Hadith and Quran justify oppression towards women as acceptable by Allah (Moore, 2017). I will analyze how this is different from the Bible since the cruelest view of females in the Bible is more gracious than that of women in Islam. Any discussion regarding the religious justification for the way men, children, or women are treated is mostly justified through texts from the holy booksI will address how women are treated in service in the church and what they can offer in the Mosques. The Islamic religion has a diverse understanding of the value of women since some view women as subservient while others view them as equals. Women in most Christian churches are viewed as equal, whereas in some churches, they are teachers of the word,
In the grand scheme of things, prosecutors and victims of violent crimes are natural allies. The prosecutors strive to bring the offenders to justice, whether to fulfill their duty before the law or achieve career progress. At the same time, the victims get moral satisfaction when the criminals are brought to justice. Therefore, one might think that prosecutors and victims are naturally supposed to cooperate. However, this logical scenario does not necessarily happen in practice. Sometimes, the victims cannot adequately cooperate with the prosecutors due to the experienced shock, fear, or mistreatment in the prosecutor’s office. During the mid-70s, the Law Enforcement Assistance Administration funded the first Victim/Witness Assistance Projects (VWAPs) in order to enhance cooperation between the prosecutors’ offices and victims (Karmen, 2019). With time, the VWAPs have become firmly established institutions charged with the noble mission of supporting crime victims.Prosecutor offices can assist the victims of violent crimes through various means. The best practices include psychological help in hotlines and crisis counseling, shelter, food, transportation, and property recovery (Karmen, 2019). In addition, most VWAPs make referrals to local agencies, which provide the victims with long-term care (Karmen, 2019). Furthermore, prosecutor offices offer legal assistance through pamphlets about the adjudication process. Finally, VWAPs mitigate confusion by notifying the victims about indictments, postponements, acquittals, convictions, and other possible developments in the case (Karmen, 2019). As such, the modern prosecutor offices are well equipped for ensuring the victims’ cooperation through legal, psychological, and even financial support.The San Diego County District Attorney’s Office serves as a specific example of a well-rounded victim services project. The Victim Assistance Program offers emergency (crisis intervention), legal (court support, orientation in the criminal justice system), and psychological (referral assistance) help (San Diego County District Attorney, n.d.). In addition, victims of violent crimes may receive special reimbursement for eligible losses from the Victim Compensation Board, which is funded by restitution fines (San Diego County District Attorney, n.d.). These reimbursements cover such losses as medical expenses, home security improvements, or outpatient mental treatment, among others. Overall, crime victims in the County of San Diego can rely on decent support from their District Attorney’s office.
Over the past year and a half, the notion of change and continuous development in the nursing practice had become of utmost importance, as the global pandemic outbreak forced both practitioners and patients to embrace modified approaches to care. Such an immediate and large-scale need to redefine patient care has understandably raised a series of ethical concerns. Currently, I do my best to use the course materials to seek answers and ethically reasonable solutions to patient care, but the most meaningful insight I have gained so far is that every solution to an ethical dilemma remains ambiguous.For example, during one of my interactions with the patient, I was asked whether the hospital had the policy to avoid face-to-face interaction during the pandemic with the help of video examinations. I had to address my supervisors, who explained that at the time, this option was unavailable due to the high risks of data security breach and lack of corporate video software to contact the patients without using personal accounts. After this interaction, I decided to dwell on the ethical implications of replacing face-to-face interaction with the medical examiner.On the one hand, the practice of remote patient supervision should be perceived as considerate given the risks of COVID-19 infection during face-to-face interactions. It is natural for public health care to identify ways to modify the principles of accessing care. For example, in the empirical study by Shaw et al. (2020), the researchers decided to compare face-to-face interactions with the instances of video consultations. While estimating that video consultations tend
conventional approaches to a medical examination. Once video consultations become widely used by the community, chances are people will be less likely to return to face-to-face interactions due to the convenience of such interaction. Meanwhile, the researchers emphasize that “face-to-face consultation between physician and patient remains the gold standard of clinical care” (Solimini et al., 2021, p. 2).The issue of shifting to telemedicine and remote therapy is also challenged by such factors as informed consent and social discrimination. Indeed, many patients settle for remote examination and consultation without understanding the risks, gaps, and security implications of remote treatment. The growing interest in video consultations may also affect the notion of inclusion and social equality, as it is unethical to imply that patients have access to technology in order to practice telemedicine.Thus, having taken everything into consideration, it becomes evident that nursing and the medical field, in general, cannot exist without a critical appraisal of the modifications introduced to health care. For every argument in favor of introducing such a change as remote therapy, one can find a series of reasons to criticize it. Hence, learning to perceive such phenomena as new technology critically is the first step towards creating a sensitive approach to care.
IntroductionThe piece for visual analysis was created by Cindy Sherman, and the photograph is from one of the collections devoted to the representation of female film characters. Its selection was conditional upon the informativeness of the image regarding the ambiguity of black-and-white portraits in general, as well as the possibility to reveal the reason behind this phenomenon (Public Delivery, 2021). This rationale is supported by the fact that the engaging power of the image is ensured by the reflections about the people and their lives it evokes. Thus, the condition why it is worthy of analysis is the opportunity to examine the cultural aspects of cinema by focusing on a single picture about the gaze (“COMS3410 week three,” n.d.).The image used for this purpose is known as “Untitled Film Still #21,” made in 1978, using gelatin silver print, and it is currently available in the online collection of MoMA Learning (Sherman, n.d.). Hence, the analysis of this piece is feasible from the perspective of demonstrating the importance of the sociological underpinning of cultural products and the way visual techniques are used for transmitting the message.Visual DescriptionThe black-and-white photograph appears to be quite minimalistic at first sight; however, a closer look confirms the presence of a more complex motivation of its creator. Initially, a viewer pays attention to the woman, glancing to the left with a sad look on her face (Sherman, n.d.). This characteristic, which is avoiding the camera, is one of the main features of Sherman’s collection as a whole, and it is seen in
the picture (Public Delivery, 2021). In the background, there are several buildings, and the setting, which is likely to be a city center, does not seem to be accidental (see Appendix A). It speaks about millions of other people, resembling the depicted woman, who encounter similar struggles. Even though it is unclear what kind of a challenge it might be without referencing the past, one can easily suggest that it is related to the position of female citizens in society (Public Delivery, 2021). Hence, the selected piece is informative from the standpoint of historical trends as well as their typical portrayal.The described visual qualities and details of the photograph are complemented by the technical aspect, compositional solutions, and social practices, which play a significant role in understanding the examined work. According to Gillian Rose’s framework, technology is critical for analysis, and, in this situation, it is presented by the simplicity of technique, deliberately emphasized to reflect the spirit of the age (“COMS3410 week two,” n.d.; Sherman, n.d.). In turn, the choice of colors supports this opinion, and the spatial organization and, more specifically, the distance between the woman and the buildings, confirms the alleged lack of understanding between her and the world. The societal part of this work is represented by the relationships between people based on gender bias and, consequently, isolation of the person (Public Delivery, 2021). In this case, “the separation between her and the audience” is complemented by “the shine of sweat, humidity, and fear,” thereby implying the existence of global problems (Public
Delivery, 2021). In this way, the selected piece can be characterized by a simple medium in combination with the complexity of issues typical for the female population of the previous century.Compositional AnalysisCompositional ModalityIn the assessment of the image, compositional modality is one of the most crucial parameters which should be taken into account to support the significance of its parts for the whole message. Thus, as per Rose’s framework, the genre is crucial, and in this case, it is black-and-white photography as a means of demonstrating the situations in the past (“COMS3410 week two,” n.d.; Sherman, n.d.). It is more suitable for this objective since relying on modern techniques would be detrimental to the overall perception of the piece by the audience (“COMS3410 week 4,” n.d.). Meanwhile, the composition is relatively stable in terms of remaining unchanged when examining it closer and serving as evidence of a biased attitude toward women’s portrayal (Public Delivery, 2021). The only viewing position offered to people is that of an outsider, and it underpins the societal issues referred to by the creator.Overall, the composition and its details serve as evidence of proper organization and elimination of distractions while showing the photographer’s concerns. In this situation, the image as it is currently presented can convey the general challenge of the perception of the female population as attractive regardless of personal circumstances (Public Delivery, 2021). This approach was common in the twentieth century, and the fact that it is employed in this picture confirms its historical accuracy (Sherman, n.d.). In addition, the
possibility of placing it in a different context is unlikely to change the message unless other details are included.Gaze and Tishman’s Approach: Significance for InterpretationAnother factor, which should be considered in the present analysis, is the importance of the male gaze for interpreting the image. The emphasis on this perspective is conditional upon the fact that Hollywood movies are usually viewed through this lens, and female characters are shown as “highly sexualized objects of male desire” (“COMS3410 week three,” n.d.). The woman in the picture resembles other photographs in the genre and, therefore, can be seen as belonging to this category (Sherman, n.d.). This perspective is supported by other works in the collection as the mentioned feature is attributed to all of them (Public Delivery, 2021). The link between the identity of people and their femininity is proved by the attention to makeup as a means for claiming one’s place in the world (Public Delivery, 2021). Thus, the examined picture fully corresponds to the described standards while being intended for depicting them in the right light or, in other words, criticizing societal trends of the past.Moreover, the details of the piece contribute to the general perception of this work as one belonging to the past. As per Tishman’s framework, the colors, lines, and shapes, which are critical for observation, are arranged in such a manner that a viewer has no doubts regarding the historical focus of the creator (“COMS3410 week two,” n.d.). The black-and-white objects and simple and clear contours are, therefore, crucial for interpretation, while
Walmart is an international firm that has served customers in worldwide markets for a long time. The corporation has established over 15,000 retail outlets worldwide (Courtemanche et al., 2019). Nevertheless, as the firm’s retail shop number has grown, it has faced issues that have hampered its customer experience. The fundamental problem is that the corporation was not able to provide any assistance or incentive for outstanding performance by the workers in their everyday work routines. Companies that neglect to compensate their staff frequently experience a decrease in productivity as a result of the workers’ decreased work satisfaction. Consequently, job satisfaction was dismal in the absence of support from the company’s general management.Based on the aforementioned issue, the ideal answer is for the firm to compensate its workers for any improvements recognized at the workplace. This will aid in enhancing the team’s productivity. The company should also consider the personnel’s interests, such as their hopes, ideals, and concerns about their jobs. The firm should consider the benefits and strive to improve them in order to drive people to work to their maximum capacity. Nevertheless, it should be mentioned that most businesses function best when their people are motivated by positive ideas and attitudes.
Being a global corporation, Walmart has to consider numerous ways of penetrating domestic markets. The appearance of any new entities is complicated by the already saturated state of most markets. However, Walmart has the advantage of being one of the world’s largest companies, which gives it leverage when entering a new market. At the same time, even Walmart is not invincible to local specifics. Nuances in-laws, financial and economic conditions, and even cultural relativity can offset the efforts of new entrants. Therefore, using the same strategy for every market is short-sighted. I agree with Walmart’s decision to penetrate domestic markets via different ownership forms.A joint venture is a form of ownership that presupposes sharing of risks and costs between parent companies. Companies use this strategy when the risk of entering the market on one’s own (for instance, using the form of a wholly owned subsidiary) is too high. Such instability is particularly characteristic of emerging markets, such as India. Although it is a growing economy, there are risks pertaining to taxes, bureaucracy, and cultural misunderstanding. Therefore, partnering with a local conglomerate Bharti Enterprises was a risk reduction stem for Walmart. It should also be noted that this particular venture was ultimately canceled by Walmart buying Bharti’s shares; it did smooth the former’s entrance to the market.A similar situation can be observed in South Africa, where local Massmart sold more than fifty percent of its shares to Walmart. Once again, a similar approach is used: diversifying risks by partnering with a local company to enter a high-growth
Trends and Changes of the External Environment influencing the Company’s Marketing PlanTechnologyWalmart employs blockchain, using a distributed ledger technology, to develop an automated technique to manage payments and invoices from its 70 outsourced freight carriers (Vitasek et al., 2022). It consulted DLT Labs, a pioneer in deploying and developing inventive enterprise solutions via distributed ledger technology (Vitasek et al., 2022). Walmart’s decision to use blockchain technology allows it to provide its offerings to a large population in Canada without errors in orders as this system is effective, promoting loyalty among its users. Furthermore, blockchain technology provides a safe environment for the company’s customers as each transaction has a distinct identifier, eliminating possible issues with tracking. This efficiency in order provision and tracking promotes the company’s business, ensuring its customers trust it to provide their goods without failure or payment issues.EconomicWalmart Canada decided to invest $3.5 billion in 2020 (Walmart Canada, a, 2020). Over five years, it intended to produce substantial growth to make the in-store and online shopping experience faster, simpler, and more reasonable for its customers (Walmart Canada, a, 2020). It results in a faster and better e-commerce experience and contemporary digital instruments ensuring associates serve customers best. As the organization’s business develops, especially with the-commerce and grocery illustrating an exponential growth, Walmart is unlikely to concede on offering its signature low price to customers. The company has developed trust based on this in-store and online factor. This investment would elicit many Canadian construction jobs and elicit novel partnerships with Canadian technology organizations, further marketing
Walmart as a positive force in the economy.EnvironmentalWalmart encounters various issues, including a negative reputation, stiff competition, constraints in joint ventures and business acquisitions, and rigorous cultural principles in foreign markets. For instance, Walmart has a bad reputation for polluting, as in the case of 2019 when the organization emitted 17.56m metric tonnes of greenhouse gases (Walmart Canada, a, 2020). This issue is detrimental to the company’s image, especially when sustainability and environmental protection are contentious issues for consumers. The company has stated its aim to deal with these climate effects, creating a positive image of a changing organization.Competitive EnvironmentGiant TigerThis is one of the largest discount stores in Canada and provides similar items to Walmart, making it a major competitor for the global store. It offers varying products from hardware equipment to groceries, as with its American-based counterpart (Williston, 2021). Since 2005 the chain has expanded in the Greater Toronto Area, with more than 200 stores open across Canada. Additionally, Giant Tiger utilizes a low-price strategy similar to Walmart’s, further eliciting its capacity to cut into the latter’s market share as it is a local company with greater customer loyalty. Giant Tiger focuses its recent marketing not only on low prices but on the freshness of its products and the fun of shopping in its stores (Lombardo, 2019). These issues put it at loggerheads with Walmart as it uses similar marketing tactics to gain customers.FreshCoOne of Walmart’s chief competitors is FreshCo, an organization with a growing market share due to new locations opening up in
recent years (Toneguzzi, 2021). However, Walmart has quickly rallied its resources to develop a strong online presence, allowing it to develop cost-effective ways to provide its clients with products while alleviating the necessity to visit stores. FreshCo offers fresh, frozen, chilled products, daily baked goods, cheeses, and meats. Walmart’s low-price strategy differs from FreshCo, allowing it to operate at low prices that would be detrimental to FreshCo’s bottom line.CostcoFinally, Walmart also competes with Costco for market dominance. Costco offers a smaller variety of products to effectively promote and sustain low prices for good-quality products (Chen, 2021). Knowing that low price is the best way of marketing, Costco lowers its budget for HR and advertising. The chain has a unique placement of their warehouse stores, usually in a suburban area, to ensure cheaper rent (Chen, 2021). Costco, similar to Walmart, implements E-commerce, which plays a key role during the global pandemic (Chen, 2021). However, despite Costco’s major investments in the company aimed at opening new stores, Walmart has more locations and can attract more customers this way.Walmart’s USDWalmart has a unique selling difference based on its ability to maintain customers through brand loyalty and low prices. It thrives because it relied on economies of scale and could outlast competitors that could not maintain this low-profit strategy. Additionally, customers trust Walmart’s products as it has operated in Canada since 1994 and is considered a household name (Walmart Canada, 2022). The company’s size also boosts its status as it has many branches around Canada, allowing it to provide fast
relatively easy.  * Walmart employees are not trained to interact for long with customers, which is an issue that online stores should resolve to maintain loyal customers (Stanwick & Stanwick, 2020).Possible ImplicationsWalmart’s size and customer base would help it develop an online market share faster than its competitors could. It should use this advantage to promote its business before it is too late. The organization should focus on internet growth and marketing its products using an online platform as brick-and-mortar businesses fail.Global SupportWalmart developed an environmentally-friendly business in 2019 to reduce its carbon footprint and promote sustainable business practices. Its Project Gigaton is a global commitment to cut carbon emissions by 1 billion metric tons from its supply chain by 2030. The company also sought to improve its environmental responsibility by selling environmentally friendly and sustainable products. For instance, its decision to buy Tesla semi-trucks for transportation to different areas promotes reduced fuel used in its processes (Walmart Canada, b, 2020). As such, Walmart is socially responsible and sustainable due to good business procedures.
Income inequality has long been considered one of the main factors that significantly undermine the quality of life. Moreover, wealth inequality, which allows a handful of people to get much more prosperous at the expense of millions, is even more disturbing. At the same time, people around the world are determined to acquire wealth by entirely different means, which can even be controversial. Therefore, a dedicated analysis is needed to fully understand the importance of wealth and power in the hierarchy of human values when inequality rates are unprecedentedly high. High inequality rates diminish people’s motivation to enhance their living standards, as luxurious lifestyle becomes the primary goal that almost always stays a dream and is full of controversy.Inequality can lead to objective hardships and diminished living standards in many parts of the world. Nevertheless, one of the notorious effects of extreme inequality is always the psychological perception of the phenomenon. When inequality is high and growing rapidly, luxurious lifestyles are hard to ignore (Frank). Moreover, money, in many cases, can easily be transformed into power in the US, as children are taught to be success-oriented since primary school. Millions of relatively poor American citizens can still afford many things that nationals of many other states rarely even dream of. Nevertheless, it is the inner sense of injustice and powerlessness that makes the perception of low income so painful for many.In the 1920s, the rapidly increased importance of wealth led to severe changes in culture and the social sphere in general. For instance, a completely new
stand behind the creation of an atmosphere that resembles that of the 1920s. The majority of the population starts admiring the lifestyle of the incredibly rich instead of focusing on the multiple means available for the enhancement of their lives. It is normal for a society to have a few Gatsbys that are ready to jump at every opportunity to get rich. Nevertheless, the situation where millions of people believe that they have lost all life chances because of the non-stop extensive media coverage of the luxurious lifestyles of businessmen and celebrities is destructive for any society. American Dream has not always been perceived by the majority as hoarding extreme riches. It was initially centered around harmonious society, freedom, and the ability to engage in any activities and enterprises.
In the internet era, when almost any information is accessible to nearly anyone, privacy becomes one of the most critical factors for internet users. Amongst the fundamental individual rights, the right to privacy is protected by the public government through privacy laws. Belize is not an exception; Belize’s privacy laws are listed in the Data Protection Act. This act underlines the basic principles of data protection and describes who can access and process that data and under what conditions.Data protection implies the definition and clarification of specific essential points. In that definition, Belize’s Data Protection Act shares a lot in common with the European GDPR from 2018 and the United Kingdom’s Data Protection Act from 1998 (Bartlett, 2022). It is stated that this act controls “the collection, keeping, use, and dissemination of personal data” (Data Protection Act, 2021). Following that statement clarifies what data can be considered private, what actions concerning it are allowed, and, most importantly, who has the authority to perform such activities.Although this authority at certain conditions belongs to the government or an organization in most cases, there are few exceptions that need to be discussed. In paragraph 10 of the Data Protection Act, that forbids personal data usage, part (l) excludes health care professionals. Later in paragraph 21, which explains the conditions of data transfer from a data subject to a data processor, sub-section (5), part (d) mentions “an obligation of professional secrecy” (Data Protection Act, 2021). This specific condition might explain the previously mentioned exclusion. In general, people tend to trust
example of a health care professional, it is possible to find the definition of those criteria. In Encyclopedia of pharmacy practice, it is possible to find eight principles of professionalism: altruism and caring, excellence, ethics, respect, communications, accountability, integrity, and justice (p. 205). Being so generalized and thus not bound to health care, these standards are often applied to a professional of any specialization.In Belize’s Data Protection Act, specific points about personal privacy are explicitly defined. To summarize, it states what kind of information can be viewed as confidential, the types of processing that information, who has the authority to undertake actions to process it, and at what conditions they are allowed to do so. Along with the government and legal entities, the individuals restricted with the professional secrecy agreement are also mentioned in the Data Protection Act as those who have the right to use private data. So these individuals have to match specific criteria to be considered professionals, but they can request and use personal data as part of their job if they do match them. On the whole, personal data protection is a significant concern in modern society. Passing the Data Protection Act into law, Belize’s government attempted to ensure the safety of its people in this delicate matter.
made it to China in the first place (Brooks, 2019). The warriors refused to go any further after years of warfare in foreign regions distant from home.While incorporating foreigners into Alexander’s administrative and military institutions would have made day-to-day control of his empire easier, it also led to increased resentment and mistrust on behalf of Macedonians. In order to impose his will, Alexander favored harsh punishments, which, combined with his prolongated absences, could not have increased the popularity of the ruler. However, Alexander’s treatment of his childhood friend Harpalus, whom he provided with multiple governmental positions throughout his rule, implies that he wasn’t above letting personal relationships cloud his judgment. This fact, however, is hardly surprising given Alexander’s rapidly deteriorating mental state, who has been grappling with paranoia and isolation in the later years of his rule.
IntroductionThe advancement of data and communication technology provides a new possibility for developing company strategies centered on client value co-creation. This is especially noticeable in the financial sector, more specifically, the banking field. In this situation, the competitive process can be aided by e-banking operations. Financial services are currently evolving in tandem with technological advancements. Clients always had to come directly to the financial institution to perform activities with their money. However, with the progress of technologies, the same actions were allowed to be done distantly with the help of electronic banking (e-banking).Today, e-banking implies a financial information system provided by the bank using modern wireless technology to facilitate the quick and easy conduct of financial transactions. The objective of this paper is to investigate the field of electronic banking and explore the correlation between e-banking and customer satisfaction. The significance of our study is in the critical issues of e-banking and the areas of improvement that the banks can eliminate or improve to boost customer satisfaction. To increase customer satisfaction with e-banks, businesses must increase the following factors: speed of operations, dependability, safety and confidentiality, and a client-oriented approach.Literature ReviewIn the last 10-20 years, financial institutions have significantly moved from traditional financing to E-banking (Khatoon, Zhengliang, and Hussain, 2020). The waves of development and technical breakthroughs aided banks in expanding their number of clients and E-banking products, which paved the way for financial services to flourish and become more accessible (Khatoon, Zhengliang, and Hussain, 2020). Clients now can see watch their account balances, perform cash
transactions, deposit accounts, text, and transfer payments to other individuals and companies using directions supplied to their smartphones by institutions.Electronic banking is also known as internet or mobile banking. These are platforms that banks may use to offer clients easier access to services (Nurhadi and Ilfitriah, 2020). Namely, a client utilizing online banking does so via a computer connected to the internet, while a consumer using banking apps does so using a smartphone or tablet (Khatoon, Zhengliang, and Hussain, 2020). According to Khatoon, Zhengliang, and Hussain (2020), wireless usage of e-banking demonstrates the distinction between the two types of banking settings, while users consider flexibility to be among the most crucial characteristic of the electronic banking business. The most important aspect of electronic banking is its dependability (Haq and Awan, 2020). More significantly, bank consumers think that important online financial institutions are being utilized, even though digital banking is the least expensive route.Customer SatisfactionClient satisfaction is among the essential topics in consumer research nowadays. In general, it connects buying process to post-buying phenomena, including attitude adjustment, purchase frequency, and brand recognition (Al Ali, 2021). According to Hammoud, Bizri, and El Baba (2018), a sense of pleasure occurs when consumers share their impression of the goods or services and when their experiences align with the expectations. Thus, satisfaction levels correlate directly with the work of banks’ apps and services.Define consumer satisfaction, a variety of definitions have been presented. Nonetheless, the concept of evaluating service execution and assumptions appears to be shared by most interpretations. Hammoud, Bizri, and
El Baba (2018) describe satisfaction as a favorable post-purchase assessment judgment about a good or service. Likewise, Banu, Mohamed, and Parayitam (2019) described client satisfaction as a customer reaction to the appraisal of the observed gap between hopes and outcomes after usage. Satisfaction may also be defined as the result of a post-purchase evaluation of a service or good as opposed to the prior-buying stage’s expectations.Other studies, contrary to this, have discovered that the influence exercised throughout the purchase and consuming stages of the goods or services may also have a significant effect on the user’s judgments of contentment. Therefore, client satisfaction is a consumer’s experience of joy or unhappiness after comparing an item’s or service’s effectiveness to their expectations (Carranza et al., 2021). Following these criteria and the context of this study, client satisfaction is the overall user’s perspective formed in reaction to utilizing any type of E-Banking service. As a result, E-Banking qualities may enhance, decline, or maintain the same level of client contentment.Customer Satisfaction and E-BankingWith a variety of research pointing to a link between e-banking customer experience and customer happiness, the issue lies within the definition of services of products that make customers increasingly happy and satisfied. According to our study’s examination of the literature, the following factors play an immense role in client satisfaction: speed of operations, dependability, safety and confidentiality, and a client-oriented approach (Usman, Monoarfa, and Marsofiyati, 2020). With the proper combination of these elements, an e-banking organization will be able to increase the level of customer satisfaction. Additionally,
to create a bigger client base, Alabsy (2018) advises banks to make a more extensive awareness of the service ambiguity.The speed of operations implies the speed of money transfers, payments, money withdrawals, or money deposits. Dependability in this situation can be described as the overall reliability of the app and the safety of its usage. Additionally, safety and confidentiality prove to play a significant role in the evaluation of satisfaction levels. In case an organization has a bad reputation and a scandalous record, the level of trust in the company can significantly decline. The last factor, the client-oriented approach, is responsible for the quick response of the support team. Proper responses from support teams can change the attitudes of clients drastically.MethodologyThe given research is based on the qualitative approach, which focuses on the accumulation and analysis of the retrieved information. Among the chosen variables were the e-banks such as PayPal Bank, WebMoney Bank, and Payoneer Bank. The selected sample was a group of five people who willingly decided to participate in the study and share their opinions on their experiences while testing the banks mentioned above, specifically their services. The selected group analyzed in one day and shared their results via a Google platform.As has been mentioned, the analyzed literature has defined the following elements like the ones that contribute to client satisfaction from e-banks: speed of operations, dependability, safety and confidentiality, and a client-oriented approach. Therefore, the group of volunteers has been asked to test the apps of the banks and rate the given variables
notably electronic banking. From this perspective, the usage of e-banking by financial institution consumers is seen as a significant achievement and has been thoroughly investigated in many kinds of research. Decades ago clients had to go directly to the financial institution and today everything can be accessed via smartphones and other gadgets. Yet, while more and more services are being offered to consumers, the key is client satisfaction, which can be defined by several factors.According to the analyzed studies, among the factors that play the most prominent role in client satisfaction speed of operations, dependability, safety and confidentiality, and a client-oriented approach are the leading elements. To compare the given information with reality, research was conducted with the help of five participants. The testes banks, PayPal Bank, WebMoney Bank, and Payoneer Bank, revealed that the leading e-platform is PayPal Bank, whose factors were proven to be high-quality and led to client satisfaction.
In recent years, the number of cash transfer programs in developing countries has been increasing. The authors of When the Money Runs Out point out both the promise and the limitations of this initiative in terms of permanent welfare improvement (Braid et al.169. The researchers found that cash transfers led to sustained increases in women’s educational attainment and fertility. However, the authors note that after support declined, positive outcomes, including declines in HIV rates, early marriage, and pregnancy rates, waned (Braid et al. 160). Even if the poor receive unconditional transfers, it helps in the short term to improve education and welfare.The study’s theoretical basis was the articles that argue that there is evidence of the long-term impact of the analyzed initiative on education. Researchers have not overlooked the limitations of the research, noting that in terms of data such as skills, employment, and earnings, the results are still controversial. The researchers’ work is based on experimental evaluations of the impact of a two-year CCT program targeting adolescent girls in Malawi (Braid et al. 170). The authors compared a control group that did not receive assistance with those participants who received unconditional cash transfers. For the sake of purity of the experiment, the data were evaluated two years after the program ended, and the girls stopped receiving payments (1700. The girls who participated in the experiment had to come to the distribution point every month. Interviews and questionnaires were also conducted with participants as part of this study (Braid et al. 173). One of the key findings is that this initiative has the potential to bring young girls back to school. According to the authors, CCT programs are proven to improve school performance among vulnerable populations. This research can be used to justify the need for this type of program.
One can argue that the short story “Where Are You Going, Where Have You Been?” has a fitting open ending that both represents the mythical nature of the events occurring to Connie while also providing enough evidence to indicate what had happened to her. On one end, the reader realizes that she was most likely murdered, as “she felt her breath start jerking back and forth in her lungs as if it were something Arnold Friend was stabbing her with again and again with no tenderness” (Oates). However, when Connie recovers consciousness, she is experiencing something like an out of body experience.It is obvious that she is dead and going into the afterlife, but it opens up numerous questions in the end as to who Arnold Friend really is, how is he all-knowing and seemingly omnipotent? There is always the potential that it may be a dream, given that she went outside and could have fallen sleep knowing her tendency to daydream. The open ending arises as to what is next for Connie and whether she is going into paradise, or just an illusion of it created by her killer. Connie’s spirit has seemingly changed from her physical appearance, but the audience is never given the full picture.One critical analysis by Samantha Conover suggests that Connie actually experienced an abduction and some form of rape or sexual assault. The story does not directly portray this but potentially utilizes euphemisms and other literally devices to suggest that this powerful, rich man, that most likely stalked her was a sexual predator. It is known that the short story was based by Oates on a real-life serial killer, who murdered several young girls before capture, suggesting a typology and type of sexual aggression demonstrated through his fulfillment when murdering his victims. Connie’s situation represents that of so many other women that have faced sexual assault, she knew the perpetrator but not closely, she was encountered alone, but in broad daylight, seemingly when no crime should occur. Finally, her weakness and out-of-body experience could suggest that she simply was traumatized to the point of no longer having recognition of her own body (Conover 125). It is a horrifying, but sadly accurate comparison drawn through imagery and metaphors in Oates story, indicating that it may not have been mythical at all, but an example of terrible realism.
that TSA security checks may invade people’s privacy. However, due to the complexity of security, some of the guidelines have not been stopped by courts. The author describes how special screening processes are highly invasive to individuals’ privacy. It is worth noting that any customer can be flagged in the airport for a special screening. TSA provides people with a number that can exempt customers from numerous security checks.In conclusion, the author indicates that privacy is a hard concept to define because it changes due to court rulings and new technologies. This is one of the problems in creating security guidelines that concern privacy. It is essential to note that the author provides an argument for privacy and against privacy. The article explains the concept of privacy in security checks in a structured way that is easy to follow. The provision of the example is crucial in enhancing the argument made by the author.Critical Evaluation
object of active study (Nelson et al., 2018). This paper examines the interaction and features of the development of ethnic identity for white and black early adolescents.A study by del Toro and Wang (2020) examined whether school cultural socialization of 961 African American teenagers predicted GPA through their ethnic and racial identity. The results showed that teens who perceived more school socialization had higher grades at 1 and 2 years. Moreover, the study discusses the implications of how educators can help teens of color succeed in school by reducing tension and miscommunication between white and black teens.A number of studies support the idea that, despite the relatively generally accepted concept that parenting and identities are predominantly influenced by parents, this is not entirely true. The final meta-analytical model adjusted for sample size showed that parental ethnic socialization predicted ERI study and adherence, while only peer training for bias predicted ERI adherence. The results of this study highlight the importance of both parents and peers for cultural socialization processes during adulthood (Hughes et al., 2017). Thus, the study confirms the concept of the formation of ethnic identity through communication. Finally, it supposes that cultural socialization between white and black teenagers, with an adaptive approach, is beneficial for their personality.
An aboriginal person is an individual characterized as a descendant of indigenous inhabitants of Australia. Before the arrival of Europeans, the indigenous people of Australia occupied most of the land, which they protected and fertilized to support cultivation. The aboriginal people mainly practiced hunting and gathering as their source of livelihood before adopting agricultural practices. The aboriginal people arrived in Australia from Asia via Southeast Asia and have inhabited the land between 45000 and 50000 years ago. After the arrival of European colonialists, the indigenous people faced many challenges such as economic, political, and disruption of their tradition. The aboriginal people lost their culture, land, and family without considering the extermination of European imperialism policies; they became enslaved by the Europeans. During the colonial period, the indigenous people faced a high rate of discrimination, resulting in displacement since the colonial powers occupied a large part of the fertile lands, resulting in many deaths of indigenous communities. For instance, over 200 languages the aboriginal people spoke lost value since the European colonialist did not recognize their culture. Many families were forced out of their land, thus dispersing to other parts of Australia.The descendant of the aboriginal people should be recognized as one person since they share the bloodline, customs, and beliefs with their ancestors, who lived over 50000 years ago in the land. Besides sharing cultural norms, the descendants can be classified as one people because they have a similar palace of origin: the Philippines, Brunei, Malaysia, East Timor, Singapore, and Indonesia located in the Southeast of Asia. Therefore, they deserve equal rights like any other community, enabling them to protect their culture and heritage as one person.
The fight for the independence of Latin America was of great historical significance. As a result of this struggle, the people inhabiting the former Spanish and Portuguese colonies achieved national independence that served their vital interests. Among the leaders of the struggle for independence came from different classes. However, because of the small and weak colonial bourgeoisie, the liberation movement’s leadership was, in most cases, in the hands of the Creole landlords. The growth of opposition among the Creoles and the emergence of secret Creole organizations aimed at plotting were also the reasons why this group led the uprising.By the end of the 18th century, in the Spanish and Portuguese colonies in America, the bourgeoisie formation accelerated, the layer of Creoles focused on foreign markets strengthened, and the intelligentsia emerged. These social groups were acutely dissatisfied with the colonial authorities’ policy of severe restrictions on trade and enterprise (Doc. B). They also resented the discrimination against the Creoles in the legal sphere and the lack of favorable conditions for creative activity. At the same time, the great mass of peasants, consisting of Indians and mestizos, was brutally exploited. They sought the opportunity to work freely on their ancestral lands. The struggle of the people of Spanish America for independence objectively met the needs of capitalist development, which was impeded by the colonial regime.The international situation was favorable to the struggle for independence. At the end of the 18th and beginning of the 19th centuries, Spain was involved in devastating wars with France and England. In these
According to Lufkin (2021), there is an urgent need to reduce the impact on physical and digital presenteeism in the era of pandemic and social transformations. This article focuses on the importance of recognizing true motives for presenteeism and defines the impact of subconscious biases on employee relationships. At the same time, the mere exposure and halo effects are associated with unfair or ineffective promotions that determine the quality of work. The idea that many biases unreasonably support presenteeism and negatively contribute to performance is correct, and differentiating employees’ achievements using favors seems questionable.Presenteeism is problematic because most people continue addressing their subconscious beliefs about professional growth. Lufkin (2021) notices that not all employees can come to work early and leave late to demonstrate their devotion to the organization. Some people set priorities instead of achieving work-life balance and succeeding as an employee and a parent. They believe that their presence at the workplace helps get promotions or rewards, but the pandemic restrictions have already proved that remote work may be effective. Such attitudes towards presenteeism discourage and impose obligations that hardly improve performance.However, the attention to the halo and mere exposure effects provokes some questions and concerns. The author admits that leaders and managers think about people who bring coffee or communicate as hard workers (Lufkin, 2021). In today’s business world, management principles have been improved, and employees get access to new practices at different levels. Good leaders will never promote a worker because of an improved ability to make coffee. If changes at the workplace are based on insignificant aspects, such organizations’ progress is questionable. For example, there are two sick individuals: one is present but does nothing because of a runny nose and a headache, and another is at home but works online to meet the deadline. An efficient manager analyzes the situation and understands the current contributions of both employees. If presenteeism fallaciously affects the attitude towards such employees, the team’s professionalism is low.It is wrong to believe that showing faces at the office is a criterion for career growth. Lufkin’s article reveals concerns about presenteeism and its impact on people’s judgments. Sometimes, a person needs a break or a day off to work effectively, and absence is not a sign of unprofessionalism and weakness. Being present gives no guarantees about the quality of work, and this assessment makes companies competitive and strong.
two hundred seems to be low (Service, 2017). The Kermode bear is the American black bear’s subspecies, but what makes this animal so unusual is its recessive gene that colors the bears’ fur white or creamy (National Geographic, 2017).The rareness of this species attracts additional interest in these bears – only 400 spirit bears currently live in British Columbia (Groc, 2020). According to National Geographic (2017), their population locates in the Great Brain Rainforest, which represents a 6.4-million-hectare temperate rainforest and is a great environment for this species of animals. In addition, this living area provides spirit bears with appropriate sustenance, such as salmon and a variety of berries, insects, plants, fruits, and nuts (Service, 2017). Although the animal is massive, huge, and sometimes considered dangerous, it is shy and mysterious in nature; therefore, if not disturbed, the representative of this species poses no threat (Service, 2017). However, the animal is considered dangerous only by tourists; according to Service (2017), indigenous populations see the spirit bear as sacred or holy mainly because of its unusual creamy color. Based on the described characteristics, it can be concluded that spirit bears are some of the most unique and rare species on the planet; hence, they need to be protected and their environment preserved.
Most American investors and people in business do not support investigative journalism in the business community. This thesis is of salience as it reveals the media’s hidden skirmishes, especially in conducting and reporting findings related to business and trade. The news houses have the right to conduct research on each sector of the economy and pass the results to the members of the society. However, this right has been compromised over time by the top businessmen. The main reasons for this struggle are the efforts of entrepreneurs to protect the image of their enterprises. This thesis, however, can be controversial as it can lead to a debate on the whole matter. The business class can argue that they only oppose investigative journalism to protect the privacy of their business and not hide information from their goods. Publications can make one company vulnerable to its competitors. With the details, the opponent can strategize to destroy the business. This topic of discussion is of paramount salience in a journalism and society course as it divulges challenges faced in journalism and its effect on society.The American press has a role in monitoring major trends in the country’s political sector. The news houses play a crucial role in researching, compiling, disseminating, and exchanging political content. This thesis is essential as it has a wide-ranging impact on democratic governance and political practices. The rise of political media is facilitated by various reasons, including the increased freedom of speech and expression that has been granted to the media and mass communication sector.
government policies, and their disgrace is revealed chiefly through their opinions on the national news. The topic focuses on the government policies and how they impact the citizens of America and the role of journalism in governance and policy implementation. The government is responsible for the assessing, planning, formulation, and implementation of the policies, and the media houses and journalists perform the role of passing the information to the people. The topic is crucial as it analyses the effects of the policies on various communities of people living in America and how the media communicates to the people about such procedures. The policies affect people differently and sometimes they sideline other societies such as the Black Americans. The topic can be controversial as it may build an argument that it is racially biased. Government policies affect people differently, but some policies hurt other communities, such as African and Indian Americans. This topic is crucial in journalism and society courses as it defines journalism’s role in policy implementation and communication and the widespread impacts on people.
Artificial intelligence (AI) continues to grow more and more popular in the spheres that involve processing large amounts of information within limited timelines. Marketing is among those; the key to success in it lies in constant awareness of the recent tendencies in the market as well as in consumer behavior, which calls for never-ending data analysis. The use of AI, meanwhile, helps automate the process, consequently improving the productivity of businesses, possibly by up to 40% (Ramyalg, 2022, para. 3). The improvement means not only saving time and money, but also better quality of customer service due to the possibility to invest more resources in it. Another essential benefit from using AI is the reduction of error rates by minimizing the human factor (“AI could reduce,” 2018). The algorithm does not skip anything and cannot be tired or distracted, which, along with the incomparably higher speed, makes it substantially more effective than humans are.The latter nuance actually is the reason why many assume that AI will be able to replace marketing jobs in the future. In addition, it is worth noting that the human factor involves bias and prejudice, which can distort judgement and, consequently, influence the final decision (“AI could reduce,” 2018). Considering all of the above, it seems to be relevant to guess that artificial intelligence could replace people in marketing jobs because it is substantially more reliable. In the opinion of those who support this idea, such a shift could result in substantially better understanding of consumer behavior, notably, a broader perspective on
End-Stage Renal Failure (ESRF) is a decrease in the excretory filtration systems of the kidneys, which arose due to the death of nephrons and was provoked by a chronic organ disease. The extinction of renal function causes a violation of normal life, to which various body systems respond with complications. The incidence of ESRF has recently reached more than 1 in 7 adults in the US, with 144 cases per million reported globally (Cobo et al., 2018). In the last decade, the prevalence of ESRF has been steadily increasing in parallel with the rapid growth of the population, including about 759 people per one million (Benjamin & Lappin, 2021). In 2017, the ESRF-caused mortality rate was 28% worldwide, with frequent comorbidities of ESRF being hypertension, diabetes mellitus, cardiovascular diseases, and malignancy (Cobo et al., 2018). Given this evidence, ESRF is a highly dangerous disorder with numerous adverse effects on the population’s health.The body cavity associated with the disease is the abdominal cavity, where the kidneys, the main affected organs, are located. Kidneys are gradually losing their functions, failing to filter blood; there may also be a deterioration in blood clotting, the level of prothrombin decreases, and thrombocytopenia occurs (Cobo et al., 2018). The affected body system is the urinary system, which cannot efficiently eliminate waste from the blood; however, changes in the central nervous system may also occur, such as sleep disorders, problems with concentration, and inhibited reactions.Prefixes that could be used for describing the disease are nephro-, hemato-, patho-, and reno-. While nephro- and reno-
another word specific for the kidney system, as it relates to the tumor of the renal cortex; a nephrocyte is a cell involved in the excretory process.As chronic renal failure causes a decrease in hemoglobin levels, hematopoiesis is a term related to this disorder. Although this process is defined as the creation of blood cells, during ESRF, it becomes suppressed. Hypertension, myocarditis, and pericarditis are also related to the disorder (Cobo et al., 2018). Hypertension is defined as elevated blood pressure. Myocarditis is an inflammation of the heart muscles. Pericarditis is the swelling of the heart’s pericardium. Congestive heart failure , where the heart cannot efficiently pump blood, can occur. Convulsions or random muscle contractions can also be observed in most ESRF patients (Cobo et al., 2018). Skin irritability is a frequent symptom during ESRF. Anemia , or lack of hemoglobin, is also closely related to ESRF. Diarrhea is another condition that can emerge, with the patient’s bowel movements becoming watery.It is extremely difficult to keep my productivity up; I feel fatigued most of the time. I often have a dry mouth, and I recently lost a lot of body weight. I noticed that my skin is less normal, it has less color and is easily irritated.
The late 19th century saw the introduction of the first women’s page. During this period of explicit and unfiltered sexism, society believed that women had peanuts for brains. The evolution of women’s page has evolved over the years in response to need. A women’s page serves as a space to help each other and chart the way forward. Replacing the women’s page and the style section or using them interchangeably will only work to push women aside. A Style Section should not replace the women’s page because it addresses women’s issues in a male-dominated society. The women’s page will help women more, and their affairs will be well-addressed in all aspects of life.Feminist issues are still worth talking about in our time. The discrimination against women might have reduced over the years, but all that was due to awareness being raised. There are still areas of society where sexism has not been fully addressed. Replacing the women’s page with style and fashion or using the two subjects interchangeably will only promote sexism because it communicates: “You are not that important, so we will give you the less important stuff.” While reading the newspaper, the style section is usually read for fun or not read. People want to read things that actually matter, something that impacts society at large, not “what am I going to wear today?”. In other words, women need a voice. The style section in any newspaper presents information that the public can do without, while the women’s page can actually help.Some of the
issues facing women and which the Feminist Movement has been trying to address are: 1. Domestic Labor/Chores. It is not unlikely that you would find a woman letting go of her job to “take care of her family.” Man and wife might both be working a nine-to-five job, but the woman also will prepare food for the family, do the dishes and the laundry, prepare the kids for school and still “look nice” for the man. There should be an equal division of domestic labor between spouses or at least some agreement in the family setup concerning chores. 2. The Media – Advertisements on modern televisions can subtly propagate sexist mannerisms. The media uses products widely used by society to promote stereotypic information to the masses. Few organizations are dominated by the male ego, which has an idea of what a “real” man should look like at the cost of displaying a lesser version of women.A women’s page in a newspaper is a space where women can express themselves and communicate issues that concern them. Any other area in mainstream media has been saturated by males who know little to nothing about issues that affect women. In 2012, during the elections, a famous newspaper talked about Hillary Clinton’s pink lipstick and her sense of fashion as being off. Women have a voice and can contribute to society, thus emphasizing the women’s page rather than the style section.The women’s page encourages women to speak out, thus benefiting women. Cultural practices have pushed women to the point where
Examining social changes occurring in the U.S. at the beginning of the 20 th century, one must admit that the pace and scale gained by the feminist movement were by far among the most impressive ones. By challenging social norms and accepted gender roles, American women transformed the perception of themselves in society, thus, redefining the gender dynamics within it. When considering the legal regulations and policies that allowed for the described change, one must mention the 19 th Amendment to the U.S. Constitution. However, the process of enforcing the acceptance of the 19 th Amendment has not been linear and consistent, mainly due to the presence of racism and race-based prejudices in some states. Though the early Suffrage movement lacked diversity and the associated perspectives, it did lay the foundation for the 19trh Amendment despite quite vocal claims against change among some of the more racist Tennessee women, who saw the regulation as the gateway to expanding the rights of African Americans.Remarkably, the arguments that renowned suffragettes introduced in their discussion of the 19 th Amendment varied significantly. For instance, Belle Kearney, while supporting the liberation of women, focused primarily on White middle-class members, whereas Adella Hunt Logan actively promoted the emancipation of women of all races and ethnicities (Hewitt and Lawson 2019). In turn, the perspective that Kearney offered was quite different from those of other prominent suffragettes. For instance, Addams, who also actively encouraged the introduction of the 19 th Amendment into the sociocultural and sociopolitical environment of the U.S., saw it mostly
as a “natural extension of household duties” (666). Therefore, the interpretation of the significance of voting for women that Addams offered did not assign a particularly high value to the change.The specified idea of viewing the attainment of the right to vote could be seen as trivializing the tremendous change that the right to vote caused for female American citizens. Therefore, Winslow’s representation of the issue is understandably more popular since the latter insisted on the 19 th Amendment being the opportunity to address the tremendous injustice that American women had been suffering. Specifically, Winslow referred to the change in question as the ethical and cultural awakening of the U.S. Specifically, Winslow explains that significant alterations in the social dynamics are bound to happen once “the President realizes that brutal bullying isn’t quite a statesmanlike method for setting a demand for justice at home” (669). Therefore, the perspectives on the subject matter varied significantly, yet the general idea of change was perceived as tremendously positiveUnfortunately, not all women wholeheartedly supported the introduction of the 19 th Amendment into the American sociopolitical and sociocultural setting. For instance, Tennessee women became quite infamous for their efforts to counteract the introduction of the Amendment and, effectively, ban it (Hewitt and Lawson 2019). To dissect the nature of the described conflict, one should point to the presence of explicit racism within American society of the time (Hewitt and Lawson 2019). According to Hewitt and Lawson (2019), Tennessee women assumed that the 19 th Amendment would become the gateway to African
it would be wrong to separate the American Suffragette movement from the rest of social trends observed in the U.S. community on the specified time slot. Namely, the aspects of progressivism, such as the movement against segregation and the focus on the needs of the working class intersected with the Suffragette movement to a rather substantial extent (Hewitt and Lawson 2019). Therefore, the sociocultural and sociopolitical changes observed in the U.S. in the 1920s could be seen as a single progressive movement and positive force.While not being as inclusive due to the neglect of the specific needs of African American women and the lack of representation thereof in it, the U.S. Suffragette movement of the 1920s created a platform for the further emancipation of American women. However, the problem of racism and the resulting complications in advancing the regulation have proven the necessity of inclusivity and the essential principles of humanity to be seen as inseparable for feminism. Namely, embracing the needs of all women and encouraging the interventionalist perspective, particularly, the union among women of all races, religious beliefs, and ethnic communities, has proven to be the critical focus of the feminist movement. Thus, the described change has predetermined the evolution of the American Suffrage movement.
AbstractThe construction industry is changing rapidly, modernising and improving existing house-building tools. These changes are coupled with an increasing trend towards green construction, in which the environmental and economic aspects of construction are effectively balanced, and harm to the environment and people minimised. This is especially noticeable in the cladding industry, which protects buildings from external hazards and adds aesthetic features. Different materials are used for cladding, but it is not clear which is more sustainable and user-friendly. In 2020, propelled by UK environmental organizations, the UK expert panel recommended large scale testing of cladding systems to better understand what types of cladding are more eco-friendly. In this context a review of popular cladding material aimed at finding the most eco-friendly cladding is especially relevant. An extensive literature review of digitally available academic sources, interviews and questionnaires with professionals in the industry was undertaken to find the best façade material to meet the requirements of eco-sustainability and cost-effectiveness.In this work the comparison of different cladding materials was undertaken. They were compared in terms of durability, cost-effectiveness, water and heat retention, combustibility, and harmful emissions into the atmosphere. The data was gathered through looking at raw official statistics posted by official government bodies such as the office for national statistics and by looking at cladding ecological properties analyzed in scholarly sources. Moreover, interviews were taken from leading experts in the industry to find out modern tendencies in building.The key trends in cladding industry nowadays include the use of vinyl siding, sandwich panels, thermopanels and clinker. Siding is
made of vinyl, and though it is a low-cost material, plastic is prone to cracking, so it is not suitable for buildings situated in hot regions. Sandwich panels are cost-effective but not environmentally friendly; production of panels presupposes chemical processing, as a result of which formaldehyde is released into the environment. Moreover, strength indicators of buildings made of sandwich panels are lower that the indicators of houses made of wood or brick. Clinker is not cheap; although it has excellent performance properties, including great strength, it can hardly be used for large-scale building due to its high price. Thermopanels blend the ease of use of vinyl siding and the strength of clinkers. They are durable and resistant to decay and heat, and have excellent building properties. Moreover, thermopanels are ecologically friendly. However, panels with polyurethane foam are more expensive than siding.The key finding of the whole study is that wood is a material with a unique combination of natural, environmentally friendly properties and a comparable low cost of use. For the UK market, wood is an excellent resource that is technically easy to transport and renewable. Based on the findings, it can be concluded that wood building materials, including recycled materials, should be used for façade cladding. This has made it possible to follow the principles of green building and invest in improving Britain’s environmental and economic agenda.IntroductionThe ongoing civilisational progress of society is naturally reflected in all professional spheres. The emergence of new ethical standards and a philosophy of concern for the environment as a
manifestation of the evolution of human consciousness impose restrictions on the activities undertaken. While in the context of professions related to environmental activism and human interaction, such transformations are evident, these trends are not so tangible in the construction industry. Nevertheless, the gradual incorporation of new social and environmental standards into the construction industry is difficult to ignore: more and more companies are starting to produce environmentally friendly materials or products with a reduced carbon footprint (REF). At the same time, the production of such materials aims to reduce non-recyclable industrial waste and reduce the company’s polluting footprint (REF).From a developer’s point of view, trends towards a new construction approach are also being seen: houses and neighbourhoods under construction are being made green and environmentally friendly (REF). This mainly includes the use of durable but high-quality materials, whose long-term sustainability will not affect their ecological performance (REF). However, the impact on the local landscape, the number of natural resources expended, and the cumulative construction waste are also considered.At the same time, the central aim of any business, namely the preservation and multiplication of capital, dictates its requirements for companies in the construction industry (|REF). This is not a negative manifestation of capitalism, but the thesis of companies’ emphasis on profitability should be recognised as a fact. Manufacturers cannot focus only on finding and producing entirely environmentally friendly materials, as this would have a tangible effect on the financing of projects. In pursuing the perfect resource, a company risks losing all profits and delaying production, which becomes
a serious threat to local competitiveness.Consequently, companies struggling to meet current agendas and social demands need to find a sustainable balance between environmental and economic benefit strategies. For this reason, business leaders are not faced with the idea of pouring all their resources into the environmental direction, so the term most eco-friendly product may seem redundant. On the contrary, among the many evolving options, manufacturers are looking for those that best fit the company’s and the market’s economic and environmental needs.In the context of the discussion of this balance, the phenomenon of green building should be highlighted. This is a new socio-economic trend, which refers to the construction and development areas that seek to minimise their negative impact on the environment. The concept reflects an unconditional desire on the part of the community to care for and protect nature, including in such an avant-garde area as construction. The traditional view of construction as profit maximisation with no regard for environmental damage is rapidly replaced by a green building philosophy. This is particularly noticeable in developed countries, among which the UK is a prime example. The choice of a particular European region is driven by the UK’s strong economic and investment appeal on the world stage.As a centre of international trade, the UK is highly socio-economically and culturally developed. This, in turn, is reflected in the public consciousness of both ordinary consumers and local companies: by keeping to market relevance, parties ensure that construction is environmentally friendly. This applies to choosing green neighbourhoods, reducing construction’s carbon footprint,
and investing in the most environmentally and economically balanced consumables. The UK context will therefore prove most informative in the European market to explore critical green building trends in the production and use of cladding materials.The purpose of the research workThis research project’s central and sole purpose is to examine available academic sources and case studies to identify the most environmentally friendly and cost-effective cladding material for the UK context.Objectives of the research workAs the research objective described above is complex and multi-factorial, it is appropriate to fragment it into separate goals, the sequential resolution of which is a crucial methodological strategy of the paper. Thus, the overall academic objectives of this study include, but are not limited to: 1. To conduct a comprehensive literature review based on primary and secondary filtering criteria collected through digital academic platforms. 2. To critically evaluate and qualitatively compare the literature prepared, justify its selection and assess the reliability of the sources used. 3. To theorise and outline the academic framework of the green building phenomenon. 4. To identify the parameters governing the metrics of environmental friendliness and profitability of material production. 5. To identify the cladding material used in the UK construction market, which satisfies environmentally friendly and profitable production criteria. 6. To summarise the findings and form a unified and holistic conclusion of the entire research project.Literary overviewA brief history of constructionConstruction is one of the fundamental trades of human activity, dating back literally to the emergence of primitive communities. The first manifestations of this craft were attempts
to create safe shelter from whatever materials were available: the first rock caves and mounds that protected humans from survival threats were built (Swenson, 2020). Along with the development of human thinking, there was a parallel enhancement of creative and economic skills, often attributed to the biological evolution of the brain through the development of tools (Swenson, 2020; Fiodorov, 2021). Although there may be alternative views of this evolution, such as the religious context described by Verkaaik (2013), the phenomenon of general cognitive-labour evolution is challenging to deny. To put it another way, better houses and buildings appeared over time, corresponding to the increasing human need for comfort. Stony caves could no longer provide comfort and status to individuals, and as a result, the first decorated houses, called dugouts, began to appear (Trofimova et al., 2019).Such structures did not have the windows and doors familiar to the modern reader, and in fact, they were earth hollows that maintained a favourable temperature regime inside (Frost, 2018). Such constructions were made more complex and improved to obtain more comfortable microclimatic conditions, applied and aesthetic appeal, as shown in Figure 1.Figure 1. Figure reflecting the everyday life of primitive people, including the form of their primitive construction (Frost, 2018).Eventually, construction reached the level of progress described by current trends. The requirements of modern humans for housing have increased to a large extent, and this is only natural given the evolutionary increase in the needs of individuals associated with general civilisational socio-economic development (Fiodorov, 2021). One such criterion for quality
housing in the new market is fulfilling the new basic requirements of safety and security and the observance of an environmental safety framework. Socially responsible individuals understand how damaging the construction business can be, encouraging environmentally conscious producers (Ghisellini et al., 2018).However, it is fair to acknowledge that this thesis is not exhaustive for contemporary society, as overpopulation and intensifying competition for resources reflect an alternative plan. More precisely, even environmentally damaging, environmentally hazardous, but relatively safe for humans, construction will find a consumer who does not consider the environmental aspects of production. This is a natural phenomenon, reflecting the ambiguity of the current phase of construction. At the same time, it can be expected that the emerging trend towards sustainable production will become a common agenda for the years to come; for this reason, discussions about these principles are relevant now.Green buildingAs a natural stage in the development of building philosophy, the concept of green building has emerged. In general, the term refers to the construction of buildings, which aims to reduce energy and material resources consumption from the production phase to the long-term operation phases. It is a form of subsistence construction, prioritising building houses’ economic and economic needs and environmental concerns.Academic literature has identified five key challenges for green building. Firstly, the trend aims to reduce the cumulative negative impact of construction and building materials on human health and the environment. GABS (2016) writes about reducing CO2 emissions by 84 gigatons per year by 2050. Second, the green building aims to use municipal
resources more sustainably, which means more meaningful energy use. Green building is expected to reduce energy consumption by 50% by 2050 (Rakicevic, 2021). Thirdly, this philosophy invests in finding the most eco-friendly materials, which means that the research function is an integral part of green building. One of the non-obvious areas of such construction is to support the national economy by creating new jobs (Canada GBC, 2016). Finally, the green philosophy seeks to maximise the optimised use of home resources and maximise benefits with little risk to the environment.Notably, this trend for the UK is relatively recent. Figure 8 shows that academic interest in Green Building emerged around 35 years ago and increased exponentially almost every year. This confirms the hypothesis of increased environmental awareness among the population. Remarkably, contrary to expectations, the scientific study of Green Building goes beyond a thematic focus. More specifically, Figure 9 describes the general academic categories in which scientific papers are published. Energy sciences, applied physics, plant sciences, and green sustainability research are also interested in green building. Public interest in this issue is generally stable for Britons: Figure 10 shows a histogram of google query frequencies for critical terms. From this data: people search for information on green building with equal frequency, but that activity peaks during the autumn/winter season. It can be assumed that at this time, users are actively planning home renovations, which will begin with the arrival of spring.Figure 8.

Chronogram of google query frequencies for the keywords ‘green building’ (blue) and ‘green construction’ (red) in the UK context (obtained via private access, interpreted with Google Trends).The evolution of cladding materialsOne of the developments in the construction industry has been the production of cladding materials. At this point in the scientific literature, a plurality of views has emerged about what such materials are and what functional role they fulfil. For example, Miller (2020) points out that cladding is one of the most common construction materials, including paving stones, siding, tiles, that has a breathable function. Liška and Nečasová (2020) point to the protective role of cladding, saying that “the basic function of building cladding is to protect the interior against the effects of the external environment” (p. 127).A similar view is taken by Ginwala and John (2017), who prioritise the protective function of cladding against external stimuli. Such threats include fire, wind, and physical damage, including corrosion of building materials (Dahlstrom Roll Form, 2018). Finally, Dmitrieva et al. (2021) highlighted a unique, decorative role. In this context, it is particularly noteworthy to note that cladding materials often have aesthetic characteristics that make consumers choose them over their competitors. Figure 2 displays the differences in the cladding materials used. It shows wood, stoneware, and putty cladding materials, which give the overall exterior a unique visual
characteristic. In general, there are no rules regarding the use of cladding in terms of aesthetic objectives, with identical or similar technical aspects of materials: every builder and homeowner has the right to choose any covering that seems most attractive.Figure 2. There are three types of cladding materials on a single wall: putty, timber, and stone (Duffield Timber, 2021).Generally, it is appropriate to summarise that cladding materials are used in construction to decorate buildings and protect them from external and internal hazards, including harmful environmental influences and corrosion. This set of goals drove the creation of cladding materials from antiquity when primitive communities fortified their homes with clay, leather, wood, or stone cladding (Fiodorov, 2018; Swenson, 2020). This preserved houses from winds and other natural shocks but did not always fulfil a strictly aesthetic function. Cladding materials first gained particular significance in ancient civilisational communities, such as Ancient Egypt and Ancient Rome (McGreevy, 2020). At that time, clay materials were used to create a fireproof protective layer and solve problems of visual significance. Figure 3 perfectly shows the first ancient Roman ceramic tile linings made of clay.Figure 3. Fragments of well-preserved ancient Roman tile cladding (McGreevy, 2020).By now, the need to clad buildings has undergone significant modernisation compared to how it used to be. The need to optimise the choice of cladding at the expense of the economy, adequate resource utilisation and optimal thermal-mechanical and anti-corrosive properties has led to the emergence of new materials, which have taken over the building material market in a few
decades. These include siding, sandwich panels, clinker panels, and thermopanels as forms of relatively new exterior coatings for structures.SidingVinyl siding was first mentioned more than seventy years ago. Siding made from polyvinyl chloride polymer was invented in the US market in the 1950s (CCH, 2020). It is a lightweight and flexible plastic material that found practical use in quickly erected timber frame houses, as shown in Figure 4. Vinyl siding was inexpensive and relatively easy to attach to the exterior wall surfaces of homes: such advantages have caused the siding material to become a traditional cladding material not only in American homes but also in Europe. The use of siding was prevalent in the former Soviet Union and Eastern Europe due to the material’s low cost (Reportbuyer, 2017). The use of plastic technology, which flourished in the second half of the last century, has influenced the variety of commercial siding materials: has the supply of different designs of siding sheets increased and the technology used. Sheet profiles, as depicted in Figure 4, were given secure fasteners that eliminated the need for the builder to use large quantities of screws and or adhesive, as the siding plates were bonded together. This solution improved the visual characteristics of the siding and saved on construction consumables.Figure 4. Image of vinyl siding sheet profile (left) and exterior building cladding (right) (PPW, 2021).Excessive amounts of plasticisers were added to the plastics to strengthen their properties. This has solved the photodegradation of the cladding material by solar ultraviolet light (Alahapperuma and Samarasekara,
2019). Studies show improvements in mechanical properties, be it bending strength and density of the material, when shungite is added (Kopylov et al., 2021). Similar techniques include modifying iron additives instead of classic antimony oxide (Howell et al., 2020). No matter how much siding technology is upgraded, plastic remains a short-lived and ineffective cladding material. Over time, siding tends to fray and crack when exposed to warm climates (Tsongas, 2017). In addition, PVC is not flame retardant, so the choice of this material cannot be justified by economic considerations for long-lasting, sustainable construction.Sandwich panelsComplex sandwich panels based on a combination of layer technology have emerged. It is reasonable to view the panels as a natural evolution of PVC cladding. Composite panels made a revolutionary leap for all exterior construction: the material was lightweight, comfortable, and durable and perfectly suited to decorative and functional cladding (de Sousa et al., 2021). Modern sandwiches consist of three layers, including boundary stiffening materials and a layer of sealant between them, as shown in Figure 5. Like PVC, sandwich panels are used in fast construction, which means that the mechanical characteristics of such material are not designed for durability. Thus, the additional structure of new storeys can overload the sandwich panels, causing them to warp and crack (Skrifvars et al., 2019). In addition, such panels are vulnerable to temperature fluctuations: due to the condensation of fog and dew on the inner layers of the panels, premature rotting occurs (Vidmar, 2020). In addition, such panels are often finished with formaldehyde resins to
cover gaps and strengthen the material. Still, this fact significantly degrades the environmental properties of sandwich panels (Barbu et al., 2020). As a general conclusion, such materials are not a good choice for sustainable construction.Figure 5. Profile of a sandwich panel showing its structure from the side (O’Hegarty, 2021).ClinkerIt comes as no surprise that cladding materials with a more extended history tend to be more eco-friendly. In general terms, clinker should be understood as the product of high-temperature firing of natural clay mixed with slags, small stones, and limestone (Khomenko and Purdik, 2017). The resulting mixture is finely ground to form refractory layers used in exterior finishing works (Figure 6). However, recent studies show ample evidence to support the severe respiratory hazards of ground clinker, including the threat of cancer (Di Ciaula, 2021; Spasiano and Pirozzi, 2017). Sintered clinker used as facade scenery has no such harm. At the same time, the operating guidelines for clinker mixtures prohibit the flushing of powder into sewage systems and water bodies, as this leads to clogging of tanks and the formation of cement plugs (Portland Cement Clinker, 2015). This leads to the conclusion that clinker itself is a more environmentally friendly and cost-effective material than vinyl plastics but that its use is not entirely safe either.Figure 6. Photo of clinker slabs as cladding material (Ströher, 2021).ThermopanelsOne of Europe’s most popular cladding materials are thermopanels, which are typically thermally insulated polyurethane foams. Thermopanels are often called hygienic insulation of facades due to their functional purpose: such materials are very light
in use and can be used not only for external but also for internal walls of a building (Burlachenko et al., 2021). Compared to the previously discussed forms, thermopanel is an excellent combined material, combining the flexibility and ease of use of vinyl siding sheets, the thermal insulation properties of sandwich panels and the strength of clinkers. Often these panels are made to resemble brick tiles, allowing the imitation of an expensive façade at a comparatively lower cost, as shown in Figure 7. The use of insulating panels for both new and refurbished buildings ensures a significant reduction in heat loss (Greenspec, 2020). Ultimately, it is the most cost-effective material, although its sustainability is still unexplored.Figure 7. Image of one block of thermal insulation panel (Greenspec, 2020).Wood claddingFrom the name, green building strives to use as many plant forms as possible in exteriors. For this reason, one of the most popular materials supporting eco-sustainability is wood. Wood cladding materials are renewable resources, mostly not requiring artificial synthetic additives in production (Almusaed, 2021). In addition, there is evidence of the low carbon footprint of such material: wood can absorb as much carbon dioxide as it releases oxygen, making it relatively neutral in terms of carbon dioxide pollution (Godinho, 2018; Almusaed, 2021). In addition, even felled wood is durable and does not rot if adequately maintained without plastic additives. At the same time, wood is relatively easy to stain and sand (Figure 11), so a façade made of this material can meet individual home design requirements.Figure 11. Wood
panelling as a form of wood cladding (Adam, 2020).Other forms of eco-friendly claddingWood cladding is not the only form of environmentally friendly cladding, however. Building activists worldwide are trying to solve the problem of a completely neutral product that can be used as a façade material. Often such answers take construction back to the stages of primitive settlements when the house was protected by natural waste. For example, one such option is cob, made from clay, sand, straw and soil mixed with water: Figure 12. Cob is a legacy from prehistoric times, as the active use of readily available natural materials is a feature of pre-industrial civilisations. At the same time, cob meets the critical needs of a modern façade material. For example, this mixture is easy to handle and take the desired shape, is fire-resistant and retains heat indoors (Spinell et al., 2020). In addition, the hardening structure of the material makes it possible to give it any design. Although the environmental safety of this cladding material is not in doubt, the cob is quite easily damaged in the event of earthquakes.Figure 12. Photo of a house finished with cob (Dizhur, 2017).Critical material is recycled steel, which is used to make metal siding: Figure 13. It is worth saying that steel is one of the most recycled materials in the world (Nechifor et al., 2020). Although this material is safe and generally resistant to fire, steel is prone to corrosion and is difficult to manipulate in the manufacturing process. In general, there are also entirely
radical methods that cannot find a mass producer at this stage. These include sheep’s wool, cork, straw, and bamboo (Barbulianno, 2020). Ultimately, the trend towards the maximum use of recycled materials and plants is evident.Figure 13. Example of recycled steel façade design (Bates, 2019).General outcomesIn general, the apparent trend towards greater environmental awareness, not only among the public but also among the academic community, should be highlighted. More and more people are willing to invest in eco-friendly materials, with their use shown to be accompanied by good visual and performance characteristics. However, the green building philosophy opposes traditional plastic and other synthetic building materials, polluting the environment and posing a risk to humans. However, an important conclusion to be drawn from this literature review is the lack of a formalised view of the most environmentally friendly and beneficial material to use. Consideration of this issue is central to the following sections.MethodologyThe methodological basis for this project is based on the concept of qualitative secondary research, using available data for comparative analysis. To determine the optimal type of cladding material, thematic sources presenting full or partial information on environmental and economic benefits have been studied. Academic searches were carried out using digital databases, including Google Scholar, Microsoft Academic, Research Gate and Pubmed. In addition, a standard Google search algorithm was used to identify alternative views and public opinion. The choice of a secondary research mechanism was fully justified by the low relevance of the other options to the present research work. Interviews and quantitative physical experiments were
not feasible due to insufficient and limited resources available, whereas academic search fully met all requirements.Articles, government data and websites were searched using primary filtering mechanisms that included criteria of English spelling, temporal relevance, and author and publication authority. Searches were carried out through textual and content analysis, including the use of thematic keywords. Thus, the total number of sources used was 53, of which 63% should be classified as academic literature. This fact confirms the chosen methodological framework’s reliability and supports the present study’s scientific relevance.Adherence to high ethical standards is also a necessary part of the selection methodology. Only those sources that have been placed in the public domain. In other words, there was no fraud or illegal use of educational spectrum material. At the same time, the current work does not conflict with other studies but actively complements them through comparative analysis.ResultsResults and analysisSince the main interest of this project was to determine the optimal cladding for façade construction in the UK context, this section highlights the finding from a technical and ecological as well as economic point of view.

alternative. The most durable material is clinker, but it has poor heat retentive qualities and is costly. Wood and cladding thermal systems enjoy greater air combustibility, important for creating a comfortable microclimate in the house, as well as good heat retention properties. Considering harmful emission into the atmosphere, only sandwich panels emit formaldehyde, while other materials are eco-friendly. Summing up all the data, the following may be said about cladding materials considered in this work.  * Vinyl siding, that has remained a popular cladding material over decades, in terms of cost-effectiveness, is a cheap building material. Moreover, it is ecologically friendly, since when vinyl is recycled, chlorine gas is not released into the atmosphere; vinyl can be safely incinerated and its energy reused. Its is ecologically inert and its molecules do not interact with chemicals or other substances; vinyl panels are light and easy to install. However, they are not waterproof and can bend or deform under pressure or in fire. Vinyl has an average durability, doesn’t let air in the house due to which inhabitants have to open windows to let air in. It is not suitable for creating comfortable microclimate in the house, that is why this cladding material is not used in large-scale building.  * Sandwich panels are inexpensive alternative to vinyl siding. Technical properties of sandwich panels outdo technical characteristics of vinyl siding in terms of strength, durability, thermal insulation properties and water resistance. Like vinyl siding, sandwich panels are light and easy to install; however, they are not eco-friendly.
The process of production of sandwich panels includes pressing wood-based materials at temperatures from 160°C to 175°C. When wood-based materials are heated, they emit free formaldehyde. The emissions of formaldehyde take place not only when sandwich panels are processed but also after their installation in the houses, since it is the continuous chemical process. Formaldehyde vapors are toxic; they strongly affect the central nervous system, especially the visual organs and the retina of the eyes.  * Clinker is an environmentally friendly ceramic cladding material; its reliability and durability are very high and its strength equals that of a stone. However, click is rather costly; the use of clink significantly raises building costs, that is why clink is rarely used for large-scale building. Clinker is sometimes used for decoration of buildings, but as a cladding material loses to all other alternatives in price. Moreover, clicker enjoys poor heat retentive properties, and clinker-cladded houses are cold in autumn and winter without proper heating.  * Thermopanels are modern materials that have high durability, strength, and are water resistant and flame retardant. In terms of ecological safety, thermopanels are eco-friendly, since they are inert and can not cause any allergic reactions. While prosessing thermopanels no harmful emissions are made into the air. However, thermopanels are not cheap that is why they would not be considered for economical building.In general, it has been found that wood is the best material for environmentally friendly and most profitable cladding. The following facts provide sufficient evidence for this choice.Firstly, it has been
shown that the choice of wood fully responds to the trend of environmentally conscious communities towards natural materials. Unlike plastic and synthetic raw materials, wood is a product of natural origin and, what is essential, is renewable. From this comes a second reason: there are at least 60,000 different biological species of trees, most of which are highly durable and relatively easy to manipulate (Cottam, 2018). This makes it possible to use wood in a variety of design configurations and to give it the desired shape, as illustrated in Figure 14. This includes the overall styling of the wood facade and the choice of material colour, density, and thickness. These variations lead to a third significant result: wood cladding has uniqueness because it is impossible to recreate the unique structure of a sawn wood fibre.Figure 14. Thermowood, Siberian Larch and Western Red Cedar (Duffield Timber, 2021).Remarkably, the technical properties of wood cladding also make it profitable to use. Dense timber has high sound insulation properties, allowing to keep sounds inside the home. High insulation is also characteristic of heat, as wood has excellent insulating properties. This is especially true in winter in the UK, where temperatures are known to approach zero Celsius (Jaganmohan, 2021). Figure 15 shows perfectly that the inner layers of the double-layered timber façade consistently retain higher temperatures despite the lowering of the ambient air temperature. In addition, the additional modification of the wood façade with Cross-laminated timber reduces the heat loss of -1.14% compared to traditional wood cladding and -5.07% (Pelaz et
al., 2017). This confirms the tendency of wood to breathe actively and meets the required thermal performance.Figure 15. A chronogram of temperature changes of different layers of wood cladding during wintertime (Valachova, 2021, p. 11).The ecological characteristics of the wood cladding found in the study also confirm the expectation of high eco-security. In addition to being a renewable source, the use of wood in façade construction allows the accumulation of excess carbon dioxide already at the plant’s growth stage and preserves it in a bound state when used as building materials (Godinho, 2018; Almusaed, 2021). The use of wood also requires minimal transport costs, as the resource grows almost everywhere. In addition, wood is relatively easy to recycle and leaves virtually no negative impact on the environment: Figure 16. Consequently, this material can be used as a valuable biofuel at the end of its useful life.Figure 16. Environmental effects of recycling wood (Almusaed, 2021)The economic performance of timber cladding has also been of interest. The use of hardwood as a building material has been shown to increase the cost of construction by an average of up to £40 per square metre (Tradesmen, 2020). If the housebuilder decides to use untreated softwood, the cost is reduced to £8, although additional spending in treatment, be it painting and polishing, is required (Build It, 2018). This is generally well within the average cost of cladding a building from £20 per square metre across the UK (MyJobQuote, 2020). Consequently, there are significant economic benefits to using wood cladding.DiscussionThe results obtained
allow classifying wood as an eco-friendly and profitable building material for cladding work. Wood has been shown to have excellent environmental properties and is comparably easy to use, and its purchase will not put much financial pressure on the homeowner, especially with other materials. Wood is much healthier and more efficient than plastic options and is not corroded like expensive metal cladding (Dahlstrom Roll Form, 2018). At the same time, wood materials create a favourable climate inside the house and a favourable neighbourhood due to their natural feel. Sound insulation is of distinctive importance for the choice of this material, as in densely built-up areas, the internal noise of one house can disturb neighbours.As it is a natural material, it is easily affected by climatic fluctuations. On the one hand, the high humidity characteristic of the UK leads to changes in the mechanical properties of the wood (Humar et al., 2020). On the other hand, increasing average annual temperatures hurt the material’s durability (Godinho, 2018). In addition, wood burns very well, which makes it poorly efficient in terms of fire resistance. At the same time, the naturalness of the building product leads to threats of biological hazards, namely infestation of wood cladding with fungi and insects (Vacenovská, 2020). However, the solution to these problems is obvious: it is sufficient to use hydrophobisers and flame retardants, including caffeine, which prevents the material from being affected by the threats (Šimůnková et al., 2021). Nowadays, the market offers sufficient environmentally friendly variants of liquid treatments which allow preserving the
availability of wood. In the Gulf countries, for example, this cladding material can be costly. On the other hand, the study did not empirically observe the properties of specific claddings and used ready-made primary data. This may have affected the overall unbiased nature of the study and reduced its novelty. In addition, no general methodological system of scales for comparing different cladding was developed, and their comparative analysis was weakly qualitative.Future workIn developing this topic, it is recommended that some new goals be achieved, allowing for impressive results in the future. A cohort study of different woods is proposed to identify the type of material that would have the best characteristics. It is also recommended to extend the study area to the European zone to assess the scalability of current results in new markets. In addition, a more in-depth study of wood’s environmental and technical properties would be helpful, using statistical processing methods.
Causes and ConsequencesEmployees of the company are under constant control of the management, are discriminated against, and are at risk of being dismissed for unknown reasons. The article claims that Amazon increases the efficiency of its sales due to total control over employees. At the same time, employees are often dismissed if they do not achieve goals that the management keeps secret (Blackwell, 2020). For example, among the methods for evaluating the efficiency of warehouse employees is the indicator of the number of processed packages per hour. However, the company’s management does not tell the employees what indicators must be achieved. Often employees find out about this only after receiving warnings about improper work. If an employee does not reach the secret indicators, he receives a message about his dismissal.Amazon also installs surveillance cameras at workplaces. According to the company, this is done to reduce the number of thefts. The researchers claim that the extensive network of cameras also allows the company’s management to track every step of an employee. The articles say that when entering the warehouse, Amazon requires employees to dispose of all their personal belongings, except for a bottle of water and a transparent plastic bag with cash. The location of Amazon drivers is constantly recorded and monitored. They are required to follow the exact route that is laid out on the map. Drivers must deliver 999 packages out of every thousand on time (Blackwell, 2020). This rule has led to widespread speeding and the associated increase in the number of accidents.The article
says that Amazon employees are under constant stress, processing hundreds of orders per hour. This leads to constant panic at work. In this sense, Amazon treats workers dehumanizingly, like robots: they are persistently asked to complete task after task with relentless speed (Palmer, 2021). At the end of the day, warehouse employees are required to pass a mandatory inspection — they are checked for the possibility of theft (Palmer, 2021). Waiting for an inspection lasts from 25 minutes to an hour, and this time is not compensated in any way. According to the authors, Amazon does not consider work injuries to the extent that Amazon employees feel forced to work because of the pain and injuries they receive at work. Company regularly fires workers who fall behind their quotas without taking into account such injuries, researchers say. In some cases, the number of severe injuries in Amazon warehouses is more than five times higher than the industry average.According to employees, unions could fight with difficult working conditions at Amazon, but the company does not allow them to occur. The employees’ words were confirmed when Amazon published the vacancies of an analyst and a senior analyst. The job descriptions said that candidates would join Amazon’s Global Intelligence Program to collect information, among other things, about threats to the organization of labor against the company. In the vacancy, trade unions are listed along with hostile groups, terrorists, and activist groups. The vacancy mentions that the collected data can be used in court to ban activist groups. After the
content of the vacancies was condemned in social networks, Amazon deleted them, noting that mistakes were made in it.Improvement of The Psychological StateOrganizational Programmes of Stress ManagementA positive socio-psychological atmosphere boosts employee productivity, enhances well-being and happiness, and encourages all types of activity. The development of an SPC in the team is a critical management approach that must be completed while taking into consideration the surrounding circumstances. On the other hand, the socio-psychological climate refers to a stable moral environment or the team’s general emotional condition, as evidenced by employee connections and attitudes toward the common good (Brooks et al., 2019). First and foremost, it is critical to building both vertical and horizontal inter-group and interpersonal relationships in order to create a good socio-psychological environment in the team. A manager at any level must maintain vertical and horizontal relationships while maintaining feedback with all management relationships.The promotion of integrating goals between the enterprise’s upper management and the employees is required to create a positive atmosphere. The ability of management to continuously assess and change the style, means, forms, and techniques of team management, taking into account changing situations, is a necessary requirement for the development of a pleasant environment (Wang et al., 2020). It also involves the capacity to maintain a balance of rights and obligations among employees while performing job duties and the ability to operate in informal settings. Employees’ psychological condition is defined by their level of contentment with their current position. However, not only is the psychological environment important, but so is the
kind of employment, its reputation and substance, compensation, career possibilities, and the availability of alternative interesting opportunities (Cam, 2020). The following factors are distinguished from the others in the formation of the team’s socio-psychological environment:  * Each employee’s professional and personal talents are in accordance with the structure and substance of their work. This ensures a normal workday and the absence of resentment over coworkers’ achievements.  * The highest possible alignment of ethical and moral attitudes and motivations for action is required for mutual trust and understanding among coworkers. Each employee’s capabilities can complement each other and be unified in a single creative and labor process.  * Rational and fair distribution of functions among team members.Their socio-psychological compatibility primarily determines employee happiness with their role in the team. It is based on the team members’ psychological similarities as well as the moral and professional characteristics that they share (Rasool et al., 2020). Individuals need to realize that the socio-psychological environment of a team is directly impacted not only by leadership tactics, discipline, and compatibility of people but also by their level of engagement in team management. The following activities must be completed in order to investigate the labor collective’s socio-psychological environment:  * determine the emotional attitude of team members to their occupation in general;  * to identify the nature of the relationship between employees in the team;  * to clarify the nature of the relations between managers and subordinates; to find out the degree of satisfaction of employees with the
service and living conditions of the organization of work;  * to determine how satisfied employees are with the material incentives to encourage work.The following principles should be followed when organizing meetings. The discussion is held in a democratic atmosphere. Feedback is required; once each employee has been acknowledged, all coworkers present are interviewed. The manager keeps an eye on the situation and, if there are any problems, changes the subject or attempts to diffuse the situation. Everyone can view all of the suggestions and opinions that come in. They could be placed on the walls or stated at meetings if the interaction was only with a few people rather than the full team. It is most practical to have conversations in small groups since this allows everyone to hear what colleagues want to discuss (Walia, 2018). It is difficult to assess the situation and establish the variables that contribute to creating a socio-psychological environment in a group of more than ten people who have opposing opinions.Organizational Programmes of WellbeingEmployees should attend lectures and seminars on topics such as the fundamentals of socio-psychological interactions, methods of individual self-realization, professional ethics, and business etiquette on a regular basis to help manage the psychological environment. Communication games are often used to manage interpersonal interactions. As an analog of sociometry, they promote in the establishment of team partnerships. Managers can, for example, ask employees to draw a circle around each participant based on their level of impact on the team throughout the session. After that, red and blue lines
separate working groups into multiple teams and subgroups responsible for operating in different areas and regions.Medical equipment is utilized for the diagnosis and therapy and treatment of patients after a disease or accident; it can be used alone or in conjunction with various consumables. Healthcare equipment and supplies are essential for patients’ needs, and the inability to obtain the necessary medicament can seriously threaten life. Consequently, in terms of maintaining a high level of treatment quality, it is obligatory to establish an efficient and effective medical equipment delivery and shipping system, elaborating a supply chain. At the commencement of the global pandemic, pharmaceutical products and equipment were desperately required in developing countries, and numerous offerings were acquired that needed to be packed for transportation. With regard to my contribution, it can be stated that I suggested the concept of splitting into smaller teams and subgroups, each focusing on a separate area. This enabled the group to segregate two full deliveries of donated medical supplies in two to three days instead of two to three. Thus, it was possible to send the healthcare equipment and medicaments successfully.In conclusion, patients’ needs for healthcare equipment and supplies are critical, and the failure to receive the appropriate medication might be life-threatening. In terms of my contribution, I proposed separating into smaller teams and subgroups, each concentrating on a different aspect of the project. This allowed the group to segregate and classify two complete deliveries of donated medical goods in two to three days rather than two to three.
decolonization process. After what they had seen after WWII, colonies were not ready to be colonized again. After the war, colonies that had aided their colonial rulers were awarded independence. Examples of countries that regained independence include the Philippines from the United States of America in 1946, India from the United Kingdom in 1947, Ceylon and Burma in 1948, and others.Prior to WWII, Japan has had an ambition of expanding its influence over other states. The invasion of Manchuria in 1931 marked the start of Japan’s East Asian expansion, which proceeded in 1937 with a deadly campaign on China. Japan joined the military alliance known as the “Axis” when it signed the Tripartite Pact with Germany and Italy. The United States imposed economic sanctions on Japan in order to deter Japanese aggression and force the evacuation of Japanese soldiers from Manchuria and China. Faced with serious shortages of oil and other natural resources and motivated by a desire to dethrone the United States as the Pacific’s dominating power, Japan planned to assault the United States and British forces in Asia and take Southeast Asia’s resources. The modernity of the Japanese post-WWII indeed began in the 19th century. During this time, the Asian states have accepted the culture of the West, which allowed them to integrate into the global society and develop relationships, including economic partnerships with other nations outside Asia.
As was mentioned earlier, both pictures reflect a similar theme. Even though these two works were created in different periods, they convey the same meaning claiming that only personal struggle can create hope in people’s hearts. Both paintings have similarities and differences based on the symbolic elements depicted by the authors. The outstanding symbolic component of the Girl with the Pearl Earring painting is the earring. Considering the general girl’s appearance, the earring attracts attention. As was mentioned earlier, this symbol was created to express the illusionary nature of hope (Berg et al., 2019). It was created only through the existence of dark colors in the background. Thus, this encouraging symbol shows that the hop cannot be born without darkness and despair.Christina’s World also has a peculiar symbol expressing the creator’s idea. However, this symbol is used to show despair. The black belt on the woman’s dress shows the paralyzed part of her body (Benson, 2020). Unlike the first work’s symbol, the belt expresses the negative background of the story. The meaning of hope is conveyed by depicting a woman’s house and her pose deliberately striving to the light. Thus, the pictures are similar in using symbolism to reflect the necessity of striving for hope. However, the number of symbols and their distributions are different.Considering the medium that could have empowered both pictures’ creation, Shakespeare’s Romeo and Juliet should be mentioned. The themes of hope and despair are inherent elements of this tragedy. Some researchers believe that Girl with the Pearl Earring was created based on
Shakespeare’s story (Berg et al., 2019). The woman turns back to her love, which is considered to be the person viewing the picture. Some analytics consider Christina’s World story similar to Shakespeare’s tragedy (Benson, 2020). Christina is separated from her loved ones by cruel fate, and only through striving for hope can she return to her family. Therefore, based on the conducted analysis, the thesis can be formulated as follows: researched paintings reflect the theme of the hope which people create themselves in the ultimate despair surrounding them.The identified theme can impact representatives of some professional directions. The activities of social workers are directly affected by the mentioned topic. Their prior aim is to help others morally and mentally, thereby increasing the quality of others’ lives. Thus, they should be mentally stable and always create hope for themselves and the people they want to help. Teachers also can be affected by this topic because they are connected to raising the future generation. Their work is extremely important for the whole society. Being unable to create hope and strive for the better in the world’s cruelty will affect the children and make them mentally weak. Teachers should teach young people never to lose hope in their lives.As far as the discussed theme is existential, the audience for the presentation may be pretty vast. People who want to learn more about art and humanities and those who want to share their emotional struggles with others may be interested in the presentation. Moreover, the theme can also be beneficial
Yelling, once associated with toughness, strength, and power, is now seen as imposing and aggressive, a negative side consequence of arrogance and unearthed advantage. With the widespread public reaction towards the online clip of Republican Majority Leader Jake Corman yelling at his Democratic opponent Kate Muth, the precarious position of yelling in modern American consciousness became apparent. Screaming is currently associated with toxic masculinity and anger issues that frequently stem from it. People who lose control and start yelling are met with a mixture of surprise and humiliation. It’s not an appropriate course of action for anyone who wishes to achieve public respect and be taken seriously.A large part of this movement is undoubtedly due to a wider trend away from conduct that promotes abusive and blatantly patriarchal structures. While there is no proof that men yell more than women, a man yelling is nearly always a more physically and psychologically dangerous experience. Another element of the transition seems reasonable to attribute to a shift in generational temperament, assisted, maybe, by the rise of internet culture (Petrusich, 2019). Today, there’s less need for someone to raise his voice when it’s quite easy to be cruel, abusive, and disruptive trough other communication channels.Personally, I find the evolution of the understanding of yelling rather fascinating. Social connotations of behaviors are not fixed, but rather evolve with time, depending on the state of society itself. As the general public becomes progressively more and more respectful towards one another, at least hypothetically, it is natural for screaming to become somewhat obsolete. I only hope, that respectable people are allowed to deal with the emotions conveyed previously trough yelling in healthy ways, rather then forced to suppress them for as long as possible.
IntroductionWhile every age is said to have had its own impact on society, the 1960s are immortalized in the memories of many, even though they were not yet alive then. A decade filled with love-loving hippies, The Beatles are conquering the hearts of Americans from across the Atlantic and the roaring popularity of the civil rights movement. With activism on the rise and the atmosphere of hope and change in the air, it is easy to disregard the negative parts of the 60s, which were all too real. The Vietnam War, the inner-city riots, and assassinations played an important role in shaping the decade and becoming a turning point in American politics and society. In 1968, the US entered the Sixth Party System, with the murder of Martin Luther King Jr. 1968 becoming a turning point in American politics and society.BackgroundAmerican Politics Pre-1960sOver the years of existence in the modern United States, there have been numerous iterations of the party systems and political structures in the attempts to address the differences between Democrats and Conservatives. The previous party system, the Fifth, was established in 1932 under Franklin D. Roosevelt. Under such a structure, the opposing factions, New Deal Coalition and Conservative Coalition consisted of the members of each of the original parties, namely Democrats and Conservatives. However, the intra-party ideological groups did not prevail for long, and after the events of the 1960s, including the Civil Rights movement and Cold War, the decade gave birth to the Sixth Party System. As a result, Republicans and conservative
ideals became more prominent in the US political scene, gaining dominance over the Democrats for decades to come.Key Events of the 1960sAs mentioned, the 60s are famous for their tremendous effect on the events of the time and the decades to come. The key events leading up to the 1968 political changes in the party system included both national and international affairs. The decade was packed with the Cold War and the Vietnam War, the Civil Rights movement, the assassination of Martin Luther King Jr. and John F. Kennedy, the Cuban Missile Crisis, and the landing on the moon. While these events might seem disconnected from each other, together, they brought together the societal and political change that allowed the decrease in government intervention in the economy and laissez-faire capitalism. Furthermore, the rise of Christianity in the US facilitates the mass appeal of conservative ideals. Americans were no longer content with compromising their ideals, combining the opposing views, which led to the separation of conservatism from the democratic ideology and the creation of two distinct parties.The events of the 1960s showed American society the need for the limitation of governmental power in the decisions that are made on behalf of the citizens. Millions protested military action and the complacency of the American people, such as can be seen in the Port Huron Statement by the Students for a Democratic Society, 1962 (“The American Yawp Reader,” 2022). This bold statement proposed by young activists emphasizes the need for action to be taken to rescue American society from
The Description of the Business IdeaMy business idea is a clothing boutique, Trophy Curves, for plus-size women. Nowadays, appearance plays a vital role, and many women face problems concerning their body image. The clothes that do not fit can cause not only short-term disappointment but also damage self-esteem and influence self-love for an extended period. Thus, it is extremely important to support women and demonstrate their beauty with the help of the right high-quality clothes at affordable prices. My boutique is about people and people who want to stop worrying about their everyday selection of the look of the day. The clothes give the opportunity not to apply much thought to the issue of choice between comfort and beauty because it combines both features. I have a user-friendly Internet site with three to six days of US delivery that can satisfy even the most demanding customers.It is possible to find every piece of clothing there: from evening dresses to swimsuits. Hence, it relieves plus-size women from clothing-related problems in any season and presents a unique chance to enjoy life no matter their size! The most significant competitive advantage is the affordable price of the items. As the plus-size industry has undergone rapid development only recently, most players offer such items at the prices of the luxury or semi-lux clothing segments. Therefore, many ordinary women cannot afford to buy the clothes explicitly designed for them and are forced to go shopping in mass-market boutiques. The main message of my business is to demonstrate that every woman deserves
to wear beautiful clothes to highlight all the advantages and hide the flaws. To serve this mission, the new collection prices in my boutique are in the range of 20-30 dollars, and the items on sale cost even less.The Problem to Be SolvedThe lack of a wide selection of clothing for plus-size women due to the recentness of the social transformation in terms of tolerance of people of different shapes, sizes, etc. There are not many existing specialized boutiques, which to puts the target audience at a disadvantage because of the supply shortages.Competitive Advantage & Value PropositionThe high quality, complemented by the reasonable prices, is my competitive advantage, as other stores of plus-size clothing offer items of identical quality for much higher prices. Moreover, the range of fashionable items offered in my boutique is more comprehensive: from everyday looks to special occasions. Value proposition – serving the uniqueness of every woman disregarding the size.The Rationale of the Business ExistenceTo enrich the clothing industry of clothes in general and ensure the accessibility of a wide selection of fashionable items for plus-size women specifically.The Activity of the BusinessTo bridge the gap between women of different sizes and put them in the same position in terms of such an essential issue as the choice of clothes to wear every day. It implies equal quality, prices, and correspondence to current trends in mass-market and semi-lux women’s clothing stores. My long-term interest in fashion, complemented by my adherence to the body-positive movement, led to the development of the idea of a
plus-size clothing boutique, which unites all women in their fashion fervor.The Location of the BusinessWith special attention to the COVID-19 pandemic, it seems reasonable for start-ups to be based in the virtual environment, especially at the beginning.The Date of the StartAs spring approaches, the demand for clothing tends to increase – thus, now is the ideal time to launch my business.Interest in the businessI am interested in fashion, and during the last fashion weeks, I noticed the increasing trend for clothes targeted not only at ‘ideal’ models but at different women. I am a good fit for this venture as I have experience designing clothes, including plus-size clothing. My university study’s theoretical and practical foundation gives me the entrepreneurial skills and knowledge necessary for the business launch. Moreover, several people in my circle have examples of successful businesses and can share their experiences to help me avoid severe mistakes.The Target Market and Niche MarketMy target market is plus-size women in the USA. It is indeed a niche market as it covers a small market segment, so I am focusing only on the individually constructed clothes of 1x, 2x, or 3x sizes for females.The Marketing StrategyThe marketing strategy includes the intensive engagement of social networks, especially Instagram, as it seems to be the primary promotional platform nowadays due to the constantly increasing number of users and influencers. Furthermore, as the body-positive and tolerance are trending, the demand for specialized clothing is even higher. I am considering the seasonal sales and promo codes for the first shopping as
boutique is online, I spare the rent, etc. I have no employees, and there is no cost for a sales tax permit in Florida. The design and launch of the website and marketing are also on me. Therefore, the total costs of my start-up for the first line (100 items) of clothing are approximately 10$ per unit for manufacturing and 7$ per unit for materials on average, in sum 1700$.How Much It Will Cost a Customer for the ProductsThe price of items varies from 25$ to 45$ (without sales), plus shipping (if needed) – 9$.How Much It Will Cost an Investor to Become a PartnerIt will cost 500$ to become a partner (at the beginning, after establishing the process and an accurate understanding of the turnover, the rate is likely to rise). Thus, a bigger share of the business will remain mine as a founder of the start-up.The Biggest StrengthJust try it out, and you’ll see the difference! The new look in the plus-size industry is not as on the mass-market items of bigger size but as on individually designed trendy clothes that are on equal terms with the usual ones. Such a perspective allows women to enjoy their lives in every size and shape as there is no more difference in quality and price.
develops economically through services, software design, and precision engineering.A multinational corporation (MNC) is a company, with more than 25% of revenues which come from operations in countries other than the home country of the parent organization (Samson et al., 2020). MNCs are characterized by close cooperation among affiliates in different countries and a single management authority making key decisions for the parent company and all affiliates (Samson et al., 2020). Additionally, MNC managers have a global perspective, viewing the whole world as one market.Outsourcing refers to participating in a global division of labor that enables companies to complete certain activities in locations with the cheapest raw materials and labor (Samson et al., 2020). Exporting is an entry strategy in which the company’s production facilities remain in the home country, while produced goods are transferred to other countries for sale. Licensing is an entry strategy in which the company in one country gives firms in other countries access to specific resources, such as technology or trademark rights, to produce and sell its products abroad (Samson et al., 2020). Direct investing is an entry strategy where the company manages its production facilities in another country.
the vaccination. In that way, the vaccine should be tested, and all test results should be available for check by each citizen. In my opinion, it would be even better if they could see all the processes of vaccine preparation. I personally would be much more confident in the decision to receive a vaccine, despite I think that vaccination is beneficial in any case.Thus, by myself, I am a supporter of the case about vaccine mandates. Still, when we are talking about nationwide vaccination, it is essential to remember that people are often fear to vaccinate: I think, in most cases, they fear to damage themselves. If they will not fear that, they will be much more inclined to vaccination, as everyone wants to be healthy. To conclude, I think that while mandatory vaccination is a radical measure, it is necessary to overcome the pandemic; still, the government should ensure that the vaccination process is transparent and safe for all citizens.

Therefore, I seek to allocate my resources in a way that would allow for the maximally appropriate integration of all of those, which presupposes activity in several spheres in parallel. The latter nuance, in turn, adds to the significance of the role social norms play in my life since the amount as well as a variety of my social contacts increases inevitably.Thus, during a walk, social norms involve neatness, and proper behavior that does not cause any inconvenience for the surrounding people and other. Furthermore, helping friends is actually possible to see as a norm; those who refuse
to do that are considered deviant automatically, regardless of the reason. While shopping, the essential norm-based requirement is to wait in line without trying to avoid that, for instance, by force; regarding online communication, no forms of hate speech and no fakes are socially acceptable. Even domestic life rests partly on social norms, such as cleanness and fresh breath, which hygiene procedures like brushing the teeth target.Macro-Level and Micro-Level AnalysisIt is quite apparent that norms influence both the lives of particular individuals and the performance of the entire society, as the latter actually consists of the former. A norm exists in case the community members practice certain behavior, believing that others do that as well or expecting a compliment from those whose opinion is important to them (UNICEF, 2021). Therefore, at the macro level, social norms make the vast majority of the population act similarly in specific situations and contexts. Hence, unwritten but commonly known and strongly prescribed patterns appear that eventually become integral to the culture. The micro level, meanwhile, stands for the need of a certain individual to adjust his or her everyday behavior to those recommendations so that society recognizes him or her as normal.Concept AnalysisAs the day the field log describes is quite busy, various concepts are applicable to it. One of the main among them is socialization , which is important for both individuals and society, particularly in the context of norms. Thus, Ward et al. (2019) highlight that communication not only simplifies transmitting the rules and principles of a certain
community to the next generations but also enables people to put themselves into perspective. In other words, a person acquires a chance to see how the other perceives him or her; this, in turn, determines the areas where corrections are necessary if such exist.The concept of family , whose essential role is apparent from the log, comprises two subconcepts in the given case, notably, nuclear and extended . The former is worth mentioning among the key determinants of the routine due to the need to coordinate all of the everyday actions with the partner’s lifestyle, day regimen, and demands. The extended family, meanwhile, connects the micro group, whose nuclear equivalent is, to the society, an essential agent of socialization. It is noteworthy that families may have inner traditions, such as usual communication styles; however, those should not prevail over social norms in extrafamilial contexts. If they do, the probability that society will accept the person depends inversely on the degree of the contradiction.Interactions and impression management are also essential points, which, in fact, are closely intertwined since public opinion on an individual determines his or her social success. In sociological terms, this fact makes people develop so-called images that reflect the ways they would like others to see them (Grebelsky‐Lichtman et al., 2020). Simply stated, the need to interact with society makes its members highlight their strengths and camouflage their weaknesses to reach a higher degree of acceptance. In my case, I monitor the stylishness of my clothes and do not inform my extended family on
be self-sufficient, which can be quite disappointing and, furthermore, affects my self-esteem.Outside the family, my roles change depending on the context, but their common peculiarity, excluding interactions with friends, is that hardly anybody considers me unique, while my relatives do. Notably, I am one of the numerous walkers in the street and the only other buyer for shop staff; even in social networks, I perform identically to millions of other users. The interaction, therefore, occurs differently as well; my motives in such situations are practical rather than attachment-based. This means that the purpose of such communication comes down to completing tasks or resolving issues, unlike family scenes, where I derive pleasure from contacting dear people.Notwithstanding the dissimilar nature of the cases, both can show how the other affects me and I affect them. The former manifests itself in the desire to make a maximally positive impression, which, for instance, encourages me to dress decently prior to leaving my home or disguise my problems and failures from my relatives. Regarding the inverse direction, my needs and opinions of mine, both as a close person and as a customer, may be essential, which may make others consider those when shaping their behavior.
who can be seen, one can see bewilderment, a sense of injustice and lawlessness.Turning to a more in-depth analysis of this photo, I would like to note that this work attracted me by the person’s personality. It is difficult not to recognize Nelson Mandela in this work; therefore, after reading the photo’s description, you begin to remember the circumstances under which this photo was released. Looking at the picture, you can feel the emotions of the central figure; he appears as a person confident in his innocence. This fact is especially emphasized by the visual effect when the main character of the photo seems to be above all the other participants (MacDonald, 1). Separately, it is striking that Mandela confronts people in suits when ordinary people are standing behind him, ready to support him. It is like revealing the theme of the confrontation between the state and ordinary citizens. Nelson Mandela feels like a hero who is confident in himself and his victory overpower. The photo’s author shows that he is on the defendant’s side, emphasizing this with various visual effects.This work gets into the soul well; I want to analyze and visualize the photo, imagine what Mandela is saying at this moment and what people are shouting behind his back, a pleasant feeling. This work is what we call “touched to the depths of the soul”, the photo reflects a landmark historical event and conveys the right atmosphere, thanks to which we experience genuine emotions.
Many concepts have universal definitions but are still too broad because they may have unique and varied meanings to different people. Some may place great importance on money and define it as the most essential value in their life. Other people do not agree with this definition since, for them, money is only one of the ways to achieve a goal. The family also belongs to such concepts – although there are many different dictionary definitions of this social institution, people can still add their meanings to it. The purpose of this paper is to give a general description of the family, list its main characteristics, and relate them to my family.To begin with, the family is one of the most important social agents and the smallest social unit. As noticed by Mondal (n.d.), it can be defined as “an intimate domestic group made up of people related to one another by bonds of blood, sexual mating or legal ties” (para. 1). At the same time, McCarthy (n.d.) says that the family is “people who share goals and values, have long-term commitments to one another and commonly reside in the same dwelling” (para. 2). However, some people consider themselves their own family or can extend this concept and include friends and pets in it. What is more, this group is not necessarily defined by blood relation – many married couples or single persons adopt children and form a real family unit.As mentioned above, there are many characteristics of this social group. For example, family is the most valuable concept in a human’s life that usually plays the primary role in one’s socialization (Mondal, n.d.). Within it, ancestry or descent can be traced, and even large families are typically limited in size. Finally, another characteristic is that sentiments and feelings are the strong basis of this unit. Love, affection, and procreation, as well as responsibilities and duties, form most families.When relating the mentioned characteristics to my own family, I can say that it fits all of them. I have too many relatives, including uncles, aunts, and cousins, and our huge family always tries to spend time together, have fun, and support each other. My brother and I were raised to be loving and affectionate, make ethically right decisions, and share. Our family is based on the most positive feelings and connections, and it is the main concept in our lives.
The business world is ever-changing, and companies must always be flexible to these changes. One of the changes that a business might need to adapt to is an expanding target market. P&G currently sells personal care products to a market that is comprised primarily of women. However, research shows that there is a growing market among male consumers due to the rise of male grooming. P&G should restructure to take advantage of the new market for men’s care products.P&G will need to make several changes to capitalize on the “ignored” market. The restructuring will affect various departments such as research and development, product design, and sales and marketing. Their redesign will affect their employee recruitment and selection practices (Szymczyk, 2016). For instance, currently, most employees that deal with skin and hair care products, cosmetics, and fragrances are female. This is because the target market is mostly women, which means that the products are probably developed, designed, and marketed by women. To attract a new target audience of men, the company will need to hire more male employees (Nadube & Didia, 2018). Male consumers will be more satisfied with male-only personal care products. These products are best developed by people who are male themselves and understand what other men would want. The research and development, product design, and sales and marketing departments must comprise more male employees.The main contextual variable that led to P&G’s restructuring was the changes in the target market as revealed by a study. The study was conducted by Male Grooming Trends: Profiting in
A healthcare manager is a person who organizes the work of a certain number of employees in a market economy based on modern management methods. He or she is a specialist in managing and controlling processes in the health promotion and system. It is necessary to consider many nuances related to employees’ activities in the workplace to master this profession successfully. A professional in this field can properly keep performers under control and motivate them by the manager’s desires and goals. The manager forms communications between people and determines the individual contribution of each employee to the overall result. There are two main bases of influence that encourage the performer to cooperate: personal and organizational (positional). Below is a description of these abilities and the sources of their development by managers in healthcare organizations.The sources of a manager’s power base in the healthcare organizations on a personal side include the following elements and aspects. First of all, a healthcare manager has that method of leadership under a certain level of education, knowledge, experience, skills, and abilities. The performer believes in the influencer’s special knowledge that will allow the subordinate’s needs. This is influence by reasonable faith in the skills of the leader. Secondly, the right of the head to power is conditioned by the measure of recognition of subordinates. There is a desire to influence other people, which is manifested in the desire to strengthen one’s reputation, give persistent advice, and offer help (Gopee & Galloway, 2017). Thirdly, a manager has access to the necessary information
subordinates through reprimands, fines, demotions, dismissals. However, one should remember that such force is exerted through fear, and fear restricts initiative and creativity. Sometimes heads create a shortage of resources when they cannot effectively use other sources of power deliberately (Mason et al., 2020). Thanks to the manager’s connections, they also get the opportunity to influence others.In conclusion, power is an opportunity to influence other people’s behavior and is an addition to the formal powers of heads. It is determined by the position the manager holds in the organization. Such ability ensures stability, order, and timely solution to problems within the structure. Every manager in the healthcare system needs constant development of this quality to achieve the company’s effective functioning. Power permeates the entire life of the enterprise, supporting its structure. Therefore, power is a necessary condition for the successful operation of an enterprise. Without sufficient power to influence people, the manager will not be able to achieve his goals.
The success of Phineas Taylor Barnum can be largely attributed to his ability as a marketing specialist and the sensationalist nature of his products and services. In order to understand how his performance could be implemented in the modern day, it is essential to assess the appeal of such an experience and the primary elements that allowed Barnum to successfully market it as a product to interested customers. From his museum of curiosities to his circus, Barnum would often instigate curiosity within his audience. As such, a modern version of such an experience would require aggressive marketing that is slightly less direct, thereby creating mystery and curiosity within viewers (Foster, 2017). Similarly, Barnum prioritized a number of features within his marketing, including advertising to a large demographic, massive PR stunts, persistent marketing, and providing interesting stories.Assuming this, a modern promotion of Barnum’s enterprises would include unique and continuous advertising through social media platforms. Due to the visual-heavy and experience-oriented elements of his business, video, audio, and image content would also benefit in promoting the experience. Because Barnum believed in reaching a large demographic, it is likely that not only the advertising but the experience itself could be provided digitally. In order to better implement a successful strategy, it can be neenfical to see the ways in which modern circuses or experience-based businesses operate. While many circuses continue to operate with a live audience, certain programs and businesses have found success in implementing live stream features. This would be especially beneficial for Barnum as he prefers to
A crisis is a period or an event which may lead to a dangerous or unstable situation that distresses an individual, a society, or a group. It is an adverse change in environmental or human affairs, especially when happening abruptly, with little or no warning. A crisis may take different forms: being robbed, assaulted, or harassed, facing death or illness, or even losing a job. Sometimes, it can be prompted by inner stressors such as despair with undesirable self-talk. The crisis requires one’s attention; hence seeking assistance helps one address a range of problems they might not have considered. Early intervention can significantly improve one’s ability to cope with what has occurred and its effect on their life. During the COVID-19 pandemic, I was involved in a severe financial crisis that triggered me to seek emergency assistance from several firms and individuals to intervene in my situation.The CrisisThe COVID-19 pandemic was an emergency disaster that caught each person unaware and unprepared. I am one of the individuals who were negatively afflicted by the outbreak in many ways. I worked in a certain company as a cashier, and my life was running smoothly since I had some income to take care of our family. Although I had a frequent income flow from the job, I had not thought of saving or investing some portion of the money. I also used the income to pay my fees since I attended part-time studies in a nearby institution. I had previously never been into any form of a financial crisis;
COVID outbreak was a short-term thing; hence I had little hope of resuming work after a while. Then, the disaster persistent daily with no signs of diminishing, and one day it struck our family. My parents got infected with the disease, and also, I later got ill. That was the worst moment of my life since I had to seek medication for them and myself though I was financially unstable. The circumstance forced me to seek help from friends until it came to a point when they could not help further since the medication became expensive. I could not bear that anymore and decided to apply for emergency assistance from agencies since the whole family had gone into an unpleasing state. I applied for emergency assistance from Federal Emergency Management Agency. They helped our family get the required medication and supported us financially for a while until I got well.ConclusionA crisis can be in different forms, such as a financial crisis, and can arise anytime regardless of economic status. Therefore, it entails immediate intervention through seeking assistance from agencies, friends, or family members. In cases like the one I underwent, it is crucial to apply for any form of help. If one does not get help early after experiencing a crisis, personal distress may lengthen and lead to bad decision-making.
A global organization is not always risk-safe as the parent organization is typically situated in the nation of origin, and it sets up units in different nations. Global organizations are less impacted by limited downturns than organizations that work in one country. Organizations that work in a few countries have a more extensive pool of potential clients, which implies greater freedom to create benefits. Nonetheless, global companies need to overcome various risks that can compromise the business. Especially, localization programs might not work well in the market assessment area of multinational companies.Client perspectives and practices are exceptionally affected by cultural uniformity. When an organization moves into another market, plans of action ought to be altered to reflect neighborhood inclinations, customs, and propensities (Vaara et al., 2019). For instance, changes ought to be made to the item and administration contributions, evaluation, and advertising. Except if nearby societies drive action plans, unfamiliar organizations have a high risk of collapse. The expenses related to risk in a foreign market can be overwhelming.While interpretation is a significant part of language administration, it is the ideal initial step for some organizations that aim to integrate localization. Applying the localization program to deal with worldwide business can be harmful. Hence, worldwide achievement usually requires a glocal outlook (Vaara et al., 2019). Glocalization alludes to the interface of both globalization and localization. Though globalization includes normalized overall cycles and administrations, localization includes cycles and item contributions custom-made to meet explicit nearby business sectors (Vaara et al., 2019). It perceives those monetary collaborations are
WorkWhat I Will DoThe sphere of financial well-being directly impacts my physical and psychological health. Visiting a clinic and a psychologist always costs a lot of money, which you need to earn somewhere. My current job does not allow me to take complete care of my health because some services cost as much as half of my salary. Even though I work in a place that allows me to realize myself in the field, I study thoroughly. I want to work where I will have to give no more than a third of my income for various services.What I NeedTo find a better-paying job, I need to do a thorough search for vacancies on various Internet resources. I am not sure that going to the unemployment bureau would be a good idea, but it’s worth considering as an option. It should help me to get to know better the areas in which I can work by taking preparatory courses. It is necessary to approach the preparation of a resume very carefully ( Creating a healthier life , 2016). It is necessary to update it and remove unnecessary things. The resume is my reflection, so it should look appropriate.SavingsWhat I Will DoAn essential part of a happy life has a financial cushion to help me cope with difficult times or acquire something significant. Every month, I manage to save a small amount, which helps me travel and not save anywhere. I have a budget for the month, which helps determine how much I should spend this month.
help me avoid risks and fraud from the outside, which is my big fear to deal with this issue independently.What I NeedMany organizations in the world issue microloans that repay debts, but this has a downside. These organizations are taking inhumane measures that it’s time to return the money. A good option is to contact your bank to obtain a credit card with a specific limit. This feature will allow you to pay off most of the debts and, in the future, repay the debt to the bank without haste.RetirementWhat I Will DoI managed to open a deposit on good terms, and I will constantly try to replenish it with a sufficient amount of funds. Every month I will receive a small percentage of these contributions, which will improve my emotional state. I hope that I will be able to save more and not have to borrow money or take out a loan for another purchase with a new job.What I NeedTo improve my financial well-being even more, I should spend more time studying financial literacy. There are an incalculable number of free resources for training and planning in the modern world. Together, this will give me a happy life where I stop worrying that there is not enough money or I owe someone when everything is under control. Financial control is a very responsible thing you need to start teaching at school.
The primary source for this study is the general medical journal The Lancet. It publishes the survey data and provides statistics and a comparative analysis of the obtained quantitative information. The Economist can be seen as a secondary source that describes research with less digital content. The study represents a decrease in the HIV infection rate of girls in school by stabilizing their families’ financial difficulties.The World Bank funded the study to demonstrate the value of money in reducing the spread of HIV among young, poor girls. The study was authored by Berk Özler, Lead Economist and Poverty Research Manager. The medical journal The Lancet presented statistics based on a survey in the Zomba district of Malawi (G.C. 2). The Economist later summarized the study with the most critical findings from the analysis.Thus, 1,300 unmarried girls aged 13 to 22 took part in the study. This is a sufficient number of subjects to consider the prevalence of HIV in poor areas. The sampling took place with the help of a computer, so the girls fell into different experimental groups randomly. Thus, a group stood out in which girls and their families were given small amounts of money every month, girls paid to attend school, and girls left without financial support.Based on the study, it can be concluded that the subjects who received the money in both groups showed a significant reduction in the spread of the virus. However, test subjects with no money were forced to look for a sugar daddy. Therefore, in this group of issues, the statistics of the spread of HIV were preserved. Thus, the drug called money is adequate and affects the spread of STDs. The implication is that the global community needs funding to stop the spread of HIV. However, research and further assistance to young girls have several limitations. Firstly, it is hard to understand how much money each person needs to stop looking for sugar daddies and move on with their lives. Moreover, the study was conducted over 18 months, so it is impossible to assess how it will work in the long term
The importance of learning is to obtain new information about events not previously known to me. At the same time, studying helps me analyze them and understand their negative and positive aspects. As a consequence, because I have received and assimilated specific knowledge, I have the opportunity to apply it. In case the background information concerns negative phenomena, oppression, and discrimination, learning enables me to prevent past mistakes and develop a fair future.It is essential to emphasize that knowledge and experiences are precious, especially if they relate to problems that have arisen with family members. Hence, the guest speaker formed his position because of his mother’s encounter with the discrimination of women. At the same time, the mother was trying to restore her lost rights and status in society at the highest and interstate level, which was not a common practice in that period. Although, in fact, there are several cases where women have appealed to the Supreme Court and the United Nations for assistance in obtaining rights that had not been legally restored (File, 2022). Thus, Bill C-31 resulted from such a struggle, and personally, for the speaker means an opportunity for further innovation and resolution of Indigenous rights. Therefore, understanding history and analyzing it motivates individuals to advocate for the reinstatement of their own rights and interests.It is crucial to be aware of the historical record concerning illegal actions directed at indigenous populations. Although, according to the data provided by Columbus, before the invasion of the native population of Europeans, they had a facilitated
system for rights and freedoms and were immune to widespread diseases (File, 2022). At the same time, after twenty-five years, most of the population had been exterminated and exposed to genocide.In my opinion, even the documents issued by the Pope were aimed at harshly assimilating the indigenous people. Once again, even allowing children to be educated in boarding schools destroyed genetic memory and enforced new thoughts about culture and history. Significantly, the government also enacted the Gradual Civilization Act of 1857 and the Indian Act of 1876 (Hanson, 2022). While the first act assimilated the natives and forced them to abandon their roots, the second act effectively granted Canada the right to dispose of lands and resources belonging to the Indians.It seems evident that the Europeans were thus imposing their power on the native population. The authority granted to the General Superintendent of Indian Affairs created extraordinary control of Indian status. The consequences of these laws were disobedience from the natives and a desire to regain acquired rights. Although, at first, Aboriginal authorities peacefully petitioned the Canadian government to repeal the discriminatory legislation (Hanson, 2022). I believe that the enactment, the bans on Indian self-identification, and the continuation of discrimination contributed to Aboriginal people’s growing sense of identity and willingness to assert their rights.Moreover, considering that this act significantly reduced the number of individuals who had Indian status, they lost the right to remain on reservations. Therefore, I think that the change of the land, the renaming of communities, and the transformation of Indian names contributed
The health of the population is one of the values for the society, therefore, preserving and strengthening it is an important task in which everyone, without exception, should take part. Changes in the conditions for the functioning of state structures and the ongoing transition to market relations put forward new approaches to organizing and methodological support for the training, retraining, and advanced training of nursing specialists. Nursing personnel, carrying out the nursing process in the provision of obstetric and gynecological care, provide medical and preventive care to women and families at various periods of their lives, carry out observation, examination, rehabilitation, provide care and necessary assistance.For women, the decision to terminate a pregnancy may be based on various factors. Abortion is the purposeful or accidental termination of a pregnancy (Endler et al., 2019). In some countries, abortions are officially allowed, while others are limited to the level of inadmissibility of targeted assistance from medical personnel. Additionally, different religions differ in their attitude towards abortion. Therefore, women who come to the idea and decision to have an abortion may have a different life situation, as well as the conditions for terminating the pregnancy.A nurse plays the role of an adviser, mentor, assistant in relation to a woman and her family. Nursing staff must fulfill all stages of the nursing process: conduct an initial assessment, identify the patient’s problems, plan the work, carry out planned care, draw conclusions from the care. Moreover, an integral part of the work of nursing staff is medical deontology. A nurse spends much
harmful events and pressures may have long-lasting effects on the health habits of a child. Rural locations have a higher prevalence of distress, and children who live in distress are more vulnerable to face dire health consequences. The surroundings, biology, and parenting habits impact children’s health ( Black et al., 2017). This Life Course Model demonstrates that maternal and neonatal factors may affect a child’s health before birth and that early events can have a lifelong impact. To prevent this, it is recommended that health practitioners should encourage parents to raise children in an environment that doesn’t pose this danger to kids.Cultural Competencies to Consider in Adopting Childcare as a Public Health ProgramOrganizations and individuals must react efficiently and fairly to people from various cultural origins, socioeconomic classes, races, and ethnicities. Similarly, acknowledging sexual identity and religious views affirms the value of individuals, households, tribal groups, and societies while conserving and sustaining each individual’s dignity. Cultural competence in child care assistance should also take age into account, particularly for teenagers migrating from the child care framework. Harbach (2018) outlines that a culturally competent framework entails a determination to re-evaluate child welfare services’ exclusive, adult-centered culture at the very least and an active strategy for adolescent empowerment and inclusivity at the very best. Linguistic and cultural competence entails integrating cultural understanding into doctrine and practice.
An organizational structure is a framework that specifies how various operations within an enterprise are coordinated to meet its objectives. Joseph and Gaba (2020) enumerated that these operations may include regulations, positions, and obligations. Additionally, the management chart impacts how information moves between firm levels. In a centralized system, for instance, choices flow from the top down, but decision-making authority is spread across multiple organizational levels in a decentralized model. The firm structure permits businesses to maintain efficiency and concentration. A growth plan enables businesses to extend their operations by adding new sites, investing in client acquisition, and increasing product lines. Thus, a company’s growth plans are influenced by its sector and primary audience. This essay describes the institutional structure of Adidas Company, including details about the type of ownership, corporate hierarchy, and business model. Moreover, the paper discusses some of the opportunities for growth available for Adidas by identifying three external factors that it needs to consider.Description of the OrganizationAdidas, or Adidas AG, is a German maker of athletic footwear, athletic gear, and general merchandise. The corporation abbreviates the name of its founder, Adolf (Adi) Dassler, to get the moniker Adidas (Adidas, 2022). It was the largest sporting goods maker in Europe and the second largest globally, after Nike, at the turn of the 21st century. Historically, Adidas items bear a three-stripe symbol, which is included in the corporation’s trefoil and mountain emblems. Adidas flourished significantly in the 1950s as association football (soccer) players adopted the institution’s lightweight, screw-in cleat-equipped shoes (Adidas, 2022).In 1963, the
firm created a line of athletic goods by manufacturing soccer balls. Adidas was the industry leader in athletic shoes for several years, but rivalry rose in the 1970s, particularly from smaller companies such as Nike (Schmid et al., 2018). Adidas’ mission and objective are to be the leading sporting equipment manufacturer worldwide with a distinctive product portfolio ranging from athletic apparel for sports enthusiasts to luxury fashion to suit all customer requirements and grow the customer base from several angles (Adidas, 2022). The Adidas AG Company’s business headquarter is in Herzogenaurach, Germany.Description of Organization’s StructureThe Adidas Group’s organizational structure is based on a matrix architecture. Adidas arranges its personnel and resources based on its function and product. Consequently, individuals in the programs, engineering, and logistics divisions may have two managers. After completing the project, the staff will collaborate with other personalities. Matrix organizational structure is a dynamic framework that allows other sectors to collaborate, obtain diverse, innovative solutions from another unit, and gain new competencies and administrative management tasks inside the steering committee (Jin and Cedrola, 2019). There are three corporate entities within the Adidas Group: the annual general conference, the supervisory board, and the executive management. The executive board controls the organization, including its overall planning, internal surveillance and threat monitoring systems, and adherence. The governing council approves and removes members of the executive board and oversees and informs the executive board of its operations.Type of OwnershipThe type of ownership at Adidas AG Company is general public ownership. In other words, that is to mean
that the company is a publicly traded organization. The investors of a public company have an entitlement to a portion of the institution’s assets and income. Through the free trading of stock shares on trading platforms or over-the-counter (OTC) marketplaces, the control of a publicly traded corporation is divided among broad public stockholders (Silitonga, 2020). Silitonga (2020) insinuated that an initial public offering (IPO) is the procedure in which a private firm’s shares are transferred publicly for the first time. Suppose the IPO entails selling directly to a vast pool of investors, regardless of whether they are small retail investors or significant funds. In that case, this IPO is known as general public dissemination.Organizational HierarchyThe high echelon in the corporation is the CEO, who is responsible for all of the corporation’s accomplishments and failures and assumes responsibility for overseeing the entire organization. Second, the finance department is accountable for organizing monetary and accounting tasks, such as producing and submitting appropriation statements and providing management with financial records. Human resources are responsible for hiring new staff and guaranteeing they are knowledgeable in their respective fields. The sales staff is responsible for the economic achievement of the entity by transforming brand enthusiasm into productive and long-term business growth. The brand’s department is responsible for exploring, creating, and commercializing the group’s sports and lifestyle goods by providing innovative merchandise and unique moments.IT and mechanical engineering are the two divisions of the engineering faculty. One is responsible for web design and the IT system, while the other is for machining
equipment and operations. The primary objective of this section is to aid Adidas in creating innovative technologies that will enable them to be more profitable and efficient. The operations division involves product development, manufacturing schedules, sourcing, and transportation. Its role is to increase the distribution chain’s effectiveness while assuring the highest standards for product excellence, reliability, and dispatch.Figure 1: Adidas’ Organizational Hierarchy.Business ModelAdidas’s business model relies heavily on creating creative, consumer-driven items. Instead of engaging in sponsored posts, the firm strives to show its value by developing a high-performance brand portfolio that caters to the unique needs of professionals and shoppers (Shah, 2018). It accelerates product creation and manufacturing by continually enhancing technology, procedures, and tools. In addition, they stress considerably reduced group-level fragmentation by reducing the worldwide product portfolio, unifying the storage base, and standardizing above-market service. The goal is to provide the greatest branded retail experience across all client connections. Innovative distribution channel concepts accelerate the response time to consumer demands. This technique has prompted investors worldwide to acquire Adidas’ common stock, and the corporation has maintained constant expansion over the years (Shah, 2018). The public ownership framework of the business has been a vital component of long-term success.Discussion of External Influences that Impact GrowthCompetitionAdidas faces severe rivalry from its conventional rival Nike Inc. in the sportswear and clothing industry, which significantly impacts its potential development. Nike Inc.’s brand is valued at $122.3 billion, contrasted to Adidas’ $20.19 billion (Ennis, 2020). Nike’s luxury pricing approach, best cost provider methodology, offers Adidas severe competition since
it pursues customers who build a unique level of familiarity with the commodity, eventually forming brand loyalty. Nike makes use of the fact that brand trust has been developed to link purchasers with their prices. Therefore, Nike knows buyers will be willing to pay for its branded merchandise.In addition, Nike notably emphasizes a broad differentiation approach beating Adidas’ corporate-level approach. Based on this philosophy, Nike creates its athletic merchandise in three mechanisms (Ennis, 2020). Firstly, the company produces for three distinct demographic groups: men, women, and children. Secondly, it distinguishes its goods by providing a selection of gear and peripherals, such as shoes, gym bags, mittens, and skates. Thirdly, Nike has the license to produce and market non-athletic commodities such as school supplies, broadcast media gadgets, and smartwatches under the Nike name (Ennis, 2020). This plan is superior to Adidas’ corporate strategy, which concentrates on creativity and attempts to create new goods, solutions, and procedures to compete.Political UncertaintiesThe most significant political challenges affecting Adidas are shifting trade policies and political turmoil in numerous nations. Adidas must address these concerns to maintain its worldwide presence and economic performance. The Trump administration implemented trade restrictions and levies (Ennis, 2020). Regarding price increases, US tariffs on Chinese commodities continue to be a significant source of worry for Adidas and other athletic apparel manufacturers. Germany is a significant exporter, and US import restrictions and taxes could cost the country as much as 20 billion euros (Ennis, 2020). Adidas’ global activities include the shipment and delivery of items and offerings. Adidas
Mark Hendrickson’s article titled “Advance agent of expanding empires: George F. Becker and mineral exploration in South Africa and the Philippines” investigates the geologist’s role in shaping the American imagination of imperial expansion. The first few paragraphs of the article describe the period in which the British Empire suffered as a result of its inaccurate colonial politics, especially in South Africa, where the British had constant conflicts with the local Boer government. With this in mind, the author smoothly attracts readers’ attention to George Becker’s persona, who had an experience working in the South Africa region full of gold mines and political instability (Hendrickson 2019). He also worked in the Philippines, which was recently occupied after Admiral Dewey’s victory over the Spanish.I believe the main argument proposed by the author is that given the global empire transformation of the United States, the country needed people like Becker. These are people who might enlighten both politicians and the public about the peoples, their traditions, and resources of unfamiliar and outlying countries. In this way, Hendrickson underlined Becker’s exceptional position as an educator within the American political elite of that time (Hendrickson 2019). For instance, Theodore Roosevelt, the future United States 26 th president, was a big fan of Becker for his comprehensive knowledge of the Philippines, including the political reality of the Asian country.I partially do agree with this statement since, indeed, Becker contributed to raising awareness about specific regions’ resources and to American geopolitical achievements. However, Becker’s becoming one of the most influential scientists of his
was missioned to the Philippines to obtain general information about the country’s mineral wealth. Later, the general public was told that America’s mission was to bring civilization to the corners, remaining uncivilized. A geological survey was the first step in bringing enlightenment to the Philippines. However, Hendrickson (2019) supposes that Becker’s mission in the Philippines was far from geological interest. Instead, he was to find a basis on what the American public could tolerate the intervention and violence against foreign nations might be justified.Therefore, although their statement of Hendrickson is certainly justified, Becher’s persona is definitely questionable and controversial. The geologist actively took part in military operations against Filipino. He participated in army violence against foreign people on their soil, but he also intentionally deteriorated his reports for the American audience at the request of US Senator Beveridge. Moreover, they called rebels “sincere though misguided patriots,” “adventurers,” and “pursuers of charms of an exciting life” (Kramer 2018). This changed the reasons and motives of rebels on a fundamental basis in the eyes of the American public.It must be noted that Becker’s image of gold deposits in South Africa strongly affected both mining processes and British colonial policy in Africa, justifying British aggression against local people. Moreover, he the same justification he applied in the case of American imperialistic expansions in the Philippines and beyond (Hendrickson 2019). Thus, Becker was one of the significant contributors to American expansionist policy and determined most western countries’ foreign policy concerning countries that are weaker but rich in mineral sources.
There is an adverse effect of the opioid crisis on the United States. These substances typically result in an addiction, and a more significant aspect implies that they do not address the problem of the source of pain. Instead of it, opioids develop a feeling of euphoria that masks suffering. That is why it is evident that there is no need to legalize heroin, meaning that alternative pain relievers should be created.Since heroin and other opioids adversely impact the entire nation, a reasonable step is to fund alternative treatments for pain. For example, some researchers consider using marijuana as a pain reliever, but this substance also has some health risks, meaning that this decision should be made with caution (Saloner et al., 2018). However, if medical scientists manage to find an alternative pain management medicine, numerous benefits will arise. In particular, this decision will lead to higher patient safety because opioid overuse is a leading cause of people’s death (Saloner et al., 2018). For example, more than 60,000 people died from a drug overdose in 2016 (Saloner et al., 2018). Furthermore, a significant advantage will refer to expenditure savings because using an alternative pain reliever will not create people who will require additional services. That is why there is no doubt that it is necessary to invest in alternative pain management medicines.In conclusion, it has been identified that the opioid crisis is a significant challenge for the United States. This problem results in thousands of injured and dead, denoting that alternative pain relievers should be found. Marijuana is a suitable option, but the possible harmful effects of this substance represent why the healthcare industry has not started using it. In any case, researchers should look for alternative pain relievers to protect patients and reduce healthcare expenditures.
One of the prominent areas of anthropology, primatology, studies nonhuman primates, their behavior, and social capabilities to provide valuable details about human evolution. Next, one of the primary traits that could characterize most apes, especially chimpanzees, is aggression among the male species. However, while aggression presents a significant component of social structure and gender differences among nonhuman primates, its role and influence in human evolution remain implicit. This essay will explore various manifestations of aggression among chimpanzees and bonobos, analyze and compare their causes, and determine whether aggression presents a significant component of human evolution.One of the most developed representatives of the great apes’ group, also known as humans’ closes living relatives, the chimpanzees, are known for their intelligence. Chimps are rarely associated with aggressive behavior as they “lack the weapons” typically associated with violence, such as claws and string canines (Stanford, 2018). However, despite their high level of development, chimps also exhibit a very high amount of aggression to the point of lethal outcomes, even for the members of their own community. In fact, only a few animals besides humans are capable of such violent behavior. However, according to Preis and Jacob (2019), many chimps learned several strategies for avoiding aggressive behavior, such as cooperation and conflict management, because of the natural fear of injury. While most of the time, chimpanzees live in peace, several reasons could cause aggressive interactions.The prominent reason for aggressive interaction among chimps is dominance relationships. Chimps are highly protective of their territories as territory size is closely connected to food
resources. Food availability also presents one of the components of higher social status among chimps. According to Preis et al. (2019), a higher dominance level or social status is associated with many fitness benefits, such as better health, longevity of life, and even faster healing processes. The dominance and subordination ranks are reflected in levels of glucocorticoid hormones used to assess Hypothalamus-Pituitary-Adrenal (HPA) axis activity. The research conducted by Preis et al. (2019) suggests that urinary glucocorticoid levels are positively correlated with aggression rates, meaning that elevated aggression influences glucocorticoid levels. Another study by Preis and Jacob (2019) defined that status competition causes psychosocial stress on all-male species, even during periods of low rates of aggression, which was discovered through the analysis of urinary cortisol levels. Therefore, male chimps are stressed more during periods of high competition, while aggression arises mainly during periods of low competition because of social instability caused by food availability or mating.Furthermore, considering that aggression in male chimpanzees is an outcome of adaptive strategy provides important context about human evolution. According to Stanford (2018), while violent behavior among chimps is considered immoral because of their connection with humans, in reality, aggression among chimpanzees’ is an amoral tool for obtaining more resources by eliminating competitors. Moreover, it was determined by Preis et al. (2019) that in cases with high risks of escalation, some chimps prefer avoiding aggression. Avoiding aggression and introducing different forms of behavior to show their competitiveness proves that chimps are capable of using adaptive strategies and elements of conflict management.On
the other hand, aggression is less common among bonobos, who are also considered close human relatives. Besides sharing physical differences with chimpanzees, bonobos have different social structure patterns, which influences conflict-resolving methods in bonobos. While bonobos, like chimpanzees, are also protective of their territory, bonobos have more complex inter-group relationships where they often meet to interact, which relates them to humans (Tokuyama et al., 2019). Even though bonobos tend to express aggression only to attack out-group individuals, they have never been seen killing other bonobos, compared to the level of aggression in chimps.Moreover, there are considerable gender differences between female chimps and bonobos, as female bonobos have significantly higher social status. While there could be competition among male bonobos for social ranking, according to Tokuyama et al. (2019), mating is more influenced by the female mating partner’s choice and the social status of the male bonobo’s mother. Such a rational approach to mating differs from chimps, who frequently show aggression towards females. In turn, female chimps rarely show aggression towards male chimps, which is one factor that influences the overall level of aggression in chimps. According to King (2021), aggression in chimpanzees is shaped at a young age. Young chimpanzees become more aggressive when young chimps spend with protective mothers and time with aggressive males (King, 2021). A similar tendency is found in humans: suggesting that aggressive behavior is more acceptable for boys results in men being more physically aggressive. Therefore, the continuous dynamic of male chimps showing more aggression than female chimps reaffirms aggressive interactions
and male bonobos. Moreover, as bonobo mothers often participate in competitions alongside their sons, female bonobos are not disregarded like chimpanzee females.Lastly, there are two types of aggression defined in human evolution: proactive and reactive. Reactive aggression presents a reaction to provocation, while proactive aggression does not need provocation and focuses on constructing a plan in which the victim will have minimal opportunities to fight back (Wrangham, 2019a). In general, humans are believed to be more like chimps, as they exhibit a proactive type of reaction, but humans also tend to be less reactive than chimps, making them more like bonobos. It could be that a reduced level of reactive aggression in humans occurred through human evolution and self-domestication.Comparing and analyzing the sources of aggression among chimpanzees and bonobos revealed that environmental factors, such as food availability, determined key differences of social structure and aggression patterns in chimps and bonobos. Therefore, from the point of human evolution, aggression patterns in people could be connected to environmental factors and the availability of recourses. People historically tend to show more intense proactive aggression in fighting and starting wars for resources. This essay analyzed why proactive aggression in chimps and humans has similar reasons and provided an outlook on what human evolution would look like if there were plenty of resources available for the humankind.
The current global landscape of the agricultural economy is composed of large companies. In fact, their presence is prevalent enough to dictate and formulate policies and standards within the industry (Chemnitz et al., 2017). In practice, this has resulted in a number of discrepancies such as environmental damages, violations of human and labor rights, and even the lack of effort to minimize poverty. While the scale of the issue may seem too large to resolve, alterations of consumer buying habits have the potential to foster diversity within such industries. However, buying habits are only a small fragment of a number of interventions that are necessary. Perhaps the most vital change that is missing includes government presence.The most interesting aspect of the reading to me was focused on how the current size of the agricultural market was attained. The most prominent driver of such expansion was technological advancements that led to fundamental changes within the institution of the agricultural economy. Because machines were able to harvest in abundant amounts compared to employees, this created a substantial raise within the supply component of the economy. Companies also gained the upper hand by being able to sell quantities of crops before they were even sown. Such growth allowed even further expansion, though global companies would infrequently observe the effects of their actions on the planet, people in poverty, or farmers.Another interesting factor of the rapid and substantial expansion of the agricultural market was the evolution of food retail. Essentially, the effectiveness of retail operations currently influences purchasing habits and product availability, especially within developing and developed countries. As such, from an economic perspective, the size of a food retail firm dictates its influence over both the consumer choice and which suppliers are selected. The monopolization that currently exists within the market is problematic, mainly due to the fact that such firms disregard the issues of modern agricultural processes.
City of Ontario v. Quon , the Supreme Court was only concerned with privacy insofar as it related to the permissibility of a governmental search of text messages (Halbert & Inguilli, 2014). In other words, the court did not outline a specific right to privacy but merely elaborated on the technicalities of allowing a search on a directly relevant constitutional basis. Hence, to the extent that the Supreme Court finds privacy in the Constitution, it is justified in doing so.Westin and the Supreme Court generally coincide in their view of privacy. In Riley v. California , the court stated that searching a cell phone without a warrant is illegal and recognized the swiftly increasing value of digital devices to people’s identities (Halbert & Inguilli, 2014). The importance of being secure in one’s digital communication corresponds directly to Westin’s function of limited and protected communication. Similarly, the amount of personal information stored on an average cellphone can make it an important component of the extended self, making it valuable for both personal autonomy and self-reflation. Thus, the Supreme Court’s position on privacy implicitly recognizes the value of privacy functions as defined by Westin.
Rhinoceros is an incredible woodcut made by Albrecht Durer. He created a woodcut picture that was reproduced several thousand times of the animal, which demonstrated a significant interest of the European people in Asia. His work was considered a masterpiece of that time that served informative and aesthetic purposes. The story of the picture can be used to describe the relationships between Europe, India, and the Islamic world.It is crucial to start with several facts from the biography of Albrecht Durer. He was a famous and well-known artist that made special artworks. It was found that Durer had never seen the beast himself and that created his work based on a drawing and written samples sent from Lisbon (Monson 51). Durer was an extremely influential Italian, and he knew many other influential people of the time, including Raphael, Leonardo da Vinci, and Bellini. Even though Durer had never seen a live rhino and depicted it inaccurately, Durer’s Rhinoceros became one of the most popular pictures of the time.The picture of the rhino created in 1515 was inaccurate. The picture shows that a rhino is covered with plates of armor. Indeed, the audience can observe the shift in its meaning from an exact source of zoological information to a pictorial source of aesthetic pleasure throughout the construction of the history of the Rhinoceros (Feiman 22). Durer’s Rhinoceros also has a small horn on the back, scaly legs, and saw-like rear quarters. These features are not present in a rhino. The fact that Durer was interested in the
king. However, King Manual still sent the animal as a gift to Pope Leo X in 1515. This demonstrates how the Islamic world wanted to build relationships with Europe, how India lived during the time of the Islamic invasion, and how European kings wanted to receive Pope’s favor and attention.The rhinoceros was not the only time an animal was used as a diplomatic gift. For instance, it was a gift between various noblemen across India and the Islamic world. This is because the animal depicted was made realistically as opposed to other similar works of that time (Moson 51). The animals were often sent to maintain diplomatic relationships with the western world, knowing the increased interest in exotic animals.In conclusion, Durer’s Rhinoceros demonstrates the interest of sixteenth-century Europeans in animals from the East. Even though Durer had not seen the rhino, he created a woodcut print of the animal, knowing that it would get popular. The story of the rhinoceros’ travels demonstrates the diplomatic interests of India, the Islamic world, and Europe, as the animal was first gifted by Indians to an Islamic king, then to a European king, and then to the Pope.
In this study, the researchers utilized multiple linear regression to identify the relationship between alcohol consumption and the characteristics of the neighborhood. The dependent variable for this study is alcohol consumption among students (Freitas et al., 2020). The study has five independent variables; firstly, is people often get mugged, robbed, or attacked in the neighborhood. Secondly, people in my neighborhood look out for each other and thirdly, people sold or used drugs in the neighborhood. Fourthly, people in my neighborhood generally got along with each other, and lastly, I feel safe being out alone in my neighborhood during the night.From table 1.0, the value of R square is 0.026, which means that 2.6% of the variation on students drinking alcohol can be explained by the combined variation of people in neighborhood getting along with each other, people sell or use drugs in the neighborhood, I feel safe being out alone in my neighborhood, people often get mugged, robbed or attacked in my neighborhood, and people in my neighborhood could be trusted. However, the adjusted R square, which considers the number of variables and the sample size, shows that only 0.3% of the variation in the dependent variable can be explained by combined variations of the dependent variable (Ramachandran & Tsokos, 2021).From table 2.0, the p-value is 0.342, which is greater than 0.05. This means that the regression analysis is not significant to explain the dependent variable using the independent variables (Maneejuk & Yamaka, 2020). From the correlations results in table 3.0; I feel safe being out
alone in my neighborhood, people often get mugged, robbed or attacked in my neighborhood, and people in my neighborhood generally got along with each other have a weak positive correlation with how often do you have a drink containing alcohol? People sell or use drugs in my neighborhood, and People in my neighborhood could be trusted has a weak negative correlation with how often do you have a drink containing alcohol? (da Silva Filho et al., 2021).Table 1.0: Model summaryModel Summary b

This study’s independent variable was a helpful message on the back of the dining check regarding the upcoming specials. The dependent variable was the percentage of the bill left as a tip to the waiter. This study operationalizes the restaurant tipping culture by focusing on the tip percentage. The potential confounding variables of this experiment may be the food quality, the server’s gender, the dining party’s size, and whether the customers were regulars.The study’s strengths include design transparency, implementation simplicity, and potential replication in different settings. However, the message’s content varied depending on the special, appealing differently to customers. Furthermore, the study was conducted only in one restaurant, which renders extrapolation to different establishment classes difficult. These factors could impact the tipping outcomes and, therefore, the study results.Furthermore, it is unclear whether the mere presence of a personalized message or the message content itself drove the outcome. To evaluate this possibility, the authors could have asked waiters to write different messages, some with no useful content, such as wishing a good day or drawing a smiley face. Moreover, the researchers could have used alternative arrangements, assigning the waiters randomly instead of assigning dining parties randomly.Several aspects of this study could impact its internal validity. The researchers have instructed servers to keep their behavior consistent, thus limiting potential confounding variables. Varying attitudes may affect the final tip, thus undermining the causal relationship. Furthermore, a few hypothetical aspects could limit the research’s external validity. For instance, if the waiter were a young female adult, applying the same conclusions to male waiters and older servers would be challenging, given the potential gender factor. If the study was conducted at a private country club, extrapolating the result onto the high-class restaurant and casual diners alike would be unreliable. If the meal was buffet-style, the overall tipping percentage might have been lower due to the perceived lesser effort of a waiter, thus impacting its wider applicability.Lastly, the study only used two groups, servers, and dining parties, with no size specification. The authors could have employed a third group of solo dining parties, thus separating groups from those dining by themselves. Such an addition would allow addressing the question of the groups’ size effect and individual, interpersonal interactions. Lastly, implementing the design with solo dining parties would address the effect of gender on the outcome.
The idea of Whiteness in Get OutGet Out shatters the myth of America as a post-racist country. Everything frightening, as everything funny, in Get Out comes from the fear that members of the former master race and the former slave race have for each other. Holmes notes that in this movie, the antagonists are not whites who hate blacks for their race. The director shows whites who love blacks and even envy them with scary, dangerous, and insensitive machines. It debunks the notion of an ideal culture of political correctness as if proclaiming that it is racist to treat someone positively just because of their skin color.Get Out at first resembles, and somewhere directly parodies, Guess Who’s Coming to Dinner Stanley Kramer’s not the most outstanding but historically significant film about a girl who introduces her parents to a black groom. It was made exactly 50 years ago – when interracial marriage was a scandal and just stopped being a crime. Nowadays, it seems like a wildness from the past; however, the question still arises: “Has everything got better since then?”. In Kramer’s film, the nuance was that the parents were progressive liberals, but their daughter’s engagement to Sidney Poitier was a shock even for them. Peel corrects for the Obama era and takes the situation to the point of absurdity – Rose’s parents and their friends, elderly rich whites, go out of their way to show their openness. They praise Obama, talk about Jesse Owens and Tiger Woods, use awkward jargon, and almost start rapping.
Terrorism is one of the main problems faced by humanity in the 21st century and, despite considerable countermeasures, it remains topical. Islamic terrorism is one of the most prominent forms of the radicalism of the past decades, which manifested itself in several tragic events. The movement began when Osama Bin Laden formed al Qaeda in 1989, which conducted its first attack in Yemen by placing a bomb in a hotel housing American troops (“Osama bin Laden,” 2020). Osama Bin Laden espoused the idea of worldwide Jihad, a holy war of Muslims against the infidels and especially the United States. The main terrorist attack of al Qaeda was the 9/11 Bombing of the World Trade Centers, claiming the lives of thousands of people and leading to the beginning of the War on Terror (“Osama bin Laden,” 2020). Eventually, the United States Military located Osama bin Laden and killed him, yet it did not stop other Islamic radicals from carrying out attacks. One of them was the Boston Marathon Bombings event which were orchestrated by followers of Osama bin Laden (Breuninger, 2021).The continuing terrorist attacks cause numerous concerns to emerge over the effectiveness of the United States War on Terror. Yet, it is still one of the responsibilities of the country to act as the world’s “policeman” since the United States is the only global superpower capable of establishing control overseas. Essentially, by ensuring its military presence in problematic regions, the United States manages to contain the existing threats to global peace. The Middle East is one such region, and its stability is vital to the U.S. economy and national security. The United States suppresses the influence and growth of radical movements in the region, which, if left unchecked, can continue building support networks worldwide, including in the United States. Such a development can lead to new terrorist attacks, as well as the rise of Islamist governments in the Middle East, which will be hostile to western nations. As a result, the terrorist threat in the world would only increase if the United States completely left the Middle East. In such an event, local terrorist groups would seize power and gain access to more resources allowing them to further incite violence and destruction. Moreover, there is also a threat of Islamist groups gaining control over nuclear weapons, thus putting the safety of the entire world at risk.
Several reports have been sent to the United States Department of Agriculture’s Agricultural Research Service concerning the recent spread of an unknown epidemic on a farm in Montana. The report describes that cattle started exhibiting strange and abnormal behavior. Particularly, the cows started losing weight drastically and without any obvious reason, producing a reduced amount of milk and having problems with orientation (Broucek et al., 2017). The study of the relevant literature revealed that one of the potential causes of the disease might be bovine spongiform encephalopathy (BSE) or ‘mad cow disease’ due to prions (Houston and Andréoletti, 2019). The latter is named PrPSc and is considered to be a misfolded form of protein PrPC that can be replicated and transmitted among the same species and also to other species.In this regard, it is fair to suspect that BSE could be transmitted to humans through the ingestion of diseased cattle meat. In humans, transmitted prions cause a disease that is called the new variant of Creutzfeldt–Jakob disease (vCJD) (Thomas, 2019). It is associated with developing neurological and psychological problems, mental deterioration, change in behavior, and reduced coordination. However, according to the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (2017), the average incubation period of this type of prion disease in humans is ten years, whereas, for cattle, it is two times less. Thus, there is a high risk that farmers already have vCJD but without any symptoms yet. For this reason, I was sent to the farm to collect the brain tissue sample of the recently
of BSE was registered in 1986 in the U.K., and the first case of vCJD was reported just several years later in the same country (Kim et al., 2016). The original cause of the BSE was found to be a meat-and-bone meal. For this reason, our investigation of the disease’s etymology started from the food that the cattle consume. The farm manager explained that they use several domestically produced supplements and two imported ones – from Brazil and the U.K. – to feed their cows. A further search for the cause of the epidemic revealed that just recently, there was also one case of BSE detected in Somerset, U.K. (McCarthy, 2021). Next, I talked with the farm manager in Somerset and found that they used to buy the supplements from the same company in the U.K. as our farmers in Montana. Therefore, the primary source of the BSE and vCJD epidemic was identified.Unfortunately, there is no treatment developed to cure both BSE and vCJD. Usually, the sick animals die in a period of two weeks to several months. As for the affected farmers, they can live as long as 12 years after the first symptoms appear. In this regard, it is suggested that all the cattle on the farm be quarantined until all the animals and farmers are tested.
Active Political, Social, Cultural, and Economic EnvironmentIn order to understand the complexities of a country’s development and evaluate its prospects regarding its economic, social, and political well-being, a comprehensive analysis is typically needed. While the presence of external factors is also of essential significance, the resources available to state residents, as well as capacities that the state in question possess, play a nonetheless essential part in promoting further economic and sociocultural development. For Australia, the described factors have been quite positive over the past couple of decades, allowing the state to evolve and promote the sustainable use of its economic resources and other types of assets.Political Stability and Instability StructureWhen evaluating the factors that must have contributed to the current rates of political stability within Australia, one should mention the fact that it has not been significantly affected by the British colonialism. Due to the geographic location that complicated the process of colonialism, Australia had been isolated from the impact of the British rule for a while, which helped the state to develop its agency and start political changes within it s framework based on the unique factors attributed to its setting. Moreover, once getting rid of the British rule, Australia managed to establish relationships with other states on equal footing, which advanced its political performance to a significant extent. As a result, the current structure of political stability within Australia is quite resilient and strong, allowing the state to be flexible in its political interactions with foreign countries.At the same time, the current situation observed
within the political stance of Australia may come into question in the nearest future. Due to the rapidly changing dynamics of international relationships, Australia may need to revisit some of its current political standards and approaches to building economic and political relationships. Namely, the Australian government, as well as organizations involved in international trade, may introduce more accurate tools for political and financial forecasting. As Black explains,Given the volatility of international relations, of environmental developments such as population growth, resource availability, global temperature change, and pandemics, and of other aspects of the future, such discussion may appear very problematic. 1Thus, Australia will need to include precise tools for geopolitical analysis so that it could forecast; likely changes in the global economic setting and examine the available routes. For instance, the increase in China’s political and economic influence in the global setting is to be taken into consideration. Namely, Friedman explains that the recent change observed in the Chinese economic setting indicates that China is likely to become a strong economic partner for Australia in the future:China has also emerged as a major industrial power in the last generation, with growth surpassing that of any other major economy in the world, although its economy is still far smaller than that of Japan or the United States. 2Similarly, other Asian and South Asian countries that have been advancing in their economic and technological development represent a rather lucrative opportunity for Australia, which is why the state authorities need to encourage private and public sector to build connections with
the specified states as well. At the same time, relationships must be maintained with European and the U.S. Although the present-day setting affected heavily by the coronavirus pandemic still represents a range of challenges, Australia has a plethora of opportunities to succeed.Access to Strategic Human, Natural, and Economic Skill and ResourcesAdditionally, Australia has quite broad access to human, natural, and economic resources. Due to the rapid development within the Australian market, local businesses have been enjoying quite a range of opportunities. Moreover, since Australia has been a very popular tourist destination, it has gained quite a range of economic resources. 3Access to Allies and EnemiesExamining the problems in the relationships between Australia and other countries, particularly, Europe and the U.S. will lead to the discovery that Australia has remarkably few political opponents. Granted that there is a plethora of economic rivals in the global market for Australia, the range of openly antagonistic relationships between Australia and other countries is surprisingly small. Indeed, considering the present political environment closely will show that Australia has no political opponents. The lack of conflicts with other state scan be ascribed to Australia’s geopolitical situation; namely, having been isolated form other states for quite a while due to its geographic location, Australia has not developed any antagonistic interactions with other countries. Therefore, Australia has virtually no enemies. However, even if it had, the immediate access to them would be fairly limited due to the problem of geographic location mentioned above.In turn, the range of positive interactions that Australia has been enjoying
Executive SummaryBottega Veneta is a worldwide famous brand, but its performance might need a boost owing to the company’s recent growth needs. Bottega’s options include product diversification and the production of a new line of items. The company’s brand must be reinvented by emphasizing the significance of quality in daily things and minimizing the level of luxury associated with its products. Bottega will be capable to establish a novel production line by developing the brand impression in a way that relates it to the firm’s principal identity.IntroductionTransitioning from a premium company to one that sells things for daily usage is practically impossible. Bottega Veneta, on the other hand, will identify whether all aspects of the corporate communications process are in harmony (Weingerl and Javoršek, 2018). Assuring customers that their daily routines are comfortable while adding a touch of luxury, Bottega will be able to develop an entirely new and extraordinarily profitable brand.Audit of the BrandPen Portrait and Analysis of CompetitorsBottega Veneta brands are primarily focused on attracting feminine as well as macho women, as seen by the photographs. The women here are smart and stylish, live in the contemporary world, are self-assured, and sophisticated. Given that Bottega’s women’s fashion trends are mostly irrelevant, the photographs depict ladies who have their own perspective and discern what is best and more importantly, what garments fit them best. Indeed, these women appreciate comfort above everything else and are willing to spend their money on high-end Bottega brand items. Bottega’s consumers prioritize comfort above innovation, but not rejecting the latter.
Additionally, the target population is likely to live in the fast lane because of their proclivity for digital technologies.Digital Pen PortraitFigure 1: Digital Pen Portrait.Analysis of Digital Competitors (POPs and PODs)PODs will include user comfort, since Gucci, Burberry, and Loewe all market luxury in a similar manner as Bottega, but do not focus on daily things and their use (Achim, 2019). In other words, the items are distinguished by superior materials and timeless designs, which sets them apart from the competitors. Bottega’s majority of items are premium priced because to their exquisite brands and high-quality textiles (Zhang and Zhao, 2019). High quality and efficacy are the primary POPs, which Bottega will need to thoroughly examine to guarantee that the standards established satisfy those used by other firms in the industry.Brand InventoryHeritage and History of the BrandSince 1966, Bottega Veneta has been recognized as a luxury goods and designer clothing company. The firm, based in Italy, has amassed considerable influence in the premium design sector. By concentrating on establishing the brand that will serve as the foundation for a fresh and distinctive brand identity, one may successfully capture the luxury daily items market.Brand DNAThe brand DNA will enable the business to portray itself as innovative while concentrating on quality and consumer comfort. As a result, the DNA will be designed with the goal of fostering a pleasant existence. The brand’s objective will be to ease everyday routines while also adding excitement and satisfaction. Integrity, customer attention, accountability, and excellent quality will serve as the cornerstone for the
brand DNA’s growth (see Fig. 2). The proposed technique, based on the Onion Model, will aid in tracing the transition from the existing brand to the one set to emerge.Brand PersonalityTo explain the personality of the brand that will be developed, the Aaker Model will be required. By using Aaker’s five personality characteristics, one may determine that the brand to be established is truthful, highly competent, and fairly sophisticated (Kakitek, 2018). Additionally, the presence of luxurious components may provide a touch of excitement. The harshness of the items will be kept to a minimum in order to preserve their sophistication (see Fig. 3).Figure 3: Aaker Model for Brand PersonalityюBrand IdentificationThe brand’s identity will be developed utilizing Kapferer’s method. As seen in Figure 4, it is critical to establish an intercultural relationship between the sender and receiver (Cuofano, n.d.). In the instance of Bottega, a feedback system will be used to build a relationship between the consumer and the firm. The data collected via surveys and questionnaires will be used to include culturally relevant components into brand goods and to adjust them to the unique demands of individual customers.Figure 4: Kapferer’s method analysis (Cuofano, n.d.)юEquity in a brandTo boost Bottega’s brand equity, especially with its new range of items, one must examine Keller’s Brand Equity Model (see Fig. 5). According to the approach, brand identity should be built around how consumers and the business interact; beginning with the organization’s basic values and the viewpoint, it brings to company-customer communication. Thus, Bottega’s new range of goods’ brand equity
should be organized on the use of high quality, inventive design to infuse moments of luxury into their customers’ daily lives.Figure 5: Keller’s brand equity model (Keller’s brand equity model: building a powerful brand, 2021).Architecture of the BrandBottega’s contemporary architecture may be regarded as a branded home, in whom all goods are housed under the Bottega primary brand. However, when a new brand is created that incorporates daily; the need to rethink the present branding strategy may arise. In order to reach their target audience, the firm will need to develop a house of brands.Brand LeveragingBottega will heavily on the strength of its present brand in the early phases of advertising its new items. As a result, the new brand must contain features of the existing one, including the title and potentially the typeface. However, the company’s corporate philosophy, which values individualism and confidence, may be included into the design of the innovative product. Because of their high quality and end outcome, Bottega will strive to promote their emerging brand as dependable.Brand PositioningWhile the current Bottega brand in the desired corporate environment is largely rooted in luxury, the successor one must be grounded on practicality and presented as useful in everyday life. Luxury elements, such as unique architecture and materials used in the new products, will be offered as bonus items, helping to raise brand recognition (Brunetti, Confente, and Kaufmann, 2019). Like Bottega Veneta, the new brand should focus on artisanship and everyday convenience, if not luxury.Strategy for BrandingAIDA. To generate public attention in the brand,
the AIDA model will be required (Prathapan, et al., 2018). Bottega will seek to enlighten the community about its new venture, generate curiosity in the new everyday product brand, and encourage target shoppers to acquire them. Advertising and a webpage will be created, where advertisements will emphasize luxury and comfort to entice buyers with the help of a customer loyalty program to encourage the exercise.RACE . Additionally, the RACE (Reach, Act, Convert, Engage) Model must be used to advertise the items and pique the audience’s interest. To be more precise, a new communication channel comprised of ICT and contemporary media will be developed in order to reach out to consumers. To promote action (“Act”), the website will have interactive components that allow buyers to tailor their experience. The conversion process will begin after Bottega has amassed a following of committed fans via discounts, gift certificates, and similar methods. Finally, the engagement step will include listening to customer input and tailoring items to their specific requirements.Licensing/IPBottega will retain ownership of the intellectual property and goods, since the new brand will be released under its name. Thus, Bottega will be given intellectual property rights not for the items themselves, but for the idea underlying them, namely the incorporation of comfort and a touch of elegance into everyday routines. Due to the incorporation of the company’s present logo into the mark to be produced for the aforementioned items; it will be important to acknowledge Bottega’s property rights as the owner of the aforementioned intellectual property.Elements of a BrandBottega’s current
brand identity is composed of various themes, incorporating opulence and beautiful austerity. To sum up what luxury is and how it can be expressed via accessories and garments, Bottega Veneta’s slogan is “When your initials are sufficient.” (‘Bottega Veneta’ 2019). The logo, printing, symbols, packaging, and colors are all presented as brand aspects.Logotype for Brand IdentityThe present brand identification logo is fairly simple and, as a result, one-of-a-kind. As a consequence, the enterprise’s redesigned trade logo must be beautiful and stylized. The logo must keep the shape of the company’s letters printed in a sans serif typeface for this reason. The defined method will emphasize the company’s integrity while maintaining a strong commitment to its principles and philosophy.Color of the LogoCustomers will immediately distinguish Bottega’s items due to the usage of color-coding. It will be prudent to utilize colors that enable instant differentiation of items; hence, a brand’s category will be distinguished by divergent colors like red, blue, yellow, green, or any other shade that helps the product stand out.Icons and PhotographsTo be immediately distinct from the logo, the brand icons will need to be far less detailed than the logo. However, simplifying the current brand is more challenging given that it is reflected by the company’s name. Although the purposeful choice of sans serif fonts simplifies the effort, there are still significant barriers to overcome. To do this, the logo must be reduced to the first two letters (BV) in a classic sans serif typeface and the allotted color.PackagingPackaging shall be biodegradable, recyclable, reusable, non-toxic,
and skin – friendly. Bottega must position itself as an eco-friendly company, which includes sensitive packaging. Each produced item will be delivered in three, six, or twelve-packs to conserve resources.Branding StrategiesThe New Brand Strategy’s Five ObjectivesTo Increase Brand AwarenessThis increases market share and establishes Bottega as an industry leader.To enlarge our social communitiesThis goal may be accomplished by using a variety of social media platforms and tactics to provide content that expands our social network communities and viewers.To bolster customer engagement techniques in order to boost customer loyaltyThe aim here will be to recruit reputable or prominent members of the target audience to serve as brand ambassadors.To Keep a Close Eye on Customer FeedbackIt is critical for recording customer sentiments on relevant items that serve as a barometer of satisfaction and progress.To convert social media followers into qualified leads and new businessBrand content generates social media followers and dialogues that result in new clients. The amount of leads generated through social media platforms is a key performance indicator in this case.RecommendationsTo acclimatize Bottega to the internet age, social media should be utilized to market new products to clients. Additionally, an application must be built to assist prospective purchasers in navigating the corporation’s manufacturing process more effectively (Dwivedi et al., 2021). The investigation revealed that Bottega’s internet ads and visibility are still lacking, despite the fact that the digital revolution has taken over. To remain current and preserve its leadership position, the business should use other social media channels in conjunction with its website possibilities.Customer Engagement in
the Digital AgeBottega’s digital consumer profile is highly sophisticated. Now, it includes a regard for workmanship, brand loyalty, and customization choices. The emphasis on personalization is anticipated to rise in the digital environment (Shukla and Nigam, 2018). As a result, the potential to enjoy items designed exclusively for them must be leveraged to entice consumers. The corporation will need to explore many variations of each item, such as tote bags and umbrellas with distinctive designs.Execution of the Brand10 Instagram Messages 1.

The import of raw materials and resources for the production of goods is of particular value. However, the procedure for importing products from one country to another may often have some disadvantages. Hence, in some cases, there is a need for a large duty on the product, which reduces its profitability for the organization. This work aims to consider two strategies for reducing this financial indicator for companies.The first strategy that can be applied to reduce the cost of import duties on resources is to optimize documentation. Hence, the organization must be sure of the validity of the documents (Planitzer, 2020; Voudouris & Plomaritou, 2020). Incorrect and incomplete filling of the boom associated with the transportation of goods or raw materials from abroad may result in an increase in the cost of duty. Moreover, it becomes a causal time cost for the company. Responsibility for the implementation of these actions should be borne directly by the head. The availability of accurate data also increases the efficiency not only of the company’s work but also of its employees. The introduction of new technologies will also reduce duties if suppliers send the necessary documents in advance.Another strategy to reduce import fees for goods and resources may be to make supplier decisions based on all elements of the total land value. To perform this process, it is necessary to apply forecasting skills and implement a risk management policy (Odman et al., 2018). Despite the seemingly high financial costs. Moreover, a specialist can be applied to the analysis of various examples. This person can teach how to calculate the appropriate fees and financial consequences and customer service. It was the potential audience that was able to communicate with the control group.
Ethics shape the state of many businesses and display the owners’ intentions towards bettering the consumers’ lives. Ethical considerations are rules that the company should adhere to while making significant decisions concerning their customers and creditors (Schmitz & Leoni, 2019). The integrity of Key West Stores is an ethical consideration since it affects the business’s operations. Accountant does not display integrity in their job and place themselves at risk since the creditors are offended. It is also unfair when the business transfers the blame to the mailroom and the post office, knowing they are liable for the delay in delivery of the checks. It is unethical for Key West Stores to hold the bills and lie to their creditors to avoid penalties.The stakeholders affected negatively by the conspiracy are the creditors, the mailroom, and the post office. Whereas the creditors lose money by paying more interest, the mailroom and the post office blame the delays in the checks. The creditors cannot complain since they are dependent on the business and thus pay for the excessively demanded money by Key West Stores. Conversely, the firm earns from the perfected delays hence the only party that benefits. Tiffany Lyons is another party that may be a victim of the activities. It will derail her emotions if she is not okay with conducting the lies.Tiffany should not continue with the immoral practices started by Jay because they place her at risk of losing her trustworthiness in the organization. The business should give her a position to conduct her duty
The story of medical research has been rather unkind to women, often neglecting the differences of the female anatomy and failing to acknowledge female-specific issues, centering on male ones. However, even when healthcare research does prioritize women, the manner in which it does so often remains quite deplorable, as the case of Henrietta Lacks demonstrates. Representing a case of blatant abuse of women’s rights, as well as unmasked racism and neglect for patient’s dignity, the case of Henrietta Lacks stirred the global community, yet it was only Rebecca Skloot who did Lacks’ narrative justice. By pinpointing the nature of the problem, specifically, outlining racism and disregard for the integrity of women’s bodily autonomy, Skloot condemns the abuse that Lacks suffered, therefore, paving the way to new, fair and unbiased, medical research.What makes Skloot’s work remarkable is the focus of the narrative. Specifically, Skloot does not diminish the significance and effect of the discovery that researchers made. Indeed, the discovery of HeLa cells can be seen as a massive breakthrough in addressing the issues of social, academic, and racial injustice observed in the case under analysis. Instead, Skloot appeals to the principles of research participants’ autonomy and the fundamental rights of an individual, particularly, the right to bodily integrity: “All I remember is that she had this disease, and right after she died they called me in the office wanting to get my permission to take a sample of some kind. I decided not to let them” (Skloot). Thus, the plight of the narrator becomes especially reasonable
the chalk from his hands. Class was over” (Skloot). The specified passage renders the indifference of the academia toward vulnerable populations, namely, African American women, as well as women belonging to other minority races and ethnicities. Therefore, Skloot manages to represent the injustice of what has been done to Stock, while also giving credit to researchers for the advancement of healthcare that they promoted.By emphasizing the injustice and racism that Lacks suffered, having been subjected to extraordinarily biased research with no regard for the bodily autonomy of hers, Skloot addresses Lacks’ case in a very straightforward and unapologetic manner. Skloot manages to balance between acknowledging the importance of research and the necessity to recognize the rights of minority groups, thus, delivering a compelling and thought-provoking message. Encouraging compassion to the victims of systemic injustice, particularly, racism, Skloot creates the narrative that elicits deep sympathy for Lacks and at the same time promotes the importance of combatting racism. Namely, the story focuses on the need to recognize the humanity of oppressed groups, especially African American women, who have been subjected to a variety of injustices, the denial of their dignity and autonomy being one of the most egregious examples.
that take place in all similar cases.In February 2009, state police found 26-year-old Kenzie Houk, who was eight months pregnant, in her bed with a bullet through her head. Jordan Brown, the son of the victim’s fiancé, is one of the youngest suspects in the country to be charged with murder. According to Heide (2021), juvenile murder arrests in the United States increased dramatically from 1984 to 1993, leading experts to forecast an epidemic of continued violence. Since then, numerous approaches and techniques have been tested to reduce juvenile violence. Nevertheless, they have not provided a highly efficient uniform framework that can assist in mitigating the issue.A wide range of factors should be taken into account when realizing the reasons for such a severe problem in the country. Moreover, a dedicated analysis is needed to realize the effectiveness of the already existing programs and institutions aimed at reducing the risks of violent crime among juveniles. Furthermore, the issue of recidivism should be widely discussed, as preventing it has always been considered one of the primary goals of the institutions that work with juvenile criminals. A large number of evidence-based practices are to be considered when providing the best solutions that can help develop a uniform approach to the issue in all states.
Directed by the American film producer and director Martin Scorsese, The Irishman is a 2019 film that tells the story of the typical operations and life of members of gang families and groups in the mid-20th century. The film is based on Charles Brandt’s 2004 novel I Hear You Paint Houses . Specifically, the film is based on the memories of Frank Sheeran, an elderly Irish-American man who served in the Second World War before becoming a hitman for the Mafia groups in America. Sheeran, when in a nursing home, recounts the events during his time as a hitman in the 1950s and thereafter. From his recounts, the film shows the events that surrounded the operations, relationships, and lives of the gang families during the period. Throughout the film, the director uses various cinematic approaches to tell the story and create meaning. Signs are intensively used in the film to create meaning in various scenes and scenarios. In the same way, the film portrays the application of the cinematic approach, with composition, camera, costumes, effects, hair and makeup, set design, and color used to tell the story from Sheeran’s recounts.Signs are important means of conveying meaning in various aspects of human life and relationships. As the theory of semiotics states, films use signs to signify or covey meanings through the various things that humans typically employ. Words, body language, gestures, pictures, letters, and visual illustrations are some of the various methods that humans use to convey messages. Combinations of these signs help the filmmakers effectively convey
meanings and messages.Like most modern films, The Irishman demonstrates the use of these signs in addition to codes and conventions to convey meaning in the same way that words and languages are used to construct meaning in communication. At the petrol station scene where Sheeran first meets Russel Bufalino, there are some signs that he is not meeting a common businessman but a shrewd, cunning, and dangerous individual. Bufalino’s body language, when explaining the mechanical problem involving Sheeran’s car, is suggestive of a member of the Mafia, but Sheeran cannot notice at this time. Here, Bufalino tells Sheeran, “you are back in business, kid” ( The Irishman ), yet Sheeran is around 56 years and almost the same age as Bufalino. These words, when analyzed from an in-depth perspective, are a sign that Bufalino is a boss somewhere and leads an influential group. In addition, the quick way in which Bufalino finds an answer to the mechanical problem in Sheeran’s truck is a sign suggesting his shrewdness and ability to lead, which are seen later in the film.Similarly, in the Friendly Lounge scenario when Sheeran meets Skinny Razor Dutillio, some signs signify the other type of business that the group operates. Sheeran is delivering meat to the hotel that is owned by Dutillio. During their meeting, Skinny Razor’s body language signifies that he is a tough guy not just in business but probably in other aspects of life. For instance, he changes his face and looks straight into Sheeran’s eyes when a delivery man tells him,
“I supply steak… the best steak” ( The Irishman ). As if to mean something different, Skinny Razor looks directly into Sheeran’s eyes and says, “you do?” ( The Irishman ) and then looks at the others and laughs a little as if he is not interested in the business. Rather than discussing the business, Skinny Razor tells Sheeran that they will talk later. All these words and body language suggest that he is not interested in the meat business, but probably another different form of venture. Furthermore, there is a background piece of music that is playing during the meeting. When Sheeran is leaving the Friendly Lounge, some background music plays with the words, “you better go back to your used-to-be place” ( The Irishman ). These words signify the possibility that the meeting will take Sheeran to another kind of life that is not good.In addition, in the same scene, a flashback shows Dutillio back in 1945. Here, the audience is introduced to the kind of violence that will probably follow and dominate the story. A sign of a razor blade used to mercilessly cut the neck of a chicken is quite frightening. Dutillio uses a straight razor to cut the chicken’s neck and immediately blood splashes into his face. The sadist Dutillio gives a satisfied look on his blood-spattered face, showing signs of ruthlessness. The blood also spatters into the walls and the workers continue their work as usual. These aspects are used as signs to signify the kind of people that Sheeran
will be dealing with and their characters. Dutillio is a sadist and violent individual who is ready to kill humans as a hitman on hire. The splattered blood on the wall signifies the meaning of the euphemism “painting houses”, which is used in the film to mean the work of hitmen killing people on hire.During the second meeting, again in the Friendly Lounge, the film director uses additional signs to show that the two men have met before and have even conducted some business together. Unlike the first meeting, the second meeting is relatively relaxed and both Sheeran and Dutillio demonstrate body languages that signify their friendship. Both men are seated at the table eating steaks, which signifies that they have even done some business together. It is a sign that Sheeran has joined the group and is part of the dealings common with the Mafia in the black market. The audience comes to learn later that Sheeran was stealing meat from his employer to supply it to Dutillio and other members of the gang at a lower price, allowing them to increase their profitability.Apart from the use of signs, the film director also uses cinematic approaches to make meaning. Costumes, when used in films, are important ways of creating meanings and themes. In The Irishman , different costumes are used for different scenarios to create various meanings. In the introduction part of the film, Sheeran is wearing a leather jacket, jeans, and a loose hat. He appears casual, less presentable, and more of a low-class
individual. It also appears that he wears the same kind of clothes during the different appearances- first at the petrol station and later at the Friends Lounge. The director uses this approach to portray Sheeran as an old and poor person who is striving to meet his daily needs. It also suggests that he is ready to take additional jobs as long as he increases his income. He appears in white aprons only when he is transferring steaks of meat from his van to the customer’s premises.On the contrary, the members of the Mafia are well dressed, clean, and well-kept. Their leaders like Dutillio, Bufallio, Jimmy Hoffa, and Angelo Bruno are all in black, blue, or dark suits, with colored ties. In most scenarios, they are in these costumes even when participating in parties in bars and lounges. This suggests that they are members of an organized group that has codes of conduct or specific behaviors that each must follow and which define the culture of the setting.It is also imperative to understand how the filmmakers used the costumes approach to portray the changing times in the story. As the film continues, the audience realizes that there are multiple scenarios spanning over decades, given that the story is told in a flashback. In this case, characters change with time, beginning in the late 1940s and ending in the late 20th century. In the 1940s and 1950s scenarios, the characters are wearing clothes that reflect their times. For example, most of the characters living in the 1940s
and 1950s, as well as early 1960s, are depicted with hats and coats. However, as time moves, the costumes change significantly to reflect the popular designs of their times. In the 1960s and 1970s, the characters wearing less formal clothing and hats are not common, as an example. Women are portrayed in long dresses during these periods but as time goes on, most women’s clothes change to shorter skirts that are tight to portray the dynamism in the clothing culture of the time.The use and manipulation of the camera is another important cinematic approach that filmmakers use to achieve meaning and convey themes. In this film, camera-specific aspects were applied in different scenarios to achieve the objective. Specifically, camera movement makes a large part of the film aesthetic. In many scenarios, the cameras remain fixed to ensure that they focus on the object, person, or point of interest. The cameraman composes each shot for the most visual impact. It is worth noting that the entire story is told in flashbacks based on Sheeran’s memories. The stories revolve around the unknown, underworld figures that occurred in history, including pervasive crime, the union movement, and assassinations of people, including the president. Achieving this objective required the camera to be changed each time to ensure that the shot is finessed for maximum impact. In addition, the camera soars over the scenes, taking everything, before it sweeps down into a single shot of the person or aspect of interest. It appears that such technologies or utilities and techno cranes and
the old models of the time. Sheeran’s truck is a small manual lorry that can be ignited by simply connecting wires on the plugs near the engine rather than using an ignition key. In the background, one can see old model saloon cars packed or passing, some bearing the manufacturer’s old logos such as that of Chevrolet. In the same way, the steak shop scenario is designed to reflect the common views of the time. For example, there is no electronic money and all transactions are in cash. In addition, papers are signed with seals as the official stamp, which reflects the common methods of conducting business in the 1940s.Based on this analysis, it is evident that the filmmakers in The Irishman used multiple cinematic approaches to develop a story that spans decades. The filmmaker’s use of signs is evident throughout the story, given that some themes and meanings are hidden but clues are given through signs. In addition, the film makes use of cinematographic approaches to reflect the different times the story depicts. Scenes are designed to reflect the common things one would expect to find in a real-life scenario during a specific period. Achieving this objective required the film developers to design costumes common during each period. In addition, the scenes are designed in such a way that they make the viewer feel connected with the specific time in history. As time changes, the filmmaker changes the design for the scenes and costumes to reflect the common culture of each specific historical period.
IntroductionDeveloping leadership qualities is helpful for any person, but not everyone is successful in this matter. Most executives have achieved heights not only through luck, connections, or natural talent – most of their achievements are the result of hard work. I have to evaluate myself as a leader in this work, backing up my opinion with an outside perspective and well-known approaches. It is important to note how the leader approaches the issue of evaluating himself, with the same responsibility he will treat the evaluation of his employees. Self-awareness and critical thinking are essential skills of any leader, so how much my own assessment matches up with the feedback from other people is also an important indicator.EvaluationSelf-EvaluationFor self-assessment, I used questionnaires that have already proven themselves in this area. These include the Emotional and Social Competence Questionnaire (ESCI), which reflects aspects of emotional intelligence and the ability to see your strengths (Park & Faerman, 2019). Before the test, I noted to myself my strengths in communicating with people: adaptability, critical thinking, self-control, and inspiration of the interlocutor. The difficulty confirmed my high achievement in communication skills. Flexibility, coupled with constant control, makes it easy to approach any person while keeping the main goals and objectives to yourself. This ability does not allow me to leave the intended topic in dialogue or negotiations until a compromise or consensus is reached. In addition, I always try to support the interlocutor, even if he comes to me with bad news. A person has the right to make mistakes, and
you need to be able to admit them. My strong point is that I can give a person a push at the moment when they are depressed.The second questionnaire with which I made a self-assessment is the assessment of personal value. If the first questionnaire showed my natural communication abilities, then the second questionnaire indicates what is behind my behavior (Smikle, 2019). There are three main styles of leadership: authoritarian, participatory, and delegative (Akpoviroro et al., 2018). My style, according to the test results, is focused on accessibility, which corresponds to participatory leadership. This style requires high levels of emotional intelligence, but it also guarantees the highest productivity among all types in the workplace (Akpoviroro et al., 2018). My power is not an obstacle or a source of fear for employees – it is just a tool to reveal their strengths. The test results showed that flexibility is closely related to creative thinking and creativity. Finding opportunities for your development allows you to demonstrate a vitality that energizes other people.FeedbackI received feedback from two of my former colleagues and family members. Having brought the data to statistics, I got that people note sympathy and the ability to give strength even in the most challenging situation. This fact is a consequence of flexibility and adaptability against the background of high levels of emotional intelligence. However, some of those taking part in the survey fear that I am a talented manipulator. Empathy and inspiration can direct a person towards their own goals and desires. This fear is very
The country under review is Mexico the way it was portrayed by its famous citizen – Mexican poet and writer Octavio Paz. The author presents his perspective on Mexican lifestyle and culture in his influential essay The Labyrinth of Solitude . This analysis would focus on the essay’s Chapter 3 dedicated to fiestas in general and the Day of the Dead in particular, which reflect many national traits of Mexicans.Fiesta or celebration is an extremely important cultural concept for Mexicans. According to Paz (1961), their “calendar is crowded with fiestas” (p.47). One may argue that every culture has holidays, and there is nothing special about Mexicans also having such. However, Paz identifies several peculiarities in how his compatriots celebrate and perceive their festivities compared to citizens of other countries. The writer also comments on the specific reasons for Mexicans’ passion for exuberant ceremonies and festive occasions.Life experience often influences artists’ works, and Paz was not an exception. His family had suffered a lot during Mexican Civil War and was quite poor (Brittanica). However, Paz had access to his grandfather’s big library, where he learned a lot and later managed to get an education and started publishing his poems (Brittanica). What is important to note is that Paz visited and worked in several countries, including Spain, France, and the US. It allowed him to look at his homeland both from inside as its citizen and from outside as a person, who had contacts with foreigners, witnessed other lifestyles, and learned about different outlooks. One can learn more
about something when one has alternatives to compare it to. The same goes for the culture: one cannot fully appreciate the good things about one’s culture and be critical of bad ones if one knows nothing about others. Therefore, Paz’s view on Mexican culture is so precise and valuable.In Chapter 3 of The Labyrinth of Solitude , Paz explains Mexicans’ love for exuberant rituals, ceremonies, and festive activities. Moreover, he comments on several paradoxes related to Mexican attitudes towards holidays that often puzzle the foreigners. For instance, The Labyrinth of Solitude answers why Mexico wastes so much money on seemingly meaningless and useless celebrations. Another paradox explained by Paz is the weirdly festive and cheerful manner Mexicans celebrate the Day of the Dead.Paz explains the essence and the peculiarities of Mexican fiestas through several cultural concepts. The first one is the appreciation of the present moment. Paz (1961) notes that during celebrations, “time comes to a full stop” and returns to its original form: “the present, in which past and future are reconciled” (pp. 47-48). Fiestas allow Mexicans to enjoy and appreciate what they already have instead of worrying about tomorrow beyond our reach (Paz, 1961). It might sound unpractical, as one should not completely abandon all thoughts and plans concerning the future or valuable memories from the past. However, what one can learn from such an attitude towards time is that excessive worries about the past or the future make people miss important life moments and forget about actually enjoying their life.Another important observation Paz
identities and pretend someone else. As “the customary hierarchies vanish,” everyone becomes equal and liberated during fiestas (Paz, 1961, p. 51). Thus, fiestas can be seen as a way to make people of different social statuses closer to each other.In conclusion, Octavio Paz’s The Labyrinth of Solitude gives the readers a brief overview of Mexican culture and worldview. Mexicans’ attitudes towards fiestas contain valuable lessons: appreciation of the present, the importance of companionship, and free expression of emotions. Mexicans also noticed a magical connection between the opposite life phenomena and used it in their rituals: they waste money to attract them or celebrate death to provoke rebirth. Moreover, fiesta can be considered a small revolution against established norms: all participants lose the acquired statuses but get the sense of equality and companionship, which is difficult to feel in other circumstances.
A tort refers to omission or act that gives rise to harm/injury to another person and amounts to a wrong where a person who was wronged may recover damages (US Legal Inc., n.d.). In this case, the tort that Tom incurred was being hit by a baseball that knocked him out. He was then taken to the hospital as a result of the hit. Another tort was the fact that he lost his possessions when another fan stole his mobile phone and wallet. Finally, the last tort is food poising, but only if Tom can prove that it is because of the food poisoning that he had to stay home for two weeks without working.For the first injury the stadium is liable because we are not told that they have a disclaimer on the tickets that relieve the management from such injuries caused by flying balls (All Law, 2015). Secondly, the theft of his handset and wallet cannot be associated with the stadium, therefore, the stadium is not reliable for the theft of his property, and the person that stole is responsible. Lastly, if Tom can prove that he stayed home for two weeks because of food poisoning, then, the stadium is liable. However, in the case of the concussion liability will not be on the stadium.Finally, with respect to Tom’s case with food poisoning, it does not matter if he bought a ticket or not. By him buying a beer and a hot dog directly from the seller, he legitimately bought it from the stadium and the purchase was isolated from the ticket. However, any other thing that happens such as an accident or sickness as a result of purchases should be legally valid and the stadium still responsible.
Hansberry, Lorraine. A Raisin in the Sun. New York, Vintage, 2004.The Youngers, an African American family, living in Chicago in the 1950s, are the subject of A Raisin in the Sun. When the family is given $10,000 in life insurance money, each member of the family has different ideas about how to spend it. Beneatha wants to go to medical school with the money, but Walter’s older brother wants to build an alcohol store. After their mother, Lena, puts a down payment on a new home, the remaining funds are given to Walter, who is instructed to save up a considerable sum for his sister’s medical school tuition. Against his mother’s desires, he invests the entire sum in his liquor store. The family is looking forward to receiving the insurance payout, which has the potential to turn their long-awaited hopes into reality. However, the Younger family members have opposing ideas and dreams about how best to spend the money, causing friction.Sexton, Anne. “Wanting to Die.” Poetry Foundation, 1981, Web.“Wanting to Die” is a free verse poem with thirty-three lines divided into eleven tercets (three-line stanzas). This poem has been referred to as one of Anne Sexton’s literary suicide notes since it is written in the first person and is presented in a conversational style. With a person who has asked her about suicide, the author addresses the reasons for suicide and the attraction with it in this poetry. The poem opens with a discussion between the author and an unknown interrogator. Sexton captures the spirit of
confessional poetry in this poem, as she honestly exposes her feelings about the connection with death and her ongoing fight with suicide. Though this poem appears to be about death and suicide at first glance, there are multiple examples in it that may be related to drug addiction and the objectives of the drug user. This poem’s tone is generally luridly sad since it creates meticulously black and morbid imagery. Through precise personifications of suicide and death, it immerses the reader in the psyche of the suicidal thought.Sexton, Anne. “Her Kind” Poetry Foundation, 1981, Web.The speaker of “Her Kind” takes on a number of identities that defy stereotypes of femininity, rejecting society’s expectations that women be attractive, nurturing, and obedient in the process. According to the author, being a woman who chooses independence over dependency, self-reliance over familial connections, and death over acquiescence means being viewed as a dangerous outlier—a witch who must be excommunicated. Rather than isolating the woman, this independence provides her with a powerful sense of solidarity with other non-traditional women: she is not alone but one of a kind. The speaker analyzes the various ways patriarchy stuffs women into small boxes in each line of the poem—boxes that the speaker refuses to be bound in. The poem “Her Kind” by Anne Sexton has a calm tone, with no clear-cut scenes or conversation but a strong sense of story, emotion, and imagery. It seems to be a peculiar, wistful reminiscence of a lady who has long since died, bizarre as that may be.
part confessional diary entry to herself. “Daddy” is an attempt to bring the intimate and mystical together. It is frightening, like a strange nursery rhyme about a split personality, a controlled bombardment directed at a father and husband. Plath’s horror and grief are expressed beautifully and ominously in this poem. It blends cheerful echoes of a Mother Goose nursery rhyme with grim World War II resonances.Plath, Sylvia. “Lady Lazarus.” Poets.Org , Harper and Row, 1962, Web.The poem’s title, “Lady Lazarus,” refers to the poem’s speaker and relates to the Biblical narrative of Jesus and his miraculous resurrection of a man called Lazarus. The poem’s speaker claims that she, likewise, has come back to life countless times. The speaker’s wish to die in order to be free of her pain is explored throughout the poem, which continuously returns to the idea of death by fire and the speaker’s power to rise from her own ashes. The poem alludes to the tortured speaker’s many suicide attempts. It also emphasizes the role of tyranny and power in one’s life. The poem also conveys the concepts of perseverance and resurrection. The key themes of this poem are death, sadness, agony, and power. The speaker recounts her unsuccessful suicide attempts and explains why she is irritated.
Article SummaryThe article “ Anopheles stephensi Mosquitoes as Vectors of Plasmodium vivax and P. falciparum, Horn of Africa” by Chali et al. (2019) compared the susceptibility of Plasmodium falciparum and Vivax infection between the An. stephensi and An. arabiensis mosquitoes. The study was conducted in the Awash Sebat Kilo region found in Ethiopia because of its high perennial malaria transmission. An experiment was conducted to establish the difference in infection status between the two species of mosquitoes. Adult An. stephensi and An. arabiensis mosquitoes reared from immature mosquitoes were fed from membrane feeders with fresh blood from the patients attending the Adama clinic. The feeding was done with blood infected with P. vivax and P. falciparum for 7 to 12 days. The mosquitoes’ midgets and salivary glands were dissected to examine the oocysts and sporozoites, respectively. A comparison of the infection status was done using logistic regression analysis. The differences in mosquito sources’ infectivity were examined using the Pitman test. Data analysis was done using the STATA version 13 and GraphPad Prism 5.3.From the 85 aquatic habitats surveyed in the study, 75.3% of the larvae detected were from An. stephensi mosquitoes. The general proportion of blood-fed mosquitoes was higher for An. arabiensis (median 80.5%) than An. stephensi (median 53.5%, p<0.001) (Chali et al., 2019). However, the latter species reported a significantly higher infection with P. vivax (median 75.1%) compared to the former species (median 58.4%, p<0.042). An. stephensi mosquitoes showed higher odds of infection for an individual mosquito (OR=1.99, p<0.001) and higher numbers of oocysts per
infected midgut (median 17) than the counterpart species (median 13, p<0.001). Also, a higher proportion of An. stephensi (51.8%) had a high sporozoite load and odds of detecting high sporozoite intensity from the salivary glands compared to An. arabiensis (31.1%). It was evident from the study that An. stephensi poses a higher risk for increased P. falciparum and P. vivax in Ethiopia compared to An. arabiensis .Article CritiqueStrengthsThe findings in this study contribute immensely to the control of malaria transmission in Ethiopia and Africa. The article has a brief abstract to provide a succinct summary of the content of the study. The introduction part of the article provides a firm sense of what the study is about and develops the background of the research. The study has a clearly stated research design that explains the materials and procedure used. The analysis and results section contains enough details for readers to understand. The use of table and graphs provide a clear representation of the results. The implication of the research results is adequately evaluated, and interpretation is efficient o address the research problem. The concluding section highlights the main points and provides some recommendations based on the research. The study has a wide range of clearly cited works with fully provided bibliographic details.WeaknessesThe article’s title does not state all the variables examined and the relationships between them. The study establishes the difference in infection of Plasmodium falciparum and vivax between the An. stephensi and An. arabiensis . However, the title and abstract of the study do not
to the appearance of a teenager. Mental health: Personal qualities and features such as perfectionism, low self-esteem, and impulsivity are potential factors of anorexia. Career: the chance of anorexia is higher among those who have thinness is a requirement of the profession, like ballerinas, models, gymnasts, and other professionals. Diet: Being passionate about a particular diet can increase the risk of anorexia.The objectives of anorexia treatment include weight recovery, psychological care, and healthy dietary and behavioral patterns. Treatment is selected individually and may include strategies such as nutritional counseling, psychotherapy, family therapy, medication, or hospitalization. The duration of treatment and its consequences are individual and depend on the time of the disorder, its severity, the chosen treatment, and adherence to it. With the proper treatment, recovery from anorexia is possible, but the risk of relapse remains high, highlighting the importance of compliance with medical recommendations.
IntroductionWritten in the middle of the twentieth century, the novel A Confederacy of Dunces remains relevant these days. The book unveils some of the features of the people who cannot find their place in their communities or human society at large. Ignatius J. Reilly, the protagonist of the story, is one of such individuals incapable of fitting in. Some may note that the man is just one of the thousand inhabitants of New Orleans trying to live his life and become happy (“Literary Journeys”). At that, he is not an eccentric man with slightly standing out peculiarities but a person suffering from a mental health issue with vivid symptoms. Ignatius can hardly become a part of his community, although he has to try hard due to economic struggles that started after his irresponsible behavior.It has been widely discussed that Ignatius shares many traits in common with the author of the book as John Kennedy Toole also failed to become a successful member of his community and American society (MacLauchlin). At that, while the writer committed suicide, unable to fit in, he gives Ignatius a chance to succeed (Henninger 782). Ignatius J. Reilly can be seen as a good illustration of the behaviors and choices of people with antisocial personality disorder who are doing their best to find a place in their communities.Ignatius and His Antisocial Personality at Home and in the CommunityIndulging Oneself as a Sign of the DisorderIndulging oneself is one of the most conspicuous traits of Ignatius, which is also one of the major
symptoms of antisocial personality disorder. Individuals diagnosed with this health condition tend to indulge themselves and try to have a hedonist way of life as they pay little attention to other people’s feelings or needs (Maass 9). Such persons try to ensure that they have everything they need (money, food, and other people’s attention), and they attain this goal even if it happens at the expense of others. People with this diagnosis believe their needs have to be satisfied while other things do not matter.This trait is displayed in Ignatius in many ways, including his eating disorder and unwillingness to earn his living. Ignatius compares the need to make money and get a job with being “thrown out again into the abyss” (Toole 86). He prefers reading his medieval texts, writing letters and reflections, as well as daydreaming and watching movies (Leighton 211). He cares little about his mother’s struggles and the fact that she supports him financially, although he is already a middle-aged man. His attitude towards food and drinks also shows that he has few or no limits. The man believes that “the lack of food… channels all of one’s better impulses” (Toole 132). He pays no attention to other people’s needs but concentrates on his personal comfort, be it good food or proper clothes. Clearly, being such a self-centered person suggests that the man has symptoms of antisocial personality disorder.Arrogance and Deceit as Common SymptomsOther common symptoms of antisocial personality disorder are arrogance and deceitfulness. Being arrogant is closely related to indulging oneself
as arrogant people find themselves superior to others, which justifies, in their opinion, their focus on their needs. People with antisocial personality disorder are characterized by a high degree of arrogance, which is associated with antisocial behavior (Stanton and Zimmerman 439). Such people do not find it necessary to follow or even listen to other people’s recommendations or warnings. Individuals with this type of psychological issue do not follow any external norms and regulations, even if these are crimes that can lead to punishment (fine or even imprisonment).Ignatius has these traits and breaks several rules, norms, and laws throughout the story. Instead of selling products, he consumes them, which is, of course, an unexpected behavioral pattern (Toole 165). He does not even try to do his job well as he is rude and insults potential customers. Instead of trying to make a good start and earn money, Ignatius has a daily plan to sell “five or six hot dogs quickly, park the wagon somewhere, and get to that theater” (Toole 164). He is not a diligent or responsible employee, so he can hardly have a decent or, eventually, any job. Moreover, he mocks other people’s desire to go up the professional ladders and become successful in this sphere (Slepov 14). This attitude is another illustration of Ignatius’s antisocial behavior. He believes he is too good to live the life of ordinary people who think about practical things. Ignatius dreams about the perfection of Medieval society and the corruption of the modern times, although he is completely
dependent on the fruit of the twentieth century with its hot dogs, bathtubs, and cinema.He is also ready to break laws and accuse others of the crime he commits. His fraudulent activity is a result of his arrogance and lack of attention to rules. He believes that “the world understood only strength and force” and copies his boss’s signature with no remorse (Toole 55). He is remorseless when accusing an innocent woman of his crime, which is also, from his standpoint, is a sign of strength and power. Clearly, he is disrespectful to older people and the representatives of the law. This trait is displayed on the very first pages of the book when Ignatius has a heated argument with a patrolman. All these attitudes and behaviors show that the protagonist of the book in question is willing to act in an antisocial manner.Relationships with His MotherOne of the most illustrative aspects of Ignatius’s life in terms of his psychological issue is his relationship with his mother. Antisocial behavior is often violent, but it is always destructive (DeLamater et al. 345). It destroys people’s relationships, it deteriorates persons’ social status, and it also ruins one’s personality. Ignatius is far from being a loving or caring son who can be a mother’s pride. He is an abusive and manipulative middle-aged child who expects full financial and practical support from his mother. He is so selfish and arrogant that he sees his role as the one to “to keep her in her place” (Toole 5). He is verbally
abusive with his mother and does not truly appreciate anything she does for him. He is also manipulative as he tends to emphasize that it is her responsibility to address all the challenges the family has to face as she is his parent. Clearly, such a position is not appropriate for a responsible middle-aged man.Moreover, he often thinks his mother causes harm and distress while he is a loving and caring son. For instance, he stresses in his writings that “that people learn to hate those who help them,” which is “a truism of human nature” (Toole 135). The man truly believes that he keeps his mother safe while he is actually causing trouble and distress to the old woman who needs care, understanding, and support.Again, instead of trying to build proper relationships with his mother, Ignatius prefers to pay no attention to the old woman. The inability and unwillingness to develop relationships with others, including family members, is another sign of antisocial personality disorder (Maass 9). Such people alienated themselves even from their closest relatives. Their brutality and arrogance make their close ones distance themselves from them as well.Romantic RelationshipsIgnatius’s relationships with women are quite illustrative as well because the man in his late thirties has had no proper romantic engagement with anyone. The most prominent sexual link to a female is his attachment to a woman in a picture. Importantly, the fact that she is holding a book with medieval texts seems the most attractive trait in the entire image for Ignatius (Toole 166).
The “brilliant” nude woman must have some “new and valuable insights,” which form the basis of Ignatius’s interest. In simple terms, instead of trying to develop relationships with a real person with all complexities and associated efforts, the protagonist chooses to chase after an image in a pornographic picture. No other woman deserves his attention, in his opinion, which is a sign of his arrogance and super ego.The only real woman Ignatius has at least some kind of relationship with romantic grounds is Myrna Minkoff. They tend to write letters to each other discussing political and social issues, and the man manages to seem a potent intellectual who is decisive and committed. However, the reason for being physically close with Myrna is Ignatius’s desire to escape from his mother’s house or the mental health institution. Myrna, according to Ignatius’s plan, will be the source of his material wellbeing, which is put straightforwardly with a short phrase, “Do you have any money on you?” (Toole 221). Again, the protagonist chooses the easiest way and remains a manipulative man pursuing his hedonistic goals to indulge himself.Behavior in the CommunityIn addition to the professional life that illustrates Ignatius’s conduct in the community, it is necessary to consider the man’s involvement in the political life of New Orleans. This aspect is depicted in a satiric way, which sheds more light on the protagonist’s attitudes towards other people and society at large (Pugh 39). Ignatius makes an impression that he wants to lead a civil rights movement to make the life
of a vulnerable group better and restore justice in the corrupt United States. One of his writings is one of the brightest illustrations of his true intentions. For others, he wants to display that he has made the “decision which reveals a militancy, depth, and strength quite unexpected in so gentle a nature” (Toole 76). However, in reality, he is only concerned about one idea and writes to himself that “powerful civil rights organizations will no doubt cover me with laurels” (Toole 76). He wants to be glorified, and he finds quite an easy (as it seems to him) way to achieve his objectives.The central outcome of antisocial personality disorder tends to be the inability of the affected person to fit in, which is the case with Ignatius. Toole depicted the protagonist of his story as a person somewhat torn between the world of the modern American and Medieval societies (Freese 358). Freese states that Ignatius is unable to adapt to the concepts of cause and effect as he often resorts to such factors as Fortuna (358). Ignatius exclaims such phrases as “vicious trick is Fortuna playing on me” many times throughout the book (and even within a day) (Toole 164). However, his being unfit is not caused by his inability but his unwillingness to adapt. Ignatius is too arrogant and selfish to even make an attempt to be a part of something bigger (for example, family, community, or society). He is the biggest and most important phenomenon in the world, in his opinion. Ignatius does
not want to fit in as he prefers to fit society into his picture of the world.Possible Causes of the Disorder Explaining Ignatius’s BehaviorsMultiple factors affect people’s mental health, including but not confined to genetics, family history, and environment. An antisocial personality disorder is also usually caused by a combination of factors with genetics and environment being critical aspects (Maass 6). As far as Ignatius’s case is concerned, it is difficult to estimate the extent to which his childhood experiences influenced his personality. However, hereditary characteristics of the protagonist’s mental health are rather apparent.His mother is also an indulgent and manipulative person, which suggests that she is affected by the same health issue. She drinks quite a lot, although her son’s arguments about her being an alcoholic are too poorly grounded. At that, her alcohol consumption causes considerable difficulties as the huge fine they are to pay is a result of her careless behavior. The way she and her son went to their car and the ways she left the parking spot and wrecked the nearby building suggest that she was under the influence but still decided to drive (Toole 18). The old lady does not want to restrict herself in her consumption of something she finds delicious (such as alcohol), which is a symptom of antisocial personality disorder.Mrs. Reilly is also trying to manipulate other people, such as her potential partner, neighbors, police officers, and her son. In her relationships with her son, she is victimized, but she is also willing to make easy choices.
He believes that people are not worth his effort, although he attempts to become a leader of a movement. Clearly, this movement is not about making some groups’ life better, but it is all about his desire to be famous and glorified. All these traits are signs of antisocial personality disorder that can be caused by different factors.Since the author does not describe or give any details regarding Ignatius’s childhood, his family story can hardly be used as an explanation of the man’s mental health status. At that, the behaviors of his mother shed light on the roots of Ignatius’s personality. Mrs. Reilly is an indulgent and manipulative person, which are also symptoms of antisocial personality disorder. The woman is more successfully integrated into the community, although her irresponsible behavior causes a lot of trouble for her and her son. Thus, it is possible to note that Ignatius’s antisocial personality disorder could be inherited.Irrespective of the nature of the disorder, Ignatius is an illustration of a person with a certain psychological issue. His mental health condition makes him develop inappropriate behavioral patterns that are ill-accepted in American society of the middle of the twentieth century. He sees himself as a genius that is misunderstood and opposed by the rest of the world that is completely damaged. Ignatius cannot find his place in his community, so he chooses to escape. Clearly, even the trip with Myrna can hardly help the man escape from himself and fit in.
IntroductionApple Inc. is a multinational tech company based in California, the US. In terms of revenue, Apple is the largest technology firm, with approximately $365.8 billion as of June 2022. The company has been known for its market capitalization, whereby it has sold many computers and mobile phones. The company was founded in 1976 by Steve Jobs and others such as Ronald Wayne and Wozniak Steve. The company’s success has been through digital innovation that matches modern customer trends in technology. The common products in the market include iPhone, Apple Watch, iPad, and AirTag, among others. Apple has endured global success due to the maximization of devices’ capability by adding value to the internal structure of any handset it makes. There have been key marketing plans, and the quality of products makes consumers get interested in the products.Description of the OrganizationApple designs and manufactures smartphones, personal computers, tablets, and other products and services, as seen in Figure 1. The company operates on various platforms, such as App Store, which allows clients to discover and download applications, books, music, and other digital content. Through digital subscriptions, Apple has succeeded in offering digital content, such as through Apple Arcade, Apple Music, Apple TV, and Apple Fitness (Smith, 2020). Apple sells all these products to a range of markets whereby individual consumers, small-scale businesses, and government agencies have been key customers. It is important to note that Apple has been regarded as one of the companies that created a class regarding what is offered in the market. Many consumers
have raised the company’s reputation in social media, which has given a recommendable perception towards consumerism.The firm is known for marketing its products through commercial ads and print media. The company has an official store and website that assists in leveraging the marketing of its phone, laptops, and other products. The target audience for apple is high-end product users, and that is why the company has been associated with premium branding that matches high customer services. Apple delivers innovative, up-to-date items that fit the market (Hern, 2018). With the current metrics put in place, Apple is gaining a high volume of sales which gives the company stability in the market. Therefore, the company is one of the competing firms globally regarding digital products, and the management is doing all it can to explore the market more.Figure 1: Apple’s products (Licsi, 2022).One of the major moves that helped Apple explore the market right is the foresight to beat the competition. The firm identifies customers’ needs before the customers discover what they require. For instance, the introduction of iTunes saw a major shift in keeping music organized in a given platform. Other key tools include a voice-activated assistant enabled through company research and development (R&D) (Hern, 2018). Simplicity is another way that Apple has maximized to ensure it penetrates and gains significant returns on revenue from its sales. In this case, the interface for most of its devices is easy to utilize, and users can access various programs through their handsets, where most of them require simple logic.The
Organization’s StructureApple’s organizational structure is hierarchical and functional, where the chief executive officer (CEO) is the overall manager of the business. As shown in Figure 2 below, Apple’s organizational structure shows Tim Cook, the CEO, working with the senior vice president, chief operating officer, and chief financial officer (Livesay, 2022). Apple is a public company that shareholders own where it has over 16 billion shares as of 2022, and interested people have taken the opportunity to own the shares (Livesay, 2022). The aspect of a hierarchically organized structure is seen through the CEO assuming the highest rank in the company. The company comprises more than 132,000 full-time employees who facilitate the delivery of duties and products (Livesay, 2022). The benefit of using this structure is that it enables Apple to control all avenues of business through tight manning of operations, transactions, and interactions in and outside the company.Figure 2: Apple’s organizational structure (Dudovskiy, 2021).The other structure is seen in a product-based grouping that has contributed to the success of the organization’s business strategies. The multinational giant firm has divided its operations into subgroups such as services which include App Store, ApplePay, and Apple Music (Licsi, 2022). The other sets of grouping include Mac, iPhone, and iPad. This structuring of products is important because it enables empirical market segmentation, which means each item can be sold using a specific framework according to the customer’s desires. A product-based group is known as other products, which consists of Apple TV, iWatch, displays, storage handsets, and headphones (Livesay, 2022). These
are more connectivity than computing, and many users, more so the youth, have loved purchasing from the store.The company’s organizational structure gives its business model, which incorporates collaboration between various groups and divisions. Apple combines various business models such as direct sales, franchising, and advertised-based strategy (Zhang, 2022). Apple Inc. maintains that there should be an intensive and effective partnership with other groups within the company to create a unique portfolio that enables mass purchasing from different buyers. The firm’s board of directors (BODs) comprises eight members with distinct leadership roles within the company and helps interlink the divisions to maximize high sales volumes within a given market. Three members act as CEOs, while two are former personnel who occupy the chairman role (Pereira, 2022). Some key people in Apple’s BOD include former US vice president Albert Gore, former Boeing Company James Bell president, and BlackRock cofounder, Susan Wagner.The other structure is evident in the functionality aspect of the company, which adds to its business model. The perspective allows the firm to neglect short-term financial targets when developing new items in the market that require significant investment (Zhang, 2022). Through functionality structure, Apple has been basing its bonuses and R&D on financial performance rather than funds from a specific product. Apple executives consider functionality moves a holistic approach that navigates deep into the market. In that way, the firm grows its reputation, hence its business’s success.Range of External Influences That Might Impact GrowthMany factors influence whether or not a company will grow in a competitive market.
The first matter determining Apple’s growth is a technology evident through microservices architecture and artificial intelligence. There have been highly innovative digital ideas that impact how business is done. For instance, Apple has developed Macs, iPods, and Apple Store applications due to the modern technology boost that is heavily employed to connect customers and the product (Lombardo, 2019). Adobe Systems has contributed to Apple’s growth due to the advanced software management metrics that it comes with.Additionally, access to the website revolutionized everything, including Apple. It boosted its revenue by 30% after many buyers’ adoption of the internet (Lombardo, 2019). Technological advancements are witnessed every day, and Apple stands on sustainable ground since users have turned to be digitally active, positively impacting its business. Apple incorporated AI features in its phones through face-recognition elements, fingerprint sensors, and native sleep tracking. These ideas power the company to fit in modern business zones by utilizing technology (Gopani, 2022). With continued changes courtesy of tech, Apple can be assured of getting significant sales that will improve the company’s brands.The other external factor that influences Apple’s growth is sociocultural aspects. The rising use of mobile phones increased dependency on digital handsets and changed the perception of the use of computers (Lombardo, 2019). These opportunities grant Apple a chance to grow because product demand goes high, meaning the company will have a market to deliver the required items. For instance, it is common to find students using smartphones and laptops in colleges and universities globally, and in most cases, Apple’s products are
practice of the organization in terms of cultural safety.While the statement is adequate, there are two considerable flaws. First, the organization does not describe how the principles of cultural safety were implemented in practice. Thus, it is recommended that CCEH demonstrates examples of how the commitment to cultural safety led to improvements in everyday practice. Second, the organization puts an increased emphasis on cultural competence instead of cultural humility. Unlike cultural competency, cultural humility acknowledges the inability to understand the complicated nature of a person’s culture (Greene-Moton & Minkler, 2020). At the same time, cultural humility makes a commitment to learning about the culture of other people. Thus, it is recommended that the organization puts a greater emphasis on cultural humility.If I were the leader of the organization, I would try to find a medium for communicating with some of the groups of younger homeless people in Connecticut. For instance, the organization acknowledges that more than 30% of the population served are young Hispanics (CCEH, 2015). This population may have trouble communicating with service providers. However, if the organization asked a bilingual young adult to communicate with the population, it would have a greater effect on the outcomes. Such a practice would improve the organization’s cultural humility practices.
since people are constantly exposed to hate, negative comments or publications, and fake influencers.To elaborate, impression management theory has become real since people try to become their better selves just to make a good impression on people they meet online. This fake image on social media can harm a person’s self-esteem as people may feel insecure compared to the influencers’ or supermodels’ content on social platforms. Goffman’s theory on social exchange is also apparent in the modern world, considering that people tend to quickly end relationships with people that seem to be of no benefit to them (Barbalet, 2020). Based on the aforementioned concepts, it is apparent that social media nowadays is entirely fake and toxic to users since it worsens their mental health and self-esteem.However, the abundance of social media platforms presents numerous options for users because every application is used for different purposes. For instance, Tik Tok is mainly used to exchange funny videos with friends, while Twitter is a public diary where one can present opinions on crucial topics or not so much to the followers. Consequently, it is clear that the communication style between users is dissimilar on different social media platforms. Overall, the application’s options can also limit the types of interaction as, for example, people can use some media only for texting and others to video call or record voice messages.
Interacting with patients is simultaneously an advantage and a challenge for nursing practitioners because the outcomes are difficult to predict. Indeed, problems with certain populations might occur in NPs practice if the beneficiaries of an organization have specific needs or socio-economic statuses (Curley, 2020). For instance, groups with low-income levels and difficulties affording primary health care require a unique communicational approach. The PICOT statement related to the issue in NPs practice involving specific beneficiaries can be connected to their tendency to skip the appointments. The question is: “In impoverished patients, what is the efficiency of treatment if they refuse to attend follow-ups, compared with ones who had a timely return visit?” This paper aims to describe the selected NPs practice issue, provide a literature review and recommend a specific change to influence the problem.Patients skip appointments for multiple reasons, and practitioners can impact their decision-making to improve the situation. Furthermore, the practice problem is severe because missed follow-ups worsen the effectiveness of treatment, making additional financial burdens if the clients’ conditions worsen (Arpey et al., 2017). NPs must identify why the impoverished beneficiaries refuse to re-attend their physicians, retrieve the aspects they can influence, develop and implement solutions in their interaction with patients. Conducting research and literature review is a workable strategy to gather sufficient evidence necessary for decision-making.Modern scholarly articles reveal that the reasons for the impoverished populations to skip the follow-up appointment are specific and address their financial abilities and life priorities. The lack of attendance occurs due to clients’ forgetfulness, language barrier, insufficient
and improving organizational strategies such as phone reminders.A change in the impoverished patients’ perception of follow-up appointments is complicated and includes multiple aspects that require revision. My recommendation for NPs willing to influence the problem is to adjust their communication with the selected beneficiaries and enable physicians and administrators to participate. The concept of population-based problem solving must address specific characteristics, and for the impoverished clients, the costs of transportation, insurance, and priority setting are to be considered (Curley, 2020). I would also emphasize that NPs must clearly explain the consequences of missing a follow-up. Besides, clinical office managers’ activities must include reminders for patients with severe or chronic conditions to avoid forgetting about their visit.Nursing practice issues can relate to specific populations and require unique evidence-based solutions. The literature review suggested that unstable financial situation, lack of education, and understanding of follow-ups’ importance cause skipping a visit. NPs can change the current situation by adjusting their communication, improving patient education, and encouraging managers and physicians to participate. Dealing with the selected practice issue is beneficial for organizations with an impoverished population.
The novel Atonement , written by Ian McEwan, touches upon the topic of the significance of writing. The author uses various literary devices to convey many themes within the novel. Using the omniscient narrator, the author strives to show a person’s emotions who tries to atone the sins through writing. The image of the main character of the novel, Briony, shows how the writing can help people to accept their own sins. The author uses the different types of irony and omniscient narrator mode to reflect the idea of alleviating grief and guilt through writing.The significance of writing and narrative to coping with guilt, loss, or trauma is expressed primarily through two literary devices. The first one is the irony: situational and verbal. The irony is a satirical technique by which the writer evaluates the subject involving double meaning. The truth lies not in the statement but in its opposite meaning. The author uses verbal irony to convey the emotions of the characters in more detail. “Now you’re sticking to the salad while the rest of us are suffering” (121). This type of irony is used to condemn the narrator’s behavior. Such writing structure is a way to plead guilty in the actions causing the sufferings to others. “When the wounded were screaming, you dreamed of sharing a little house somewhere” (227). This quote also contains the narrator’s conviction to her actions against the loved ones.Creating a novel, the narrator wants to grant characters the opportunity to live lives they had no chance to live. The
mode. In such novels, the narrator simultaneously acts as a character and identifies himself with the first person pronoun “I”. Such a narrator makes it possible to effectively express the thoughts and feelings of the narrator, hidden and inaccessible to an external observer, opening the way to various forms of self-observation. “How can a novelist achieve atonement when, with her absolute power of deciding outcomes, she is also God?” (325). This example shows that the narrator considers writing as an alleviating measure helping to overcome the loss. However, the narration mode allows the reader to understand that the narrator wants to be with the loved ones and cannot overcome being separated with them. Actually, the reader realizes that the atonement was impossible for the narrator. Through writing, she devotes her life to the people whose lives she ruined. Even though Briony’s mental trauma cannot be potentially atoned, she alleviates her grief and guilty through writing.The discussed issue is vital for me personally and the whole society in terms of understanding the writer’s emotions. Life is uncontrollable, and many events that haunt people all their lives may occur. Everyone finds their own way to overcome the traumas. Writing is the perfect opportunity to stay faithful to loved ones and express one’s regrets. It is morally relieving when the audience reads and accepts the author’s confessions. For me, writing may help stay morally stable and remember losses and tragedies, which is vital for the ethical development and cultural heritage transferring of society.
In the craft beer industry, as in many others, there are strategically essential components of the macro environment. These valuable components include the degree of increase in total beer consumption, the growth rate of beer exports to various countries, and shifts in the propensity to drink. It is also important to note the importance of such indicators as expanded business management and its dissemination of the potential increase in business costs due to the establishment of the labor law. The broader use of Internet technologies and their implementation, demonstrating an increase in the free access of buyers, also have a significant role.Competition in the craft beer industry is relatively high due to its increased popularity. This is because an increasing number of craft breweries have begun to introduce more business transactions into their practice (Garavaglia & Swinnen, 2017). The bargaining power and leverage of buyers and rivalry between sellers have the most potent force, and the competitive pressure from makers of substitute products is the weakest. Craft beer producers and customer demand have the most significant impact on the attractiveness of the industry and its potential profitability.The strategic map of the craft beer industry may be such that bottling plants have limited distribution. Global producers mostly have international distribution and a low or insignificant role in pricing. Moreover, I believe that this strategic group has the greatest advantage. Regional producers are located everywhere while offering prices within a small or high assortment.Key factors that may determine the success of a start-up craft brewery are access to and mitigation of distribution issues, brand image and ‘craft beer’ niche, implementation of social media for marketing, and sufficient sales volume to achieve scale economies in marketing expenditures.The first recommendation for a small craft business is a thorough development of a strategy. Risk management is a crucial aspect to avoid future problems. Also of value is a marketing strategy using information technology, since the Internet is used by most of the population and is an effective tool for advertising.Despite significant technological improvements, the craft beer industry may face serious obstacles. Firstly, it can harm nature and excessive energy consumption and emissions of waste and by-products. These environmental problems can seriously slow down business. Competition is also of great importance with other craft beer producers and beer beverage producers in general.
of the research and treatment they have to undergo. Improving the efficiency of the health care system is a policy priority for European countries.In today’s world, patients expect adequate professional skills from doctors and high standards of interpersonal communication. In recent years, they have become more aware of medical options and the kind of care they can receive at specific medical organizations. Patients are increasingly comparing options at different clinics, learning a lot of information about doctors and medical services, as well as publicly available information about diseases (Calnan, 2010). The shortcomings of medical care, not the assertive consumerism, are causing the growing interest in self-education among patients. A negative consequence of this trend is the widespread use by patients of Internet materials for self-diagnosis and treatment. The vulnerability of patients undergoing treatment can be reduced by restoring trust between them and the treating physician. Moreover, appropriate training and highly qualified doctors are factors that determine how friendly and relaxed the clinics’ clients will be about the manipulations they undergo. The destruction of the interpersonal relationship between doctors and patients due to the introduction of depersonalized procedures becomes the subject of research in the coming years.
When discussing Parkinson’s Disease (PD), the patient’s care, both from the community and healthcare professionals, is a concern. Therefore, my topic of interest is the care and treatment of people suffering from PD and how their lives could be improved. I chose this topic because it is empathetic seeing patients struggling independently without proper care from the community and the healthcare. The topic is a matter of concern because helping the vulnerable in the community creates an inclusive environment for all. Moreover, caring for PD patients is a health concern issue because, without proper intervention, patients suffering from this condition could develop worse conditions and adversely affect their lives. I believe that PD is treatable, and patients put under proper medication show minimal difficulties coping with their lives. In researching the topic, the keywords to use are ‘appropriate caring for patients with Parkinson’s Disease, which yields a variety of nursing journals to choose from.  * P – Patients and people affected by Parkinson’s Disease (PD).  * I – How does collaborative care and disease education helps to improve care management among patients who have Parkinson’s Disease? Is it worth educating members of society about PD? And what effects could it bring to patients suffering from this condition?  * C – Compares to patients’ data with no collaborative care and victims surrounded by uninformed people about the disease.  * O – Improves PD patients’ care management and care in general.  * T – Over a 24-week time frame.For the sustainability of this
project, it is important to provide supporting evidence on the importance of collaborative and disease education among the community members. Therefore, I intend to exhaust several nursing journals concerning caring for people and patients with Parkinson’s Disease. The targeted nursing journals whose content presents the importance of PD education and studies promoting collaborative care for these victims. This project aims primarily to prove the importance of PD education and the need for awareness of this condition in the community. Finally, at the end of the specified period, the behaviors and the ease of coping with the condition among PD patients will be compared with stored data when the community was not informed of the PD. Therefore, there is a high expectation of a positive result regarding efficient care and ease in managing PD patients.My research concerning PD patients’ care continues as I found this article as important as the two discussed articles. This article’s main point is shifting care of the PD patients from hospitals to community care. According to Aye et al. (2020), integrated multidisciplinary care in collaboration with other healthcare professionals is the key to managing PD patients and their conditions. Moreover, the article presents insufficient expertise, poor interdisciplinary collaboration, and communication to deliver care to PD patients as the core challenges facing the shifting process. Since full shifting to community patient-centric care would be difficult, the research proposes programs such as PD training and Telemedicine to make the dream true shortly (Aye et al., 2020). This article further narrows down and points out
the role of multidisciplinary care in PD and the limitations exhibited by PD patients in the community. This research was based on Singapore’s PD model of care. According to Aye et al. (2020), PD is the second most common neurodegenerative disease, as the research found that more than 6000 people are diagnosed with the disease. Hence over congestion of PD patients forced the birth of Patient-Centric Care outside the hospitals.In my opinion, I found this source biased as caring for persons suffering from PD is concerned. The article does not explain the programs that ensure that these patients receive the utmost care outside the hospitals. Moreover, without proper education and the provision of Telemedicine, many homes that care for PD patients would have a hard time as they do not receive quality care. However, I agree with moving PD care from hospitals to the community because various hospitals do not have sufficient facilities to handle the figures quoted in the case of Singapore. In doing so, caregivers and other healthcare professionals find it easy to care for patients with adverse PD conditions. Reading the article gives insights and knowledge of PD and the reason for ultimate patient care. With the increased PD condition, this matter is a nursing situation and a global matter of concern to help reduce and care for these vulnerable.Therefore, it is important to note that all three discussed articles build on the consensus that persons diagnosed with PD deserve the utmost care to better their lives. The three articles agree that PD
is a chronic neurodegenerative disease with complex motor and non-motor symptoms. Moreover, the articles have stressed the importance of caring for caregivers and the community. The articles also give insights into how PD persons and their families could be supported to better their existence in the community. A good example is teaching programs in the community. This creates PD awareness in the community and enhances patients’ care knowledge. Although the articles agree on some aspects concerning PD patient care, the second article dwells on the relationship between educating the public on PD and the burden of caregiving. The finding showed that with education on the PD, patients receive quality care and reduce the burden on the caregivers’ side. All in all, the information gained from these articles teaches the importance and the need for PD patients’ care.This article primarily presents the concept of personalized care management for persons affected by Parkinson’s Disease (PD). Furthermore, this article acknowledges PD as one of the rising neurodegenerative disorders in the world, affecting more than eight million people globally (Halteren, Munneke, Smit, Thomas, Bloem & Darweesh, 2020). Hence, collaborative care among families, health professionals, and healthcare services is necessary for providing care for these groups of people to make life easier for patients diagnosed with PD. The article has proposed a personalized care management model for these vulnerabilities in making this dream true. According to Hatteren et al. (2020), the model proposed has five elements for helping PD patients cope with their condition.The first is care coordination which could be
termed a team-based activity. The element allows sharing of health information among the caregivers hence facilitating a common understanding. The second element in this model is patient navigation, which involves integrated service delivery to guide and support both the caregivers and the patients. The research also found that fragmentation of care among these patients immensely affects the quality of service received. The third element as per the model is information provision data sharing concerning both physical and health details of the PD patients. Teaching PD patients about their condition creates self-awareness and, in turn, results in self-management and active self-decision-making. The fourth element of the model is the early detection of signs and symptoms through proactive monitoring. This involves thorough monitoring of patients suspected of developing PD conditions so that timely intervention can prevent further worsening. Finally, the last element of the personalized care management model is process monitoring. The element mainly involves tracking, reviewing, and evaluating the care management process concerning set plans and goals. The process is essential because it assesses the quality-of-service deliveries and their impact on the PD’s patients.This is a useful source to start with as far as PD patients are concerned. Reading through this article provides important insights both for caregivers and the family living with persons diagnosed with PD. For instance, I personally, through reading the article, find it necessary to support families and patients struggling to handle these persons living with PD, and in the future, I am looking forward to helping families and individuals affected directly or
indicating differences between the ideas delivered by words and accompanying nonverbal and paraverbal signs. Indeed, when speaking about the unpleasant occurrences at work, the speaker tried to remain calm and analyze the situations rationally. However, as he spoke, his speech was abrupt, arms crossed, and he continuously changed the direction of his sight. These nonverbal and paraverbal messages indicated that the speaker was uncomfortable or deceitful about the discussed issues. However, in most cases, the three types of communication channels were used consistently. For example, when asked about personal life, the speaker used more descriptive words, expressed positive emotions with words and facial expressions, and higher pitch and a faster pace of speaking.Probably, not all of the messages have been read correctly and clearly because the process of reading others is complex and multifaceted. It takes much practice to identify clear patterns and understand the meaning of nonverbal and paraverbal communication messages. Particular facial expressions, body language, and paraverbal indicators might have different meanings depending on a situation or a context. Therefore, it is essential to analyze all the attributes and multiple factors when ‘reading’ others for consistent and clear communication.
Religious exclusivism is the belief by members of a particular religion or a group that only believers of their faith will see heaven, and other people who believe in other faiths will be condemned to hell. A more moderate view of the religious exclusivism doctrine states that believers of a particular religion will only attain salvation while non-believers will not achieve such a status (Peterson et al., 2014). In contrast, universalism holds the view that all people will eventually receive the blessings of God no matter their faith. While religious exclusivism may demonstrate higher dedication and belief in one faith, it may bread dangerous religious extremism that could justify evil or genocidal acts against people of other faiths.Religious exclusivism manifests primarily in Abrahamic religions in various ways. For instance, in Hebrew, at the core of the concept of “the chosen one” is a belief that anyone who does not subscribe to the Jewish faith will not see the promised “world to come.” In Christianity, religious exclusivism manifests in various ways. The Catholic Church and other denominations, for instance, teach that only those who follow true faith will enter the Kingdom of heaven while non-adherents of the faith will go to hell (Peterson et al., 2014). Religious exclusivism is also apparent in Islam. Accordingly, the Islam faith, “the people of the book” described in the Quran as sincere Jews and Christians, will see paradise while people of other faiths and the ungodly Jews and Christians will have nothing to see Allah nor enter paradise.Historically, kings, warriors, and
heads of state have used religious exclusivism to justify acts of cruelty and war, bans against marriages, and persecution for people who do not profess the same faith as them. However, while religious exclusivism may lead to negative consequences, people can practice religious exclusivism today without causing harm or infringing on the rights of other people of different faiths. Additionally, all religions on the planet encourage some level of religious exclusivism where other religions are recognized as legitimate but not true religions. Religious exclusivism did not emerge with the emergence of religion but was a carrying over of the tribalism and clan system entrenched in traditional communities that viewed other tribes and clans as inferior, enemies, or less human. In the traditional sense, the clan members that killed rival clan members could justify their acts by claiming they killed their enemies. Until recently, religious killings of people from different religions could be justified. Despite the most extreme form of religious exclusivism dissipating, the implicit contempt of other religions remains today.One of the most apparent problems with religious exclusivism is the ignorance of other people’s religions and beliefs. People of exclusive faith show no interest in learning or understanding different faiths. For many, their God is the only true God, and anyone who practices another religion is doomed to hell if they do not convert. Today, many Christians would find it improper to study Islam, while many Muslims would also find it inappropriate to study Christianity. The mutual disdain for each other’s religion leads to mistrust and
the proliferation of stereotypes that divide people along religious lines. This status quo has informed public policy, foreign policy, and general national and international relations between nations. On the interpersonal level, religious indifference resulting from ignorance of other people’s religion has negative consequences. Such negative consequences include but are not limited to bans on inter-faith marriages and relationships.Religious exclusivism has robbed people of their humanism and replaced it with rules. People with exclusivist views on religion tend to worry more about what the law is than about the welfare of their neighbors. In the religious sense, a neighbor is anyone in need, no matter their religious inclination. The legal perspective on sin sees sin as an offense towards God, and the humanistic perspective sees sin as being harmful to other people. In actuality, the human and legal perspectives are not that different because disobeying God in any way is similar to disobeying one’s parents. Thus, the harmful actions of religiously exclusive people towards people who do not subscribe to their religion offend God as much as any other sin would offend Him. The scriptures talk about God creating human beings and not God creating people of one faith. Thus, as God’s creations, all human beings deserve to be treated as people first because other titles are secondary.According to John Hick’s pluralistic hypothesis, the world is religiously ambiguous. Accordingly, one can experience it whether or not they believe in any religion because there is no compelling proof that one faith is greater than the other (Peterson et
The tragic and regretful tone of the excerpt of O’Brien’s “Good Form” is set using specific word choices and stylistic devices. The author used emotionless, straightforward words to describe the scenes and let the reader draw the conclusion and resonate with the main character. For example, the dead young man was described as he looked, slim and almost dainty. In this excerpt, the author used anaphora several times to emphasize the importance of the image that he sees, for example, “real bodies with real faces” and “faceless responsibility and faceless grief.”Amy Tan wrote “Fish Cheeks” about a memorable Christmas Eve gathering and a cultural conflict. The main character of the excerpt is embarrassed by her family and her own culture in from of guests. Her embarrassment is displayed by the word-choice used to describe the actions of her relatives, followed by the reaction of her guests and her own desire to disappear. For example, the girl compares her relatives licking the ends of their chopsticks to her guests patiently waiting for the plate to be passed to them. Such words as plucked, poked, and belched are used to describe her father’s moves, viewing them as disgusting and embarrassing.The except of Yusef Komunyakaa’s “Facing It” describes the images and thoughts that occur to a veteran looking through the names on a memorial. Reading some of the names flashes terrifying scenes of those people dying before the main character’s eyes. The flashes take one line of the poem, symbolizing how quickly they come. For example, by touching the name of Andre Johnson, the veteran shares a vision of the booby trap’s white flash with the reader, meaning the death of his comrade. As such, the reader is able to go through the same thoughts and images as the veteran, as if they lived through the same horrors and terrors of war.
Notably, ulcerative colitis is a chronic inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) in which the immune system’s abnormal reactions lead to inflammation and ulcers on the inner lining of the large intestine, which is the last part of the GI tract. Based on the National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases (n.d.), ulcerative colitis can happen at any age; nonetheless, it is more common in people between fifteen and thirty years old. Ulcerative colitis symptoms may differ from person to person, such as diarrhea, passing blood with stool, and abdominal pain. Experts are unsure what causes ulcerative colitis, but they assume genetic factors, abnormal immune responses, the microbiome, and the surroundings play a significant role.Generally, ulcerative colitis is treated with medications that reduce inflammation in the large intestine and aid in the onset and maintenance of remission. Some people with ulcerative colitis may lose their appetite and eat less; they may not get enough nutrients (National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases, n.d.). Essentially, a healthy, well-balanced diet is recommended for people who have ulcerative colitis. I would suggest the perfect dinner plate to a client, which includes cooked vegetables, refined grains, lean protein sources, and omega-3 fatty acids (Santos-Longhurst & Watson, 2022). Therefore, I recommend eating asparagus, white rice, and chicken or better fish because it is full of Omega-3. Additionally, I will emphasize that the client should eat sugar-free or unsweetened applesauce for dessert. It is also vital to avoid alcohol and spicy food.If a patient has celiac disease, I agree that
(IBS-C), IBS with diarrhea (IBS-D), and IBS with both (IBS-M). I liked that you suggested two ideal dinners for patients with IBS-C and IBS-D. IBS-C’s recommended food choices are whole-grain bread and cereals, beans, fruits, and vegetables. Patients with IBS-C should consume foods high in the sugar substitute sorbitol in moderation, such as dried plums and prune juice. You have included prune juice; nonetheless, I would add dried plums as well as a snack. It is crucial to mention that the patient should drink plenty of plain water. When an individual has IBS-D, consume a moderate amount of soluble fiber is vital, such as wheat bread, grain pasta, and dried fruits. Therefore, I would recommend adding dried fruits to the dinner plate. It is crucial to note that patients with IBS-D should avoid drinking water during the meal; water is recommended only an hour before or after the meal.
The Relationship that Exists Between Kate Chopin’s At The Cadian Ball and The StormThe Storm appears to be a continuation of Kate Chopin’s At T he Cadian Ball . Both stories have the same main characters: Bobinot, Calixta, Alcee, and Clarisse. Alcee and Calixta hang out at Assumption, where the ball takes place. They flirt around until Clarisse comes and takes Alcee with him leaving Claxita on her own at the balcony. Then Bobinot finds her and later proposes to her on their way home, and she accepts. On the other hand, Clarisse accepts Alcee’s proposal, which she had earlier rejected.The Storm explains what happens after these two couples marry and what comes from their rushed decisions to marry each other. The two ladies accept their partner’s proposals out of fear of losing them and jealousy of the other opponent. The main themes in The Storm are sex and broken marriages. The name The Storm symbolizes some of the characters’ lives, and Calixta and Alcee end up marrying other people. Therefore, the two storybooks are related in the sense that one is the continuation of the other.The Idea of Social Status in At The Cadian BallThe question of social class dictates the events in which the characters can partake. Clarisse does not go to the Cadian Ball, and she gets upset when Alcee does. Both Alcee and Clarisse are Creoles as they belong to the Spanish and French people who had settled in Louisiana. In many of Kate Chopin’s stories, Creoles are wealthy, most of them
owning a wide range of land and trade merchants. Bobino and Calixta are Acadian descendants of the Americans exiled French from Acadia. They are said to have been chased out of their homes by British colonizers during their reign in 1775. In most of her stories, the Acadians are relatively poor compared to the Creoles. They are primarily fishers and farmers living off the land and working as servants for the Creoles. Clarisse being a Creole means that she is of a higher social status, and that is why she does not go to the ball and wonders why Alcee does.How At The Cadian Ball Revolves Around Love and AttractionThe author attempts to differentiate and separate the two concepts: love, attraction, and lust. This short story portrays attraction in the form of flirtation. At Assumption, where the Cadian ball is taking place, on finding Calixta, Alcee takes her with him to a more private area where they go on flirting until Clarisse comes and goes with Alcee. Additionally, Kate Chopin depicts love through devotion and loyalty. At the ball, Bobinot looks for Calixta, and on finding her all alone on the balcony, he offers to take her home. Bobinot’s feelings and actions towards Calixta show love. Even though she does not pay any attention to him, Bobinot remains irrationally enthusiastic and takes pleasure in any recognition and acknowledgment Calixta gives him. Ultimately, the author captures the issue of love and attraction through enthusiasm and flirtation that different characters portray.How the Author Uses This Short Story to
as well; it was a pacified city-state, often raging war to establish control (Brooks, 2019).Where the two city-states differed significantly is their cultures. Sparta was a military society focused on service to the military and state. It emphasized aspects such as duty, discipline, and physical endurance through all elements of its government system, such as the military, education, and civil service. In many ways, Athens also valued these aspects, particularly with an emphasis on civil service, especially after reforms that allowed not just wealthy aristocrats to rule but gave all males access to power. However, the Athens culture was also heavily embedded in humanities, such as philosophies, art, and entertainment – things that Sparta had little concern for in its society. Athens also maintained a strong class division, where the ruling elite controlled much of the power and wealth while the lower classes, despite being citizens, were given less. Women who had virtually no power, voice, or presence in Athens society were not allowed to own property or vote and were seen as the property of their husbands and fathers. Meanwhile, while some class division existed in Sparta, the militaristic nature bonded everyone together as both kings and regular Spartans respected each other. Women in Sparta were given the most rights, likely in the whole ancient world, being able to own property, could speak publicly, run households, and be relied upon by their husbands (Brooks, 2019).
OverviewBecause of its restricted comprehension and connection with other essential occupations in the professional industry, athletic training may be perplexing to many people, irrespective of the sector. The athletic trainer, like fitness and endurance instructors, efficiency experts, physiotherapists, and even occupational therapists, serves an important role in the development and upkeep of its players. Athletic training involves the management, assessment, and intervention of emergent, intermittent, and long-term medical disorders, including disability, occupational restrictions, and impairments. Fitness development, which is more prevalent in corporate gymnasium settings, is sometimes mistaken for strength and conditioning training. While athletic trainers possess many of the same talents as fitness experts, their roles and obligations are very diverse.For instance, as athletes develop bigger, subtler, and quicker bodies; athletic trainers have a greater obligation to adjust to their unique demands. These requirements may encompass, but are not confined to, pain evaluation and diagnosis, recuperation, massage treatment, nutritional support, and accident prevention. According to Ford (2003), when a therapist and a patient are from different cultures, power equilibration becomes more difficult. Furthermore, the hegemonic contemporary cultural background and mindset have had a long-term influence on racial power dynamics, impacting everyday issues linked with prejudice and bigotry. When likened to prior years, the industry is generating more unsatisfied experts, and even more are wishing to quit totally because of racism and ethic disparity. In athletics, athletic trainers’ anxiety levels might rise due to a variety of factors, including the athlete’s desire to return to the field as soon as possible after facing such discriminating actions,
or the manager might decide to play someone despite the trainer’s advice.Because sporting organizations make so many choices, it may be challenging to assign responsibility when problems arise. In this case, the sports trainer is in a strange role since they are responsible for a wide range of concerns inside a single institution. When examining an athletic illness, for example, particularly one involving a star athlete, the trainer’s recommendations might have far-reaching consequences that influence not just the trainer and the player, but perhaps the whole program.Apart from physical and health-related issues, inclusivity and diversity in sports training is a contemporary and expanding issue in the field of kinesiology. Because of ethnic gaps, racism, and job complexity, there is increased stress within the profession, making it increasingly difficult to perform at the training center. Every aspect of a curriculum might have an influence on how one makes a choice. For example, there is a considerable demand from sportsmen who want to participate and may be required to contest in order to get an education.The manager’s desire, the urge for an athlete to fight for wins, and lastly, the firm’s pressure to fill seats may generate money and pay checks, though at the cost of the trainer. The sports trainer may be faced with scenarios in which not just one, but all of these demands need attention and inclusion. Because the intrinsic unique connection between the two entities makes incompetent legislation so appealing for players to utilize against trainers, it is all too simple to over include
coaching staff and instructors. With the present chain of leadership and bureaucratic structure on college and professional sporting teams, it is unrealistic to hold the trainer liable for negligence allegations if the participant was fully informed of their situation and the hazards of participation.If injury prevention educators and instructors are not cautious of the significantly bigger cultural and academic roles associated with education, they may become accomplices in the research and manufacture of immensely experienced and talented technocratic experts who may not possess the critical threshold of abilities that epitomizes the institution’s romantic ideals and its broader academic intent. If this is permitted to continue, many future sports trainers may find themselves unable to contribute to the bigger, more vital tasks necessary for real democratic participation. To be clear, the assertion made here does not assume that sports training should not be subjected to and held responsible for quantifiable outcomes that “characterize” the admittance level of athletic training consultants (Adams et al., 2021). Moreover, athletic training does not advocate for the marginalization of contemporary academic benchmarks based on insights that influence the athletic profession and training. Rather, all the institutions’ instructors have a goal that is simultaneous and as significant as the corresponding main program of athletic training.Maintaining awareness of and reverence for higher principles of personal learning and development is critical for all learners. Sports training instructors, as members of the institution, must also consider intellectual awareness as a necessary prerequisite for legally performing the leading professional tasks connected with academia. However, although instructors have
little power over the overall culture of sports, their individualized efforts in the sports training room may have a tremendous impact (Maurer-Starks et al., 2008). One strategy for sports training instructors to improve the minimum threshold of their curriculum and pedagogy is to aggressively incorporate inclusive practices and promote diversity into all elements of their training materials.Professional athletic trainers cannot be solely athletic trainers since athletic coaching is now legally recognized as an affiliated healthcare profession and its practitioners operate in diverse settings with a broad range of patients, trainees, and coworkers. Athletic trainers, on the other hand, must constantly aspire to become lifelong learners competent at connecting with and comprehending a wide range of perspectives, ideas, skills, and viewpoints. Irrespective of the specific corporate setting or work requirements, most sports therapists are challenged on a constant basis with problems of racism, class, sexual orientation, and ethnic diversity (Day et al., 2021; Maurer-Starks et al., 2008). Because different sociocultural influences occur in both personal and intellectual athletic training environments, trainees must be adequately instructed to accept and handle crucial challenges.Now it is clear that all sports exercise physiology experts will require a substantial multicultural perspective that surpasses competent knowledge and expertise. One that allows for a vital and compassionate perspective on “others’” opinions, and one that empowers the sports training and athletics expert to optimize the landscape and access to care and outreach programs. As a result, sports training curriculums must officially, phenomenologically, and cognitively equip their learners for their upcoming relational, civic, and corporate duties.
learners to talk about their own experiences. More study is needed to determine how athletic trainers can play a role in inclusion and diversity in sports, therefore bridging the gap produced by individuals who quit due to feelings of marginalization and institutional racism.ReviewSource 1Due to a lack of diversity in the profession’s workforce and academia, there is a dearth of culturally competent sports training therapists and instructors. The foundation for a culturally sensitive setting will be laid by qualified sports trainers and therapists’ readiness to raise awareness and combat prejudices and misconceptions. According to Ford (2003), professional sports trainers and clinicians should be aware that culture influences a person’s decisions, actions, and reactions. As a result, the study was directed by the following question: what criteria should be incorporated into an academic curriculum to prepare a proficient sports training specialist in an ethnically varied society? Despite the ambiguity, data were gathered through critical examination of other papers, and the findings were organized into themes and subthemes. Ford (2003) conducted research that defined cultural competency in mental health services in order to satisfy the conflicting demands of highly skilled athletic trainers in NATA.
Why Austinville Community Health Centre Is a Good Place for Mrs.. Smith to Receive CareAustville Community Health Centre is an ideal place for Mrs.. Smith to access healthcare services because it is a short distance from where she lives. This means that it is convenient because she can easily access the health center with little or no transport cost. In addition, the small distance between Mrs.. Smith’s home and the Austville center can help her exercise through walking, which is very beneficial in managing her condition. According to research, regular exercise is essential in maintaining a healthy weight and also regulates blood sugar levels (Borse et al. 2021, p. 113). Likewise, the short distance to the facility will make it easy for Mrs.. Smith to get regular check-ups to ensure her blood sugar remains within the target range.Austville is also a good place for Mrs.. Smith to obtain care because it has multidisciplinary healthcare personnel trained to offer high-quality services to the elderly. In this case, it has several specialists, such as a podiatrist and optometrist, who can detect and treat symptoms associated with type 2 diabetes. Therefore, Mrs.. Smith will be able to obtain appropriate medications for her condition. Likewise, the center has a diabetes educator and provides education programs on diabetes. This implies that Mrs.. Smith will get insightful training on managing her condition. This may include useful tips like how to maintain a healthy diet, test her blood sugar, and the appropriate exercises that aid in weight loss. Such education will help Mrs.
Smith to manage her condition and prevent further complications.The environment around Austville offers Mrs.. Smith an opportunity to establish positive social networks that may benefit her general well-being. Since the health center provides most of its health services to the elderly, Mrs.. Smith may establish friendships with other patients. She may also make friends with her peers during the group exercise programs offered by the center. Similarly, Austville has a community café where people living in the neighborhood can meet and talk. A study shows that stronger social networks and support among the elderly are linked with increased patient adherence to medical treatment and improved self-care (Li 2021, p. 1). In this case, social networks may help Mrs.. Smith maintains her happiness, reducing any incidences of stress that are detrimental to her health. Equally important, Austville is located in a low socioeconomic community, which implies that it offers low-cost healthcare services. Thus, it is ideal for Mrs.. Smith because she solely relies on her pension.Five Health Professionals That Mrs.. Smith, Will Need to See at the Health Centre, and What Services Each of Them Could OfferSince Austville is a primary healthcare center, Mrs.. Smith can benefit from the services offered by several specialists. The five health professionals that Mrs. Smith would seek assistance from including the podiatrist, optometrist, diabetes educator, physiotherapist, and clinical exercise physiologist. In this case, a podiatrist is a valuable specialist in the diabetes care team. Patients with diabetes are highly predisposed to developing foot problems such as foot ulcers, nerve damage, Charcot
foot, and amputations. A podiatrist is adequately trained to assess any complications associated with a patient’s foot and prepare a treatment and prevention plan (Blanchette et al. 2020, p. 2).These specialists can identify foot health risks and effectively treat them to avoid further complications. In addition, an optometrist is critical in managing Mrs. Smith’s health condition. One of the common symptoms of type 2 diabetes is blurred vision. Thus eye care is essential for patients with diabetes (Ford et al. 2021, p. 1). In this case, an optometrist will check Mrs. Smith’s eyes regularly to detect and treat any injuries or abnormalities associated with her vision.A diabetes educator is crucial in offering valuable insights into the management of diabetes. In this context, a diabetes educator will work collaboratively with Mrs. Smith to develop an effective treatment plan and educate her on proper nutrition and other positive lifestyle choices (King et al. 2017, p. 2). Patients with diabetes are advised to eat nuts and avocadoes as well as use beans and eggs as a healthy source of protein.They are also directed to consume a diet with fruits, vegetables, lean proteins, and whole grains (Borse et al. 2021, p. 113). The diabetes educator may also recommend regular exercise to help in reducing body weight. Similarly, these professionals also train families to assist patients with diabetes in managing the disease. Likewise, a physiotherapist may assist in alleviating the severity of diabetes through therapeutic exercise programs (Harris-Hayes et al. 2020, p. 12). In this case, a physiotherapist may recommend various
aerobic and resistance programs to Mrs. Smith to help her maintain healthy body weight. Aerobic exercise may include swimming and walking, while resistance activities may comprise yoga, weightlifting, and calisthenics.Finally, Mrs. Smith may require the services of a clinical exercise physiologist (CEP) who is integral personnel to patients with chronic illnesses, especially diabetes. A CEP assesses a patient to determine the most suitable exercise regimen (Pearce & Longhurst 2021, p. 2). They also monitor the exercises to ensure that the patients engage in safe practices. Through such patient-centered exercise programs, patients can maintain healthy body weight and regulate their blood glucose, protecting them against further complications.How Mrs. Smith’s Care Would Be Funded, and the Benefits Mrs. Smith Might Be Eligible forMrs. Smith is on an aged care pension, one of the income support payments from the Federal Government for individuals who are 66 years and above. Therefore, her primary care may be funded through the aged care scheme. One of the benefits that Mrs. Smith is eligible for is a carer allowance. For people of her age to qualify for this type of government pension, they need to be frail, aged and have a severe illness or disability. If a community health center offers ongoing or continuous primary care services to an individual meeting these criteria, the institution may also qualify for a carer benefit (Payments, Concessions n.d.). This payment intends to help individuals who have assumed responsibilities to care for the geriatric population. This is because unique demands associated with caring for older adults usually
hinder or negatively impact caregivers’ ability to actively engage in formal employment. In this case, since the patient is frail, aged, and has recently been diagnosed with type 2 diabetes, Austville qualifies to receive a carer allowance after every two weeks.Under this national scheme, Mrs. Smith is also entitled to an extra supplement pension. This can help the patient with her bills and drug costs. In addition, since Mrs. Smith is a beneficiary of the Age Pension, this automatically qualifies her for the Pensioner Concession Card (Payments, Concessions n.d.). This means that she can receive healthcare services and utilities and use her Pensioner Card to access more discounted rates on medicines through the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme and other support services. Therefore, all these advantages could mean cheaper medication, considerable refunds for medical costs, Mrs. Smith having her physician’s visits bulk billed, and reduced rates on household supplies. Others include lower water rates, property, motor vehicle registration, and public transport.The benefits a Primary Health Centre Such as Austville Would Offer for Others in the Local CommunityPrimary health centers have several benefits to people in the local community. Such facilities increase the access to care services for the community residents, especially people with low socioeconomic backgrounds and the elderly. Additionally, primary healthcare institutions provide a range of services to people in the neighborhood. The services may include health promotion, early intervention, preventive care, and screening, as well as treatment and management of acute and chronic health conditions like asthma, cancer, and hypertension. Likewise, primary health centers provide a
broad range of healthcare personnel, such as general practitioners, nurses, social workers, nutritionists, and other allied health professionals.This greatly improves the healthcare outcomes of the residents in the surrounding areas because they can receive high-quality and patient-centered care. According to research, a robust primary healthcare system is linked with low medical costs, improved efficiency, reduced hospitalization rates, increased patient satisfaction, and positive health outcomes (van Weel & Kidd 2018, p. 464). Therefore, the Austville center will provide comprehensive and tailored services to meet the health needs of the locals.Primary health facilities provide continuity of care to local residents. Having a specialist who is familiar with a patient’s medical history is essential. This is because they can adequately recommend an effective treatment method based on the patient’s records. In addition, such healthcare personnel can efficiently detect a health abnormality in its initial stages due to frequent check-ups and contacts with the patient. It is also important to note that the familiarity between a patient and a physician builds trust and improves communication. Therefore, patients can easily talk about sensitive health issues and receive much-needed help.Not to mention, a primary care doctor may help patients avoid certain health complications that may affect them in the future. In this case, based on a patient’s health records, a physician may detect an increased risk of conditions such as cancer, diabetes, stroke, and obesity, among others. Such information may, in turn, assist a patient on what steps to take to avoid developing the ailments (Agarwal et al. 2017, p. 7). Therefore,
primary care centres offer continuity of care which substantially improves the local residents’ health outcomes.The Community NeedThe growth of the geriatric population has negatively impacted the provision of primary care. This is because older adults have more co-morbidities demanding higher levels of care than the younger generation (van Gaans & Dent 2018, p. 2). Another report shows that one in four senior Australians lives below the poverty line, and individuals aged 65 years and above equals 7 percent of those who are homeless (Face the Facts n.d.). In addition, instances of older adults living alone and away from family members have also been reported.The city’s population growth rate has increased significantly over the last few years, driven mainly by an increase in net overseas migration. The research indicates that migrants currently represent about 28% of the country’s overall population (Raymer & Baffour 2018, p. 1055). Therefore, issues facing refugees and asylum seekers are also things that Austville endeavors to address. This often involves providing them with the most basic needs, such as food, education, and temporary housing. The implication here is that Austville must be adequately equipped to address the challenges of growing senior citizens and cultural diversity. The goal is also to assist informal caregivers like friends and neighbours who provide daily assistance to these groups.SolutionSince the community has continued to experience a high growth rate of the older population and an increasing number of migrants, inadequate clinical and social services have left these individuals in a dire situation. Austville sees the opportunity to continue
during this time. Therefore, CHADD came into existence with the primary aim of changing ADHD situations, which most people misunderstood as a ‘behavior problem.’ The organization acknowledges ADHD as a potentially serious disorder yet treatable.CHADD is creating an overornament both for children and adults affected by ADHD (CHADD, 2022). This is a Maryland-based organization supporting people enduring the effects of the condition. One of the organization’s activities is enhancing children’s education services and accommodations in regular classrooms.The organization holds that children affected by ADHD have the right to education just like other normal children. Moreover, through an awareness campaign, the organization has created a favorable environment in workplaces for people suffering from this condition. The history report of the organization reveals that one parent group in Florida grew dramatically and was ranked the leading non-profit national organization intervening for children and adults affected by ADHD.
IntroductionSignificantly, health care safety and well-being are key issues towards achieving a quality healthy population. The complexity of patient technology has been transforming. Before, nurses used to touch, smell, and hear about monitoring patients when caring for patients. With the current evolution of technology, various measures have been developed to enhance and improve health care services which have been of great success (Alotaibi and Federico, 2017). While technological changes elaborate both problems and solutions in enhancing patient safety, much must be done to overcome the issues. One of the devolved technological strategies involves Automated IV Pumps, a device used to administer medication. The introduction of Automated IV Pumps has led to both negative and positive impacts in the nursing profession based on the illustration.The necessity of providing quality health care is the level to which health services to populations increases the probability of meeting desired health care outcomes. Automated IV Pumps are one of the key technological advancements in health care which is a device designed to help nurses give the right dosage. Using Automated IV Pumps has improved the efficiency of service care, reduced errors and flexibility, which is believed to improve general patient safety. To a greater extent, safety measures such as following instructions, monitoring and dosage must be considered.The problem of the statementDespite the technological advancements in health care, 100% attained of patient safety is still an issue. The rising number of patient issues are increasing hence calling for more attention to carry out more research (Wei et al.,2021). Patient safety and care
are the major concerns to all hence the study will evaluate the patient outcomes related to use of Automated IV Pumps to come up with the necessary measures. Alternatively, there is a little improvement of care services in nursing profession.However much the technological measures have improved the level of patient care, there are still issues about patient safety concerning the use of technological evolutions, such as they have Automated IV Pumps. Patient issues, such as medical errors, are one of the key obstacles which should be minimized to ensure safety and well being.Objectives of the studyThe study’s main objective will look at the major impacts of Automated IV Pumps in the nursing profession. Further, the study will achieve this by assessing the outcome of patients undergoing medications using Automated IV Pumps.Research questionTo determine the impacts of Automated IV Pumps in nursing profession.Justification of the studyMy study will aim at finding out both positive and negative impacts of Automated IV Pumps on patient care and safety to give the necessary support to use Automated IV Pumps in the nursing profession or not.FindingsNurses involves in a lot of activities on delivering quality patient care. The evolution of technology such as use of Automated IV Pumps is of great achievement since it enhances accurate judgement of drug administration. Patient care should no longer be a guess work instead accuracy and consistency. On the other hand, the use of Automated IV Pumps lightens the work of nurses who are overworked. The impact of Automated IV Pumps has been felt in
The article by Vargas and Soriano is dedicated to an innovative solution in the educational field, namely the use of blockchain technology in Edublocs. In the introduction, scientists note the problems of the modern educational system that can be solved with the help of Edublocs (Vargas & Scott, 2019). The main feature of the blockchain is the impossibility of loss, damage, or forgery of an educational document. Since a block created once can no longer be changed, it cannot be deleted from the network (Fedorova & Skobleva, 2020). In this way, the reliability and integrity of the data are guaranteed, and the learning history can become completely transparent.This is followed by both a theoretical and a practical overview of the Edublocs platform. The first section of the main part presents the theoretical aspects of using the program, and the second demonstrates the interface of the platform (Vargas & Scott, 2019). The Edublocs blockchain platform will unite students, educational institutions, employers, and recruiters, as it will be developed taking into account their needs (Vargas & Scott, 2019). This will give the sphere not just a useful tool for interaction but will push it to significant changes and the emergence of new solutions. A separate section of the article is devoted to tutors: the authors note that the introduction of new technologies will require radical changes in educational institutions. These changes will primarily affect the transformation of management, management methods, financial management, and specific people (Ismail et al., 2019). Therefore, today it is necessary to prepare the teaching staff and staff for serious changes.In conclusion, scientists claim that the result of the introduction of blockchain technologies in education will be the automation of production processes and the provision of services. This means that those educational institutions that have switched to a modern developed digital infrastructure will be able to maintain economic stability. Using Edublocs will allow these educational institutions to remain competitive.
SummaryNursing is an often-undervalued profession, which is essential to an efficiently functioning hospital environment. Nursing theory has a valuable and established input on the effectiveness of the nursing staff in real-life situations (Oducado et al., 2019). Nevertheless, nursing practices and customs are most effective and widely used in everyday scenarios. However, since the theory-practice gap remains significant (Greenway et al., 2019) it is often the case that the staff acts in established ways without understanding the underlying reasons for the customs. This can be problematic for several reasons, including motivation and credibility. Firstly, the students might think of theory as a waste of time and hence be less motivated to study. Secondly, it might decrease the trust between the patients and the nurses, as the credibility of the nursing staff falters. Lastly, it might negatively affect patient care quality (Salifu et al., 2018) if the nurses are unable to act efficiently in unfamiliar situations. Therefore, it is vital to learn the background of the nursing practices in order to understand why they are the way that they are today, and how to amend them if the situation needs a novel solution.Describe the evolution of nursing practiceThe nursing profession as it is known today can be traced back to Florence Nightingale, a nurse in the mid-19 th century. During the numerous wars that were to follow in the 20 th century, the profession’s importance was amplified, aiding the soldiers significantly. Nightingale had to go against the societal norms of the time to follow her beliefs that she
should be able to aid who she wants (“How the Evolution of the Nursing Profession Benefits Nurses & Patients Alike,” 2019). During the Civil War and the two World Wars, the significance of the nursing profession became undeniable, raising the credibility of women willing to help.Over the years, the nursing profession has been shaped and reshaped many times. Firstly, there is now formal education available to those willing to become caretakers. Based on the theories and practices that have been established, this allows the knowledge to be passed on safely. Furthermore, as the nursing profession became more recognized, those affiliated with it also gained more duties and responsibilities. It is vital for nurses to remain sharp and efficient in their daily decisions, as some of them might be life-saving. Lastly, there are now safety and quality procedures and standards that ensure that each and every patient receives the best quality of care.Identify and compare key players to the foundation of nursing practiceFlorence NightingaleAs mentioned in the previous section, one of the most famous nurses in history was the Mother of Modern Nursing. Florence Nightingale started her nursing career by training in Egypt and later went on to serve in the British military during the Crimean War. There, she began the practices that have shaped nursing as it is known today.Clara BartonClara Barton was a teacher before the American Civil War, a profession she later was forced to give up for the sake of delivering medical supplies to the troops. Although her name might not be as
familiar as some other ones, the organization she founded, the American Red Cross, remains active to this day. Barton herself worked closely with her creation through 1904.Mary BreckinridgeMary Breckinridge was a nurse-midwife who founded the New Model of Rural Health Care & Frontier Nursing Service, which aims at delivering health care to rural women and children. Since 1925, when the organization was founded, it has been an immense help to thousands of people nationwide. It has helped reduce maternal and infant mortality rates largely, and still operates today.Dorothea DixAlthough today mental health is getting a lot of spotlights, when Dorothea Dix founded the first mental asylum in the early 1800s it was still a completely unknown area. While today it is generally understood that there are certain people that deserve to be treated for their mental issues rather than ostracized, this was not always the case. Dix advocated for mental health rights before the state and Congress and has shaped the current civil rights of the mentally ill.Margaret SangerMargaret Sanger was the founder of Planned Parenthood, which came to life after the untimely death of her mother from difficult pregnancies. While she was being treated in a hostile manner and was even forced to flee to Europe, she did not give up on her beliefs. On her eventual return to the United States, she opened the first birth control clinic.Mary MahoneyMary Mahoney was and is an inspiration to many as the first African-American nurse in the US. Following her example, many other women entered nursing schools
IntroductionResearchers worldwide have been studying the concept of backpacking tourism for a long period of time, expanding the existing knowledge about this sphere. Nevertheless, backpacking as a movement is constantly undergoing changes which lead to new iterations and trends. Essentially, the needs and desires of the modern backpacker are different from those which were relevant a decade ago. Therefore, there is a necessity to study the existing situation and to explore the new trends popular among the members of the backpacking community. Knowledge about the most topical trends in the realm of backpacking can be important for different industries, but especially the hospitality one. Thus, the current research focuses on determining the latest trends in the sphere of backpacking tourism and identifies ways how they can be adopted by hospitality businesses. Yet, in order to conduct quality research, it is crucial to analyze the existing academic literature on the topic of backpacking and hospitality. The current literature review will focus on three main research objectives: establishing the attractiveness of backpacking for younger generations, identifying hostels’ methods of making travelers’ experiences special, and analyzing solutions for the long-term sustainability of backpacking trends.Objective 1: Backpacking and Younger GenerationsBackpacking is a relatively new phenomenon which emerged several decades ago, which explains the lack of academic research on the topic in the 20 th century. The concept of drifter-tourism introduced by Cohen (1973) in the 1970s was one of the first attempts of researchers to explore the topic of unconventional tourism. The idea of drifter-tourism referred to a least institutionalized type of tourism, which was characterized by a high level of individualism (1973). Drifters described by Cohen can be considered the predecessors of modern backpackers since they both possess the qualities of autonomy. At the same time, today, backpacking can be viewed as institutionalized tourism and has already established itself as one of the conventional ways of travel. Moreover, according to Cohen (1973), were usually affluent young people who wanted to have new experiences in life. Modern backpackers include people of all ages, yet the younger generation individuals remain the majority. Additionally, since backpacking has become an institutional type of travel, it is considered by many people a lifestyle (Cohen, 2011). According to the research of Cohen (2011, p. 1535), many backpackers describe their activities as their way of life and call themselves “lifestyle travelers.” Essentially, backpacking has become a phenomenon which is extremely popular in the tourist community to the point where some people consider it their primary occupation.
the latter, the decision is the result of reliance on false or inaccurate information with the best intentions to make a correct choice. When it comes to a bad decision, a manager is aware of and has accurate information and a proper understanding of key factors but intentionally chooses the incorrect path. A bad decision might occur due to a wide range of factors, which can involve a conflict between a manager’s self-interests and organizational objectives or merely emotional influence on the decision-making. However, wrong decisions require changes in the acquisition of accurate and reliable information on which the correct decision can be made.In both cases, it is highly relevant to improve one’s decision-making skills both now and in the future. Such an improvement requires an increase in the integrity of processes of data acquisition and collection. It is stated that decisions can be “impaired by various inconsistencies and errors, which negatively affect the value of these data for any decision-making processes” (Schuh et al., 2017, p. 425). Therefore, proper automation of data collection methods on the basis of accuracy and integrity can greatly improve the overall knowledge available to a manager. By being able to see a wider and clearer picture of a situation, a manager will be capable of making correct decisions.

IntroductionBarclays bank is a UK-based Multinational Corporation headquartered in London and operates in the financial niche. The universal bank was established in 1860 in London as a goldsmith’s lending business offering people loans and saving options. The bank’s resilience in the corporate domain made it navigate all the challenges, and it still operates to date. Barclays bank remains relevant in the financial industry because it analyses societal trends and changes its operations to suit human needs. At the height of feminism in the 1950s, it became the first bank to appoint a female manager in 1958, Hilda Harding, who served the bank until her superannuation in 1970. The bank has more than 4750 branches located in different parts of the world in 55 countries. However, 1600 of the branches are located in the UK. Barclays bank has thrived in finance because it leverages technology, social listening, and adopting an effective leadership structure.Description of the OrganizationThe bank operates in two distinct divisions for efficiency, Barclays UK and Barclays International, all of which are supported by the Barclays executive Services. The bank’s standard services include wealth management, investment, retail, and commercial banking. The bank boasts of having employed over 83,500 members of staff to ensure the smooth delivery of services to the organisation (Haralayya and Aithal, 2021).Although the business started as a partnership between James Barclays and other goldsmiths, the state of ownership has changed over the year to remain in tandem with the practices and regulations affecting the people. In 1981, it changed its entity and re-registered
as a public limited company (Vakhrusheva et al., 2021). The state of ownership allows members of the public to purchase shares. Some of the most significant shareholders in the company include Raymond James, Natixis advisors, and Cambiar Investors LLC. In 2021, the bank generated a total profit of 5.75 billion sterling pounds (Barnes and Newton, 2022). The bank uses strategic management options and cultural competence to thrive in different regions with different cultures.Description of the Organization’s StructureBarclays bank is a British universal bank owned by shareholders. Since it is a limited liability company, the shareholder’s property cannot be sold when the bank fails to pay its debts (Vakhrusheva et al., 2021). The principal shareholders of Barclays Bank include Qatar investment authority, Dodge and cox, BlackRock fund advisors, and the Vanguard Group Inc. The organisational hierarchy is headed by the Barclays execution services (BX), which manages the two main groups, Barclays international and Barclays UK. The CEO further appoints directors to every functional area of the bank to make it work efficiently (Barnes and Newton, 2022). The bank’s primary business model is sales and trading, where the sales agents solicit ideas and opportunities from prospects. At the same time, traders advise clients and execute orders to ensure the client’s goals are attained (Schachter, 2018). It is imperative to note that the organisation’s leadership structure allows for a closed feedback loop.Figure 1: Barclays Business Structure (Ozili, 2022).The chief operations officer (COO) and execution services are virtual offices that coordinate and evaluate all operations. Mark Ashton is the current
position holder and coordinates Barclays UK and Barclays International (Schachter, 2018). The COO receives reports from the management committee, which comprises the CEO, Coimbatore Sundararajan, the chairman of the board and the different directors for crucial operations. Specialisation and division of labour are encouraged as each exceptional service, such as investment banking, wealth management, and compliance, requires a director who concentrates on the assignment.All the directors report to the executive committee to grant better services in the long run. Barclay’s organisational structure promotes specialisation and division of labour (Bari and Syazwani, 2018). Closed loop reporting and a feedback mechanism designed through the structure make the universal bank thrive despite the turbulence in the banking sector. Contemporary companies must learn from Barclay’s organisational structure for effective communication, feedback, and decision-making.Barclay’s Key Management TheoryThe leadership style and organisational structure use Fredrick Taylor’s scientific theory. According to the scientific management theory, leaders must break down tasks and allocate them to specialised people other than relying on the employee’s decisions. The approach explains that everyone can be trained to deliver on their speciality. Barclays uses the top COO to supervise and receive information from directors specialising in their field (Schachter, 2018). Barclays benefits from the scientific leadership theory because it increases collaboration and enhances team efficiency and objectivity. When the correct extrinsic and intrinsic motivations are used, the employees are likely to be more creative, motivated, and result oriented to ensure that they deliver positive results (Tahir, 2018). Although the scientific theory of management by Fredrick Taylor is no longer
being applied in many businesses today, most of the application principles are evident in Barclay’s structure.External Influences That Might Impact Barclays GrowthA strategic SWOT analysis is conducted on a business to determine its strengths, weaknesses, opportunity and threats. The strengths and opportunities eliminate the organisation’s weaknesses and threats (Bari and Syazwani, 2018). Similarly, the PESTLE analysis determines the political, economic, social, technological, and legal factors likely to affect an organisation or determine whether the business would fail. The political environment is an external factor which can help favour the organization when the law supports profitability. Social factors include the demographics and characteristics which make people seek services from the organisation (Tahir, 2018). The three critical external areas that Barclays should focus on include social, political, and economic factors. Although the factors are beyond the organisation’s sphere of influence, the management can take them into account and work with the relevant external stakeholders to improve its performance.Social FactorsThe social factors in an organisational analysis include society, culture, and how it affects people in the long run. The banking industry can only thrive when people in society are successful in their economic endeavours. For example, when the demographics have a small number of people with formal training, unemployment will be high, and the business will not have potential customers (Bari and Syazwani, 2018).Further, gender stereotyping and lack of entrepreneurial spirit may negatively affect the business as society members will lack economic empowerment. Barclays can leverage social factors to empower people to be financially independent in the community. Investing
in the country (Purshouse, 2020). For example, if a country it operates in has a socialist economic system, it should design its operations to meet the expectation of the people. Further, the level of government invention in strengthening the economy must be analysed and understood to ensure that Barclays benefit from any governmental interventions. The inflation, interest, and unemployment rates must be considered before investing in programs relating to the affected population (Haralayya and Aithal, 2021). Barclays must therefore hire an economist always to analyse the economic situation to avoid making bad decisions.ConclusionBarclays bank is a thriving organisation that started in the UK and spread to other parts of the world. The organisation started as a goldsmith lending enterprise, then a partnership and finally became a limited liability company. The ownership status in such an entity is through the shareholders, and public members are always welcome to buy shares. The company has numerous motivated workers who are willing to perform better. The organisational structure depicts bureaucratic relationships and division of labour as per Taylor’s theory. The PESTEL analysis is an essential tool used to determine whether or not an organisation can thrive. Barclays must consider the political, social, and economic factors to blossom.
for the group and me.My ally-ship would establish a connection with the oppressed group and focus on providing such people with the required assistance. An appropriate and effective motto should be created to reveal my intent. It seems that the following statement is suitable: “Sexual orientation is not as significant as it seems.” These words denote that judging a person according to their sexual orientation is not reasonable.A few essential obstacles can affect my ally-ship, and they include social opposition and the reluctance of the target population to change the situation. On the one hand, many conservative social groups and structures can argue against my allyship because homosexuality is not appropriate for them. Thus, it is necessary to address this fact by educating people. In particular, the focus can be placed on the fact that social oppression often results in adverse health consequences for LGBT individuals. On the other hand, the representatives of the selected population can be afraid of advocating for positive changes, meaning that specific counseling should be organized for them to make them engaged in the allyship.
their cultures (Tilling, 2013). This approach would explain the correlation between the male sex and behavioral problems through Western cultures’ promotion of aggressive notions of masculinity, going as far as to encourage bullying (Rosen and Nofziger, 2019). In short, the crucial difference between gender theories explaining behavioral problems in males is where they look for answers.Knowing about and understanding these gender theories is obviously relevant for teaching in more ways than one. First and foremost, it is nigh impossible to efficiently address behavioral problems without understanding their cause. Secondly, and also importantly, gender theories that are long out of favor in the scientific community may still hold strong sway over the public. An example would be the mythopoetic men’s movement that draws heavily upon biological determinism despite all criticisms of the latter (Tilling, 2013). As such, better knowledge of gender theories is also crucial for the understanding of the ways in which people can rationalize their behaviors.
outcomes of the analysis appear in an understandable form and actually serve to illustrate the theoretical background, in which part the authors comment on the essentiality of proper leadership in organizations. The practical part involves a detailed examination of several types and styles, specifically, the ways various leaders interact with employees. The general conclusion is the criticality of mutual respect and dedication to recognizing everybody’s needs, which underlies servant leadership as a practice.Human resources and psychology of leadership apparently are the areas where the investigators specialize. Notably, they participated in a range of publications on several topics within the above fields, such as organizational leadership, individual leadership, culture-specific peculiarities, and others. As mentioned, Current Psychology, the global peer-reviewed research forum, accepted their work for publishing, which means that it meets its quite specific quality requirements. It was found through the JFL, Jerry Falwell Library.
Love is not simply a feeling but a complex physiological process that occurs in the human body and involves different mechanisms. The chapter “Biochemistry of love” by Carter & Porges provides an insight into the biological basis of love and relationship. The key concepts explored in the chapter include the role of oxytocin and vasopressin in the creation of emotional bonds.Social behavior is part of the process of evolution, and it can be found among the most primitive species. At the same time, the social behaviors of humans are more diverse, and love is only one of the possible forms. Nevertheless, the feeling of love experienced by people still begins in the core part of the human brain, which encounters certain sensations transmitted by the vagus nerve. On the biochemical level, neuropeptides oxytocin and vasopressin play major roles. For instance, oxytocin is a hormone responsible for strengthening a lasting bond between a mother and her child (Carter & Porges, 2022). Still, other adults also can experience an increase in oxytocin when they see a newborn, and this situation can contribute to their desire to engage in caretaking. Moreover, oxytocin facilitates eye contact and social cognition, which are essential elements of love.Research shows that oxytocin is not the only hormone contributing to a loving relationship since it usually works together with vasopressin. The latter is a neuropeptide that coordinates aggression and protective conduct; therefore, by working with oxytocin, they create a balance. For instance, oxytocin, which can decrease stress, helps children to undergo distress related to the
Selection: “To Be Free” (2017)  * Artist: Jamaal Barber  * Art Form: Carved Wood Block  * Time Period: 21st CenturyBiographical Profile of Jamaal BarberJamaal Barber is a modern African American artist specializing in printmaking and woodcuts. The artist was born in Virginia and raised in Littleton, North Carolina (“Jamaal Barber”). He showed interest in art from a young age, fascinated by images in children’s and comic books. Then, Barber started drawing in elementary school and would draw on anything he could find (“Jamaal Barber”). However, Barber’s early passion would not lead him to become a full-time artist.Barber’s major in college was business, but he switched it to art. Barber realized that he wanted “to make this art stuff work” when he had taken a “drawing class as an elective” (Johnson). Barber won several ECU student art awards during his years at East Carolina University. Notably, he won the JOSA Award of Excellence in Drawing in 2002 and got first place in the graphic design competition of the Rebel Magazine (“Jamaal Barber”). In 2003, Barber graduated from ECU with a bachelor’s degree in Communication Arts and took a 15-year break from studying to foster his personal view of artistry (“Jamaal Barber”; Johnson). In 2004, Barber moved to Atlanta, Georgia, and resides there with his wife and kids (“About”). The artist was actively creating during the break while working as a graphic designer for Iota Phi Theta Fraternity, Inc. and Spoken Magazine. His works have been displayed at the Ao5 Gallery and the Mano A
Mano art show (“Jamaal Barber”).Furthermore, Barber’s works have been published by Penguin Random House, Black Art in America, and Emory University, as well as on social media platforms and in the New York Times (“About”). From 2018, Barber went for a master’s degree in Printmaking at Georgia State University. His focus on printmaking began when he saw a demonstration on making a screen print at a local art store in 2013 (“About”). The artist’s prints and woodcuts are displayed at ZuCot Gallery and have been part of various art shows such as the Decatur Arts Festival and the Atlanta Print Biennial exhibit (“About”). In his works, Barber explores Black identity and showcases aspects of African American life (Johnson). His pieces are dynamic, thought-provoking, and experimental, depicting the perception of African Americans by themselves and society.Critical Analysis of “To Be Free”I selected one of Barber’s recent woodcuts because it showcases the social reality in which many African Americans live to date. The theme of the piece is the desire and struggle for freedom. The carving consists of a black man looking to his right and four white hands holding him by the shirt. The man’s expression is calm and thoughtful, indicating that he sees desired destination and is unconcerned with the impediment. He seems to be in motion: he starts moving towards the said destination. The hands are clenched and tense, stretching and nearly tearing the man’s clothing. It shows how they try to stop the man no matter what. The contrast between calmness and aggressiveness is
striking and indicates a contest of persistence with the sheer power of reality. The artist has used a contrasting black and white palette that enhances said competition. Barber’s art piece from the same exhibition says: “Black is never neutral.” Interestingly enough, black is defined as a neutral color, but the artist makes it non-neutral in his piece. ‘To Be Free’ implies that black is a resistance surrounded by heavy and oppressing whiteness.I think that Barber wants to show the hegemony of white America over the perception of black people. Tariq notes that Barber brings to light how “blackness is hyper-visible only when it is not seen as a threat to white wealth, power, privilege and safety.” The piece depicts how white society often attempts to dictate the freedom of a black person, employing discriminating views, stereotypes, and boundaries. Another implication that can be made is that the hands pulling the clothes will only receive the clothes. Historically, clothes were symbolic of status and caste in society. The man is determined to escape, and his body will not be taken, but he may lose his clothing. Here, the clothes seem to be the man’s false skin, the symbol of perception of himself and his place in society imposed by said society.I would classify the piece as black art because it questions the harsh reality of African Americans in modern times. The exhibition is called Bright Black , and it revolves around what Barber sees as “the American Color Theory” and breaking “hegemonic modes of seeing” of black
people by society (Tariq). Barber propagate African Americans to be strong and unflappable like the man on the carving. The will of the individual, the man, overshadows society’s discriminating imposition, the hands. They have grabbed a strong individual by his imposed identity, and the man has complete control over the situation. To be free, he needs to let go of so-called ‘hegemonic modes of seeing’ and be true to himself.Selection: “Portrait of the Artist as a Shadow of His Former Self” (1980)  * Artist: Kerry James Marshall  * Art Form: Paper Painting  * Time Period: Postmodernism/New BlacknessBiographical Profile of Kerry James MarshallKerry James Marshall is an African American painter and printmaker. He was born in Birmingham, Alabama, in 1955 (Yood). The artist is known for his unique style, representing ordinary people and questioning social dogmas. Marshall studied at the Otis Art Institute in Los Angeles and got his Bachelor of Fine Arts in 1978 (Yood). Marshall used a collage technique in his early works and was actively creating in the 1970s. However, the turning point for his career came in 1980 with the ‘Portrait of the Artist as a Shadow of His Former Self’ (Easter). It was the first of Marshall’s famous black figures that have become characteristic of his style.Marshall has been living in Chicago most of his life. He moved there with his future wife, Cheryl Lynn Bruce, in 1987 after he finished a residency for the Studio Museum in Harlem. In Chicago, he worked as a professor at the University
of Illinois from 1993 to 2006 (Yood). During this period, the artist made numerous paintings and series depicting the life and culture of African Americans and the social issues they face and received several awards. MacArthur Foundation gave Marshall’ Genius Grant’ in 1997, and Otis Art Institute awarded him with an honorary doctorate in 1999 (Yood). Other honors include a fellowship from the National Endowment for the Arts (1991), Wolfgang Hahn Prize (2014), Rosenberger Medal (2016), Chicago’s Fifth Star Award (2017) and WEB. Du Bois Medal (2019) (“Kerry James Marshall: Biography”). In 2013, Marshall was appointed to the President’s Committee on the Arts and the Humanities. The artist has been widely praised for his influence on US culture and art.Marshall’s works have been exhibited not only in the US but in Europe too. Numerous museums and art centres in Chicago, Los Angeles, New York, Washington, San Francisco, Minneapolis, and Boston hold his paintings in their collections. For example, Chicago’s Museum of Contemporary Art or Washington’s National Gallery (“Kerry James Marshall: Biography”). Other well-known institutions throughout the US have been organizing solo shows since the late 1990s. Abroad exhibitions have been held in Vancouver, Vienna, London, Kassel, Venice, Antwerp, Copenhagen, Barcelona, and Madrid. The most prominent displays were Documenta in Kassel in 1997 and 2007, the Venice Biennale in 2003, and David Zwirner in London in 2014 and 2018 (Yood; “Kerry James Marshall: Biography”). Additionally, the artist was commissioned to create a grand mural for the High Line in 2015. Such presence in museums and galleries and
is cheerful, and the image is perceived as optimistic. Easter argues that some might see a connection between the piece and the racist practice of blackface, but Marshall, most probably, did not intend to make such connections. The artist painted a black figure over a black background to show how individuals may be present but ignored by others. This concept is relevant today more than ever as societies, groups of people or individuals tend to ignore those they deem unworthy based on some biases, which is discrimination at its core.Marshall was inspired by Ralph Ellison’s novel Invisible Man written in 1952. Ralph Ellison explores “the harsh indignities of being a black in America,” being virtually non-existent in the eyes of white people because of skin color (Easter). Furthermore, ‘Portrait of the Artist’ was Marshall’s experiment with black paint. White notes how black is “as chromatically rich as every other color on the spectrum” in Marshall’s works (as cited in Easter). The experiment’s success gave the world dozens of brilliant paintings that depict the richness of African American culture and raise awareness about issues that African Americans face daily. That is why I believe that ‘Portrait of the Artist’ is an important contribution to black art.
The spectrum of race weighs heavily on the history of the United States and Canada and keeps on shaping the life experiences of Black people living in both countries. According to Reynolds (2016), not only is race a central element of history and culture, but it also determines the writing and reading of history. That is why Canada’s policy of multiculturalism contributed to the adoption of Black History Month, which initially originated in the United States and took place every February. It is the time during which people are encouraged to participate in festivities and events honoring the legacy of Black folks and their communities.Black History Month in Canada has been conducive to schools teaching about diversity and the ancestry of African cultures. Prince (2009) states that it is, indeed, extremely important – but a special month is not enough. She recalls coming to schools every February to read stories to kids, providing them with a Black perspective on their history. That, in Prince’s (2009) opinion, is simply a crumb that Blacks are offered to settle for and stop there. It contributes to the amplification of the compartmentalized version of Black people’s history, which only further perpetuates a hegemony that denies their existence. An example of that, at one time, was a librarian’s suggestion that Prince read from a collection of Anansi stories instead of something she picked from her children’s book. This was justified by the fact that none of the kids in the audience were Black, but all of them understood Anansi, as well as Prince’s book, was generally deemed too difficult. Prince politely declined but was offended, for that was a classical instance of attempts to suppress a distinct cultural vision that she was supposed to deliver.Therefore, an inclusive curriculum is not simply an option to consider – it is an absolute necessity. Instead of devoting twenty-eight days to the Black perspective and then ignoring it for the rest of the year, the government is to implement the exploration of the world’s history into the regular syllabus. Not only will it contribute to the destruction of harmful myths and to a fuller understanding of the cause-effect relationship between certain events – but it will also make Black children feel represented. For a country that prides itself on encouraging multicultural policies, all of these are equally important.
Maternal health refers to women’s wellbeing when pregnant, during childbirth, and postpartum. Black women in most parts of the world undergo unacceptable poor maternal health results, including disproportionately high death rates (Davis, 2020, p. 56). Health and societal system factors play a significant role in black women’s high maternal mortality rates and poor health outcomes. As a result, these women of color have barriers to receiving competent healthcare services and face racial discrimination. Davis (2020, p. 58) argues that factors such as sexism and racism adversely affect black women’s healthcare outcomes and medical care use. For instance, these women of color are likely to be uninsured, experience significant financial issues with healthcare, and are unlikely to access prenatal care compared to white women. At the same time, black women have high chronic health issues and preventable illnesses such as cardiovascular diseases, hypertension, and diabetes. As a result, these health conditions adversely affect infant and maternal healthcare results when these women choose to become pregnant (Davis, 2020, p. 59). However, women of color deserve healthy and safe pregnancies and childbirth. Therefore, what factors affect black maternal health, and what systematic changes should be implemented to ensure it is improved globally?There is a significant connection between black maternal health and women in social topics. For instance, some communities discriminate against women because of gender, color, physical ability, class, and ethnicity. Davis (2020, p. 59) explains that other individuals believe that men should be more powerful than women; therefore, they disregard ideas such as women’s leadership. Some people believe
that women’s primary responsibility is taking care of the home and giving birth. These perceptions adversely affect women, leading to mental health illnesses (Davis, 2020, p. 60). Therefore, it is crucial to change people’s perspectives and views about women in society. This can be achieved by encouraging the community to view women positively and accommodate them in society.The black maternal topic has attracted many people’s attention globally. As a result, it is crucial to determine why the number of women of color in maternal and childbirth deaths is increasing in the world. It is also essential to discover the causes of more maternal complications in black women than in white individuals. This topic will help individuals identify why healthcare organizations serving women of color have lower-quality maternity care. People should understand the challenges that black women experience to have reproductive care that meets their needs. This care is essential because it assists women in planning their families and enhances women’s and children’s healthcare outcomes.Intersectionality involves acknowledging and understanding that every person experiences oppression and discrimination differently. Intersectionality can be used in black maternal health topics to determine and identify its causes, such as race, physical ability, and sexual orientation. These factors have adversely affected women of color globally, leading to income inequality. For example, for every dollar paid to a non-Hispanic white man, a black woman gets sixty-three cents. Corresponding to Crear-Perry et al. (2021, p. 230), the lost wages push women of color to choose between necessities such as healthcare, food, and housing because they
Executive SummaryBusiness Goals : to capitalize on a decentralized parking system, to introduce secure payments, to increase business transparency, and to establish a digital renting environment for all consumers.Management Plan : to identify contingencies, to win support from the city administration, to allocate responsibilities among essential employees.Market Research : there are two popular applications (Parkgene and Parkaide) that offer blockchain-based parking assistance. The proposal utilizes non-fungible tokens as the key source of competitive advantage.Marketing Plan : the buyer persona for the current proposal is a male or a female car driver aged from 18 to 40. New customers will be found on social media, via referrals, and with the support of social media influencers and native advertising.Operational Plan : sales (set monetary milestones), marketing (attract people to the product), research and development (investigate the market), operations (connect with more stakeholders), people (motivate locals to engage in testing), financial and administration (scale the business and continue improving the blockchain system).Action Plan : to generate a decentralized platform for blockchain-based parking lots in order to avoid the issue of the application being disconnected; to implement real-time navigation to provide car users with relevant evidence regarding available parking spots nearby; to investigate the blockchain network to introduce new transactions based on non-fungible tokens.Bottom Line : the approximate budget for the proposal is around $200.000. The majority of financial resources are required to cover employees’ efforts and advertising.Business PlanFinding a parking spot is one of the hardest tasks that have to be completed by local citizens and visitors across busy
metropolitan cities. In addition to the time required to help a person find the best parking spot, they have to waste fuel to park their car and avoid tickets. With approximately 20 hours per annum spent by an average driver to find a parking spot, it can be safe to say that the issue has to be resolved as soon as possible (Yang et al., 2017). In addition, there are plenty of overpayments caused by unreasonably high prices for parking spaces that turn into an approximate income of $20 billion. The scarcity of parking places and their high cost could be the two intertwined reasons contributing to an increased number of road traffic accidents (Dzulkurnain et al., 2019). The inability to find a parking spot quickly could also lead to massive traffic jams. From the existing evidence, it is also clear that most governments cannot resolve that problem by simply creating new parking lots and augmenting the number of parking spots across metropolitan areas.Business GoalsThe primary business goal of the current proposal is to promote the value of decentralized parking and introduce blockchain as one of the most efficient instruments intended to contribute to a transparent network. Blockchain could become a crucial contributor to car parking improvements, as there are virtually no limits to how it could be applied to the process of developing a car parking platform (see Figure 1). Blockchain-based data storage would contribute to a real-time connection between respective sensors across parking facilities and the application developed to support blockchain parking. With the
Blockchain can be defined as a developing technology that is increasingly used in various fields of human activity. The report by Grech and Camilleri (2017) provides insight into applications of blockchain in education, which are “still in their infancy” (p. 8). The authors emphasize the numerous benefits and social advantages that this concept can bring into the academic setting. Grech and Camilleri (2017) state that “within education, activities likely to be disrupted by blockchain technology include the award of qualifications, licensing and accreditation, management of student records, intellectual property management and payments” (p. 8). Although the application of blockchain in the educational field is still underdeveloped, this technology can disrupt the student information systems market and offer numerous benefits for society.The open implementation of blockchain technology can enable the automatization of such processes as achievement record verification, certificate validation, and license issuing. Overall, Grech and Camilleri (2017) offer “eight scenarios for the application of the Blockchain in an education context, based on the current state of technology development and deployment” (p. 95). In particular, it can be used to secure certificates, verify accreditation, recognize and transfer credits automatically, and store lifelong learning passports. Furthermore, this technology can help track intellectual property, receive student payments, provide funding to students, and enhance student identification processes.Overall, the report discusses the fundamental principles of the use of blockchain in education. The authors conclude that this technology promotes such values as trust, collaboration, transparency, self-sovereignty, and disintermediation. Furthermore, Grech and Camilleri (2017) “recommend that further development of the technology in the educational field should be considered as a shared competence of the market and of public authorities” (p. 9). Blockchain can empower students and disrupt the market due to its innovative approaches to education.
Leaders choose an appropriate organizational structure depending on various factors characterizing a company. However, the most prominent ones include the environment in which the company operates, its size, the technologies available to it, business strategy, as well as the stage in the organizational life cycle. Thus, Bombas has implemented a unique employee-oriented structure and culture because the company is relatively young and focused on innovation as a core of its strategy. The company has taken the route of giving back as an essential principle of its culture and mission, engaging in charity work and encouraging employees to be proactive in helping and supporting needy people. Through fostering a welcoming environment, a “Hive” in which workers feel safe and confident to be creative and innovative, Bombas has enabled high levels of performance and satisfaction among employees. Thus, a favorable and person-oriented organizational structure and culture provide benefits to the ways in which employees behave.Bombas has shown to be highly results-driven, and the ways in which the goals are met are often experimental and boundary-pushing, which has shown to bring significant success to the performance of the team. Intrinsically, workers at Bombas are motivated to do well because their accomplishments allow them to develop as professionals and become valuable team players (Fischer, Malycha, & Schafmann, 2019). For instance, the “Surprise and Delight” program is instrumental for making employees feel that they help others, making them feel better internally. The extrinsic motivation of Bombas employees is illustrated by the array of benefits they receive, such as total health coverage, company-sponsored professional development programs, unlimited time off, or a flexible working-from-home policy.
IntroductionHaving adequate knowledge and information before making financial decisions such as investing in stocks, bonds or cryptocurrency is very important. Understanding the advantages and weaknesses can help one know where to invest their finances best. For instance, company stocks of firms such as Nestle and Volkswagen are very attractive and promise a great amount of profit for individuals looking for opportunities to invest. Despite this, some people who own stocks in such firms are looking for other opportunities to invest in cryptocurrency after trading in their holdings in stocks and bonds. Buying crypto, especially bitcoin, is now like a trend, and many individuals are entering the crypto space without assessing the trade’s pros and cons or weaknesses. This paper looks at the financial advantages of Russian bonds, Nestle, and Volkswagen stocks while also looking at the weaknesses of cryptocurrency in an attempt to help reach a financial decision on investment.Financial Advantages of Nestle Stock, Russian Bonds, And Volkswagen StockFinancial Advantages of Nestle StockNestle, one of the largest food groups globally, raised a whole-year sales target after reaping the benefits of price increases on its products, that range from bottled water to pet food. According to Nestle S.A. ADR Stock Price & News (2022), the company whose shares saw an increase of more than three percent has eclipsed other companies by leveraging the strength of brands like Perrier water. According to (Affonso, Dias & Pinto, 2021), the firm further increased prices in the last quarter of 2021. The same is expected this year when input costs are
anticipated to rise even more than the four percent witnessed last year.Nestle, like its peers, is facing challenges with the supply chain as the global economy is still trying to fight against COVID-19. The hikes in prices should help ensure the margin’s steadiness at around seventeen percent, followed by an average margin boost in the midterm (Affonso et al., 2021). The company raised its annual organic growth guidance to between six and seven percent from five to six percent after the sales improved to about seven percent in the third quarter of 2021. The volume growth is anticipated to slow as the boost witnessed currently because of the pandemic wanes (Affonso et al., 2021). According to Nestle S.A. ADR Stock Price & News (2022), the benefits of greater volumes and pricing would fully show this year.Financial Advantages of Volkswagen StocksThere is evidence that this stock should be a great choice for investors, for instance, a surge in recent price momentum shows an increasing interest of investors in the stock. According to Volkswagen AG Stock Price & News (2022), it is clearly well-positioned with a one-month price change of about four percent. Whereas all stocks have the potential of witnessing a hike in price for a small period, a real momentum player is needed to deliver positive returns for an extended period. Volkswagen stock is in that category as the stock witnessed a gain of seven percent over the last year (Affonso et al., 2021). Additionally, the momentum for this stock is fast-paced, as it has a
beta of around two (Affonso et al., 2021). This shows that it moves sixty percent higher than the market in any direction.Given the price performance, it is clear why the Volkswagen stock scores a B in momentum. This suggests that the best time to choose to purchase stocks from Volkswagen would be now if one desires to benefit from the momentum. Additionally, a rising trend in earnings estimate revisions has helped the stock earn a high ranking, ranked second by Zacks. Research reveals that the momentum influence is strong among the top stocks. The reason for this is that more investors have developed an interest in stocks that cover analysts and have raised the earnings estimates, which helps in keeping the prices up. The Volkswagen stock is trading at a great valuation despite processing fast-paced momentum traits. Regarding the Price-to-Sales ratio, the stock currently appears cheap (Affonso et al., 2021). For every dollar of sales, an investor only needs fifty-eight cents.Financial Advantages of BondsInvesting in stocks, especially those belonging to companies such as Nestle, is great. It becomes even better when someone invests in bonds such as Russian bonds. The financial weaknesses that can be found in stocks are eliminated by choosing bonds (Isaac, 2020). For instance, the volatility in bonds is lower than in stocks which shows that even though it is safe to invest in stocks, it is safer to do so in bonds. Additionally, stocks suffer from more day-to-day volatility than bonds (Reboredo, Ugolini & Aiube, 2020). The interest payments are higher in
of nowhere. This means that one could lose everything while investing in the crypto business if they do not comprehend for what they are signing up. This continues to be seen as more prominent investors continue to be involved in the business and use different tactics.Trading in crypto is different from how someone can trade in a traditional market. For instance, it is still a challenge to access leverage. A trader particularly has to pay a funding raise to maintain their options and thus positions open, which is expensive. Therefore, one must note that unlike conventional markets, where there is a huge amount of leverage plus borrowing that they can get at low costs, crypto leveraged cash is expensive.ConclusionThe paper has shown the differences between investing in bonds, stocks, and cryptocurrency by revealing the financial advantages of stocks and bonds while also showing the weaknesses of cryptocurrency. For instance, individuals who own stocks at Nestle will earn more profits this year than even last since it is expected that the company will raise the prices to more than four percent seen in 2021. Volkswagen stock is gaining interest from many investors as its earnings estimates are high. This means that the price, like that of Nestle, will also rise. The Crypto business, as popular as it is, continues to welcome sophisticated investors who are applying various tactics which can make others lose as they gain. Additionally, also paying a funding raise to maintain one’s options in crypto is more expensive than investing in bonds.
Since the business sphere is closely connected with human communications and relationships, the psychological aspects of people’s behavior play an important role in this field. Regarding customer relations, one of the most prominent business concepts in creating relationships with people is marketing and advertising. In turn, these aspects of operations are involved in developing important details of any company’s business, such as brand strategy and impact on consumption levels. Various companies, including established and new ones, explore ways of implementing the concept of stimulus generalization in brand strategy elaboration.To explain the aspects of brand strategy, it is essential first to discuss the theory of information processing and identify its relation to mental responses. The theory of information processing, which is a cognitive approach to explaining how the human mind changes sensory data, is strongly related to brand strategy creation since individuals encounter visual information constantly. This paradigm proposes that information obtained from the environment is subjected to mental processes other than basic stimulus-response sequences. In terms of business activities, this theoretical aspect can be devoted to marketing, advertising, and public relations activities since these sectors are mostly concentrated on communicating with people, including potential customers.A brand strategy is considered to be a planned statement that outlines a set of long-term objectives that eventually lead to people recognizing and preferring a brand. The brand’s mission, its obligations to customers, and how these aspects are presented are part of an effective branding strategy. A branding strategy cannot be determined as the summation of a logo, color scheme, or
website; although these visual components are essential to a successful brand strategy, they can be potentially misinterpreted. All of the subjective components that create brand recognition, brand equity, and brand perception over time are fundamental to a branding strategy. An excellent brand strategy’s fundamental aim is to let the community know that a brand exists, what concepts and ideas it represents, and what characterizes it. Every business is possible select a distinctive and unique method to measure success, but all will incorporate the same theoretical aspects in their strategy.Referring to the various theoretical influences of the brand strategy, it is important to highlight the ideas of learning and memory that are connected to visual perception. Emphasizing the concepts of learning and memory, it is obligatory to examine behavioral learning and the difference between classical and operant conditioning, including the comparison with discrimination of stimulus. Classical conditioning can be described as the process when one stimulus is combined with another that fails to generate a reaction. A second stimulation, referred to as the conditioned stimulus, triggers the response over some period. When an unconditioned stimulus is consistently coupled with a neuronal input to create a reaction, the unconditioned stimulus becomes a conditioned stimulus for that reaction. The approach of modifying behavior through reinforcement after the desired response is known as operant conditioning. Customers can be persuaded to engage in a certain behavior if they anticipate the behavior will result in a favorable consequence. Since the behavior is systematically maintained through positive or negative reinforcement and penalty when
the stimuli are accessible and not when they are missing, discriminative stimuli have influence over a specific behavior.In order to affect customer behavior, particular brands frequently utilize stimulus generalization concepts. The propensity to react to stimuli that are identical or similar to the initial conditioned stimulus is defined as stimulus generalization. To put it differently, it is determined as the capacity to act in a new circumstance in a manner that has been learned in previous comparable positions. With regard to the presence and use of stimulus generalization in the process of creating a brand strategy, it is possible to emphasize the implementation of this concept in both new and already established organizations. A renowned, well-known brand, for instance, generally has a trustworthy and instantly identifiable design. Customers are mainly certain that the goods will be of excellent quality when they notice a conspicuous design. A newer or less popular business is feasible to attempt to profit from the reputation of a well-known label by using the same color palette, logo positioning, typography, and other design elements in its packaging. In this case, the competitor’s objective would be to elicit the same emotional response from customers as they do for the established brand. The newer firm has a better probability of effectively impacting customers’ purchasing behavior after this generalization has evolved.In addition, established companies can substantially benefit from the consequences of stimulus generalization. Such businesses will frequently use their prominent packaging design for a variety of their items. Customers may have had a favorable encounter with
Industrial authority and its improvement in Hong Kong on a review on relative industrial authority are the paper’s title to be critiqued in this critique. It is an article on corporate governance authored by Bryane Michael and S.H. Goo. The authors of the article have reviewed the developments in Hong Kong in company governance. As the discipline of corporate governance narrows, much empirical observation checks the very characteristics of company governance (Michael & Goo, 2015). Policy- and legal-related policies look at the normative corporate governance reform issues yet reasoning about corporate governance in itself as a matter involves having a look at the refinement at the country level. The stance here is true regarding thinking about corporate governance at the country level as this involves consideration of every individual in that particular country. This paper and critique focus on the strengths and weaknesses of corporate governance concerning business ethics and Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR).The background of this article is all about corporate governance concerning the entire country. Its purpose is to find out to what degree the experience of Hong Kong proves or disapproves theories from company governance for various issues and concerns. These issues include; executive compensation, ownership of the family, self-dealing, and concentration in Hong Kong, among others. Corporate governance emerges to be the main idea of this article. Being the argument of the article, the authors review the corporate government on its recent developments in Hong Kong as a key place in the USA. They have viewed it on various dimensions like the
degree of family control, self-benefit harms, and feasible results of shareholder’s attentiveness on company authority execution.The authors have organized their study in some manner to enhance understandability and the information flow in some different sections. They have provided an outline of the company governance in Hong Kong, and also show how better corporate governance in Hong Kong at least correlates with higher share price premiere in one section (Michael & Goo, 2015). Another section shows an outline of crucial company governance from outside the United States and how to handle the socially disastrous household dominance of outlined corporations. Another segment is the third which deals with the self-advantage of an organizational position between connected parties. In this case, for instance, a late study of the economic wave has considered the role of such self-benefit on share-holder values and the company performance, yet nobody has looked at the fit of such self-benefit to the picture of the wider company governance. The fourth section focus on the intensive shareholdings and their roles in decreasing the quality of industrial governance and the fifth provides an outline of two key matters in many authorities.The argument in the article is effective or convincing according to the author’s findings in this article. For instance, on contrasting two different corporate government measures looking at the perspective of the commerce system generally and the other at particular industrial governance practices, Hong Kong rates excellently or poorly according to the authors. This depends on which industrial government consideration is looked at. Hong Kong is rated
second just after Singapore by the statistics of the competitive forum of the world. This means that this region has much more to do in comparison to other countries to achieve maximum scores regarding these evaluations. Therefore, according to the authors, the accounting area seems to be best for Hong Kong companies regarding companies’ industrial governance practices in Hong Kong. The outcomes assigned to different features of industrial control in Hong Kong are in line with the CSLA analyst including compliance with general accounting principle regulations and policies and rules applicable to corporate governance culture. Therefore, this activity seems an important issue concerning the evaluation of Hong Kong companies as there is a clear indication of ethics in corporations’ evaluations.Families’ control in corporate lives is another important issue detected by authors in this article in Hong Kong. Households have continuously managed and continue to control Hong Kong’s companies (Michael & Goo, 2015). This indicates that Hong Kong has relatively grown from family-controlled individualism. According to the authors, families in Hong Kong controls the subsequent highest share of the corporations within the neighborhood from Indonesia. Yet the Tai of the families of Tai-pan controls few of the industries than other authorities. The weakness associated with family-based corporate governance is that it risks crowding out the non-family-based interests hence family interest discriminates or crowds out productive investment. This issue, therefore, calls for a policy to seek to change the status quo hence enabling corporations to work towards enhancing positive business ethics and good corporate social responsibility to society.
Good companies’ CSR and business ethics are of great importance to society as they enhance the community’s welfare.Another important issue put into consideration in this article by the authors is the encouragement to engage in government-related activism of Hong Kong pensions. Pension investment leads concerning the historical evidence show domestic investments lead to a broad increase of corporations and better oversight over these corporations. In consideration of the given example, Sweden gives a useful and recent sample for Hong Kong. This is due to its size, that is, economic terms, population terms, and the fast development led by the government of a national pension company. Better corporate governance with a government relation, therefore, means good business ethics and proper CSR of the corporations working concerning the government. Companies’ positive relationship with the government ensures that the companies work toward the interest of the society, hence the importance to the community due to good business ethics and corporate social responsibility. The strength of this character of the companies and the government leads to a positive attribute towards working to the social interest and ensuring acceptable corporations’ behaviors towards society.Self-dealing reduction by connected individuals or parties is another important issue considered by the article’s authors. They suggest that connected parties often lead to more harm than good. Transactions of the associated parties in Hong Kong reduce shareholder value. According to the authors, measuring the expropriation extent by insiders measures the degree to which the scope of transactions of the connected parties affects the value of the firm in
Goo, 2015). This means negative corporate governance which also reflects negative business ethics and CSR. Reducing concentration, therefore, will be of much importance to the community by converting the negative view to a positive one. This will mean better relations among the real shareholders hence working towards the interest of the society.Other important issues considered include; non-members concentrated holdings, derivative actions on empowering minority shareholders, open-ended vehicles to open closed companies, Hong Kong’s two-non issues corporate governance, and corporations’ accounting and auditing which seems to be ok. In derivative action towards empowering minority shareholders, a common-sense instinct that shareholders’ lawsuits increase the value of the firm by cleaning up industrial governance is much supported by the econometric evidence (Michael & Goo, 2015). Corporate governance clearing means negative business ethics and CSR in corporations. In another view to enhancing good corporate governance, executive remuneration is necessary. This remuneration represents an important issue in corporate governance hence it is of much importance to the companies. When corporate governance is sorted, it results in good business ethics from the executives toward shareholders and all the organizational stakeholders. It also enhances good CSR by ensuring companies work towards the interest of society. Conclusively, corporate governance, good business ethics, and CSR are necessary for the betterment of corporations and hence must be enhanced.
Various cultures around the world have unique creation myths and traditional methods of presenting them through art. The cosmology of the Aztec civilization was quite different from the Europeans that conquered them. Firstly, the Europeans’ Christian God “created mankind in his own image” and granted him dominion over a perfectly constructed world, the Garden of Eden (Holy Bible, New International Version, Genesis 1:27). In the Bible, he is described as a benevolent, if strict, father figure who can forgive humankind their sins and grant them eternal redemption. Consequently, God is depicted in art as a wise, older man with a beard and white hair. Christian art primarily praises the power of His forgiveness and the bountiful nature that He created.In contrast, Aztec creation stories are based on dismembered gods, and thus the origin of the world is catastrophic violence, which explains why Aztec art depicts divinity as gruesome and awe-inspiring (National University, 2022). Their art functions as a warning and an order to obey. They demand blood in exchange for food, and each sculpture of the gods in Aztec culture contains a receptacle for human hearts (National University, 2022). Unlike Christianity, the central figure is a female goddess, but similarly to Eve, she is primarily a passive player whom the other gods punish. Furthermore, Coatlique’s choice to give birth a second time against her children’s wishes could also be interpreted as the Aztec version of Eve’s sin of disobedience.Both Aztec and Christian gods are described as perfect and self-contained. However, in the Aztec mythos, gods are above the concepts of good and evil, while in the Christian order evil is considered the dominion of Satan and the opposite of God. Therefore, Aztecs have to appease a bloodthirsty, violent goddess to receive food and survive. On the other hand, Christians have to reject sin and submit their spirit to God to gain eternal salvation. Ultimately, the Christian creation story is based on forgiveness and love compared to the Aztecs’ survival through violence, and this difference is reflected in their opposing art styles.
IntroductionCalifornia has passed a bill to reduce the number of prisons. The state considers this a big step towards serious judicial reform, because the number of people in custody will decrease. My research question is to find out how this Realignment was a viable remedy to the California prison system overcrowding. We should care about the question because overcrowding in places of detention is a serious humanitarian problem. Such conditions restrict the rights and freedoms of prisoners. They increase the potential for conflict situations and circumstances that can lead to destabilization of the operational situation inside correctional institutions.It is important to know the answer to decide whether to apply prison reductions in regions where the problem of overcrowding is particularly sensitive. The confirmation or refutation of the effectiveness of the mechanism used in California depends on its further application to solve an acute problem. When investigating the similar research question previous scholars have found that the reform used in California has serious drawbacks. In particular, when the area of detention was reduced, there was no significant reduction in crime.The basic themes I use as headings in my literature review area are the humanity of prison reductions, the consequences of reforming the penitentiary system and access to justice. The current research is missing research regarding the assessment of how the implementation of the prison system reform program takes into account the needs of society. In this paper, I will use empirical research methods, namely the study of scientific research and the analysis of the information received. This
proposed study will advance knowledge and fill holes in the current research record by focusing on the new aspect of the problem. Instead of using the number of prisoners per square meter as indicators of overpopulation, the conditions of detention will serve as a guideline in this work.Literature ReviewIntroThe independent variable in this research is the number of prisons. The two dependent variables are the number of prisoners and their conditions of detention. The existing research says that there are currently six prison facilities in California. Moreover, according to researchers, there are 9 prisoners per one employee of the penitentiary system in California (Bartos and Kubrin 2018). In addition, according to the report, California is among the five states with the highest proportion of female prisoners (Bird, Nguyen, and Grattet 2021). Researchers claim that this is a special group of prisoners who need certain conditions.The existing experience of reducing the number of prisons in California is of some interest to researchers. The three trends in the research record are primarily a discussion of the humanity of keeping prisoners in new conditions. The articles attempt to study a number of humanitarian problems of the detention of citizens of California (Bird, Nguyen, and Grattet 2021). Also, existing studies discuss the consequences of reforming the penitentiary system both for the prisoners themselves and for society (Lin 2018). The third trend that can be noticed in research is the raising of the issue of methods for reducing prisoners (Grattet, Bird, and Nguyen 2017). The authors are concerned about the associated
reduction in access to justice.Humanity of Prison ReductionsThe gaps in the current state of knowledge related to this research question are connected with the fact that numerical values are usually provided in research. For example, overcrowding in California prisons is proved by calculating the population density or the number of employees per inmate (Bartos and Kubrin 2018). However, the studies do not use comparisons of the compliance of the content of the execution of punishment with international standards in this area. The deterioration of the order of serving sentences for California convicts is not determined by the conditions of their imprisonment. The worsening of the medical and sanitary and material support of convicts mentioned in the studies is brief and insignificant (Bartos and Kubrin 2018). They are not described in sufficient detail and are mainly presented in the form of numerical values.The sources of uncertainty are the criteria by which it is necessary to determine the humanitarian well-being of prisoners. With the reduction in the number of prisons in California, the number of people per institution has increased (Bird, Nguyen, and Grattet 2021). However, scientists cannot come to a consensus on how much should be spent on food and personal belongings of prisoners per month (Welsh 2019). There are also disagreements about the area of the cell and the location of the beds (Bird, Nguyen, and Grattet 2021). In addition, there are different points of view regarding the need to take into account the psychological state of prisoners (Grattet, Bird, and Nguyen 2017). Any discrimination can
become one of the criteria for increased density.Consequences of Reforming the Penitentiary SystemIt is known that reducing the number of prison buildings is not equivalent to reducing the number of persons serving a criminal sentence. However, it has not yet been fully investigated how the reform affected prisoners. The opinions of scientists were divided as to how the changes affected compliance with international penitentiary standards (Welsh 2019). The list of problems faced by the California penitentiary system is not fully defined (Bartos and Kubrin 2018). There is a normative consolidation of the rights of prisoners, but the possibility of practical implementation and protection of the rights and legitimate interests of convicts remains unclear.The sources of disagreement are the assessment of the problems of ensuring the conditions of serving sentences in California correctional institutions and ways to solve them. Some scientists are not sure that the problems that have arisen in the execution of custodial sentences face the same problems (Grattet, Bird, and Nguyen 2017). Some researchers believe that as a result of the reform, the conditions of detention have ceased to comply with the normative ones (Lin 2018). Other scientists tend to think that California prisons have strict conditions of detention, but do not violate international norms (Bird, Nguyen, and Grattet 2021). Therefore, there is a certain interest in the organization of ensuring the regime and safety of prisoners in California prisons from the point of view of the prisoners themselves.Access to JusticeScientists agree that it is possible to avoid overcrowding in prisons in conditions of
a reduction in their number only with a decrease in the crime rate. However, it is not known which mechanisms to achieve this goal will be really effective. Some researchers advocate the humanization and improvement of criminal legislation (Bartos and Kubrin 2018). Other scientists see the threat that the introduction of forced labor instead of imprisonment will lead to the opposite effect (Welsh 2019). Mitigation of punishment may cause an increase in motivation to commit criminally punishable crimes. Eventually, this will lead to overcrowding of prisons.Experts disagreed: some believe that the decrease in the number of people in prison is not due to a decrease in the growth of crime. They support the policy of consistent humanization of criminal penalties implemented in California (Bartos and Kubrin 2018). Other researchers fear an increase in violent crimes associated with mitigation of punishment (Bird, Nguyen, and Grattet 2021). They claim that there are no fewer offenders, punishments have become less severe. The number of convicts in the colonies is getting smaller, but the number of persons registered with the criminal executive inspections is increasing. Thus, it is not fully understood how the liberalization of penal enforcement policy affects the number of prisoners in California.SummaryThe research proposal of this paper aims to study the conditions of detention of prisoners in California prisons in order to compare them with established international standards. The data specified in the official documentation will be taken as the criterion of the prison overcrowding. Crime statistics will also be compared before and after the implementation of
the reform in California. Based on statistics, a potential increase in the level of crimes in the future will be predicted using a special computer program.MethodologyIndependent data – the number of prisons – will be needed after calculating the further increase in crimes according to statistics. Dividing them by the number of prisons, it will be possible to predict the possibility of overpopulation of California prisons in the near future. Dependent variables – the conditions of detention of prisoners and their number – will be used to determine the compliance of imprisonment in California with international standards. Indicators such as the area of residential premises, as well as the presence of conditions of detention that may cause discrimination, will be considered.To collect data, I plan to use various international documents containing standards for the detention of prisoners. I will also use crime data published on the official websites of California and state executive agencies. In order to collect information about the conditions of detention, it seems to me important to pay attention to the testimony of the prisoners themselves, so I will use interviews with them. I will mainly turn to video interviews to pay attention not only to verbal, but also to non-verbal signals. In addition, in this way I will be able to give an approximate external description of the prisoner’s condition. Accordingly, if there are signs of obvious physical and mental distress, it will be possible to assert non-compliance with the standards of detention, which in most cases arise as a result of
overcrowding in prisons.I have a research hypothesis about the nature and direction of the relationship between my independent and dependent variables. I think that by dividing the number of criminals by the number of prisons in California, I can calculate their occupancy. Further, to obtain the value of another variable – the conditions of detention – it is necessary to use numerical values of the area of premises in the building, the number of employees, funding per prisoner.I do not have sufficient psychological knowledge to conduct a survey with prisoners. Some of them may intentionally describe the conditions of detention as unbearable in order to shorten their time in places of restriction of freedom. Therefore, it seems to me more appropriate to analyze existing interviews with California prisoners recorded on video. Thus, it will be possible, based on the behavior of the convict, to determine whether he is experiencing psychological or physical discomfort, indicating violations of the conditions of detention and overpopulation. This study is a trend, since the signs of improper conditions of detention appear quite quickly and persist for a long time.FindingsOfficial statistics show that the number of prisoners in California colonies has significantly decreased and has become minimal. However, crime rates have not decreased: they continue to grow. Many crimes have been decriminalized, which has caused an increase in their commission. Instead of imprisonment, criminals are punished with compulsory, correctional and forced labor. The area of the prison divided by the number of prisoners obtained according to statistics is less than the values
Being a well-developed market with a high purchasing power of the population, Canada presents an array an opportunities for foreign exports, namely the U.S. Within this framework, agricultural exports reflect a considerable part of the overall trade. Canada remains the U.S.’s second-largest partner in this regard, and the relations are supported by favorable agreements between the nations. This report evaluates Canada as an agricultural export destination with an emphasis on nuts and pistachios, in particular.The process of agricultural export into Canada is well-regulated, which promotes the safety and transparency of trade relations. According to the U.S. International Trade Administration, Canada accounts for 15% of the country’s total agricultural exports with $22 billion, most of which are consumer-oriented. Through this exchange, Canada receives high-value products for its population, whereas the U.S. support over 130,000 jobs. Since 1989, most American agricultural products have entered Canada duty-free under the NAFTA and U.S.-Canada Free Trade Agreement, currently replaced by the USMCA. Supply-managed products, such as dairy and eggs, are not covered by the agreement, which still implies that pistachio export will benefit from duty-free relations. As per the agreement, all shipments are required to have a USMCA Certification of Origin in addition to the standard export documentation package (Government of Canada). For the consumer’s safety, Canada requests all exporters to provide a Phytosanitary Certificate for plant products. They officially confirmed that they are pest-free, conforming with the importer’s sanitary requirements, and have been inspected by the authorized agency of the United States (Government of Canada). This way, the overall safety
Article Counterpoint: Cultural Protectionism Is Necessary in Canada is written by Jeff Klassen and is published in Canadian Points of View: Cultural Protectionisms, which is the property of Great Neck Publishing. The principal thesis of the paper states that cultural protectionism is especially important for Canada in cultural, economic, and political aspects. Canada is actively working in this direction, but the growing pace of globalization and, in particular, American influence require a decent resolution to the concern of preserving cultural heritage and self-identification. The central purpose of this article is to draw attention to the current state of affairs on the world stage and emphasize the essential for cultural protectionism.Arguments of the WorkThe author emphasizes the importance of his judgments mainly with economic arguments, relegating the cultural aspect to the background. He argues that Canada, being a politically stable country, uses cultural protectionism primarily to protect vulnerable industries from the massive American influence. Klassen pays particular attention to the media and art industries, which experience severe competition from imported products. All the statistics given in the article testify to the insufficient financing of enterprises and cultural security measures and the low interest of residents.Evidence and ConclusionIn Klassen’s work, one can see an active call for the separation of Canadian culture from an American one without turning into anti-Americanism. To argue his position, the author gives examples and brief comments on much evidence taken by Canada concerning cultural protectionism. For example, active support for the UNESCO Diversity Convention, the creation of the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation to increase Canadian content on radio, the organizing of the Canadian Heritage Department to protect cultural heritage. Everything is particularly compared with the American influence and position. The final thought of the article suggests that cultural protection is necessary for Canada’s economy and culture. However, this approach is not supposed to be overly confrontational.

IntroductionThis final project requires that I develop a Training and Organizational Development (OD) proposal aimed at improving diversity training at Cape Coral Hospital. It is important to note that many organizations see the management of diversity programs as not being limited to HRD programs and processes, but expanded to include special needs of the new employees. Therefore as the HRD manager for Cape Coral Hospital, my task is to propose new training programs and processes to senior management, and explain how HRD methods can help manage a culturally diverse workforce.Benefits of Cultural DiversityEmbracing and supporting cultural diversity comes with a lot of benefits. First, having a diverse workforce is critical for any company that is focused on reaching its true potential. Cultural diversity helps organizations experience strong appeal on the global canvas as well as improved innovation (Kamales & Knorr, 2019). As for Cape Coral Hospital, cultural diversity mean more engaged workers coupled with high retention and quality patient care. Other benefits of diversity in workplace include promotion of varied perspectives, improvement of profits and revenue, attraction of best talent, boosting of global reputation and easy troubleshooting. An organization that ignores cultural diversity may end up encountering a lot of problems such as employment discrimination lawsuits. In a nutshell, by supporting a more diverse workforce, Cape Coral Hospital will support variety of perspective.As the HRD manager for Cape Coral Hospital, recognizing and valuing employees is of great benefit, especially when they come from diverse cultures. This is the case because it leads to high innovation—when different
cultures work together, there are more opportunities for increased creativity (Kamales & Knorr, 2019). Similarly, valuing workers makes them feel appreciated and empowered to work. Based on these issues, the recruitment process of new employees for Cape Coral Hospital should be approached in a holistic manner to ensure the minority employees do not feel left out.Some Key DemographicsCurrently women account for approximately 47 percent of the overall workface. This number is projected to remain constant until the end of 2022. While the projections do not give the exact percentage, it is expected that the number will rise due to sudden increase in single-parent families. Additionally, about 20 percent of those living with disability according to ADA are in the workforce (Sprong et al., 2019). This number is expected to increase in a few years to come. Lastly, the average age of workforce is increasing every day.New Training ProgramsFor the senior management at Cape Coral Hospital, there are important new training programs that I would propose in an effort to develop effective recruitment and selection methods to attract more minorities. The new training programs for consideration will start at the top of the organization. The success of the programs will require the organization to have a chief diversity officer to steer the training in the direction it needs to go. Most importantly, Cape Coral Hospital should put in place a diversity leadership council to help identify areas that require more attention.Ethnicity and Race Identity ProgramThis training program will be aimed at helping the senior management differentiate between
ethnicity and race. They need to understand that ethnicity is a learned behavior while race is biologically determined. The aim of this training program is to help identify the different categories of people that are known to face discrimination. This program will guide the development of effective recruitment and selection method because it comes with unconscious bias course. This course will help employees understand their own biases and, in return, reducing the gap and encourage diversity in workplace.Disabilities and Physical Abilities ProgramThis training program aims at helping senior management to train employees the importance of working together—it improves employee engagement. Therefore, the program is important as it instructs senior management on why and how to ensure the workplace environment is ADA compliant (Stevens et al., 2018). As indicated earlier, about 20 percent of those living with disability according to ADA are working. This means that Cape Coral Hospital should support their needs. The program also strives to remind the senior managers the benefits of hiring people with diverse disabilities.Gender-based Training ProgramThis program is intended at reminding senior management that gender is an internal diversity—a characteristic that people are born with. The training program also strives to show them how discrimination among sexes occurs in different workplaces. Therefore, gender-based training program will train senior management how to remove biases linked to gender, thus making workplace more diverse and inclusive. If followed through, the program will help the organization keep the employees at work while, at the same, attract more minorities and women. The advantage of this program
is that it removes discrimination.Age-related Training ProgramThis program is intended at informing the management the fact that the hospital, regardless of time and period, will have a composition of workers from different generations. These groups have their own ideals and belief which can lead to biases, ageism. According to Zaniboni et al. (2019) ageism “is a tendency to harbor negative feelings against employees of different age” (p. 453). This training is necessary because age discrimination can occur at any age. This program will encourage inclusion within the workforce, thus making the company attractive to employees of all ages.Citizen Status ProgramThis training is necessary because there are high chances of finding immigrants at any place of work. The problem these individuals face is that despite having their citizenship, there is always a rift with those who grew up in the area. Therefore, it is imperative for senior management to implement this training program because it helps remove unconscious biases in the workplace. In essence, citizen status training program will improve the organization’s overall diversity. This, in turn, will bring diverse ideas on the table thus attracting more workers, especially the minority groups.The role of senior managementCape Coral Hospital’s senior management has the authority to implement the aforementioned new training programs alongside other advantages such as flexible work schedules, onsite daycare and childcare subsides. This will attract new hires and, at the same time, make them feel at ease working for the organization. The senior management should specify how they value cultural and religious traditions including holidays. The
new programs should motivate the management to focus more on forming affinity groups that will empower staff on how to work in teams in order to meet patients’ needs.New Training ProcessesThe new training processes that I propose to senior management include: making their commitment clear, encouraging objectivity, screening and interviewing and inclusive interviewing. With regard to making their commitment clear, the senior management will receive training on how to ensure the images on career pages represent their commitment to diversity. Similarly, they will be trained on how to communicate their values and dedication to diversity and inclusion. It is important to note that potential recruits are interested in knowing where the organization stands on some issues before opting to work for it.Encouraging ObjectivityAnother new training process the senior management will be educated on is on how to encourage objectivity. Here, Cape Coral Hospital’s management will receive training on how to make a multi-tier approach part of the organization’s recruitment policy. For example, senior managers should prioritize reviewing every candidate’s resume and preliminary Q&A before the interview process starts (Epstein, 2019). The training will guide them on how and why they should make the first tier of screening mandatory. The aim is to ensure the organization is able to monitor consistent assessment.Screening and interviewingThis training aims at ensuring the organization has an effective screening process in place to evaluate the potential new hires. This program is necessary as it strives to address the biases, either conscious or unconscious, that interfere with decision making process. In other words,
the training aims at ensuring all the resources put in place to attract new hires do not go to waste. The senior management will trained on the need to make the members of the hiring team more diverse—this allows them challenge issues related to affinity bias.Inclusive InterviewingThe last training process is on how the senior management should conduct inclusive interviewing. The senior management should understand that job interviews come with a lot of anxiety. Therefore, this program aims at training the management on how best to ensure the potential recruits feel they are welcomed and on the same level. For instance, the team will be trained on how to utilize a two-stage interview process to address the issue. Some organizations start their process with a blind phone interview before conducting in-person meeting.Additional Information  * The management should implement policies and guidelines that support equal employment opportunities: the policies should focus on employment criterion that extends beyond gender, race and age.  * The management should make the candidates’ positions more compelling to potential applicants: consider providing some key details that will attract a diverse range of recruits  * The senior management should ensure the employees understand the decisions for hiring are best on merits: hiring is not based on quotas.HRD MethodsThe HRD methods such as job rotation, assistant to position, committee assignment, and outdoor training can be utilized to manage a culturally diverse workforce. Firstly, the management should ensure job rotation involves all the employees regardless of gender, age and race (Diego-Mas, 2020). This
questions regarding the life and worldview of introverts. The text is characterized by a high degree of subjectivism and a pronounced bias towards the category of extrovert readers. The author compares extroverts with “puppy dogs” who can listen to a person for a minute and then start “barking” again. Such a comparison is pejorative and may cause an ambiguous reaction in the reader (Rauch 133). In addition, the author directly states that introverts are a more intelligent, reflective, and sensitive category of people. Every conclusion has the right to be presented for acceptance; however, a rather dismissive tone towards extroverts may, on the contrary, cause rejection of the message.The position of the author is coherent and has the potential to find its reader and supporter. However, the aftertaste from its reading is rather ambiguous and makes one think about the excessive tendentiousness of the writer. The text does not compare two different categories of people but vigorously downplays the principal personality traits of extroverts. The author says that the world would be much calmer and saner under the guidance of introverts. This theory may well be valid; however, perhaps the world should not be so sharply divided into “white” and “black,” “extroverts,” and “introverts.” This article does a good job of its central purpose: to illustrate an alternative radical vision of the modern model of society separated mainly between extroverts and introverts.
I would like to thank my descendants that my work is not forgotten. This story of eternal love is probably relevant in your days, so there are many film adaptations and versions of ‘Romeo and Juliet’. The new adaptation of my play generally made a controversial impression: the actors look suitable for their roles, but the internal theme of the play seems to be not so profoundly got.Carlo Carlea’s ‘Romeo and Juliet’ (2013) was filmed on medieval sites and villas in various Italian cities with a minimum of historical inaccuracies. The play of some characters is good: Hayley Steinfeld reminds us that Juliet was a child by modern standards, not yet a woman. Some of the scenes have been reworked to understand the story by the younger public better. The details have been changed, and the lines have been cut to maintain the frantic emotional level that modern audiences demand. As soon as the film opens, it becomes obvious that the prologue has been transformed. Romeo does not exude an ounce of passion or romance, although he is slightly more masculine in terms of manner, voice, and fighting than in previous incarnations. I wonder if the director and producers understood the play’s timeless themes.They made a film that, I think, includes humanity’s greatest weaknesses and strengths when it comes to both love and lust. However, once the characters begin to behave radically differently, with dialogue thoughtlessly thrown in and topics ignored or trampled upon, it ceases to be an adaptation and instead becomes a parody. The adaptation seems to fall short of the problems posed in the original play.
The narrative structure in the movie Carol is distinct due to the focus on intricate elements of storytelling. The main reason for deviation from the traditional forms of the narrative approach is rooted in the fact that Carol provides a multitude of perspectives. The film does not solely revolve around Carol or Therese but rather smoothly transitions from one subplot to another. Both perspectives naturally merge into one cohesive and compelling story rich in information, emotion, and story elements.Firstly, it is important to note that the given film’s setting takes place in the 1950s, when the world was significantly more conservative and restrictive, especially in regard to the members of the LGBTQ+ community. However, “it’s the way the decidedly modern sensibility of the narrative meets classic style that is the point” (Turan par. 4). In other words, the modern approach of utilizing several viewpoints on the story combined with classical stylistics makes the narrative structure unique and intricate. The film is shot in such a way that viewers regularly become mere observers of the characters, who convey their emotional states not through words but rather through facial expressions, settings, postures, and musical backgrounds. Another review states that viewers watch “the characters through the windows of a car or house and left them in a hazy focus” (Raynes par. 8). At various points in the film, viewers can observe the protagonists sitting or standing behind windows, resembling the realistic experience since it is usually how people see strangers rather than being part of private conversations.Secondly, the narrative
another without any rigid transitions. Therefore, the film’s narrative puts a great deal of emphasis on non-verbal communication because it wants to keep conversations and interactions as realistic as possible.However, the emotional elements and key aspects of the characters’ exchanges are delivered through gazing, staring, smiles, and other forms of expression. Under the conditions of such a narrative, the role of a judge is assumed not by the director, producer, or scriptwriter but by the viewer, and moreover, not by an individual viewer but by the audience. If the audience is captivated by the cinematic image, emotions and feelings awakened in it, then the filmmaker has successfully completed the task. In other words, in Carol’s narrative structure, the delivery of meaning and essence is carried out through the captivating followership of the protagonists.In conclusion, the selected movie’s narrative differs from the traditional forms due to the use of several perspectives from which protagonists can be met and observed. The transitions between one subplot to another are intricately smooth, which ensures the cohesiveness of one singular story. The film does not try to explain but rather shows in its natural setting without excessive invasiveness from a viewer’s perspective.
A caster can be described as a simple wheel mechanism usually attached to the bottom of a particular object to simplify its movement and reduce the effort needed to change its position. Such details can be used in shopping carts, office chairs, beds, or furniture. The presented caster consists of six parts needed to guarantee its stable functioning, attaching to the demanded object, and rolling. These details are the metal base, two vertical supports, four screws, bushing, axle, and a wheel. Being assembled, they ensure the proper work of the detail and its attachment.The base is made of malleable cast iron and weighs 1083,5 grams. It is the basis to fix all other objects and assemble the caster mechanism. It should also be attached to a particular surface to enable it can be moved. The vertical supports are placed on the base by using available SHCS screws. The choice of steel as the material is explained by the high pressure caused by objects on the base.The caster mechanism also has two vertical supports made of malleable cast iron. Their primary function is to hold the wheel and guarantee its rolling without friction on the base. The mass of every vertical support is 437.6 grams. They are placed on two sides of the base using SHCS crews and should also resist a significant load, which explains the choice of the material to manufacture them.The mechanism has four socket head cap screws (SCHS) needed to fix vertical supports and ensure their stable position on the base. Each SCHS
Any abundant biological species have significant effects on the planet by consuming natural resources. Being rather popular as pets, dogs and cats are often explored with attention to their psychological impacts on humans, but their negative environmental influences require consideration as well. The essay aims to summarize these animals’ key environmental impacts with an emphasis on food consumption, infectious disease, species’ survival, and global warming.As domesticated animals, cats and dogs fit into the environment in peculiar ways. Animals living with pet owners in urban areas constitute a new category of consumers that require alimentary products in diverse price categories, animal toys, grooming products, and other pet products (Ferguson, 2020). With no need to hunt for smaller animals to survive, domestic dogs and cats that can go outside still need their predatory impulses to be satisfied (Ferguson, 2020). One option is that it results in the purposeless killings of small birds and rodents, and the abandoned prey can attract dangerous disease-transmitting animals, such as city-dwelling rats. The situation might be different for stray cats and dogs as they are urged to eat from garbage bins and protect their territory, which involves the spread of infection and aggression towards animals and humans. Even domestic and healthy dogs’ feces contain viruses and parasites that can enter water supply systems, thus causing harm to humans and water life (Ferguson, 2020). Therefore, dogs’ and cats’ presence cannot be unnoticed when it comes to the global environment.Dogs’ and cats’ influence on the ecosystem as a whole is rather negative. Firstly, free-ranging domestic
species with plant diets, such as sheep, horses, or herbivorous rodents, in their negative impacts on the ecosystem. Every year, cats’ and dogs’ consumption of meat and animal products contributes to the release of at least 64,000,000 tons of N 2 O and CH 4 , both of which have prominent global warming potentials (Okin, 2017). Therefore, these animals’ impacts on air quality and greenhouse gas emissions are also substantial.Finally, both cats and dogs exert an enormous influence on the environment and the ecosystem. As carnivorous species, they actively consume products of animal origin that require substantial natural resources to be manufactured and contribute to greenhouse gas emissions. These domesticated animals’ hunting behaviors might affect native species’ survival, and parasites in their feces can cause human disease and water contamination, making stray dogs and cats a source of danger.
Numerous issues concerning the recent amendments to the bail program have become the topic of heated debates. The original claims implied that the new attitude would allow for more humane and just techniques. Nevertheless, releasing various types of defendants without any bail has led to an increased number of participants who are rearrested on felony charges while still on release. Therefore, a dedicated analysis is needed in order to realize all the factors that stand behind such dramatic outcomes. Moreover, it is crucial to develop and establish the most efficient framework for releasing people without bail.The bail reform is a part of a series of criminal justice reforms that have gone into effect in recent years. According to new rules, judges are not allowed to impose monetary bail. Moreover, judges were not granted an opportunity to evaluate the potential threat that a defendant could pose to a community. At the same time, according to Gold and Wright (2020), pretrial detention has huge repercussions and can jeopardize employment and housing. Thus, the original motivation behind the introduction of the bail reform was centered around the inequality issues and disparities that allowed the rich to buy their freedom and return home.Right now, thousands of people who have not yet been convicted of a crime are incarcerated and awaiting trial. The vast majority of them belong to low-income communities and cannot afford to pay the needed sum to spend time with their family, earn money and prepare for a trial properly. The vicious cycle created by such an attitude
Change champions are vital for healthcare organizations as they help integrate novelties necessary for improving the quality of services and patient outcomes. Furthermore, such employees advocate for the continuing education and practice scope expanse among their colleagues, enabling them to evolve and become better specialists (Miech et al., 2018). You also mentioned the crucial aspect of change leaders’ activities — the engagement of nurses to meet the healthcare system’s goals and address the inevitable challenges. Indeed, implementing strategic initiatives that encourage the organization to update its practices continuously is a mission of change champions in facilities of all types. You also identified the role of opinion leaders in achieving goals oriented on better quality and patient outcomes. I agree with your statement that such individuals are “respected sources of information connected to novel ideas and possess sufficient interpersonal skills to influence others’ decision-making.” Human resources of any organization must integrate change champions and opinion leaders to the collectives where the practice updates are urgent.The alternative perspective to assess the importance of change champions and opinion leaders in a healthcare organization is to view how their administration and team-building improve the workplace environment and services’ quality. Human resources must consider that individuals at the executive positions might not be the actual authorities for other employees. Moreover, opinion leaders are frequently the most experienced or proven reliable team members, who have the decision-making and recommendation power regardless of their post (Spoon et al., 2020). Valuable insight from your post is that change champions can develop and advocate for
The rapidly changing situation in the market of goods and services forces organizations to adapt efficiently and quickly. It results in overly rapid changes within the enterprise without a smooth transition. The fast pace is becoming a problem for both the company and employees. Team members are forced to quickly adapt to new work formats, promptly learn new skills, and take on additional roles. In such conditions, competent and high-quality change management and decision-making are essential.In an age of global transformation, change management has become one of the principal success factors for most companies. The surrounding reality is in a state of constant shift: the demands of internal and external customers are changing, new market barriers and opportunities are emerging, unforeseen risks are occurring. Companies that cannot withstand the pace of development and adapt to new conditions often have to leave the market, giving way to more flexible organizations. The central concern is that for most employees, rapid change causes a feeling of anxiety and discomfort. It often causes longer sick days, days off, constant complaints, and employee turnover. People are distressed about their jobs, an unknown future, and ever-increasing competition (Anastasiou, 2020). The situation can be aggravated by the inability to master new technologies, the lack of high-quality communication, and a sick work environment that negatively affects the overall progress.The decision-making process can be challenging, especially in times of crisis. The crisis is a severe external factor that significantly affects the quality of conclusions. Many people do not have enough personal experience or psycho-emotional strength to make a straightforward decision and accept full responsibility. Inaccurate decisions can be based on numerous internal and external errors. Internal factors are related to the personality of the decision-maker. They may help to overcome the anxiety and conduct effective brainstorming. External factors are related to decision-making conditions and external influences. Such decisions may be limited in time, effectiveness, or sources, depending on other workers or the status of a performer (Anastasiou, 2020). All of the above factors have the potential to interfere with the decision-making process.
time. For example, having to clean the pump, as the user-maintainer chooses to believe is an acceptable option, may damage the pump, rendering it useless for clinical use. Long-nail users may destroy the print on the pump keys, rendering them unreadable.However, despite the reported challenges, various benefits have also been executed from my project of using Automated IV Pumps in improving patients’ health care. Nevertheless, they are a secure way of implementing IV fluids. These injectors are solely designed to deliver a specific fluid volume at a specific rate. The use of these pumps greatly helps practitioners reduce the possibility of errors in the volume, timeframe, and rate of fluid administration (Chaturvedi et al., 2019). Therefore, health centers are expected to use infusion pumps in improving healthcare for patients as it is more beneficial.
Chapter IThe first chapter describes the position of women in Neo-Confucian regimes in China and Japan. When comparing the attitude of the society towards women in these two countries, it is possible to see that Chinese society was more strict with them (Hughes, S.S. & Hughes, B., 1997). However, women’s position in both societies was quite low because China and Japan were patriarchal countries dominated by males, though Japan once was a matrilocal system.Chinese government adopted several laws that were meant to protect women’s dignity and chastity, but in practice, they served as severe restrictions on their freedom and violation of their rights. Thus, the Quing rape laws adopted in the middle of the XVII century made it hard for women to achieve justice since they needed to provide evidence of being raped. Apart from that, the definition of rape was officially established, and it was hard to classify an assault as rape if it did not match the definition (Hughes, S. S. & Hughes, B., 1997). In addition, the Chinese government restricted the position of widows since they were forced either to live in the household of their late husband and take care of the family or to remarry, leaving all the property and children in the family of the first husband. Thus, many widows were remarried against their will and left without property and reputation.Hence, women in China were forced to protect their chastity by themselves, sometimes even with their own lives. However, despite significant law positions and almost no social status, some Chinese
The chapter primarily focuses on the ethical evaluation of BP’s decisions in regards to spill management through the lens of utilitarianism. The latter considers an action ethical or unethical depending on the overall outcome and benefits (Halbert and Ingulli 1). When analyzing BP’s decisions and actions, it is important to include all stakeholders. Firstly, the cost-benefit analysis shows that BP incurred heavy losses due to fines, penalties, lawsuits, and damaged business. However, both long-term and short-term effects need to be considered. Secondly, shareholders of the company also incurred major losses.Thirdly, the workers, who suffered from the spill, and other professionals were involved in the cleanup were killed, severely injured, or suffered other health effects. Fourthly, the Gulf area is a highly valuable ecosystem for fishing and other marine life forms. It is still unclear how massive the harm will be on the local fauna, but it is evident that the chemical particles will not magically disappear and will continue circulating in the ecosystem.Fifthly, the local businesses, governments, and populations are heavily dependent on the Gulf’s ecosystem for a wide range of reasons. The spill impacted the fishing, tourism, and health of people living near the area. Although FDA claimed that seafood is safe to eat, it is still a question of time whether or not longitudinal health effects will occur (Halbert and Ingulli 3). Sixthly, the Gulf area is critical for the natural environment outside of it because fish, birds, and other marine life forms use the site for breeding, migration, and other patterns of behavior. Therefore, BP’s decision not to employ a backup switch will result in harmful consequences, but its decision to participate in deep-water drilling might equalize in terms of economic benefits to the nation.
interrupted by other people. Essentially, the lack of control was the cause of the people’s lack of involvement, but the problem could have been prevented if speaking, in turn, had been adopted. The positive collaboration experience involved a school project over Zoom where everyone contributed their particular share. The project’s success was due to the clear distinction of roles within the team and the presence of one leader who supervised and coordinated everyone’s actions.I believe that a successful collaboration in an online setting must be based on planning and strategy. Essentially, it is important to allocate specific roles to all members and plan all meetings to avoid scheduling problems. Any possible conflicts must be solved with the help of one leader who is trusted by everyone. Additionally, to achieve success, a group needs to rely on collaborative tools such as Zoom and shared online documents.Technical communication fosters collaboration between people by helping individuals to enable others to learn, make decisions, and act. Technical communication skills let people be more valuable as professionals and affect their ability to work in teams.
Although crime in Reading, Pennsylvania, remained high despite the city’s budget constraints, police chief William Heim invested significantly in crime prediction software in 2013. Predictive Policing is the name of this Big Data start-program up’s dubbed PredPol (short for predictive policing). As promised, the program would analyze past crime data to identify where and when cries most likely occur hourly. The number of burglaries in high-crime neighborhoods dropped by nearly 20% when police started paying more attention to these hotspots. Predictive policing software is similar to a lot of baseball statistical modeling. It is presumably devoid of the racism and prejudices incorporated in the recidivism models that the court system utilizes. For this program to work, it has to have much data about the region to justify the presence of police there.It has been established that human initiatives generate tension and danger in vulnerable populations. Mathematical models currently dominate law enforcement. Because of ideas that relate nonviolent crimes to a rise in violent crimes, police chiefs feel that even “nuisance data” may be utilized to create “better data” that can concentrate more intensely on violent crimes. Police departments throughout the nation are bolstering zero-tolerance rules for both violent and nonviolent offenses by relying on data from predictive policing methods. One of the most hazardous aspects of this system is that its inner workings are kept secret from the general people.At a “hackathon” in the spring of 2011, O’Neil and the New York Civil Liberties Union worked together to uncover crucial information on the NYPD’s controversial and
models, are both racially discriminatory and logically faulty. There is no consideration for human nature in these models that claim to have a wealth of information on the likelihood that an ex-convict from a particular area would re-offend after being released from jail. According to O’Neil, justice system data scientists should understand prison life and how it affects inmates’ conduct. Many inmates suffer from malnourishment, solitary confinement, and sexual assault in prisons. When these institutions reach total capacity, they can generate a $5 billion industry. When it comes to making prisons mysterious, these firms go out of their way to do it.In the not-too-distant future, facial recognition algorithms will be able to identify even more dangerous weapons of mass destruction. The Chicago Police Department knocked on the door of a 22-year-old male who resided in a high-crime, low-income area in 2013. They warned him that the police were keeping an eye on him because he was linked to persons who had been arrested. By focusing on persons not involved in criminal activity, police were stoking racial tensions in the communities where crime was a problem. According to O’Neil, building models that presume everyone is the same is more accessible than developing policies that make the justice system more equitable (though perhaps less efficient).
During the past century, scientific findings have significantly changed the way humans live in all spheres of life. Scientific methods have also been transferred to psychology to understand human behavior. Science uses systematic observation as a medium of obtaining knowledge. It is an empirical method that helps scientists learn more about our biological and physical world. Science has been used to save humanity from various catastrophes and diseases by discoveries of vaccines and the green revolution. These discoveries saved millions of people from eventual death caused by diseases that were untreatable.Science has four vital elements, which include: 1. Systematic observation. Scientists make observations in a very organized manner. The observed phenomenon is customarily measured and recorded to reduce memory bias, affecting scientific conclusions. Most observations are done in controlled conditions, which are systematically varied to understand the phenomenon comprehensively. 2. Hypothesis testing. Hypotheses and theories are developed in a manner that can be tested. Testing hypotheses requires that experiments be conducted to either prove or refute the hypothesis. It is an empirical way of confirming the validity of such hypotheses. 3. Democratic. Scientists usually engage in debates and discussions concerning their theories and observations. The free expression of scientific ideas helps bring out the best in science. Scientists do not disregard the works of others but engage in critiques and support of scientific works aimed at bettering the quality of knowledge acquired. 4. Cumulative. The scientist also uses facts presented by earlier scientists to build on their works. Science provides a straight path of development where
earlier advances build up better and more enriching facts and knowledge.Some people still doubt psychology is a science because many psychological phenomena like intelligence, depression, and prejudice are seemingly unobservable. However, psychological researchers mainly focus on behavior because individual feelings and thoughts are invisible. Scientists can also observe the behaviors of identical and fraternal twins to know the extent to which social and genetic factors contribute to personality. In recent times, psychology has become a complex discipline because of better study designs, measures, and statistical analyses in exploring human nature (Diener). For instance, when studying the emotion of happiness, the psychologist can ask participants about their happiness and request them to indicate where their feelings lie on a numbered scale. Scientists can also use memory measures based on the idea that optimistic people have no problems recalling pleasant memories while negative people easily recall unpleasant events.Moreover, psychologists also use biological measures, including saliva cortisol samples or fMRI images of brain activation. Therefore, psychological science is essential for creating interventions that enhance people’s lives. Many research studies are concerned with ascertaining which therapies are the least and most effective for treating psychological disorders. Several studies have indicated that cognitive-behavioral therapy is effective in helping people suffering from anxiety and depression disorders (Diener). Some other research findings have shown that some therapies are harmful and should be avoided. Therefore, it is important to evaluate the various interventions used to treat patients and eliminate those that are deemed as harmful.In recent times, the easy way people access information and
explanations makes us live in the “Information Age.” It is essential to consider the quality of information instead of quantity because not all information is to be trusted. Trustworthy information is hard to come by in an era full of fake news and misleading information. In this respect, science’s main task is to determine what type of information to consider as being well-informed. It uses observable data to help understand and explain the world in a trustworthy manner. Scientists conclude by using less certain words that are related to probabilities. Such a manner of explaining situations is what separates scientific from non-scientific statements.Both methods make use of induction which concludes based on specific observations. However, the induction process is considered an untrustworthy way of providing information due to its contradictory results. Scientific thinking is distinguished from everyday thinking by certain prescribed features. These features found in scientific theories and data include consistency, scope, simplicity, fruitfulness. There is also another additional feature that is prevalent in scientific theorizing and thinking, known as falsification. Karl Popper dismisses statements that did not pass the falsification test. He viewed such statements as hindrances to scientific progress. Popper claimed that there was no way of refuting, refining, or advancing knowledge using such statements. He offered a solution that argued that there would be only one actual possibility if science proved that all others were not true (Erin). It means that scientists need to articulate all evidence to disapprove their hypotheses.However, today’s scientists are more interested in providing explanations and descriptions for
is applicable in all situations with no exceptions. It is among the many differences between conclusions drawn from scientific observations and those drawn from personal anecdotes. Well-designed research depends on systematically-recorded observations that represent the population and are of high quality.The Null Hypothesis Significance Testing is used to assess the probability that the data collected (observations) would be similar if no relationship existed between the variables in the research study. For instance, a researcher would want to find a relationship been class performance and age if there were, but in reality, no such link exists. The null hypothesis provides no meaningful link between academic performance and student maturity. This hypothesis also consists of an alternative hypothesis that the two variables are related. In evaluating the two hypotheses, the researcher needs to gather data and compares what she expects to find to what she finds. The aim of collecting data and making comparisons is to determine whether to reject or falsify the null hypothesis in favor of the alternative hypothesis. However, the research conclusions can be wrong due to errors. There are the type1 error and type11 errors (Erin). The type 1 error is when the research concludes that there is a relationship between the variables while there is not in reality. On the other hand, the type II error occurs when the collected data does not show a relationship between two variables while there exists one. However, researchers can set a threshold for type I and type II errors using probability values.
Chapter 3. India. Women of Mughal EmpireIn this chapter of the book Women in World History , the Mughal rule and its consequences for women in conquered lands are discussed. The first concept presented in this book is the aspect of slavery. Non-Muslims were allowed to be enslaved according to Islamic laws, so for women, slavery was a greater threat than being forced to conform to a foreign religion and ways of living. Due to famines, many women were sold into slavery or seized to be sold at auctions away from their homes.At that time, bhakti, an art movement of female poet-saint, began. Bhakti means “devotion”, so this genre concerns religious matters such as denial of pedantry, rejection of asceticism, and depths of personal devotion. This way of self-expression had no boundaries, and its followers (many of whom were women) could present it anywhere. However, this does not mean that women did not struggle with acceptance in those realms. Another critical aspect of women’s lives was the production of cloth. The cloth had become a big part of Indian export, and every woman in a castle was capable of spinning thread (Hughes, & Hughes, 1997). Weaving had become a family production, and many of them settled near cities where silk, cotton, and wool were in great demand.For royal women of Mughal, a great responsibility was to ensure the health and success of younger generations that were to take power. They educated and advised princes in their coming-of-age and wars for the throne and subsequently influenced politics.
were ways for men to dominate women through pain, humiliation, and fear.A significant shift happened in the area of female work and empowerment; when earlier women could perform specialized work and play a prominent role in politics, in the 17th-century men have pushed them off that path. For women, household chores, children bearing, and taking care of them were the utmost priority. Urban crafts that females were involved in mainly consisted of beer-brewing and provisioning (Hughes, & Hughes, 1997). However, at the end of the 17 th century, beer-brewing privileges were lost for women.While male rulers and philosophers claimed that women were too emotional to be good at governing, plenty of queens came into power in the 16 th century. For many of them, the power was inherited, and some of them governed as regents for male heirs (Hughes, & Hughes, 1997). As opposed to the ideas of men, those women were as competent in managing kingdoms as men could be. An excellent example of that is the Maria Theresa of Austria. She exuded courage, ambition, and common sense when ruling. In addition, she valued education for herself and the authorities. Her life story and actions serve as a rebuttal to misogynistic ideas within authority structures.
Robotics is a discipline of engineering and computer science that deals with robots’ design, manufacture, maintenance, and utilization. Robotics strives to create devices that can support and benefit people. Mechanical engineering, mechatronics, information engineering, electronics, biotechnology, computer programming, software development, and mathematics are included in robotics. In designing a robot, it is necessary to highlight the stage of testing and simulations, which, combined into separate courses, can identify possible drawbacks and errors. What concerns the elaboration of an obstacle course in a “real-world” simulation, it is essential to ensure the presence of several procedure testing steps that will determine the functionality of a robot.A robot is considered a machine capable of automatically performing a complicated set of activities, particularly one that a computer can program. Advanced cyber-physical technologies, including robotics systems, are often associated with the physical and software components that are supposed to alter over time (Jamshidi et al., 2019). A remote control system can direct a robot, or the control can be included inside the machine itself. Although some robots are meant to resemble humans, most are task-oriented technologies focusing on basic utility rather than expressive aesthetics. Humanoids, industrial machines, medical operational robots, patient aid robotic systems, cooperatively programmed robots, and minuscule nanorobots are examples of autonomous and semi-autonomous robots. A robot may obtain a sense of consciousness or think of its own by replicating a realistic look or automating motions, and autonomous devices are likely to transmit in the future.Considering the process of constructing a robot, it is important to highlight several specific
building stages that can be universal. Establishing a purpose for the robot is the first phase, which allows determining its specific capabilities, which, as a result, will help the creators set the necessary tasks. Secondly, select whether the robot will operate on a manufacturing or intelligent operating system, depending on whether constructors are developing an industrial or conceptual computer. Thirdly, designing the machine’s central command module, which will be in charge of decision-making, and constructing a shell will provide physical characteristics and functionality.The purpose of the course is defined by the need to ensure the robot can navigate in space, detect barriers and effectively abolish them. In order to elaborate an obstacle course that can test the autonomy of simple robots, it is possible to select a “real-world” simulation as a course general design approach. What concerns a “real-world” simulation, this testing concept is based on the assessment of how efficiently a robot is able to avoid obstacles and solve issues in practical and real circumstances, as in Figure 1 (Pandey et al., 2019). Moreover, in this simulation, a robot’s performance is scored and analyzed in a scoring system, which collects and sorts data. Firstly, to create a specific course, it is obligatory to identify the design concept and the key features and components of the robot that has to be tested.Figure 1. Testing autonomy: ideal trajectory of robot navigation between obstaclesReferring to the technical characteristics and components, the robot will include chassis, wheels, motors, motherboards, a proportional integrative derivative controller, and a microprocessor that will
second step is devoted to changing the robot’s initial position in the space before testing. In this case, the robot is proposed to start moving from different points selected randomly. Therefore, this process excludes pattern behavior and ensures effective orientation in varying settings. Finally, the third step describes the measurement of the robot’s velocity and analysis what speed level can be considered maximum. When it accelerates, the probability of failing the autonomous obstacle testing can increase.To summarize, a robot is considered a machine capable of automatically performing a complicated set of activities, particularly one that a computer can program. The objective of the course is to guarantee that the robot can traverse in space, detect obstacles, and properly eliminate them. It is conceivable to use a “real-world” simulation as a basic design strategy for creating an obstacle course that can test the autonomy of simple robots. The robot will have chassis, wheels, motors, motherboards, a proportional integrative derivative controller, and a processor that will allow the robot to conduct a program, among other technological characteristics and components. What concerns the recommended course map is that it should be composed of circumstances and problems for a robot’s movement.
The concept of nursing is closely associated with the idea of continuous improvement, as the trends of health care need to mirror the existing social trends to provide the best care possible. One way to secure such care is to refer to the latest scholarly findings to modify the approaches to care provision in the workplace. This process of implementing research-based findings in daily patient care is known as evidence-based practice (EBP) (Wilson & Austria, 2021). Currently, EBP is not used actively by nurses for several reasons.First, the workload of most nurses discourages their desire to learn and embrace EBP. According to McArthur et al. (2021), a physical opportunity is a construct that contributes to the nurses’ ability to resort to EBM. Physical opportunity includes such barriers as “cost and lack of resources, compromised communication, staff turnover, and limited physical guidelines” (McArthur et al., 2021, p. 20). As a result, management promotes behavioral patterns that react to the environment rather than examine it in advance. The second massive barrier to EBP in the workplace is the lack of social opportunity embodied in the lack of organizational support and teamwork (McArthur et al., 2021). Since the aforementioned examples tackle only a minor part of the existing challenged, the need to intervene and facilitate EBP is evident.The first commonly mentioned approach to facilitate the use of EBP is to establish a leadership that would encourage the practice by both setting an example and conducting training and workshops. Another crucial facilitator is to secure nurses’ access to relevant sources in the workplace, including relevant databases, steady Internet connection, and subscription to peer-reviewed publications. In such a way, the use of scholarly research will become more time-efficient and less stressful for nurses.
IntroductionAntibiotics work against bacteria in numerous ways by either inhibiting metabolic pathways, nucleic acid synthesis, protein synthesis, depolarizing cell membrane, or inhibiting the cell wall synthesis. By employing these methods, antibiotics can inhibit bacterial growth or kill it. However, as antibiotics work against bacteria, they have been depicted to leave behind resistant strains that multiply naturally (Reygaert, 2018). Antibiotic resistance occurs when germs such as bacteria and fungi continue to grow by developing the ability to defeat drugs designed to kill them (Singer et al., 2003; Toerien, 1967). Sometimes it is impossible and difficult to treat infections that are caused by antibiotic-resistant germs (Foti et al., 2011; Fair & Tor, 2014). Patients who have these infections require extended medical stays, follow-ups, and costly alternatives before realizing positive results.Microorganisms from the unknown samples are essential to identify to prevent harmful and beneficial bacteria in this society. The problem of antibiotic resistance has spread worldwide and has a more significant impact on poor and developing nations than developed nations (Ventola, 2015; Waxman, & Strominger, 1983). Because of the ease with which antibiotics can be purchased in many of these countries without a prescription, the developed world primarily relies on prescriptions (Alanis, 2005). According to Falagas and Bliziotis (2007), polymyxins were the antibiotics that retained the highest activity against the three examined species of Gram-negative bacteria. Citrobacter freundii (C. freundii ) is often resilient to numerous groups of antibiotics, signifying that both scientific and ecological strains may harbor antimicrobial resistance elements (Liu et al., 2018). Over the past years,
there has been increased awareness of family Enterobacteriaceae due to its association with causing animal and human diseases (Stanic et al., 2015). Genus Hafnia has been linked to emerging antimicrobial resistance patterns and infections related to presenting unusual diseases and stem cells.The lab techniques and procedures covered during this course were used to test each student’s practical understanding of microbiology. The purpose of this lab report is to identify unknown organisms using genetic sequencing and traditional biochemical testing techniques on each isolated unknown that led to the identification of each unknown. It is also predicted that C. freundii will have a more excellent antibiotic resistance to each of the four tested antibiotics, including penicillin, doxycycline, polymyxin B, and rifampicin, than Hafnia alvei .MethodsTwo unknown organisms labelled as #15 and #43 were provided on agar plates. Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR) was done to identify the genus for both unknown organisms (#15 and #43). PCR entails a biochemical process that amplifies a single DNA molecule (BIOS 3120, 2021). It was used to find specific 16s rRNA genes present in unknown organisms by cross-referencing them with databases for known bacteria sequencing. PCR test involved materials such as Taq polymerase, a DNA template, PCR primers, nucleotides, inoculation loop, a flame, a micropipette, sterile water, and a PCR tube. A mix for loading in the PCR was made by adding 0.5µL of forward primer 8F, 0.5 µL of reverse primer 1492R, 1µL of the DNA template, 10.5 µL of sterile water, and 12.5 µL of master mix to a PCR tube.
The tubes were then loaded in an Eppendorf Mastercycler Nexus Thermal Cycler Gradient programmed to start with 95 0 C for 10 minutes, 95 0 C for 1.5 minutes, 55 0 C for 1 minute, 72 0 C for 2 minutes, 72 0 C for 10 minutes, and a 10 0 C hold (Lab Manual, 2021).The unknown organisms were streaked on the TSA broth and TSA plate by inoculating the loop over the flame and then transferring a loop bacterium into the slant on a zig-zag motion. The streaked organism was then incubated at 37 0 C until the next lap period to prepare the bacteria for biochemical tests. An analysis was made, and the samples were used to carry out six biochemical tests on each unknown bacterial culture. For unknown #43, the following tests were performed: gram stain, thioglycolate, oxidase, catalase, citrate, indole production, and ornithine-decarboxylase test. For unknown #15, the tests performed were gram stain, thioglycolate, oxidase, catalase, ONPG (B-galactosidase), and indole production.Gram StainGram stain is a laboratory technique used for determining the thickness of bacteria’s peptidoglycan layer by labeling it either as thick peptidoglycan layer (gram-positive) or thin peptidoglycan layer (gram-negative). To perform gram staining, the material needed included clean microscope slides, staining trays, gram stain reagents, a water bottle for rinsing, and bacterial cultures. Gram stain test began with the bacterial smear at fixed heating on an inoculated slide containing a colony of bacteria culture in a small volume of water. The bacterial specimen was then air-dried followed by fixed heating underside
for a few seconds. After completing heat-fixing, gram straining was performed on the bacterial smear.The procedure for this biochemical test entailed, firstly, addition of crystal violate drops to the smear and then allowing it to settle for sixty seconds. The slide was then rinsed off; after this step, all the cells were purple. Secondly, a few drops of gram’s iodine were added to the bacterial smear and then allowed to sit for sixty seconds before rinsing with water. Alcohol was added as a decolorizer and left to run over the slide surface for 7 seconds until no more crystal color came out of the bacterial smear. The slide was then rinsed with water to stop the decolorization process. It was noted that Gram-positive cells retain crystal violet and remain purple after adding decolorizer while gram-negative cells lose crystal violet and become colorless. Finally, a few drops of safranin were added on the slide as a counterstain then allowed to sit for one minute before rinsing off. The results were then analyzed by putting and observing the slide color under a microscope. Bacterial growth at 45 0 C was done by incubating the culture for 48 hours, and then observation was done on its growth.Thioglycolate TestIn a bacterial experiment, a thioglycolate test was chiefly performed to ascertain bacterial oxygen requirement using thioglycolate broth that contained an oxygen gradient with higher levels at the top and no oxygen at the bottom. When conducting this test, the material required included a thioglycolate tube with resazurin indicator and bacterial cultures
#43 and #15 (Beaman et al., 2007). A thioglycolate tube was inoculated with the organism to be tested for oxygen relationship and then allowed to grow at the optimal growth temperature. Growth patterns were then observed for the test on thioglycolate broth.Oxidase TestOxidase test was done to ascertain if bacteria under test produced the enzyme cytochrome oxidase. The presence of this enzyme is an indication of aerobic bacteria, which can utilize oxygen in the respiration process as a terminal electron acceptor (Beaman et al., 2007). Oxidase test was performed by inoculating bacteria culture onto an oxidase disc upon which Kovac’s reagent was added on top, and then observation made on the color changes.Catalase TestA catalase test is done to establish if bacteria produce enzyme catalase understudy in a bacterial test. Catalase enzyme is used for breaking down hydrogen peroxide, which is a harmful chemical (Beaman et al., 2007). The test was conducted by streaking bacteria onto the TSA slant and growing it at 37 0 C for 48 hours, after which hydrogen peroxide was added. The observation was done on the reaction of the bacteria with hydrogen peroxide.Citrate TestA citrate test is done to determine if bacteria can use sodium citrate as the only carbon source and inorganic ammonium hydrogen phosphate as a nitrogen source. Citrate test was done by streaking the slant back and forth with a light inoculum containing bacterial colony and then incubated aerobically at 37 0 C for 96 hours (Beaman et al., 2007). The observation was made on color changes from
green to blue or no color change along the slant.Indole ProductionMost proteins contain tryptophan amino acid, and some bacteria can produce enzyme tryptophanase that breaks down this type of amino acid into indole, pyruvate and ammonia. The indole production test was performed by first growing the organism using a tryptophan medium (Beaman et al., 2007). Tryptophan broth was then inoculated aseptically to allow culture growth for 24 hours at 37 0 C. 0.5 ml of Kovac’s reagent was added to the broth culture, and the tube was observed for absence or presence of the ring.Ornithine-Decarboxylase TestOrnithine-decarboxylase test is primarily done to establish if a microbe has the ability to use ornithine as the sole carbon source and energy for growth. Ornithine decarboxylase accomplishes the utilization of ornithine. The test was conducted by putting the inoculum of culture #43 aseptically into ornithine decarboxylase broth and then incubated for 48 hours at 37 0 C and an observation made on color changes.ONPG (B-Galactosidase) TestONPG test is perform to differentiate members belonging to Enterobacteriaceae family and other microbes depending on activities of beta-D-galactosidase. The test differentiates late lactose fermenters from non-lactose fermenters of Enterobacteriaceae . The test was conducted with test medium at room temperature of 37 0 C, and then inoculum incubated aerobically with loose caps for 24 hours and observation made on color changes.Kirby-Bauer (Antibiotic Sensitivity) TestKirby-Bauer test is used for ascertaining the choice of antibiotics to be used when treating an infection. The test used penicillin, doxycycline, polymyxin B, and rifampicin on the culture colony. The
observation was then done on the zone sizes, and results were interpreted (Bhargav et al., 2016). Upon completing all the experimental tests, unknown organisms were identified following PCR/BLAST, dichotomous keys using the Bergey’s (Whitman et al., 2016), streak plate isolation, and biochemical tests.ResultsAn organism of genus Citrobacter was characterized by straight rods, about 1µm in diameter and 2 – 6µm in length and occurring in pairs and singly. Both #15 and #43 were first identified using DNA sequence analysis that involved performing genetic comparisons of the organisms. During initial identification of these organisms, genetic analyses workflow was performed that included identifying genus via PCR/BLAST, dichotomous keys, streak plate isolation, and analyzing isolated biochemical tests using the Bergey’s Manual. For unknown organism #15, a gram stain, thioglycolate test, oxidase test, and indole production were all negative, and positive for catalase test and ONPG (B-galactosidase) test. To identify the identity of the unknown organism, the test results were followed using a dichotomous key, which identified unknown organism #15 to be C. fundii.Test Result for Organism #15Name of Test                  Observation                                     Interpretation

The result for unknown organism #43 was negative for gram stain, thioglycolate test, and oxidase test, while a positive result was observed in the catalase test. Citrate test was negative, while the indole production test using SIM and ornithine-decarboxylase test were positive. Hafnia is characterized by straight rods of about 1µm in diameter and 2-5 µm in length, it was first identified based on its PCR/BLAST, biochemical test results, and dichotomous key. Therefore, the unknown organism #43 was identified as H. alvei based on the tabulated results below.Test Result for Organism #43Name of Test                  Observation                                      Interpretation

Influence on Jazz HistoryCharles Bolden was born in New Orleans and is recognized as the first person to perform and play what could thereafter be considered jazz music. Many early jazz musicians credited Charles as the founder of jazz. Louis Armstrong and Jelly Roll Morton attested that Bolden was among the most influential musicians who played jazz. Many aspects of Bolden traditions, such as syncopation, polyrhythm, and improvision, linger today and are considered significant to jazz music (Nmaam, 2019). Since Buddy Bolden’s band did not know how to read music, most of their compositions were either copied or generated on the spot. That is how the art of improvising became the hallmark of jazz. This style had an impact on young jazz musicians. Musicians today draw inspiration from the first king of jazz, and his influence on music culture and ingenuity touches them fundamentally.Bolden was known for his loud sound. People who sang about the prowess of his music career emphasized his loudness. He cemented his reputation by using the knowledge of his cornet to put fans into a trance and get them dancing into a frenzy (Micucci, 2019). Bolden had the ability to sink himself into a trance where nothing mattered but music. He played blues at medium tempos sprinkled with racy lyrics. By mixing gospel and blues inflections, he made a rhythmic feel that resulted in a unique sound that spread throughout New Orleans. His talent for altering rhythm, performance, and melody elements appealed to his fans and forever changed the music course.Events and
he heard comprised jubilant singing, spirituals, and shouts from his neighborhood. Creole and African American musicians who played a waltz, schottische, and quadrille influenced his views on music styles (Sandmel, 2019). He played and associated with other early jazz musicians like George Baquet, Sidney Bechet, and Peter Bocage, who contributed immensely to his career. Bolden absorbed the African American and Afro-Caribbean folk music styles back in the day. Brass bands that performed various secular and religious functions also helped shape Bolden’s life in music.In 1902, he was shortlisted as a music artist in the city directory (Sandmel, 2019). By the end of 1890, Bolden had the most powerful band in New Orleans. Due to the expanded band following, the demand for his music grew, and he constantly performed while playing dances and parades all across town. Unfortunately, the pressures of performing constantly and alcohol consumption ended his career in 1906. His relationship with the band deteriorated as he became unreliable and eventually quit playing. Bolden made his last public performance during a parade on Labor Day 1906.
The adjustment process of new children and their parents can be challenging for them and the teacher. An educator can implement many educational and communicational techniques to ease the process and support the children and parents. I believe that maintaining constant communication with parents through conferences or phone calls, with the consideration of their time and privacy, is one of the most important elements. Encouraging home learning activities and welcoming parents into the classroom is also crucial.Most parents would like to be involved in or informed about their children’s adjustment in a new classroom. Gaining parents’ trust by properly communicating with them and engaging them in collaborative problem-solving and planning would ease their and their children’s adjustment process (Kuhn et al., 2017). Being mindful of their time and privacy is crucial in establishing a healthy parent-educator relationship. According to Lin et al. (2019), home learning activities can help children overcome their school involvement issues. Informing parents about the importance of home-based activities would encourage them to participate, resulting in parental support and involvement in the adjustment process of the children. For parents and children with separation anxiety, an educator can invite the parents into the classroom. However, it is vital to communicate the expectations and roles to the parents beforehand to avoid misunderstandings (Zurcher, 2016). Overall, it would calm the children and reassure the parents of their children’s safety during the adjustment process.The adjustment process of children and parents to a new classroom and teacher is challenging; however, there are ways to make it easier for all the parties. I think that being respectful and maintaining educator-parent communication is the most important factor in adapting to a new schooling environment. Inviting the parents to the classroom can help with the separation anxiety in both children and their parents. Additionally, encouraging home learning activities would solve the involvement issue of the children.
Counselling parents on children’s sexuality is a challenging task because parents often realize how fast their children are growing and that sexual development starts from birth. Thus, I would counsel parents about childhood sexuality based on evidence about what is considered normal sexual behavior what is considered abnormal sexual behavior at a certain age. I would also try to be sensitive to the culture of the parents, as some parents may still consider some behavior inappropriate despite evidence due to cultural peculiarities. I would also teach about how to respond to sexual behavior appropriately. The National Center on the Sexual Behavior of Youth (NCSBY, n.d.) states that there are two strategies for responding to the behavior: “in the moment” and “after the fact.” At the moment, the parents should pause to collect their thoughts and avoid emotional responses, redirect the behavior, listen to what the child has to say, and teach about appropriate behavior. After the fact, parents need to reflect on all the information and knowledge they have, prepare for the dialogue, and communicate with the child.In order to identify if sexual behavior is normal, one needs to understand that appropriate behavior differs depending on the children’s age. For instance, children aged 0-6 may touch their private parts in public, while at the age of five, some children start to feel shy about doing so and explore themselves in private (NCSBY, n.d.). Thus, in order to identify if the behavior is normal, it is crucial to have adequate knowledge about what is appropriate at a
may tell me that they drank alcohol even though they were not allowed to do so according to the rules of the program they participate in. According to Standard 23 of the Ethical Standards for Human Services Professionals, I am obliged to report this case to my employer, which would result in the exclusion of my client from the program (National Organization of Human Services, 2015). However, my moral beliefs would tell me to conceal the for the best benefit of the client.First, I need to explain to the client my professional and ethical responsibilities, which would help me to have a common ground for further conversation. Second, I will warn that this information will be passed on to the employer for further discussion. However, I will supplement this transfer of information with comments about how likely alcohol use is to happen again. I will stress the fact that the client made a confession without pressure. Finally, I would search for other programs and try to convince the employer that the client should stay in the program.
students when performing tasks requiring switching from one set of rules to another (Sandhofer & Uchikoshi, 2013). With that in mind, to maximize children’s participation and language use, I can incorporate classroom activities and games requiring switching a language quickly, translating notions expressed in images in another language, and so on.Another approach to balancing the amount of teacher’s talking involves restricting verbal hints and suggestive interrogation in discussion activities in the classroom. Practices linked with encouraging DLLs to answer and ask questions during reading activities facilitate oral language development (Halgunseth et al., 2013). Nevertheless, to maximize children’s motivation to participate and express their thoughts, I can keep track of my questioning habits and replace the unnecessary remarks with non-verbal clues. For example, instead of answering my own questions when children cannot figure out the correct answer, I can implement visual clues, pantomime, and gestures to provide hints and direct their thinking. This will encourage them to engage in group discussions and express their guesses verbally, thus practicing speaking.
Patient education is a crucial step toward addressing public health issues, particularly, the threat of colorectal cancer and the effects that the chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) may have on the outcomes of a bowel resection surgery, including the complications that it may entail. Specifically, as a nurse, one must introduce a teaching plan that will be used as the guide for a patient to follow when learning about the side effects caused by COPD in patients requiring bowel resection. By incorporating the elements of verbal and nonverbal communication strategies, a nurse will be able to introduce a patient to the key COPD-related management of bowel resection in a patient with COPD.In a nursing context, a teaching plan represents a fairly simple idea. Suggesting a series of steps to be taken in order to educate a patient about the disease and the means of recognizing and addressing the symptoms, a teaching plan implies building readiness and awareness in a vulnerable person (Potter et al., 2019). Remarkably, a teaching plan benefits not only a patient, but also a nurse. Specifically, a teaching plan allows a nurse to ensure that a patient complies with the proposed treatment strategies and can access the required services in case bowel resection is needed. In order words, a teaching plan increases patient autonomy and awareness, reducing the extent of health risk.To develop the teaching plan for educating a COPD patient about bowel resection and implement it accordingly, a nurse will need to embrace the opportunities that verbal and nonverbal communication strategies provide.
Specifically, in nursing verbal communication can be defined as the communication method involving the use of words to convey essential information to the patient (Potter et al., 2019). In turn, nonverbal communication suggests using any other tool, including gestures, facial expressions, movements, and other devices that may potentially substitute the use of the spoken language to transfer data. For a nurse as an educator, the application of nonverbal communication is vital dude to the presence of patients from diverse ethnic, racial, and cultural backgrounds (Potter et al., 2019). Therefore, learning to use visual cues as the means of introducing a patient to a specific piece of information should be regarded as one of the primary ways of promoting awareness and risk management.There are two primary non-verbal communication factors to be borne in mind when developing an education program regarding the impact of COPD on the outcomes of bowel resection. First, it is vital to ensure that the nonverbal communication elements used in the process cannot be misinterpreted by the patient. Second, the nonverbal elements must be complementary to the verbal content and serve to reinforce its understanding as opposed to introducing new data, which means that instances of misunderstanding will be avoided. Moreover, since the patient does not have any background in health management or understanding of his issue, concise and simplified instructions must be provided. The table below outlines the essential elements of the teaching plan.Table 1. Teaching PlanPurpose : Explaining a COPD patient the nuances of bowel resection and the associated health risks

Available Resources                                     
 Lectures and simulations using specific scenarios will be used as the primary method of educating the patient.  2 weeks        The essential information will be provided to the patient using digital resources, particularly, digital repositories of information. Additionally, essential information concerning the process of bowel resection and its likely outcomes will be described, and methods of contacting a nurse will be provided.  The patient’s understanding of the subject matter will be tested with the help of short quizzes, as well as personal discussions with a nurse. The latter method will be particularly useful in identifying gaps in knowledge and any misconceptions that the patient might have about the subject matter.

                 As a nurse educator, one must also keep in mind that the patient education process is dynamic. In the case under analysis, the specified idea suggests that the learning process must be reciprocal, with the nurse learning about the patient’s learning abilities and characteristics, while the patient learns critical information about the surgery. Furthermore, being dynamic, patient education suggests that the choice of the strategies must be informed by the presence of cognitive and emotional stimuli.The dynamics of the teaching and learning process will also have to be primarily reciprocal for the key goals to be accomplished. Namely, the patient must be motivated to learn about the signs of bowel inflammation and other symptoms indicative of cancer requiring further bowel resection. Thus, the patient will be introduced to the notion of self-directed learning, where he will be able to use the provided autonomy and independence to gain the relevant skills and the ability to assess the key risk. Thus, the patient will be prepared to function in a complex environment with multiple threat factors, selecting the settings that provide the most favorable conditions, managing the emergent issues, and seeking the support of healthcare experts whenever needed.However, building the described abilities in a patient will require a major teaching effort from a nurse, as well as a number of relevant teaching skills. Specifically, as a nurse educator, particularly, on the issue of bowel resection surgery in COPD patients, a nurse
The patient, G. B., is a 50-year-old female who was diagnosed with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) for the first time. She addressed the clinic with frequent coughing, shortness of breath, fatigue, and excess sputum. She reported her history of smoking for the last 20 years and an insignificant increase in heart rate from time to time. She is hypertensive, but she controlled her blood pressure with Lisinopril. However, G. B. does not like to go to hospitals and thinks that medications are not necessary all the time. She came alone as she is a widow, and her children live far away in another country, so she did not want to bother them but check her condition independently. She defined herself as an isolated person after her husband’s death in an accident. She has a close circle of friends who visit her sometimes, but there is no regular person to discuss her problems or concerns.PathophysiologyCOPD is a common diagnosis in many adults who have a history of smoking. Besides, this disease is one of the leading causes of morbidity and mortality today (Yawn et al., 2021). Thus, much attention is paid to its management and prevention through education and early detection. In addition to prolonged coughing, COPD patients experience fatigue, and the quality of life is significantly decreased (Early et al., 2019). In most cases, people who smoke suffer from dyspnea or shortness of breath, and clinicians ask to inhale and exhale a portion of volume to check their ability to get air in (Yawn et
established, and financial support for nursing research is being strengthened. In medical institutions, permanent positions of nurses have been introduced – scientific workers are involved in the conducting of clinical nursing research.In countries such as Great Britain, Germany, France, Switzerland, there are tendencies for recognizing nursing as an independent profession, the practical activity of which has a developed theoretical basis. There are three principal differences between research-based and evidence-based practices. The first is that the first one is more practically-oriented. The second is that the result is gained through the testing in various settings. The last differentiating feature is that the methods’ and results’ effectiveness is higher than in research-based practices.Bharat Aggarwal, former professor emeritus of cancer research, resigned after discovering the fraud in many publications he published on curcumin for cancer treatment. As of 2020, Aggarwal has had many of his research papers withdrawn ( Prominent Indian-American researcher under probe , 2018). Such misconduct should be avoided in scientific research, especially in healthcare field. To do so, the researchers should ensure the reliability and validity of the study by getting approval from the institutional review board. If I were to conduct the research, I would use the participants’ rights protection principle and seek the governmental healthcare association’s approval of chosen methods.
In Mesopotamia and Egypt, the first kings similarly worked alongside priests and depended on their support. However, Egyptian kings, specifically called pharaohs, were considered kings of the whole region and clearly stood above priests, while Mesopotamian kings worked closely with them (Brooks, 2019). Another important difference is the origin of the state’s rulers, as Mesopotamian kings were also warriors who led their people in battles with their neighbors, while Egyptian pharaohs were thought to be god-kings (Brooks, 2019). Egypt was a centralized unit, unlike Mesopotamia, which presented itself as several separate states.Furthermore, differences in religious outlooks arose from alternate views on why the gods created humans. Mesopotamians considered gods to be cruel and believed that humans were not to enjoy life and could risk offending the gods (Brooks, 2019). Unlike the Egyptians, they did not believe in the afterlife, possibly because of the god’s attitude towards people. In Egypt, a religious, ethical code approved by gods guided each citizen (Kreis, 2006). This is why the afterlife was such an essential part of their beliefs – it was a process that evaluated their goodness throughout life.The religious and agricultural development inevitably led to the intellectual and cultural progress of the countries. The Middle Kingdom of Egypt is famous for its papyrus use, along with ink and cosmetics (Brooks, 2019). Mummification was an essential process related to their general religious beliefs. On the contrary, the warfare and trade typical for Mesopotamia explain their creation of the wheel and significant improvement of architecture and the sciences (Brooks, 2019). It can be suggested that religion played a major role in the groundbreaking inventions of Egypt (Kreis, 2006). Generally, the key differences between the regions arose from contrasting religious and political systems.
The term “confession” has several meanings, such as admitting one’s sins and being ready to repent. Augustine began working on the C onfessions when he was probably 43 years old (Teubner 1). There is no precise, clear motivation to write his own, but there may be at least two possible factors. First, his people were suspicious of his ideal standards, his career as a bright teacher of rhetoric, pagan-influenced education, his known reputation as an ex-Manichee (Teubner 57). By writing the confession, he would defend himself from this kind of criticism and demonstrate that his faith and beliefs were pure Christians. Another possible motivational possibility may have been brought up by his close friendship with Alypius, Christian converts such as Paulinus Nola, who renounced the world and his immense family fortune after his conversion to Christianity.The C onfession comprises 13 Books; books 1 to 9 recount Augustine’s life and spiritual journey, while book 10 shows the temptations, he was still facing. Books 11 to 13 are the extensions of the first chapter of Genesis. The first ten books were about Agustine, while the last three were about the scripture. All the Confessions had many themes such as nature of evil, sin, time, sufferings, lust, truth, wisdom and knowledge, weakness, pride, internal peace. According to Augustine, God cannot be the cause of evil. For Augustine says, “evil does not exist”(Teubner 78). Evil lacks good, and evil exists as long as good is absent.Saint Augustine’s Confessions have a unified theme of inner peace. His reflections on it seem
to bring his deliberate state of spiritual and psychological calmness, despite the burdens and stressors in his journey. He believes that human beings cannot find inner peace without involving God; he believes human beings were made to seek peace in God. There is excellent echoing of the solid ethical foundation portrayed by ancient philosophers as Neoplatonic and the Pythagoras vis a vis beauty; these are Augustine’s favorite themes.Augustine was a student at Carthage, and he was troubled by troublers who interrupted his classes there, rendering him among the critical students who refused to pay their fees. In addition to that, he was financially inconvenienced (Teubner 157). Notwithstanding his disconcertment, he wishes and reassured that such students would be preferred to learn to money. He furthermore says, “You, O God, the truth and fullness of our sure good, and our purest peace” (Augustine 126). Despite being stressed, Augustine remains psychologically calm, thus concluding that inner peace is achievable whatever the situation.At the time, Saint Augustine was describing the decision to resign his professorship after an upcoming vacation in the autumn holidays, with his chest problems giving him a further excuse to resign. He mentions to his students “who did not meditate on Your law or Your peace, but on foolish lies and legal battles” (Augustine 79). He continues by giving an extended analysis of the scripture in Psalms 4. Music was Augustine’s interest; he introduced the idea of singing psalms during the time of distress via the story of Ambrose’s Basilica. Shifting gears, love, according to Augustine,
is not limited to human beings alone. But Love expands to God’s love for human beings, the love that the inanimate beings have for their natural lives. When it comes to humans, their love is multidimensional; it grows from one stage to another: love at infancy; love at adolescence; love for interests and desires.From his infancy, Augustine indicates that he could not speak and yet he could sense bitterness and jealous in others. From the above statement, we can understand that Augustine never is fond of infants. Throughout infancy, infants would take everything selfishly for themselves only, constantly crying to be given attention and not to be ignored, to be loved only (Teubner 57). Infant’s love can only be described as love for hunger which demands to be filled, or love for pleasure that requires to be filled with comfort. That is why Augustine claims that love is one of the origins of sin; even at birth, everyone is got sin in them.Next, the author analyzes the stages of love in adolescence. At this stage, humans start to experience different types of love. Here they will begin having desires to love, be loved, pleasures, love for earthly materials. Augustine says in his second book, “The single desire that dominated my search for delight was simply to love and be loved” (Augustine 144). He claims that humans’ thoughts of erotic desires of wanting to love or be loved could be the way that can lead to God or lead them astray from God.Augustine attends a theatre show
to understand human emotions and existence in another instance to feel the pleasure and love; desires of crying, weeping, laughing, and passion. It is clear that he wished to enjoy these desires and likes but realized gradually that as he enjoys giving into his desires, it led him astray from God’s path into alienation. Confessions has a central topic of sin, mercy, and fleeing. For the most of his life, Saint Augustine looked to be avoiding Christianity by engaging in practices and cults such as Manichaeism. Also, he is entombed in a sea of passion. He is avoiding confession because he does not believe he has what it takes to live a life consistent with the teachings of the Bible. Through the audience of sinners, this book had an impact on the Middle East. This book teaches the reader exactly what sin and confession look like in real life.A topological understanding of how to confess and become a Christian is also imparted to the audience. In Augustine’s stories, the audience connects with them because they are relatable. Preachers who seek to reach out to the lost can find inspiration in this memoir. Inquiring minds who doubt their own misdeeds and God. This personal book shows those who have committed grave crimes that God is able to pardon them all. Many big crimes were committed by Saint Augustine, and he even challenges the Lord, “Why do you demand me to love you?” (Augustine 24). Augustine was saved by God’s grace despite his many transgressions.Augustine introduces freedom as
another set of theme that is evident in Confession. He says freedom is a man’s ability to freely have the presence of ‘evil will’ within the man’s soul. “They say this is the soul, enslaved, contaminated and corrupt…” (Augustine, 79). Free will is human desire that comes from the perfection of God’s steadfast love; this gives humans the ability to do anything freely. This proves that humans were made of God’s likeness and image.However, freedom is not to be mistakenly used as an excuse for breaking the rules and guidelines to do anything illegal from someone’s locale. There are consequences to be met; thus, we are not free to perform actions without them being checked into balance. Augustine says, “I directed my mind to understand what I was being told, namely that the free choice of the will is the reason why we do wrong and suffer your just judgment” (Augustine 256). From his statement, we can note that freedom is the beginning of evil; as stated earlier that ‘evil will’ stay within humans’ souls. Therefore, it can be said that it is in humans’ nature that when they get any freedom, they will commit evil.Augustine was faced with other challenges that later affected his general growth, especially while at school. In Carthage, Augustine came across a quote in the book Hortensias by Cicero, which says, “It is the pursuit of truth through a philosophy that leads a person to a thoroughly happy life” (Augustine 122). This line of quote impacted Augustine’s life and affected his
the sea of lust. According to City of God, what were the consequences of lust? The way of the earthly city is outlined as a way of lust, where one turns to the good of the world for themselves. Sexual lust is obvious evidence of a misdirected love, here the body is in control and refuses to listen to the spirit hence pulling the spirit into earthly pleasures. The consequence of lust is death as the connection between the two is well clear.In conclusion, Saint Augustine’s Confession contains many different themes but putting more emphasis on sin. In his writing, he shows how sin leads us to God or astray from God. These themes are pretty related to those studies in other texts by authors such as Aristotle, Plato, and Euclid.
There are always multiple obstacles that can significantly diminish the overall efficiency of any project plan. Therefore, it is crucial to analyze all the factors that may stay behind potential barriers to its successful implementation. Given the complexity of the project plan and the holistic approach expected to prevail in all stages of its fulfillment, there are numerous spheres that may be exposed to certain risks. Significant changes that affect the organizational structure of an institution always lead to various issues ranging from increased expenditures to employees’ diminished motivation and resistance to changes. A dedicated analysis is needed in order to find the most appropriate solutions to problems that may arise.One of the essential issues that should be addressed while implementing the plan is centered around the employees’ perception of the efficiency and urgent nature of the changes that the project plan implies. Therefore, it is of significant importance to provide all employees that may be affected with a substantial body of evidence proving the benefits to a hospital in general. It is crucial to underpin the strong correlation between a hospital’s performance and employees’ salaries.Given the importance of measures listed in the project plan, the only issue that might make employees anxious is their pay. Factors such as lack of cooperation among the medical team, lack of motivation in nurses, lack of a holistic approach, and lack of support organizations could be barriers to holistic care (Babaei & Taleghani, 2019). Therefore, employees that are most likely to be exposed to increased amounts of stress should
used while implementing the project plan. White et al. (2021) name careful planning, execution, evaluation, and broad dissemination among the measures that are instrumental for a successful outcome. Dang et al. (2021) pinpoint the increased importance of dissemination plans, audience-specific recommendations for internal and external dissemination venues, pros and cons of different types of dissemination. Thus, collecting data and evidence continue to play a crucial role in mitigating potential barriers.There are multiple barriers that may undermine the rapid and efficient implementation of the project plan. Nevertheless, solutions provided in this work allow for an enhanced understanding of the strengths and weaknesses of the plan and may eventually contribute to future changes. Therefore, it is vital to stick to the original plan that includes stipulations on the required actions if specific difficulties arise. Nevertheless, additional efforts are needed to secure the payments, keep employees engaged and motivated, and provide precise guidelines for cases when deadlines cannot be met.
In general, numerous types of reasoning exist and find implementation, but not all of them bear special significance for decisions affecting patient care. Approaches to reasoning can be classified into types based on the inductive or deductive direction of inquiry, the use of analogy or abduction, the utilization of decomposition and evidence synthesis, and so on. In the healthcare field, reliance on credible evidence is what informs the professional community’s approach to clinical reasoning, given that mere suggestions and excessive experimentation and creativity involve extra risks for healthcare consumers. Particularly, the so-called frequency-based reasoning dominates the field, especially when it comes to guideline development, and it requires practitioners to rely on statistics in making clinical decisions (Wieringa et al., 2018). This way of thinking has diverse benefits, including the ability to limit reliance on questionable hypotheses and make virtually any decision integrated with the global healthcare knowledge base.To clarify the standards for reasoning and determine their levels, relevant evaluative questions must be posed. When formulating such questions, it might be essential to distinguish between the scientific and ethical levels of clinical reasoning. From the viewpoint of the scientific perspective, asking questions about the thinking process’s clarity, alignment with the previously reported evidence, and relevance to objective information pertaining to the client is important to further detail the standards of reasoning. Questions regarding clinical decisions’ ethical implications can also support the determination of levels in reasoning standards. Such questions might include the consideration of benefits as perceived by the client in decision-making or the client’s unique socio-demographic situation and psycho-emotional condition in arriving at the solution. Similarly, the degree to which healthcare’s universal ethical values inform the reasoning process might be relevant in determining various levels of reasoning standards.
One of the pillars of efficient and meaningful clinical practice is ensuring that every professional is engaged in continuous education and growth. The implementation of evidence-based practice is a direct way to provide such an opportunity to nurses, allowing them to use relevant research to implement better, modernized, and patient-oriented interventions. According to Koota et al. (2021), “the EBP educational intervention implemented in this study had a positive effect on emergency nurses’ EBP attitudes, knowledge, self-efficacy, skills, and behavior” (p. 23). Hence, the introduction of EBP, by all means, is a positive change for the clinical setting.However, it has been established in terms of the practicum that the implementation of EBP is currently limited in eh Memorial Regional Hospital in Hollywood, Florida. The issue is mostly related to the heavy workload of the staff and limited costs allocated to the educational interventions. Currently, the administration of the hospital is oriented towards financing actions and interventions efficient in the short term. Meanwhile, EBP, meaning an innovative approach to practice, can potentially save money on replacing old time-consuming, and less effective interventions.The two major implications of this issue for nursing include the inability to access quality education and increased chances of emotional and physical burnout. Indeed, when nurses have no access to relevant scholarly research, they are less likely to secure positive patient outcomes and acquire knowledge. With the inability to implement more time-efficient and innovative practices, nurses are also at risk of struggling with a heavy workload. Moreover, according to Sultana et al. (2020), EBP can present evidence-based approaches to reduce burnout rates among nurses. For this reason, this issue needs more attention in clinical settings nationwide.
Emily Dickinson’s 1865 poem A narrow Fellow in the Grass conforms to the fear of deceit. The imagery is used to introduce fear or anxiety through a snake. It starts with a skinny man that travels through the Grass. The author takes the readers into the poetic lifeline of exploration of fearing the unknown. Whenever an individual fears the unknown, they are prone to fall victim to deception. The encounter with a snake describes the orientation of deception because they are unpredictable. In the poem, the snake appears and disappears without rooting any warning. The author uses this nature of environmental changes to bring the nature of anxiety and fear. The poem analytically revolves around the realism of fear versus the idealism of deceit, which symbolizes nature and humanity.The author personifies the snake by calling it a fellow , which gives the snake a weird humanistic quality. When it is called a fellow, it means that the snake has thoughts that can materialize into intentions (line 1). The sense of menace seems archetypical. It sums up the presumed encounter that the author supports the idea that there is a bigger problem than the basic analogy of snakes being scary. The symbolic nature of the serpent is fear and deceit, which many people can use in their contexts. Ancient snake symbolism, such as in the Garden of Eden, is trickery or deceiver.The speaker uses flashbacks to relate to his childhood encounter with the snake. According to the speaker, he was fooled into touching a snake (line 12).
Reading Emily Dickinson’s poems is one of the most captivating and challenging tasks for many students. On the one hand, she raises a variety of interesting themes that fulfill human life and motivate in her short poems. On the other hand, the combination of oddness and restraint confuses. There are twelve lines in her “I Died for Beauty,” but each sentence delivers a message about the poet’s interests and literary contributions. Inevitability, life-long goals, and conflict are the three themes in Dickinson’s poem that are properly conveyed through the imagery of truth and beauty.Death is the only thing that remains inevitable in human life despite multiple intentions to avoid or postpone it by a variety of means. Dickinson introduces two speakers who died because of different reasons but similarly “adjusted in the tomb… in an adjoining room” (lines 2, 4). The poet uses such a terrible but expected end when a person leaves this world to underline humans’ equality before nature and the fact that death ends most people’s capacities to speak, wish, or act (Dahami 256). There is no need to consider achievement, knowledge, or wealth because the outcome, an empty grave, is the same for everyone.Another significant aspect of the poem is the identification of life-long goals and possibilities. According to Dickinson, people may die with two thoughts in mind, either for beauty or truth (lines 6-7). These two concepts are so different and similar at the same time, proving her constant struggle for spiritual victory (Sharma 103). The conversation between the supporters of
truth but sees that it does not change faith. The same end and the same emptiness “covered up our names,” without giving a chance to protect and immortalize the identity (Dickinson line 12). Although this poem is not about conflict, this theme strengthens an understanding of the story.Dickinson succeeds in using several powerful techniques and terms to demonstrate how poetry should penetrate the human mind. Her “I Died for Beauty” is not just a conversation between two persons who lived and died but a combination of hope, knowledge, and outcome. This close reading is a chance to see how Dickinson treated life and accepted death through the prism of personal goals and entire conflicts. Inevitability is never univocal, and it is a responsibility of people to live and learn and be ready for death not because of something purposeful but for something eternal.
With exponential growth in smart device users, there is an increase in the volume of data generated from various smart devices, which differs according to all the fundamental V’s used to classify it as big data. In general, most service providers, such as Microsoft, Amazon, and Yahoo, have established a significant number of geographically scattered data centers to process the massive quantity of data generated by various smart devices to give consumers speedy response times. These service providers commonly employ Hadoop and SPARK for processing massive datasets for this reason (Chaudhary et al., 2018). However, there has been less attention placed on the underlying infrastructure, which is one of the most crucial aspects for the effective completion of any specified solution in this context.I believe that cloud technology optimizes and simplifies many of the issues presented in the business applications of big data. It largely solves the problem of insufficient data storage size and ensures the infrastructure’s greater flexibility. Similarly, the information is easier to back up through cloud solutions, increasing the overall resilience of big data-related processes. The value of big data in business cannot be overstated. It aids in identifying the target audience, doing market research, and obtaining more precise findings. Companies will be able to simplify corporate processes by incorporating big data into their operations. Companies will be able to make decisions based on precise information, such as whether to invest in a product. Consequently, they will be able to avoid making inefficient investments. Since the subject of Big Data and the cloud solutions for it becomes unavoidable, it is essential for the firms to adapt their existing infrastructures to the market demands sooner rather than later.
is the division of data into relevant and irrelevant topics based on the topic of co-teaching and collaboration. Only the information that can be utilized for finding a personal approach to the students should be shared and discussed among collaborating teachers.In my future practice, I would like to implement the Station teaching theory where stations are set up and both teachers teach at a station and provide instruction to students. Such a strategy allows students to gain access to the teachers’ help easier, involves asking for help, and provides students with the opportunity of obtaining different explanations. This cooperation strategy helps both teachers establish a successful study plan, collect relevant resources for students, and individualize the educated material according to the needs of their students. For example, in the case of teenagers with a strong retina stratification, cooperating teachers could find a better solution for the enhancement of motivation and productivity in such students. Young adults with eyesight problems might be given special material (video or audio recorded or developed in a better online version) provided by their tutors.
The Coca-Cola Company is a transnational worldwide-known corporation founded in the United States. This company produces and distributes various beverage drinks worldwide; it has been estimated that the mentioned corporation sold its products in more than 200 countries. The Coca-Cola Company uses an image of the ‘one and only’ original beverage drinks manufacturer; the corporation’s positioning is focused on the jovial inspiration of the customer (Brennan, Crawford, and Khamis, 2020). It can be assumed that nowadays, Coca-Cola can be considered as a part of popular culture. Moreover, the company takes an active part in the process of globalisation. In addition, The Cola-Cola Company has a long history of successful advertising Christmas campaigns.Description and the Analysis of the AdvertisementThe given advertisement (see Exhibit A) is a Coca-Cola video ad dedicated to the Christmas of 2021. This advertising video demonstrates the story of a boy who is deeply touched by his senior neighbour’s loneliness during Christmas Eve. While watching a cartoon about Santa Claus, a boy decides to create a personal miracle for his neighbour. The following part of the plot depicts the collective efforts of the house residents to build an improvised chimney, through which a gift will be delivered. Finally, at the end of the advertisement, the classic bottle of Coca-Cola is being introduced to a viewer by native integration into a video. Undoubtedly, the main idea that this ad attempts to deliver is the importance of a strong community and of family or friendly bonds. The main objective of this advertisement is to promote the
brand’s values, sustain the corporate image of The Coca- Company, and advertise the drink’s integrity in modern life.The Ad’s Stopping PowerOne of the main aims of the given ad is to make an average customer think that this particular product is unique, original, and irreplaceable. The Coca-Cola Company is a major corporation with a big name and credible reputation, and their main product is one of the most recognisable beverage drinks in the world. Due to that fact, the main task of the Coca-Cola advertising campaign is to sustain its reputation as one of the most popular brands in the soda industry (Guo and Wen, 2021). Since the brand occupies a top position in that particular part of the market, the main threat that may negatively impact the company’s profits is the risk of various substitutions; for example, the corporation’s main opponent – PepsiCo and its products (Guo and Wen, 2021). What may seem like a simple reminder of a company’s existence, in reality, plays a crucial competitive role. Therefore, one of the inherent parts of Coca-Cola’s advertising and the message that is present in the reviewed ad is the idea that Coca-Cola is an original beverage drink that cannot be replaced.Another crucial aspect of this ad is its central message that goes in the subtext of the given plot – an idea that Coca-Cola is an integral part of the Christmas celebration. The conditions of modern era advertising force the companies to justify an average customer’s need to buy a particular product (Polesana, 2019). It
can be noted that this brand’s advertising campaigns have been focused on this event for a continuous period. The company implied Christmas advertising for more than 100 years (Jones, 2019). As a result, a bottle of Coca-Cola has become a natural Christmas attribute, at least in Western countries (Ireland and Ashton, 2017). Moreover, the style of storytelling and the presentation of the product itself implies that the customer is already familiar with the advertised product. Thus, one of the advertisement’s goals is to remind a consumer that Coca-Cola plays a key role in creating the Christmas atmosphere.In addition, the entertaining aspect of the ad must be considered as well. Although the plot of the video has been discussed, its effect has yet to be determined. It is important to understand that the reason why the advertisement introduces the product itself only at the end of the video is to keep the viewer intrigued (Sharma and Bumb, 2020). Since the viewer cannot predict what product is being advertised, he or she will most likely continue watching the video until the very end (Sharma and Bumb, 2020). The slice of life, in combination with a small fantasy, appears to be quite appealing to an average consumer, who seeks to tighten the family and community bonds during the Christmas holidays. Therefore, a minimal product placement in the ad, coupled with a somewhat complex and relatable plot, attract the consumer’s attention.Although the ad does obtain a unique selling product, it may be noted that it successfully bonds the product with
the customer’s joy and happiness. Undoubtedly, not every company has a need to use a particular USP in order to successfully advertise a product; such is the case of Coca-Cola (Presman, 2017). Instead of focusing on a particular benefit that a customer may obtain, the ad promotes the well-established idea that a company is a manufacturer and distributor of pure happiness (Presman, 2017). As a result, this ad holds on to the main marketing strategy of a company and continues to mark the extent of joy that this particular product may bring into a customer’s life.Finally, the specificities of the ad’s visual part are focused on giving a viewer nostalgic and heartwarming feelings rather than exciting and impressing them. Due to a brand’s continuous history, one of Coca-Cola’s goals is to remind some consumers about the taste of their youth (Aytekin and Ayaz, 2018). Since the image of the brand forms various customer’s expectations, the fulfilment of these expectations directly affects the company’s profit levels (Anisimova, Weiss and Mavondo, 2021). In addition, The Coca-Cola company sustains a trusting relationship (as an additional factor of retention) with its customers (Mahmoud, 2018). Thus, while promoting a drink as a part of the tradition, the company attempts to proclaim that the customer always gets what he expects, that Coca-Cola is a part of his family.The red colour, which is unmistakably associated with Coca-Cola, is used to depict the product as a tasteful and desired drink (Mochama, 2020). In addition, in the case of this particular advertisement, the red colour
is associated with Christmas, which may be a part of the aspect discussed earlier (Mochama, 2020). It can be stated that the visual part of this ad prevails over the textual elements; the viewer’s attention is captivated by a wordless touching story. Overall, this ad may be characterised as highly persuasive; moreover, it avoids annoying the consumer by using a minimal amount of Coca-Cola’s brand logos.On the other hand, the ad has a minor weak side; although being reviewed separately, this video can be assessed as a high-quality one, the repetitiveness of the foremost thought may be considered annoying. If to consider The Coca-Cola company’s long history of Christmas advertising, it can be noted that the main delivered idea is being constantly repeated. Even though the video has no aim to excite or surprise the viewer, the repeated narrative may appear irritating for some of them.The Ad’s Call To ActionThe ad attempts to sustain the popularity of various concepts among the customers; due to these concepts, which will be discussed below, the company focuses its advertising on a middle-class customer with a family. One of the corporation’s focus points is the family bonds and family itself (Yadav, 2019). Considering the fact that in its advertising campaigns, Coca-Cola considers the family as a whole, a middle-class male or female; for example, the family’s father is the one who is willing to spend money on the given product. Due to the strong interlink between various family holidays and the brand, it is an older member of the family
who will provide them with the drink.At the same time, the intending meaning of an ad is global unity, the sense of community, and the importance of being together during the holidays. The long-established celebrations, such as Christmas, usually imply family reunions; thereby, the Coca-Cola ad tries to promote the idea that the company’s beverage drinks are part of this household spirit. In other words, Coke is what unites people and brings them together, at the same time comforting them and making their ties even more substantial.Judging by the company’s popularity scale, reputation, and market image, it is possible to assume that the advertisement is intended to raise brand awareness instead of promoting a product. Undoubtedly, Coca-Cola is a part of popular and the product itself no longer requires advertising and promotion. However, the corporate image is what retains a company’s target customers and increases the company’s profit (Alkitbi et al., 2021). Thus, a company needs to conduct constant advertising campaigns in order to sustain a customer’s brand awareness. In the case of Coca-Cola, most of the corporations advertising attempts are focused on the consumers’ level of awareness and on sustaining the corporate image (excluding the cases when a company presents a new product).Although the necessary means to convince a viewer may be characterised as the most fitting, and the message itself may seem reasonable, some individuals, including me, are likely to question the ad’s idea. If to consider various ethnicities and cultural traditions’ facts of existence, it seems doubtful that the drink is a part
Social behavior is a complex of behavioral patterns typical for most of society at a particular time. There are several types of them, but they all are characterized by a lack of specific structure, even in the case of deliberately organized movements. It is due to many different influences between all social movement’s members. If they are not directed by some external or internal motivational force, such as political will or money, which organizes them, they are easy to dissolve eventually. The spread of the Internet and social media leads to massive changes in social movements’ creation, organization, and dissolving, allowing much quicker information exchange.Social movements are various, and social media influence them all directly. Uncontrolled movements are initiated by some changes in the world, which are influential for people: for example, financial crises, wars, or even some rumors about important events. Such rumors can even be not true: the prominent example was the case with Sony and Apple in 2010. There were a lot of posts on Facebook and other social media about hypothetical plans of Apple to acquire Sony ( Types of Collective Behavior – Introduction to Sociology: Understanding and Changing the Social World , 2016). They were not true but led to a rise in Sony’s stock price, which depicts how easily social behavior may change under strong stimuli and due to quick spreading.Thus, one can see that social media made social movements much easier to create and much easier to dissolve. They facilitate information exchange, and therefore, all events may become known to many people rapidly via social media posts, online news, and blogs. The consequence is that the social movement, created in response to a stimulus, such as rumors about a large company, will be formed instantly, and its consequences will reveal very quickly, too.
into at least fifty nation-states” is rendered powerfully in Achebe’s work (“Things Fall Apart”). Moreover, being forced to teach their children the essential constructs of the foreign culture, the Ibo people develop a sense of cultural loss and, ultimately, massive community trauma (“Things Fall Apart: Plot Summary”). Thus, the despair that the Ibo people experience as they feel the devastating loss of their culture becomes particularly resonant in the book.By viewing the White, western culture as the only reasonable and legitimate mind frame to possess, White colonists have almost destroyed the Ibo culture, as Achebe’s “Things Fall Apart” illustrates. The book shows how the colonists foisted their culture on the Ibo people, forcing its members not only to accept the new values, philosophies, and even faith, but also to teach the specified cultural constructs to their children. Thus, being stripped of its culture and identity, the Ibo community started falling apart, as the book describes vividly.
by providing them with food, accommodation, financial help, or help them find jobs.In addition, online communities can be supportive and useful for many families. For example, in situations of grief, people can support each other online or offline; however, grief support will need new approaches due to COVID-19 (Moore et al., 2020). Communities living in one district can help families with fires in their flats by sharing blankets, food, and water or by finding a place to live. Moreover, diverse populations or communities supporting families in their health issues are also valuable.Although it may seem that such support does not make much difference, it is entirely wrong to look at the situation from such a perspective. Firstly, such communities support individuals or families in cases of emergency or necessity, and in this way, they can provide help to many people. By supporting families, such organizations help not only separate individuals or families, but they maintain an adequate level of life which helps the country on the governmental living by keeping economic showings on an appropriate level.
There are extremely few films that explore not only female friendships but also delve into the interpersonal connection of women, seeking to escape the restrictions of gender, class, time, and place. In turn, Scott’s road movie reveals the female nature from the inside. Thelma, married at 18 and tolerating her tyrannical husband, is not as downtrodden and tame as many would like to see. Thelma does not agree to condone, so she packs her things, throws suitcases into her friend’s car, leaves a note for her husband, and goes off with Louise for the whole weekend. If Thelma is an amateur adventurer, then Louise is a serious rebel. Her boyfriend Jimmy has no power over her, but rather she dictates the rules to him, although she is forced to endure his constant adventures while she works as a waitress. Louise does not hesitate to shoot the man who tried to rape her girlfriend.Seeing the world through the eyes of liberated women driving merrily into the unknown was an innovation that boldly granted a woman the right to be human. Cooper notes that this is a movie about women who defy eternity and openly neglect social conditions. It has a philosophical background in the immortality of the soul and the lofty value of freedom, which despises even death. The film’s finale proves that suicide is preferable to prison, just as lethal injection is better than life imprisonment.It is a pity that they do not make strong films about women’s struggles in Hollywood anymore; that is why it
remains to revise Thelma and Louise from year to year. The current films about women ending with a wedding, and receiving a ring from a man are equated to the moment of personal transformation and self-identification of a woman who is looking for only worldly peace in life. These stereotypical films are forgotten and will never become a symbol of the female spirit, which Thelma and Louise became precisely because it reflects the true woman’s need for freedom.Smith, in her speech, focuses on gender inequality in cinema. As confirmation, the speaker presents depressing statistics. First, according to Smith, less than a third of all speaking characters are women (2:39). The most unexpected thing is that the situation has not changed for 70 years. As my example, I can cite the world-famous film The Lord of the Rings, where all ten central roles are male. Thus, the woman is still noticeably absent from the screen.Second, Smith asserts that in addition to gender inequality, Hollywood films are characterized by racial and ethnic discrimination. It is noteworthy that it is possible to expect changes in this direction. In 2020, the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences announced the introduction of special rules that should eliminate inequalities within the organization itself and the film industry. Rottenberg affirms that starting in 2024, films that qualify for the Best Film award must meet at least two of the four criteria. Among them is the presence of actors from an ethnic or racial minority, 30% of the composition of a woman, representatives
the gender of the director and the peculiarity of the roles in this movie. Thus, the more women participate in creating a movie, the more women appear on the screen, and vice versa. This fact is one of the reasons for the disappointing statistics on the number of women in cinema and the peculiarity of their representation. Therefore, given the disheartening statistics and trends that have taken place in recent years, Hollywood cinema is not a very good place for women.Chelsey, thanks for your opinion. Indeed, in addition to the motif of freedom and independence, Thelma and Louise unfold with a feminist approach, making women as strong as men. The film’s female perspectives undermine and appropriate the dominant male gaze typical of mainstream Hollywood cinema, using mockery as a narrative device to illustrate the sexism inherent in the male gaze. Three narrative devices are explicated that structure the mockery in the film: stereotypes about depraved and testosterone-obsessed men; portray men as a spectacle for female attention; and the celebration of women’s friendships. The result of the tongue-in-cheek techniques is a strong female gaze that resists and defies patriarchy and opens the film’s text to a feminist reading. As for the TED talk by Stacy Smith, indeed, the situation regarding the role of women in the film industry is disastrous. Thus, nowadays, most films are shot by men and many films still represent the male gaze.
The barriers that firms may face on their way to internal logistical integration are possible to group into five categories by their origin and nature. The first derives from an insufficiently coherent structure of a business that results in poor communication among its departments. According to Bowersox (2019), this is the consequence of the “traditional practice” of uniting the employees who are responsible for certain activities into clusters to enable excellent performance though functional perfection (p. 332). In practice, meanwhile, such an approach can result in an insufficiently effective corporate culture, in other words, a lack of unity, morale, and dedication, frequently from top management as well (Naseem et al., 2021). My professional experience illustrates this; I have worked for a firm where the boss showed little to no interest in organizational routine. Furthermore, some of my coworkers from different departments considered their function the most important, offending each other.The traditional systems of management and reward, which actually result from the above functional structure, also can be an obstacle to internal integration. Notably, they “mirror” that structure, focusing on employees’ achievements in the area of their activity rather than their involvement in corporate culture and contribution to the performance of the entire company (Bowersox, 2019, p. 332). In fact, this begins ever before employment; many educational institutions stick to the classical assessment system that uses grades as the only measurement. Consequently, school leavers as well as graduates, including myself, have to acquire knowledge about other reward systems intentionally, and it remains theoretical in most cases.Considering the
enable it. Furthermore, even the need to hire a new employee may bear a threat for productivity since it will be hardly possible to compensate for his or her lack of relevant knowledge (Bowersox, 2019). This actually is among the reasons why I left the above company. Specifically, I did not see any development prospects there, as the informational restrictions prevented me from adequate self-actualization.Finally, another possible barrier is inappropriate infrastructure, which umbrella term comprises, primarily, transportation, storage, and inventory. Thus, the latter, as Bowersox (2019) insists, should be in the minimal quantity that it necessary for surviving drops in demand or similar perturbations. Otherwise, a business may face considerable financial challenges emerging from the need to store and maintain extra equipment; its obsolescence can aggravate the situation. In fact, this is a quite natural phenomenon even in everyday life, for instance, many have cupboards full of unnecessary items, and I am not an exception. In business, however, such practice is especially unfavorable because it can interfere with process integration.
IntroductionComparative politics is a scientific concept that is widely applied in the study of political science. This concept and ideology are used to study different political units of countries, pointing out how different they run their political affairs while at the same time noting differences. According to Caramani (2020), comparative politics rely on comparative methods that benchmark one country’s political system to another to understand the failure or success of various countries’ political systems. There are several mythological approaches to studying political science, including statistical, case study, and experimental methods (Chilcote 2018). In simpler terms, comparative politics applies comparative approaches in examining two or more countries to assess various political functions. The two countries chosen for this research paper are Canada and the United States. Therefore, the concept of comparative politics will be applied to the two selected counties’ political unit systems to point out both similarities and differences.Canadian and American GovernmentCountries and states have specific rules and statutes that have different contents. This implies that the laws apply differently in states or countries. Therefore, Canada and Unites States are different countries; the two have political systems and units that differ in operation and how the vital process occurs. According to John Wesley Dafoe (2022), the political systems of the United States and Canada exhibit some similarities and differences. Despite the numerous changes that have occurred in both countries’ systems, they are still a replica of one another with slight variations. John Wesley Dafoe (2022) educates that the Canadian Dominion and the American Commonwealth explain the
two countries’ political system development. However, John Wesley Dafoe (2022) noticed that Canada has stayed under the umbrella of Great Britain and therefore is practicing parent-state laws.On the other hand, the United States is a sovereign state and drives its principles from the European constitution (Floridi 2020, p. 371). Therefore, from the country’s profiles, it is clear that the two have different government operations with some similarities.Canada and the American government have similarities and differences worth discussing in this paper. Floridi (2020, p. 372) reports that the two countries’ governments have central authority with many supporting local administrations literary, known as states in the United states and provinces in Canada. In both countries, the central government or authority has enormous power and is entitled to national issues, including the local administration’s security and integrity (Palsson et al. 2020, p. 1269). Other studies, however, report that Canada is not yet an independent state and thus depends on the imperial power of England (Gilmore, Kousky and St.Clair 2022, p. 216).This means that the laws governing Canada are from England’s laws. From this claim, Canada, therefore, has no power or voice to proclaim war or do its affairs independently without involving the great power of England (Gilmore, Kousky and St.Clair 2022, p. 218). As such, it can be noted that the great power of England is the parent rock of the Canadian constitution.The two countries’ governments also differ remarkably when the power assumed by the respective central governments is compared. According to Dauvergne (2018, p. 579), the Dominion government’s
powers include all that federal laws grant. On the other hand, the opposite is true because the central government seems to have equal powers with the federal government. Coming to the judicial systems of the two countries, it is crucial to report that there are also some similarities and differences in how court proceedings are carried out in each country. The judicial systems are similar in that the Canadian system consists of many federal courts at the province level, equivalent to the United States federal courts in different states (Dauvergne 2018, p. 581). However, Canada is reported to have one federal court compared to the United Supreme Court because these two courts presume enormous power. One noticeable difference in the judicial system of the two countries is that there is no federal court in each province as there are courts in each state.Political PartiesDemocracy in any country is nurtured when citizens can express their voices and interests by choosing the leaders they want. A group of federal representatives defines the United States democratic system voted for by the United States citizens. The modern politics witnessed in the United States is a result of two major parties, the Democrats and the Republicans, which have been the dominating parties since the dawn of Unites States politics (Dippel 2022, p. 33).Ethnicity, race, originality, religion, and money are the major factors that impact United States political party system. In their research, Hess and Renner (2019, p. 420) found that the United States Federal government consists of three legislative, executive, and
judicial branches. About democracy the United States practices representative democracy, where leaders are elected to represent other citizens in the national senate, congress, and local governments (Hess & Renner 2019, p. 423). Although there are some minority parties in the United States political system, the state could be referred to as a two-party political system because the country only has two dominant parties with high odds of winning an election.Canada exhibits a different political system from that of the United States. According to Tanguay (2021, p. 741), the Canadian political system is based on the context of parliamentary egalitarianism. Canada is a constitutional country, unlike the United States, and thus enjoys a multiparty system of state and legislative practices. Even though Tanguay (2021, p. 742) identifies the Liberty Party of Canada and the Conservative Party of Canada as the major parties, other research has also pointed out minority parties in Canada. These include New Democratic Party, Green Party, and the Quebec nationalist Bloc (Tanguay 2021, p. 742). Just like the other two dominating parties in Canada, these minority parties have found relevance in Canada which brings a different picture when compared to other parties in the united stated, a part from the discussed major parties.Political CultureCulturally, the two countries under investigation show different political orientations from one another. The critical literature search found that Canada has adopted an egalitarian type of leader for decades (Budd 2019, p. 138). This leadership model benefits citizens greatly because it supports social amenities and steers economic freedom and multiculturalism. Thus,
Canada emphasizes social equality, which entails individual rights and inclusivity (Budd 2019, p. 143). The Canadian political system is democratic, resulting in universal healthcare, gun control, and social and foreign aid programs. On the other hand, American political culture could be well explained based on Elazar’s theory. Elazar’s theory holds that American political culture is divided into distinct cultures, including moralistic, individualist, and traditionalistic (López 2022, p. 100367). Elazar’s theory portrays American political culture as moralistic in that the government is seen as a means that caters to society by ensuring citizens’ welfare (López 2022, p. 100367). Moralistic political culture enhances transparency and honesty, which are the key pillars of democracy.Elazar’s theory also states that the United States system could also be experiencing an individualist political culture. This culture is the type in which the government is portrayed as a tool that solves and addresses citizens’ issues. The government must provide vulnerable citizens with healthcare services and feeding programs in an individualist culture. According to Elazar et al. (2022), the individualist political culture is practised in states such as New Jersey, New York, and Pennsylvania (Elazar et al. 2022). Finally, some states in America also exhibit a traditionalist type of political culture that enhances prejudice against other ethnic groups while perpetrating white dominance (Elazar et al. 2022).This is true because, in the recent past, the United States has witnessed mass demonstrations criticizing how black police officers treat Americans (Updegrove et al. 2018, p. 3). A good example is the demonstrations about black lives matter. This was
Achieving core and specialty competencies is of significance for DNP learners since it ensures that they gain knowledge and skills that are essential for their future professional activity. That is why it is reasonable to involve in evaluating whether the scientific activity and practice immersion hours contribute to reaching this result. Thus, the given paper will comment on how I have achieved five course outcomes and present my self-reflection regarding the work made.Nursing and science-based theories play a significant role in my professional area. That is why I invested many efforts to ensure that I used and integrated them during my coursework. For example, these approaches helped me identify that creating interdisciplinary research and practice themes is a valuable activity. The rationale behind this claim refers to the fact that multiple course assignments revealed the significance of collaboration. In particular, I found that there should be a direct connection between researchers and decision-makers because scholarly evidence should guide healthcare delivery models to address many issues, and pressure injuries are among them.Furthermore, working with my DPI project demonstrates that theories are of significance when it comes to addressing specific health problems. That is why the theory of planned behavior is considered a practical approach to minimize the prevalence of pressure injuries in the health care industry. On the one hand, scientific evidence offers some arguments in favor of the given idea. On the other hand, practice immersion hours demonstrated that the theory of planned behavior is an effective tool. The rationale behind this claim relates to the
fact that patients’ health tends to improve when they are told what and when to do. That is why the given theory is an adequate theoretical base to combat pressure injuries.It is also worth admitting that the employment of science-based theories and concepts was an effective approach to enhance health care delivery. In particular, it relates to the fact that numerous factors, including injuries, infections, and others, can affect patient safety. That is why it was found that beneficial outcomes can be obtained from using “a customized set of Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality (AHRQ) patient fall reduction guidelines” (William, 2020, p. 210). This information reveals that the literature review activities have led to implementing new practice approaches that have the potential to follow high healthcare delivery standards.Simultaneously, achieving the course competencies has provided me with solid theoretical information on my DPI Project. It relates to the fact that I enriched my knowledge of epidemiology, research practice, and statistical methods regarding pressure injuries. I have managed to absorb this information by investing in literature review activities. The rationale behind this strategy refers to the fact that scholarly sources can provide all the required information concerning a specific health issue and its place in the medical industry.Finally, it is reasonable to comment on how I will apply the information above to my DPI Project. On the one hand, I will use the theory of planned behavior as a basis of the practice improvement interventions. This approach is considered adequate because credible data have revealed that patients
need specific recommendations and directions that will guide their behavior and help them achieve better health outcomes. On the other hand, the course activities have helped me understand that the application of science-based theories is possible if it is supported by sufficient evidence. That is why I will do my best to enrich the DPI Project with credible, relevant, and timely literature findings.Since DNPs should do their best to promote the principles of business, finance, and economics, I also invested in this sphere. I developed a budget for my DPI Project and provided the rationale for it. It refers to course DNP-840 that included comments on direct and indirect, fixed and variable, as well as other costs to reduce the prevalence of pressure injuries among older people in a medical unit. That activity resulted in the fact that I now understand that a DNP should invest sufficient time and effort in ensuring that medical interventions should stay within stipulated budgets (Nolin, 2017). This competency will inevitably bring a few advantages to my professional practice.Furthermore, the course assignments helped me develop and improve my leadership, influence, and advocacy skills in implementing healthcare policies. In particular, it relates to a case study analysis that I performed. The assignment focuses on breast cancer since it is a widespread condition affecting multiple patients. I identified that this health problem implies ethical and cultural implications of care because a specific population, older women, are more subject to the condition. That is why the course assignments allowed me to make sure that
early screening is an essential approach to minimize the prevalence of breast cancer.In the healthcare industry, one should draw sufficient attention to employing consultative and leadership skills. I invested in developing this competency during my practice immersion hours. It refers to the fact that I worked in collaboration with professionals from dietary, respiratory, and physician groups. In that case, it was required to rely on effective leadership practices to promote the work of such professionally diverse groups. That is why I applied concepts of a few leadership styles, including servant, transformation, and authoritative ones, to motivate and guide these professionals. There is no doubt that effective leadership is of significance when it comes to teamwork in the healthcare sphere.In addition to that, course 815 was productive because it revealed that my professional practice should aim at meeting health policy standards. This claim relates to the fact that policy governs all life spheres, and the healthcare industry is not an exception. That is why I learned how to find political standards and contribute to their implementation. Furthermore, the course activities allowed me to identify that a few ethical issues related to hospital-acquired pressure ulcers. Thus, I comprehended that my task would be to ensure that patients would not suffer from these problems.This paragraph will explain how I will use the competencies of this outcome in my DPI Project. Firstly, the principles of finance, business, and economics are essential for the Project because it is necessary to understand whether the proposed interventions will be reasonable from a financial
point of view. An attentively developed budget can demonstrate whether it is rational to implement a particular intervention. Secondly, leadership-related competencies are also essential since the DPI Project implies cooperation with many patients, healthcare professionals, and authorities. That is why developed leadership skills will help me motivate and organize individuals to ensure that they approve the Project and actively participate in it.The work with practice information systems and databases is of significance for DNP nurses. That is why I invested sufficient effort to gain the given competency. It refers to the fact that I completed the assignment from course DNP-815 about the conceptual-theoretical-empirical (CTE) structure. The phenomenon under consideration offers theoretical background for developing a middle-range theory (Garvey et al., 2019). The assignment focused on a theory of nursing in hypertension care. That activity allowed me to understand that the structure could be considered a practical approach to evaluate a middle-range approach and identify its strengths and weaknesses. The literature review played an essential role in my gaining this competency because scholarly evidence was necessary to locate the theory and apply the CTE structure to its analysis.Furthermore, I dealt with the evaluation of consumer health information sources. I drew specific attention to ensure that they meet the requirements regarding timeliness, accuracy, and appropriateness. This competency was achieved since I relied on financial data and various technical tools to calculate the costs of healthcare and proposed interventions. In this case, the literature review also contributed to essential advantages. It refers to the fact that reliable and timely
studies can be a valuable source of information to find and evaluate the required data. Furthermore, analyzing the scientific evidence helped me improve my knowledge of healthcare-related practices and tools.Simultaneously, I reviewed and evaluated Internet-based cognitive-behavioral therapy (iCBT). This approach was practical since it helped select and use health information systems and patient care technology. In particular, this competency refers to an assignment on technology interface evaluation. That activity allowed me to become familiar with such concepts as usability, functionality, and user experience. I identified that all information systems should meet multiple requirements to ensure that both patients and healthcare professionals can benefit from them.In addition to that, DNP-835 was productive for me since I completed a case report for the application of quality and safety concepts. It refers to the fact that I identified that a few measures could directly influence patient safety. According to Ismail (2017), they are “state policy, diagnosis, medications, surgical operations, infections, and injuries” (p. 592). It denotes that any of these spheres can create barriers and threats to the concept of patient safety within a healthcare setting. Simultaneously, it indicates that it is possible to affect any of the areas to provide patients with safer and more qualitative care.Finally, it is rational to state what information will be used in my DPI Project. Firstly, the information regarding a middle-range theory and its advantages and disadvantages can be of significance to guide my intervention. Secondly, I will use the skills in calculating the budgets of healthcare and proposed interventions to ensure
that my Project will not be a significant financial burden for an organization. Thirdly, I will do my best to make the intervention meet the usability, functionality, and user experience requirements. Fourthly, an insight into the patient safety areas above will lead to the fact that my intervention will provide individuals with adequate care, at least within one of these spheres.The first segment of this outcome relates to analyzing epidemiological, biostatistical, environmental, and other appropriate scientific data regarding multiple case issues. The epidemiology paper from DNP-825 has helped me meet this objective. It occurred because the case with breast cancer was used to identify the concepts above. Thus, the Center for Disease Control and Prevention (2020) demonstrates that “early menstrual periods before age 12 and starting menopause after age 55 expose women to hormones longer” (para. 5). This finding explains what factors and why they contribute to the fact that breast cancer is considered a widespread disease among women worldwide.It is worth admitting that the literature review activity played an essential role in mastering this outcome. The rationale behind this claim refers to the fact that working with scientific data is a productive strategy to find the required information. The same epidemiology paper involved working with multiple scientific and governmental sources to identify epidemiological, biostatistical, environmental, and other data. I drew sufficient attention to ensure that I worked with credible and reliable articles and studies. That activity allowed me to understand how to dissect a research article and find the data that were relevant to my
research.Simultaneously, I actively engaged in advocating for social justice, equity, and ethical policies within all healthcare spheres. This claim refers to the fact that I participated in five scholarly activities to identify how COVID-19 affects healthcare staff’s needs. In particular, I focused on the necessity to standardize the use of personal protective equipment (PPE) since this strategy could directly affect medical professionals’ response to the pandemic. Those assignments helped me understand that medical facilities should offer sufficient safety conditions to all healthcare providers and patients irrespective of their race, ethnicity, gender, socio-economic status, and others. This approach can ensure that social justice and equity are promoted in the medical industry.In addition to that, the scholarly activities above demonstrated that specific equipment could be considered an effective tool to achieve better health outcomes. That is why the conducted research allowed me to discover that appropriate equipment pieces can reduce the prevalence of pressure injuries among hospitalized patients. Since I have arrived at such a viewpoint, it was necessary to check whether it was valid. Thus, I conducted a literature search to locate timely and empirical studies that would either support or deny the advantages of relying on equipment to combat pressure ulcers.There is no doubt that I will effectively apply the skills and knowledge above to my DPI Project. The competency in identifying epidemiological data is essential since it helps identify a widespread health issue and at-risk population to consider in the Project. Since I understand the necessity to promote social justice and equality in healthcare delivery,
I will ensure that my proposed interventions will not discriminate against any group of people based on their characteristic features. Furthermore, my DPI Project will try to focus on using specific equipment to reduce pressure injuries because sufficient evidence reveals the benefits of using this method.The DPI draft prospectus contributed to evaluating outcomes of practice, practice patterns, and systems of care for public health. This claim relates to the fact that this activity helped me advance theory by highlighting whether it was possible to reduce the prevalence of pressure ulcers in the healthcare industry. This outcome was achieved because I focused on the existing national benchmarks regarding the health issue under analysis. Thus, the given approach demonstrated that pressure injuries were a significant problem for the whole medical industry. That is why it is necessary to develop specific interventions to address the situation at a local level.Furthermore, many activities have contributed to the fact that I became familiar with improvement methodologies to promote safe, patient-centered, and timely care. Firstly, I engaged in multiple peer discussions on patient-centered approaches to care delivery. Those activities were productive since I expressed my own thoughts about the topic and listened to my peers’ opinions. The interaction of this kind helped me gain sufficient knowledge on the subject to evaluate the existing approaches and choose the most optimal one. Furthermore, I discovered that there should be a solid partnership between a patient and a clinician. In this case, the probability of achieving the desired health outcomes increases because all stakeholders actively
sustainability assignment allowed me to understand that every practical intervention should have a theoretical basis that supports it. Thus, my DPI Project will also focus on a robust theoretical background to achieve successful results.The given assessment paper has demonstrated that I managed to gain many skills and competencies that can help me complete my DPI Project. Firstly, sufficient expertise in literature review activities denotes that I will work to identify credible and timely sources for the Project. Secondly, the acquaintance with the quality and safety concepts will contribute to the fact that I will develop and implement an intervention that will meet these requirements. Thirdly, the experience in dealing with financial issues will also be utilized in the DPI Project. Finally, leadership, nursing and science-based theories, and other discussed competencies will be beneficial for my future work.It is also reasonable to mention that the 10 Strategic Points document and the Draft Prospectus require minor changes to ensure that they efficiently guide the DPI Project implementation. Prior to submitting my DPI Project Proposal to the Institutional Review Board (IRB), I should ensure that it meets all the requirements. It implies reading the document several times to identify any existing discrepancies and eliminating them. Possible issues can affect the content, intervention applicability, format, grammar, spelling, and others. Thus, I will do my best to ensure that my DPI Project Proposal meets the highest quality standards.
IntroductionLeadership is an important concept because it affects operations such as safety in a healthcare system. It can be defined as the ability of an individual to inspire others to attain set goals (Keats, 2019). In addition, leaders help ensure that activities run effectively during care. For instance, nurse leaders can handle workplace incivility and conflict among staff. Workplace incivility is among the challenges that affect the provision of quality care to patients. However, safety is a situation where one is free from harm. Therefore, it enables nurses to apply safety initiatives to achieve safety standards required during care.Identification of LeadershipLeadership plays an integral role in the performance of an organization. It is defined as leading a group of people towards achieving a given objective (Keats, 2019). For example, leaders help solve disputes among health professionals or between patients and providers. They also assist in eliminating instances of workplace incivility such as bullying, biases, and other negative emotional responses (Keats, 2019). In addition, leaders ensure that followers can work in teams and acquire appropriate communication skills. As a result, leaders ensure that an organization runs effectively.Appraisal of LeadershipLeadership appraisal is an evaluation that consists of capabilities and traits. Firstly, leaders should be role models or an example to their followers. The followers should learn through them (Becker et al., 2019). For instance, leaders should effectively solve disputes professionally. Secondly, they should guide the followers on the right path, especially in teamwork. Thirdly, leaders should communicate effectively and make sure they listen and respond appropriately. Thus, a
high score in the evaluation is determined by the leadership capabilities a leader displays.Identification of SafetySafety is an important aspect of healthcare because it affects care outcomes. By definition, safety is a state of being free from any harm or danger. It can be the safety of patients or healthcare providers in a setting (Trinchero et al., 2019). It makes sure that providers’ actions, such as diagnosis and treatment, are free from errors. Safety also assists in the creation of a conducive working environment for providers. For instance, working in a clean environment ensures that nurses are free from harm that could be caused when they stay in unclean surroundings. Thus, the overall outcome of safety in a healthcare setting is providers delivering quality healthcare services to patients.Appraisal of SafetySafety appraisal involves aspects used to evaluate safety in a healthcare setting. Firstly, safety is characterized by healthcare services such as diagnostic care being free from mistakes. Secondly, healthcare settings should have minimal patient readmission due to treatment going wrong (Trinchero et al., 2019). Thirdly, healthcare providers should also be free from any danger and should access protective equipment and operate in an environment free from stress. Finally, safety rules are adhered to by both providers and patients.Impact on the Nurses’ Need to Use High-Level Clinical JudgmentThe concept of leadership and safety influence nurses’ need to use high-level clinical judgment in a healthcare setting. First, nurses are mandated to ensure that patients get quality care. To achieve this, the nurses must use their clinical judgment. They are
also required to know when and where to ask for opinions during care. Second, in safety, nurses should adhere to rigorous standards of care (Keats, 2019). Third, they are supposed to use evidence to provide care to patients. Finally, nurses should use the concepts learned in school and the resources available at the facility to ensure quality care. For instance, nurses should collaborate with other healthcare providers to make informed decisions during care.Emerging Health Initiatives – LeadershipThere are emerging health initiatives on the aspect of leadership. Firstly, there is a need to create a conducive working environment where nurses can work effectively and provide quality care. Secondly, adequate nurse staffing to eradicate stress levels that adversely impact care. Third, nurses should have conflict resolution skills to address problems that arise in healthcare (Keats, 2019). Finally, nurses should be educated to help eradicate workplace incivility. For instance, they should understand the effects of incivility on the performance of an organization. Nurses should know the role of technology in providing quality healthcare to patients by improving the efficiency of operations. Thus, the emerging initiatives that leaders should consider are fostering an enabling environment to provide quality healthcare services to the people.Emerging Health Initiatives – SafetyThere are various emerging health initiatives as far as safety in healthcare is concerned. The first initiative is to ensure that nurses work in a safe environment and that patients are free from medical errors (Keats, 2019). The second initiative is conducting rigorous training on safety issues in healthcare. This involves making sure nurses
To advance communication, there is a need to cultivate trust between relevant stakeholders in healthcare, such as nurse leaders, nurses, and patients and their families (Daft & Marcic, 2019). Trust ensures that stakeholders are open and transparent during communication. The other way is to adopt appropriate infrastructure such as communication apps or use the latest technology to improve communication between stakeholders. Another way is by constantly training nurses to be effective communicators. For instance, nurses should have listening skills because it is essential in providing quality care to patients. Thus, effective communication can be attained when there is trust among providers; the facility has appropriate tools to support information sharing, and when providers are equipped with communication skills.ConclusionLeadership has a direct link to safety in the workplace. It plays an integral role in motivating followers to achieve the set objectives. For instance, a nurse leader ensures that nurses are encouraged to achieve healthcare goals. Nurse leaders also help solve issues such as conflict and eliminate instances of workplace incivility like discrimination. On the other hand, safety is being free from any harm. Therefore, it also plays an important role in ensuring that health providers and patients operate and stay in a safe environment.
In Plato’s literary work, there are three answers to what piety is. Euthyphro begins with a lesser sense of righteousness. However, Socrates, following his general point of view, generally insists on a broader sense of the word. This is because he is less inspired by correct customs than by ethical life. Thus, the first answer to the question of piety shows that Euthyphro’s piety is what he is doing at the moment, that is, accusing his father of murder. Euthyphro offers such a definition of piety and impiety as what pleases divine beings.On the other hand, what they hate and do not accept as pious is impious. Further, Socrates rejects the activity of Euthyphro, since it is just an illustration of piety and does not give a fundamental outlined characteristic that makes the right activity pious (Plato, 2021). It is important to note that divine beings differ in many things. Thus, it can be said that there are several things that divine beings simultaneously cherish and despise.Euthyphro is caught off guard at a certain moment, so Socrates reminds him of the definitions he gave earlier. He said that the gods love something because it is pious, which means that their love flows from something inherent in the pious. Socrates claims that the approval of the gods is just an attribute of a given feeling and that divine approval is not a defining characteristic. Thus, Euthyphro is the kind of minister who wants to know the answer to the main question. However, Socrates rejects every definition of piety that he offers. After all the failed attempts, Euthyphro hurries away and leaves the question unanswered.
Power may corrupt those who wield it, and the pursuit of power is frequently harmful. People whose life objective is to obtain power over others are condemned to fail since human ambition frequently leads to sinful behaviors, which are inevitably punished. While The government is the system that makes laws and ensures that they are followed, it is the person who wields power who is responsible for the equality and impartiality of its enforcement.Tragedies lie at the heart of Shakespeare’s creative legacy. They represent the strength of his brilliant mind as well as the essence of his period, which is why, if following epochs looked to Shakespeare for comparison, they first understood their struggles via him. Shakespeare’s tragedies have been influenced by a growing number of fresh interpretations. Macbeth, one of Shakespeare’s most renowned tragedies, depicts characters who have been damaged by their ambition and reveals the devastating nature of the desire for power for the sake of authority. Shakespeare’s Macbeth is the most comprehensive portrayal of the individualist as a person who actively and consistently prioritizes what reflects her interests over the interests of others. Macbeth, driven by ambition, is eager to liberate his mind from moral ideals and domestic norms, seeing them as stumbling blocks and meaningless preconceptions.People, like the play’s major protagonists, who are consumed by the concept of obtaining the throne, are frequently corrupted by power and eventually wreck their own lives and the lives of others. Macbeth is a tragedy of overwhelming ambition; therefore, it’s no surprise that its leitmotif is
the hero’s words: “I dare everything a man dares,” which are addressed to death itself in the finale: “I wish to experience the last. Macbeth is a tragedy about a colossal personality who had the same chances for victory as death, but valor without wisdom drove it to full isolation from humanity and its soul.Macbeth is willing to kill and betray even close friends to gain the crown and the kingdom. With a dagger, the hero assassinates the sleeping monarch. He also orders the Banquo and Macduff families to be killed. Macbeth does not see individuals; rather, he sees impediments on his route to the throne. After realizing that he might inherit the throne, Macbeth, a brave and powerful warrior and dedicated servant of the king, transforms into a greedy and vicious killer.Lady Macbeth seems to be a more ambitious woman than her husband Macbeth., so Macbeth is far from the only person whose life has been tainted by power. This woman persuades her husband that Duncan should be murdered if he visits their home. “Look like an innocent flower, but be a serpent behind it,” she says to her husband. Lady Macbeth, who aspires to be queen, encourages her husband to commit crimes, therefore defining their fate. Without his wife’s convictions, Macbeth would not have committed all of these heinous acts.The play’s conclusion, which discusses Lady Macbeth’s lunacy and Macbeth’s death, is the primary revelation demonstrating the corrupting nature of power. When Lady Macbeth notices blood on her hands, Macbeth, who thought he was unstoppable,
typically given to those who seek it. The throne, for example, was meant to belong to Duncan in Macbeth and later to his son, who may also be a fabulous king. Macbeth, on the other hand, receives the power because he went to such lengths to obtain it. Although power does not always corrupt, it does destroy individuals in the majority of situations because it is attained by those who are inclined to destroy.Power corrupts those who possess it, and the chase of power tends to result in suffering. Macbeth shows individuals who have suffered as a result of their aspirations, revealing the fatal nature of the desire for power for its own sake. The play’s finale, which recounts Lady Macbeth’s insanity and Macbeth’s death, thus, becomes a key revelation that demonstrates how power corrupts. In Macbeth, the author demonstrates the corrupting influence of power: the protagonist’s and his wife’s life spent pursuing the throne ended tragically. Macbeth kills innocent people, including children, in his quest for power. The wife’s desire becomes the driving force behind everything that occurs: the image of the crown becomes more essential than anything else in her life. The play’s conclusion suggests that individuals should not seek power only for the sake of power. This performance teaches individuals that power and those in positions of authority are not essential aspects of their life.
has five interactional functions that overlap and illustrate how the term engulfs masculine homo-sociality. These functions are gesturing agreements, marking attachment and connection, marking the discourse structure, mitigating stances of confrontations, and exclamation (Kiesling, 2004). Dude can either be applied to more than a single function or be ambiguous; hence the functions are not entirely exclusive. The word is an interactive resource that creates several stances, as illustrated by the uses listed above.The term dude rose to popularity in the 1980s because the youths used it as an exclamation to illustrate affection and delight. Therefore, dude was used as an in-group term to indicate solidarity since its inception as described by history (Kiesling, 2004). The in-group and solidarity meanings stick with the term to present and are the stances highlighted upon the word’s usage. The rapid rise and popularity of dude is arguably an attribute of the reinstatement of new puritanism that emphasizes family values and hard work supported by solidarity.Dude’s use pattern is determined by its functions and discourse relevance and influenced its encroachment in Anglo-American society. Male youths of European American descent use the term more than their female counterparts. Additionally, the term satisfies five overlapping functions and meanings in interaction. Dude encodes a principal masculinity stance that enhanced the term’s rise and popularity. The dude is a shadow of the 1980s and 1990s constantly gathered over generations.
When managing the lifetime of material, reliability design is a sub-discipline of process engineering that emphasizes the importance of dependability. Therefore, reliability defines the ability of a system or component to work properly under specified circumstances over a certain amount of time. Reliability is closely connected to dependability, which is often described as a component or process’s capacity to perform at a certain time or time interval throughout a period. The probability of performance is the abstract notion behind Reliability concept’s abstract idea (Slivinski et al., 2019). Quality, testability, repairability, and advancement are all often referred to as reliability technology. The reliability of components greatly influences the cost-effectiveness of a system. For instance, when vehicles break less often, their resale value is greater. At the highest levels of “lifetime” systems, reliability technology has difficulty anticipating, preventing, and managing the complexity and danger of failure that might occur.“Margin” reliability is characterized by developing highly particular strength margins (force, chemical, and electrical) and then designing to those margins. The product’s toughness must be reduced if it is lightweight, inexpensive to make, and effective. There is little room for error in the manufacturing process. The consumer has to know exactly how the product will be used and how it will benefit them. In addition to defining particular environmental variables, life expectancy forecasts must be based on specified instances. The focus on quantification and the selection of objectives indicates a limitation to good performance; nevertheless, there is no intrinsic limit. The development of better value does not have to be
Confidence limits and hypothesis testing are some of the key components of statistical testing that are used in healthcare administration for different purposes. Both of them are interconnected, as it is impossible to establish a hypothesis without knowing the confidence limits. The numbers indicate the lower and the upper ends of the confidence interval (Kros & Rosenthal, 2016). For instance, if a man is six and the confidence limits are 4 and 7, the confidence interval will be 4 to 7. They indicate how accurate an estimate of the mean will be for a particular statistical category of objects or characteristics. Confidence limits enable medical personnel or healthcare administrators to establish how close the estimate they have is likely to be to the one that exists. In order to count the confidence limits for a particular object, one needs to calculate a confidence interval.Hypothesis testing helps establish whether a particular statement or hypothesis is true and determines how plausible it is. In order to find it out, the statists usually use sample data from a particular population, relying on the characteristics they need. The hypothesis is divided into two large groups. The first one is called the null hypothesis, and it is a statement that indicates that there is no statistical difference between two or more variables (Kros & Rosenthal, 2016). The second type is the alternative hypothesis, and which is opposed to the null hypothesis and is what statists usually check.When speaking about hypothesis testing, it is necessary to mention the two types of errors
Several methodologies are put into place to compare the role of intervention with other professions. The techniques include the interest-based methods, based on the profession of mediation, generalist intervention model utilized in the social work profession, and traditional adversarial model, employed in the law profession. Therefore, the paper will profoundly detail the change of roles based on this professional based on skills, techniques, and strategies when changing from one career to another in the intervention as a conflict ensues between different parties at large.Three professions are compared, including mediation, social work, and law. To demonstrate these parallels, I utilize an interest-based model of mediation, a generalist model of social work, and a traditional adversarial law model. Noteworthy, other laws and social work professionals see mediation as a possible role for them to play. Significant differences appear when the three models’ orientations, values, and techniques comparison as defined by (Barsky 2017). A lawyer’s conventional role is that of an advocate who fights for the rights and interests of one party in a dispute. Most social workers are accustomed to campaigning for specific clients or causes. Lawyers or social professionals who want to play the position of a mediator must put their advocacy aside and become neutral facilitators. Clients can use mediators to negotiate on their behalf.Furthermore, mediators support each party’s ability to negotiate, they do not support a particular situation or the solution. When advocacy-oriented helping professionals become mediators, one of the most challenging adjustments is to become neutral. Each of the three professions emphasizes the right
and stability. As noted earlier, Rucol’s employees work from home at least two days a week. The organization operates six days a week and has over fifty functional branches.Possible storage solutions for Rucol include cloud storage, solid-state drives (SSD), and hard disk drives (HDD). Each of these options has advantages and demerits in the organization’s case. SSDs and HDDs, for example, provide cheaper storage alternatives for Rucol. The two options are readily available and do not require a constant internet connection for access. Moreover, SSDs and HDDs provide excellent offline data storage and backup solutions for organizations undertaking vulnerable processes like Rucol. Shortliffe and Cimino (2021) note that data storage solutions that can be kept away from the internet offer some of the best data management options for sensitive data. The argument makes SSDs and HDDs appropriate for the organization.HDDs come with large space at a relatively lower cost than SSDs, making the former option more appropriate for Rucol’s case. The company will thus utilize HDDs for data backup in a high-efficiency computer without internet connections. Nonetheless, the best data storage alternative for Rucol is the cloud storage system. Choosing Google Drive will allow the organization to acquire about thirty terabytes for $300 a month. The choice will offer data security, increased accessibility, and reliability (Weiland et al., 2019). Coupling the cloud option for data management during normal operations and an HDD system for backups promises the entity a better solution for the data management problem.
IntroductionThe biographical film ‘ Before Night Falls’ touches the most delicate strings of its viewers’ soul, describing the tragic and hardship-filled life of the famous Cuban poet Reinaldo Arenas. The man was raised in a low-income family and decided to support the Cuban revolutionaries who appreciated his talent as a writer. At the same time, he suddenly resolved to issue a national appeal about his non-traditional orientation. However, his former friends and comrades-in-arms, with the famous Fidel Castro at the head, managed to declare a law banning homosexuality and together jailed the young man. For two whole years, he served his sentence in a Cuban prison and developed plans for a new brighter future. After his liberation, Reinaldo Arenas radically changes his plans and escapes to America. Although he found true love there, but the idyll ended with a disease. Thus, it is essential to establish if Reinaldo himself chose his sexual orientation or if it was influenced by various factors.Social and Cultural Factors that Influenced the Sexual OrientationAlthough evidence of homosexuality existed in ancient Greece, humanity has long considered it immoral. Freud’s writings in this area explain the main character’s sexual attraction to his own gender (Gibson et al. 37). In this way, the philosopher wrote that obstacles or the inability to pass a particular stage in life contribute to the development of homosexuality (Gibson et al. 37). The film’s hero suffered from living in poverty and without a father since his childhood. Even when a teacher visited the house to praise the boy’s literary
abilities, his grandfather became highly annoyed (Schnabel). At the same time, viewers may notice that Reinaldo Arenas watched men bathe naked for the first time. The main protagonist smiled and looked at the men’s bodies with curiosity. Therefore, it is possible to draw a connection between the problems in the family and Reinaldo’s yet undiscovered desires. At the same time, Freud believed that innate sexual deviations could not affect a person independently (Gibson et al. 38). They were stimulated by social factors, of which there were also plenty in the central character’s life.The prohibition and persecution of homosexuals and arrests also strengthen Reynaldo Arenas’ sexual instinct. Significantly, even in prison, he believed that he could emerge free and defend gay rights (Schnabel). Carpenter remarked that members of the culture, such as writers, actively advocated for homosexual rights (Gibson et al. 39). He argued that rights and freedoms are valuable for such people, and they are willing to fight for them. Reinaldo Arenas also felt oppression and tried to restore justice in his books. He wrote about the government’s fighting against gay people, although Reinaldo could only publish abroad. As a consequence, the protagonist’s heightened sense of justice and equality, attracted by cultural figures, negatively affected his life. He was persecuted because of the written books banned by the censorship and held in custody as a particularly dangerous criminal (Schnabel). Thus, the concepts cited indicate that Reinaldo Arenas was prone to homosexuality due to the social conditions of his life, and his literary talent contributed to the
the emergence of AIDS (Schnabel). Therefore, religious doctrines are skeptical of the protagonist’s behavior and confirm that he made a conscious selection. Although the Bible describes a close relationship between David and Jonathan, some scholars interpret this as a manifestation of homosexuality (Gibson et al. 7). Accordingly, the argument that people are automatically born with a traditional orientation and that homosexuality is a personal selection that one can refute. Hence, even this interpretation of scripture by scholars explains that one does not deliberately choose homosexuality.ConclusionThus, Freud would argue that social factors influencing an individual’s formation as a person can affect sexual orientation. The adverse conditions of Reinaldo Arenas’ childhood and adolescence may have contributed to the manifestation of a non-traditional sexual orientation. At the same time, Reinaldo’s literary abilities inspired him to resist the authorities and society. That is why he did not stop writing books and openly declared his gay identity. It was these various reasons why the main character died at a young age after experiencing a great deal of suffering. The biblical argument that sexual orientation is his own decision can people refute because some scholars believe that scripture demonstrates gay relationships. Therefore, the protagonist’s non-traditional orientation resulted from a combination of reasons that subsequently led to his death as a young man.
The “Eye of the Storm” video is a fascinating example of how race can be socially constructed in the classroom. Jane Elliott created a distinction between blue-eyed and brown-eyed children, teaching the young participants that their peers with brown eyes were superior (Bloom). Although this contrast does not possess any inherent meaning and is merely a representation of one’s amount of melanin in the body, it became significant for the children. Thus, Elliott socially constructed race by suggesting that one group of children is better than the other, with the eye colors serving as symbols to emphasize race and group belonging.As a result of such distinction, differences in the students’ activities and performance became evident. Elliott observed that the children who were in the brown-eyed group grew more confident, and they began to behave more condescendingly towards their blue-eyed peers. Contrastingly, the latter students have been reported to become more shy and timid, supposedly intimidated by the pressure from the other group (Bloom). Blue-eyed children felt less reassured, with their academic performance dropping significantly and their relationships with their former brown-eyed classmates becoming worse (Bloom). By the end of the activity, a drastic difference between the two groups was remarkably clear, and fights between the learners could be seen frequently. Thus, each group was negatively impacted by the new racial social structure.What stood out to me the most in this experiment was how quickly the changes in the children’s behavior became evident. Although the classmates appeared to have close relationships before the distinction was made, these connections were abruptly severed after Elliott created the two groups. The new behavioral patterns formed very soon, demonstrating how easily children can incorporate the new rules into their daily lives. From this perspective, teachers and adults should be exceptionally careful when educating children on various topics, as the results of such learning can be devastating.
It isn’t easy to single out the central directions and build a particular hierarchy in the modern art world, including music. Some of the performers influence the minds of young people, and political strategists can use some compositions during elections. The current state of the art is too vague to make clear statements on this subject. Hip-hop performers expose many of the problems of megacities and young people: drugs, cruelty, violence, and lack of life guidelines (Rabinowitch, 2020). The social movement for women’s rights is significant for the modern generation, and female performers are becoming iconic people in music. One such person is Lady Gaga, who began her career as a freak with a sensual mezzo-soprano. Performers like her describe the issues of discrimination and harassment emotionally. Some critics single out Moby as an iconic artist who influenced the formation of modern cultural reality. He brought a unique genre and popularized it by making his songs available to the public, including for the political life of the United States.There is a problem with expressing yourself through flashy statements within the framework of modern culture (cancellation culture, hate speech, shaming). In this context, of course, the past artists were bolder, but there was a different world, a different reality, and society for them. The public space is dynamic, and artists should now look for other ways to draw attention to themselves or to this or that issue (Rabinowitch, 2020). The information space is already crowded, especially within the Internet. It isn’t easy to surprise a modern young listener, attracting their attention and keeping them. It seems that this is not a matter of personal courage but a matter of total societal changes that have occurred over the years and decades.
The contract is an agreement between two or more persons to establish, change or terminate civil rights and obligations. A contract is the most common type of transaction. The content of the contract includes the rights and obligations of the parties concluding the contract and the conditions under which the contract enters into force or loses it. The concept of the contract is used in three meanings, the contract as: 1. Legal fact, the basis for the emergence, change, or termination of a civil legal relationship; 2. Agreement of the parties, providing for the rights, obligations, and the procedure for their implementation; 3. A document that contains a specific message and the content of the contract is its conditions, which are divided into essential, ordinary, and accidental (Hutchison & Myburgh, 2020).Ordinary conditions – conditions provided for by law and come into effect automatically, regardless of their indication in the contract. Random conditions supplement or change the usual conditions. Such conditions are included in the text of the contract at the discretion of the parties, but their absence does not affect the validity of the contract. All contracts can be classified into several types, differing from each other according to some criteria (Hutchison & Myburgh, 2020). Unilateral – in one party, the contract gives rise to rights; in the other – obligations; and bilateral – at the conclusion of the contract, each party acquires both rights and obligations. In addition, there is a division into paid, implying the property representation of one party due to the counter-property
I, Tituba is a book centered around the strives and inequality of a wrongfully convicted black slave woman who was a victim of brutality and prejudice throughout her life. The story depicts the Salem witch trials from the perspective of Tituba, a black woman. Her life is characterized by various injustices and misfortunes, which led to her early death. Condé introduces her readers by declaring her goal to present Tituba’s side of the tale. The declaration suggests that Condé believed the story of Tituba’s maltreatment needed to be told to expose the truth she had been denied due to her skin color and gender. Her husband, John Indian, a black slave, shares some maltreatment exerted on Tituba despite having individual shortcomings. The novel I, Tituba, brings out the effects of patriarchy and racism on people of color and, majorly, on women. The book exposes John Indian’s cowardliness and selfishness towards Tituba and further highlights her frantic attempts to deal with life predicaments.In the seventeenth century, females were denied equal treatment to men. Racism led to portraying black women as lesser than their white counterparts. Condé included Tituba’s side of the tale to assert the patriarchy exerted by males and its implication on women of color. Tituba embodies a kind, powerful woman who cannot resent her adversaries. Although black males were racially oppressed, gender benefitted them as they were secluded from the Salem witch trials. Individually, the white men of Salem, especially Samuel Parris, had authority over their whole neighborhood.Tituba’s life was centered on male dominance, illustrated
by being born of rape, wrongly accused, and killed. From the novel’s inception, foreshadowing depicts a man’s power over a woman. The author employs this literary style when he states, “Abena, my mother was raped on the deck of the Christ the King by an English sailor one day in the year 16**. I was conceived as a result of this act of assault” (Condé 3). The introductory chapter foreshadows Tituba’s horrific rape at the moment of her accusation by four men. Her mother subsequently defends herself against another attempted rape, hurting the white male sex offender, but she is hanged later. Her mother clearly warns her about the safeguards she should take while developing a connection with a man—Tituba’s downfalls in the story result from her entanglement with men. As a black woman, Tituba is denied protection and dignity in every situation she encounters.Men had a significant influence on Tituba’s life. Condé’s argument underlines the importance of sex and ethnicity in Tituba’s existence. Her existence revolves around the actions of the males in her vicinity. She is exploited and sometimes chooses such routes due to the men she accompanies. Her husband, John Indian, urges her to confess to practicing witchcraft instead of standing by her in fighting the false accusations (Condé 5). The men in her life fail to regard her as an equal human being due to her gender manifested by John’s decision to sacrifice herself to end the witch case. Tituba’s selflessness contrasts with John’s Indian selfishness when she devotes not mention other
women who allegedly helped her in witchcraft. As a result, Tituba was sexually abused and assaulted by four men, including Parris. Her strong-willed mentality aids her in overcoming the horrific things she endures throughout the years.Being feminine is a significant deciding element throughout Tituba’s existence. In actuality, her world was ruled by males. Tituba finally realizes that she cannot trust anybody, particularly males. In prison, an inmate named Hester offers the remarks that daily resonate inside her, becoming repetitious throughout her life: “Life is too nice to men, regardless of their hue.” Condé uses this precise word to emphasize the injustice in Tituba’s and the other black girls’ lives (Bilal and Ashfaq 782). Black men experience an edge as they are required to work only as slaves, but women of color are forced to work as slaves while sexually and socially abused.Women’s reliance on men is among Tituba’s flaws throughout her existence. She yields to men, valuing their freedom above her own. Condé’s fictional portrayal of Tituba includes biblical allusions to the instruction she had imparted to her by deceased loved ones. The usage of a biblical analogy makes an indirect connection to the bible. While God directed individuals in the bible, Tituba is guided by influential ladies in her life. Although she heeds their counsel, she often chooses to follow the men in her life, resulting in her death. In the biblical setup, Eve defies God by eating the fruit. Tituba disregards the counsel of previous ladies throughout her life, leading to several catastrophes. “I
IntroductionGlobalization has had a huge impact on the world economy, and on the growth of geographical mobility of the workforce in particular. Huge masses of people change their habitat, type of settlements and sphere of activity in relatively short time intervals. At the same time, they find themselves in a new, unusual environment for themselves, among people. It has a different way of life, a different system of secular and religious values and speakers of a different language. The growth of the absolute and relative share of diasporas leads, respectively, to an increase in their absolute and relative contribution to the economy. This work considers the diaspora as one of the most important subjects of the economic processes of our time. All economic processes related to the diaspora are developing in line with broader ethnic, social and economic trends of modernity.As a combination of all the new processes of globalization, a major trend is developing: diasporas are playing an increasingly important role in the economic sphere. At the same time, their economic potential becomes commensurate with the economic potential of the States on the main territory. In some situations, it may even exceed the potential of the ethnic groups forming the environment. Today, many members of diasporas, while retaining their ethnic and religious affiliation, change their citizenship, and as a result become associated parts of other nations. In the era of globalization, such a previously private pattern becomes one of the universal ones. The number of people with dual citizenship who simultaneously participate in the economic
life of two or more states, nations and ethnic groups is growing. For example, investing in the economy of some states, they direct the earned funds to their historical homeland, pay double taxes, etc. Thus, diasporas contribute to the economic development of local communities to a much greater extent.BackgroundDiasporas as subjects of the cultural and historical process are as ancient as ethnic groups and confessional communities themselves. This can be judged based on the oldest written sources and ethnographic materials about ethnic groups that have pre-state forms of social organization. The socio-demographic structure of diasporas can act as a prerequisite for leadership in the economy (Welde et al., 2020). The most famous of all the variants of the genesis of diasporas is their appearance as a result of resettlement from their historical homeland. The flow of migrants is dominated by men of working age, with a level of education and vocational training above average, as a rule, energetic and enterprising (Stone & Scott, 2018). Thus, migrants are more economically active in comparison with the average characteristics of the initial community.This phenomenon is partly spontaneous, partly purposefully controlled by states interested in the influx or restriction of any categories of migrants. Many states practiced recruitment or, conversely, introduced restrictive quotas in accordance with the age, professional, property, etc. level of migrants (Koinova, 2018a). As a consequence of these spontaneous or purposeful selection, the economic role of the diaspora may be higher than the average in the surrounding society (Seraphin et al., 2019). This is manifested, in particular,
in the standard of living, which can be significantly higher than in the historical homeland.Key Scholars and Theoretical FrameworksThe degree of influence of diasporas on the economic development of the receiving and sending countries is an urgent topic for the work of many researchers. The theoretical frameworks regarding this topic touches on such different aspects of the problem. These are employment and solidarity of migrant workers, as well as the impact of migration on the socio-economic development of countries (Carment & Calleja, 2018). In their works, scientists address various, sometimes opposite aspects of the role of participation of diasporas, migrant workers, remittances and human capital in economic development.The theoretical framework is interconnected with the processes of globalization of the world, the contact of local cultures, and the formation of new socio-cultural identities. In the 1990s, a new direction for research appeared in it — the transnational approach. It should be noted the developments of the American sociologist Peggy Levitt, who has repeatedly been published in collaboration with Glick-Schiller on the problems of the theory and methodology of the transnational approach (Levitt & Schiller, 2004). She is a major representative of the sociological direction in the study of the phenomenon of transnational. In addition, Levit is credited with introducing the topic of transnational diasporal corporations into scientific discourse.The concept of “transnational social space”, introduced by the aforementioned scientists, caused a flurry of criticism from sociologists. Waldinger (2017) developed the theory by writing a paper about the limits of transnationalism. He considers it methodologically erroneous to consider a
national state without connection with a specific territory (Waldinger, 2017). At the same time, Waldinger is impressed by the very idea of social interactions over diasporas and territorial borders. However, he still suggests replacing the concept of “transnational social space” with the concept of “deterritorialized national state”(Waldinger, 2017). An important factor for him was the involvement of diasporas in the state market, which led to the formation of stable international economic interactions.One of the aspects of studying the diaspora is its elements. The concept proposed focuses on the elements in which, according to the author, the essence of the phenomenon of the diaspora is reflected. Diasporas are mostly formed as a result of forced eviction. As a result, large groups of people or even entire communities find themselves outside the country of origin (Guo, 2021). At the same time, voluntary emigration of individuals and small groups may take place, which also leads to the emergence of enclaves in host countries. The basis of the diaspora is a community that already has a clearly defined identity formed in the country of exodus.It can be seen that some characteristics in all concepts are consistent and complement each other. For example, in the concept of Hannaford, the provision on the violent nature of resettlement is highlighted (Hannaford, 2018). The position of concept Hannaford about collective memory as a fundamental element of the identity of the diaspora group is important (Hannaford, 2018). The same opinion is shared by Lapshyna, stating that self-awareness and self-determination as a diaspora is largely connected
with the collective memory connecting local communities (Lapshyna, 2019). Collective experience and collective memories prevent cultural forgetting and preserve the diaspora as a whole.The thesis about maintaining links between communities in concept Hannaford partially coincides with the idea of Han about the communication networks of the diaspora. As opposed to Lapshyna, Han highlights the ability of the Jewish diaspora to intensive communication (Han, 2018). This point determines the transnational nature of the diaspora. The very fact of the presence of parts of a particular ethnic group in at least two countries allows us to conclude that there is a transnational network of relations (Meillassoux, 2018). Undoubtedly, at present this is a characteristic feature, if not of all, then of the vast majority of both classical and modern diasporas.The above approaches take into account various aspects that determine the phenomenon of diaspora. It is important that the organization of the diaspora itself can extend far beyond the borders of one country. In this case, scientists are talking about creating a network of social institutions of the diaspora in various countries and transnational spaces (Lacroix et al., 2016). Most scientists agree that it is possible to talk about the diaspora space. It covers not only sociological aspects of the diaspora community, but also representatives of the economical incentives.Nigerian Diasporic NetworksCase Study from NigeriaThe African continent (including Nigeria) makes a significant contribution to the growth of the number of migrants in the EU. In comparison with the other two vast areas of migration from South to North – Asia
and Latin America – Africa occupies a middle position (Grunsven, 2019). The relative level of migration (average annual immigration minus emigration) from Africa exceeds the Asian level and is inferior to Latin American.Diasporas alleviate the livelihoods of their relatives and their own communities through the diaspora association. The peculiarities of the development of new conditions and forms of adaptation, new socio-economic realities show that national non-profit organizations acquire additional meanings, goals and functions (Hack-Polay & Siwale, 2018). Diasporas become producers of migrants’ social capital capable of qualitatively transforming their socio-economic and political position in the host society. Similar mechanisms have been noted in relation to Nigerian migrants in the formation of the territorial identity of migrants (Zapata-Barrero & Rezaei, 2019). They also influenced adaptation to a new place through socio-environmental, economic, cultural and other strategies.The diaspora association enables diasporas to access a wider range of political connections and government sponsors to enhance the economic development of their relatives and their communities. This is due to the fact that the resources of the diaspora (in fact, their elite) are based on the solidarity of community members (Prinz & Siegel, 2019). Solidarity forms a wide range of mechanisms for strengthening the entire community – from political mobilization to the concentration of material resources in lobbying (Levitt, 1998). Diasporas can use their own culture (literature, religious organization, cuisine features) to form an image that will determine the actions of political actors. These resources relate to socio-political and economic, and improve the quality of life of all members of the
community.Diasporas would not have as much influence on their communities’ economic development without the base the diaspora association provides. The interaction of representatives of diasporas within a single society is a cost-effective tool (Waldinger, 2001). International cooperation is conducted through diasporas in the implementation of the economic policy of states (Koinova, 2018b). They act as an instrument for the realization of the economic interests of their homeland. Diasporas are also useful to the host country in establishing and maintaining economic contacts with their ethnic homeland.Nigerian diasporas are quite successful in mobilizing diasporas globally to form various associations. For example, the Nigerian Seafarers’ Union has serious economic influence and has weight for shipping companies (Alonso & Mylonas, 2019). After several major strikes, the sailors recognized this union as an equal party in negotiations and discussion of the situation on the labor market. The Remember Saro-Wiwa group is engaged in a wide variety of activities, ranging from art and culture, ending with the protection of human rights and environmental projects (Triandafyllidou, 2018). The Nigerian Youth League, which has a representative office in Nigeria, and the XN Foundation, which also pays attention to the problems of people with disabilities, are strong in youth topics (Levitt, 2005). They can finance local infrastructure development projects and influence government policies.Tensions Between DiasporasThe tension between Nigerian diasporas and their local communities is most often associated with the professed religion. In the future, further aggravation of the conflict between Muslims and Christians in Nigerian diasporas may lead to the division of communities along confessional
lines. Inter-communal relations in the Nigerian diasporas are characterized by an extreme degree of tension. It has especially intensified since the late 80s of the last century (Inouye et al., 2019). It is associated with the growing influence of fundamentalist religious movements (especially Islamic ones) around the world.Not all development plans made by diasporas necessarily benefit the local communities. For example, in the Nigerian diasporas, great importance is paid to the preservation of the cultural system, which negatively affects the economic one. There is a strict gender roles division in Nigerian households, in which women play a leading role in raising children and running the household (Krasniqi & Williams, 2018). Men are assigned an exclusive duty to provide for the family, which leads to significant economic losses (Smith & Guarnizo, 1998). The authority of parents and the older generation is high, which often takes responsibility for the younger generation as a whole. Thus, conservative sentiments prevail in the Nigerian diasporas, which hinder economic progress.Moreover, the power relations between diasporas and those who were ‘left behind’ are often ambiguous. For example, many diasporas have an opaque economic structure: an account is open, and the purpose of mandatory donations is not always known (Fossati, 2018). Large diasporas are able to form a national niche in the country’s economy. For example, they can organize national enterprises consisting of representatives of a particular ethnic group (Fiddian-Qasmiyeh & Daley, 2018). Periodically, for the purpose of rapid economic integration, diasporas aggressively occupy entire business sectors, turning them into oligopolies.Nigerian diasporas are not
homogenous that leads to tensions within the association as diasporas have different political and economic desires. For example, Nigerians from the hinterland are actively promoting the idea of primary patriotism. All their activities are aimed at helping and supporting, first of all, the place of their birth – the village, the city, the district (Carling, 2008). The political and economic desires of this group of migrants are aimed at the subsequent return to their native lands with the capital already accumulated for the purchase of housing, business, trade (Elo et al., 2019). In these diasporas, the attitude towards whole groups of people whose migration from Nigeria is permanent and irrevocable is negative.Disagreements also arise in male and female diasporas: they have different views on how their influence should be used. The differentiation of the population inevitably hinders the construction of a unified system within the entire diaspora. For example, in some regions, families headed by women are considered normal (De Haas, 2005). However, due to the predominance of patriarchal foundations, men often hinder the influence of women in political or economic spheres (Basch et al., 1993). They try to limit the activities of their wives to raising children and running a household, which is negatively perceived by the female diaspora.Lesser Economical ContributionsDiasporas did not play a significant role in the rapid growth of the country as a whole. The Chand’s study, when comparing data at the international level, showed that in developed European countries, its positive impact is close to zero, or 0.5% of GDP (Chand,
2018). The study analyzed the migration of the last 50 years (Chand, 2018). The study concludes that migrants from Nigeria do not make a significant contribution to the country’s budget. The age and qualifications of Nigerian migrants have a significant impact on whether they invest in the host country’s economy or deplete it.Nigeria’s growth has been facilitated by a fast-growing manufacturing industry built on Nigeria’s financial, and service industry. In addition, a significant role in this process was played by abundant oil supply which is approximately 2.7% of global supply (Adamson, 2019). Moreover, the Nigerian diaspora carries out the largest sub-Saharan inflow of funds to Africa. The dynamics of the growth of transfers is indicative: at least once every few months, approximately one in ten Nigerians sends funds to Nigeria (Xaynazarov & Pardaev, 2020). The transferred funds are used to finance political parties, education, and business development. Thus, the money earned by members of the Nigerian diaspora goes to the development of the host country only to a small extent.These require large-scale and long-term investments in infrastructure which can be difficult to achieve by diasporas alone. Hence, diasporas can be seen as contributing to a lesser extent to the national economy when compared to that of their communities. The growth in the Nigerian economy is mainly driven by the growth of the industrial and service sectors. In addition, banking and telecommunications services have grown significantly. Despite the growth of the economy, Nigeria has a rather backward infrastructure (Ojong, 2016). The country is not an attractor for
The US is considered a staunch supporter and promoter of democracy. However, some ethnic minorities, including Chinese and Native Americans, had suffered a lot from discrimination and had to fight for equal rights with white Americans. Despite all the oppression, they did not abandon their country during World War II and significantly contributed to the victory making the government and society see the need for collaboration.The major contribution of Chinese Americans to WWII was their active enlisting in the US army. According to Takaki (2020), their zealous support destroyed Japanese propaganda, which portrayed Chinese Americans as victims, and made China side with the US. Despite the dire conditions many of them lived in and white Americans’ discrimination against them, they used the war as the opportunity to prove themselves as loyal patriots.As for the Navajo tribe, they also had reasons for being hostile towards white Americans. However, they agreed to fight as allies to protect their country and people. Their main contribution was participation in coded interaction: Americans utilized Navajo’s native language as a base for it (Takaki, 2020). Thus, a minor language, which once was forbidden and was considered inferior, became a valuable instrument of victory.It amazes me how much Chinese and Navajo Americans had suffered from discrimination, yet they fought together with white Americans for their country when the external enemy appeared. Moreover, the use of Navajo’s native language during the war is truly inspirational, as it turned the US cultural diversity into a weapon. We should not forget about this valuable experience and support minor languages and cultural traditions.It is frustrating that immigrants or citizens with non-white ancestry had to prove their value before white Americans accepted them as equals. Unfortunately, the emergence of such movements as Black Lives Matter shows that some non-white ethnic groups still face discrimination (Garret, 2018). Therefore, new immigrants often suffer from ethnic intolerance like their predecessors did, as their languages and cultural values are considered inferior, or they do not get the same vocational and educational opportunities.To sum up, Chinese and Navajo Americans have greatly contributed to protecting their country during WWII and proved their loyalty. Despite discrimination and oppression they had experienced from white Americans, they offered help and demonstrated the power of collaboration. The use of the native Navajo language also showed the significance of cultural diversity. These historical events gave us valuable lessons, which we should not forget.
Cardona-Hernandez, R., Schwandt, A., Alkandari, H., Bratke, H., Chobot, A., Coles, N., Corathers, S., Goksen, D., Goss, P., Imane, Z., Nagl, K., O’Riordan, S.M.P., & Jefferies, C. (2021). Glycemic outcome associated with insulin pump and glucose sensor use in children and adolescents with type 1 diabetes. Data from the international pediatric registry SWEET. Diabetes Care , 44 (5), 1176-1184. Web.The advantage of this research was that it was a large international retrospective cohort study that retrieved data from the diabetes SWEET registry. The sample size was 25,654 participants diagnosed with type 1 diabetes mellitus (T1DM) more than one year ago and used technology to control their blood glucose (Cardona-Hernandez et al., 2021). Furthermore, the settings mainly were home-based in which the participants reported to the registry; hence, the results can be applied in a broader sense. However, the limitation of this study was the absence of time-in-range data (Cardona-Hernandez et al., 2021). Unfortunately, there were not enough people with this information to include this data into statistical analysis in the latter. The environment was controlled with the comparison group, but the authors missed randomization and blinding. Since this was an international study, the main barrier was the difference in GDP, which is a potential confounding factor. The researchers addressed this issue by implementing linear regression analysis to reveal the actual association between the parameters. Finally, the findings of this study could be implemented to reduce high HbA1c levels and DKA rates among children with T1DM by introducing wearable technology.McGill, D. E., Volkening, L. K., Butler, D.
Ethnicity, culture, and religion are essential elements which to a considerable extent, shape every individual’s personality. At the same time, these elements often become a topic of difficult conversations and even sources of conflict. As a person who has faced discrimination on numerous occasions, I believe that holding conversations with people about race and cultural identity is important, and I am always willing to participate in them.I have experienced racism ever since I was about seven years old. My parents are from different cities in Yemen, and both sides of the family would sometimes have conversations with me on how their culture is better than the other. After migrating to Qatar, I encountered negative comments and assumptions about my nationality and poverty in my home country. In the United States, I faced new racist interactions, this time concerning my religion. Still, these experiences have made me grow as a person, learn, and appreciate my culture, religion, and ethnicity.Moreover, every time I am targeted by people holding negative views about me, I attempt to have a conversation with them. I do not get offended by their words because I understand that their perspectives stem from their ignorance. Therefore, I always strive to educate people and tell them about my beliefs and cultural background. As a result, I am highly skilled in such conversations and always willing to engage in them since, in the majority of cases, people actually change their attitudes, recognize their mistakes, and even apologize.
the peripheral nervous system as endocrine glands (Saranya et al., 2021). Phenylalanine hydroxylase catalyzes the conversion of phenylalanine to tyrosine, while tyrosine hydroxylase catalyzes the conversion of tyrosine to L-DOPA (Saranya et al., 2021). Aromatic amino acid deaminase converts DOPA to dopamine.Lastly, the following mechanisms take place in the formation of norepinephrine from tyrosine: norepinephrine is the primary messenger for postganglionic autonomic ventricular neurons. It is generated within the nerve fiber, held in blisters, and then discharged by the neuron in response to the passage of a signaling cascade down the nerves (Płonka et al., 2022). The following information, as illustrated herein, pertains to the production of norepinephrine. First, tyrosine is carried into the sympathetic nerve end via the amino acid tyrosine. Second, tyrosine is transformed into DOPA by the enzyme tyrosine hydroxylase, which is the rate-limiting phase in the biosynthesis of norepinephrine (Płonka et al., 2022). Lastly, DOPA is then decarboxylated to become dopamine. As a result, dopamine is carried into vesicles and transformed by dopamine-hydroxylase (DBH) to norepinephrine (NE).
Life tragedies can lead an individual to different kinds of choices. Some individuals may perceive these tragedies as warnings, while some may think of them as second chances. The difference between these two individuals is how they emerge from a tragedy. Authors, playwrights, and novelists have attempted to display this notion in different literary works, documenting how different characters cope with tragedies. Tragedies in “Hamlet” and “A Good Man Is Hard to Find” lead characters to rely on the change as a coping mechanism.“Hamlet” narrates the story of an individual dealing with a loss which leads him into a roundabout of emotions. For instance, he becomes lazy due to the grief of losing his father. Such a tragedy is enough to lead an individual to misery as they try to make sense of life without their loved ones. In the play, Hamlet is depicted to have given up all hope in life and would not let anyone comfort him.“O, that this too, too sullied flesh would melt,Thaw, and resolve itself into a dew,Or that the Everlasting had not fixedHis canon ‘gainst self-slaughter! O God, God,How weary, stale, flat, and unprofitableSeem to me all the uses of this world!” (Shakespeare, 1599).This passage illustrates Hamlet’s state of desperation, which is attributed to his previous loss. His coping mechanism is evident in his continued mourning months after the death, which he is keen to admit that he has on him is enough to pass the show (Shakespeare, 1599). This means that he is aware of how he looks but
In persons diagnosed with Parkinson’s Disease (PD) (P), how effective is bicycle exercise as physical activity (I) compared to usual care (C) help to improve the stableness or physical health of PD patients (O) when applied to a specific period (T)? The chosen article for the analysis is ‘Parkinson’s disease patients benefit from bicycling’ by Tiihonen et al. 2021.The article’s abstract starts by acknowledging PD patients’ difficulties in containing their conditions. According to Tiihonen et al. (2021), identify and mention that PD patients are adversely compromised and can hardly have stable movement on their own. Hence, the article strives to find out which bicycle exercise would best benefit persons diagnosed with PD. Moreover, the research would also determine which PD-related symptoms or conditions would improve the anticipated bicycle exercise.The abstract introduces the reader to a systematic database literature search, both randomized control trials (RCT) and non-randomized control trials (NRCT), which are the tools used for assessing the effect of bicycle riding on PD patients. Furthermore, the abstract quantifies several sources that were analyzed to arrive at the conclusions that were made after the cohort study. It is presented that out of 202 articles researched, about 22 were found eligible studies with approximately 505 patients suffering from PD condition. Therefore, I think the information contained in this article abstract is adequate to give an overview of the research to its readers.The key issue in this article’s introduction is the goal-directed physical exercise and general physical activities that are in practice to alleviate the challenges faced by PD
patients. According to Tiihonen et al. (2021), physical and general activities have been experimentally and scientifically proven to lessen both motor and cognitive symptoms among persons diagnosed with PD. As such, exercise is a complement to standard pharmaceutical and surgical treatment of PD patients. The article further reinstated the need for diversified physical exercise forms for patients suffering from PD conditions to help improve their condition and better their lives.As presented in this article’s introduction, little or resources have been allocated to identifying noble physical activities paramount to improving patients’ needs and well-being. Bicycle riding is, therefore, one such activity that has been proposed by Tiihonen et al. (2021) to help improve PD patients’ conditions as more new forms and technologies are underway concerning therapies for persons struggling with PD conditions.The article states that exercise-based training could enhance functional mobility by utilizing enhanced strength, endurance, balance, and flexibility that support the efficient performance of these groups. Tiihonen et al. (2021), acknowledge that there is no conclusive research that proves exercise as a full remedy for the condition but could be considered as a disease-modifying element that helps in patients’ improvements. In addition, physical activities have been found to have neuroprotective effects on the brain. This research reports that in 2010, some individuals had severe gait freezing as a result of riding bicycles (Tiihonen et al., 2021). Therefore, physical activities have potential benefits for persons diagnosed with PD conditions.According to Tiihonen et al. (2021), the research adopted a criterion for judging the eligibility of the sources they
ought to use to investigate the matter under question. First, the review was pre-registered in the International Prospective Register of Systematic Reviews. According to this study, only original reports applying quantitative measures in understanding the effects of an intervention on PD patients were rendered valid. Studies with recumbent, tandem, motorized, non-motorized, and stationary bicycle ergometers in defining bicycle exercise were also included in this research. Furthermore, studies that involve hand pedaling instead of foot pedaling were also included in this research.Studies that were unaccepted, for instance, were those in which their primary outcome had no link to the effect of bicycling on the physical health of PD patients. To gather the appropriate data, PubMed databases for biomedical literature were visited for studies from 2010 up to 2020 using keywords such as ‘Parkinson bicycle cycling.’ Which studies were settled depending on the publishing year and author, study design and design size, quantitative measures on both pre and post-treatment, demographic characteristics of the study size, and intervention characteristics?All the studies were grouped and tested upon verifying the quality of the selected sources and validating the effect of the size of the treatment. In cases where multiple primary measures were involved, a suitable measure for analysis was chosen that best aligned the rest of the outcome true. The measure was termed functional if it enabled general movement and body mobility. Afterward, secondary measures were examined and their relationship to how bicycle cycling would influence the lives of PD patients was determined. The variables that were of interest were gait,
proved to yield better outcomes in managing PD patients (Tiihonen et al., 2021). Therefore, the results of this study showed that bicycling among PD persons improves their general conditions and wellbeing. In addition, the effect size that was obtained from the data indicates that bicycling has several benefits in helping diagnosed patients cope with their conditions. The hypothesis also proved true that moderate to high-intensity physical exercise among the patients had a positive result as compared to low-intensity training. Finally, the research also proves that the patient’s ability to balance improved with bicycling among PD patients.This study helps readers and the general public understands Parkinson’s Disease in depth. Moreover, the research gives more details in terms of the causes, risk factors, and how the diagnosed patients could be managed to give them hope in their daily lives. One is a coping intervention method that the study has outlined bicycling. This is considered a physical activity in which patients suffering from PD are subjected to improve their condition. Finally, the research reinstates the importance of caring for PD patients.
Counseling patients with HIV/AIDS is associated with significant psychological issues. One of the primary concerns is the reaction to the diagnosis. According to Chippindale and French (2001), there is a wide range of reactions to diagnosis considered normal, as some clients may take the matter very calmly, while others will react to the diagnosis with a prolonged period of distress, anger, and anxiety. Thus, the central recommendation for human service professionals counseling clients with HIV/AIDS is to allow time for the shock of the news to sink (Chippindale & French, 2001). The period of shock may be followed by a period of emotional ventilation, which may include overt stress (Chippindale & French, 2001). Thus, the central recommendation for counselors that inform clients about their diagnosis is to stay calm and allow time for the client instead of taking immediate action.The second recommendation is to put increased emphasis on acquiring coping strategies. In particular, the counselor should encourage the client to participate in the planning of care and in seeking appropriate social support (Chippindale & French, 2001). Additionally, it is crucial to work in alliance with the client’s partner, friends, and family to ensure that the best outcomes (Chippindale & French, 2001). The therapist needs to understand that it is impossible to be around the client all the time; however, the friends and family may be there just in time with the client needs psychological help the most. This will help the client to maintain an active lifestyle with minimal effect on everyday activities. It is crucial to help the client acknowledge all the stereotypes associated with the disease and understand that life goes on even after the diagnosis (Chippindale & French, 2001). Such strategies will allow stabilization of the emotional state of the client.
In the modern world, terrorism is one of the pressing threats to human health and life. Considering the events of the past century, including the first and 9/11 bombing of the World Trade Center in 1993 and 2001, United States Embassy in Beirut and Kuwait bombing, and many other attacks, the terror threat to the United States is high (Corbett et al., 2017). Therefore, it is important to apply comprehensive measures to combat terrorism.To counter terrorism, the preventive activities of state authorities and local self-government bodies must be in place. The measures should include practices to identify and subsequently avoid the causes and conditions conducive to the commission of terrorist acts (Freilich et al., 2019). Moreover, identification, disclosure, and investigation of the causes of such acts with the participation of the military forces and police should be in place. Additionally, the tools to minimize and eliminate the consequences of manifestations of terrorism should be applied. However, at the same time, there is no single strategy to stop global terrorism.The lack of universal measures is explained by the constant emergence of new ways of causing harm. In addition, the threat does not arise from the nationals of one specific country. The countries of the Middle East are known for their extensive supplies of oil and flammables, therefore, the unstable situation in the Middle East may affect the US economy (Mercure et al., 2018). Entering transportation constraints and better checks can bring a more efficient result.In conclusion, the state structures of the United States have a great influence on stability and peace in the country and abroad. Blocking communications with the Middle East will partly reduce the threat to the United States, but at the same time may affect economic and political relations between the countries. In the absence of universal counter-terrorism measures, it is still of high importance to apply comprehensive measures of prevention, studying the events that happened, and involving the police and military forces to combat the threats.
Creationism is a religious dogma about the creation of the world based on the Bible. This movement is often described as an offshoot of science, and articles are passed off as scientific and peer-reviewed. However, creationism does not meet the criteria of the scientific method of knowledge – basing conclusions on facts rather than faith. A scientist can only hypothesize about some new entity if there is sufficient reason to do so that cannot be explained by the existing theory and not because of religious faith. Nevertheless, creationists are not bothered by their lack of a scientific method. In this paper, I would like to review one such article. Although it has its share of factual information, most of its arguments do not stand up to criticism. The article “The image of God” by Genesis File seeks to disprove Darwin’s theory of evolution and prove that life on earth was created by external intelligence (2021). The author’s main arguments against evolution are the growth of molecular chaos and the scarcity of transitional forms in the annals of fossils, which supposedly contradict Darwin’s theory of evolution. In my article I will examine these arguments in sequence and highlight their main point. Then, I will use evidence-based science to refute these contentions. In conclusion, I will summarize all the deficiencies in the evidence and make recommendations on how to improve them.The first flaw in the article’s argument is that throughout the entire existence of the species homo sapiens, not a single mutation into other species has been observed.
This argument cannot be accepted as valid because it manipulates the facts. The fact is that this argument is cited as proof that an organism cannot change its form and evolve into other species on its own. It argues in favor of the fact that early organisms could not evolve from natives into amphibians and then into mammalian creatures (Genesis File, 2021). However, the author of the article does not consider that at the time of life of the first organisms, the conditions on our planet were dramatically different from those of today. Floods, droughts, and ice ages occurred. To survive, organisms had to go through massive changes. Nor should we forget that these changes took place over millions of years. However, the article’s author argues that since none of them evolved further over the last few hundred thousand years of modern homo sapiens existence, the whole theory of evolution is flawed (Genesis File, 2021). Changes in the species occurred and are still happening, just quite slowly. For example, primitive humans had a different physique; they had a more powerful, broader, and shorter chest than modern humans (Jantsch, 2019). These changes were due to the optimization of the respiratory system, which gave humans the ability to run long distances and other types of endurance. Another argument to refute the article argues that our species has been around for a relatively short time relative to those that have undergone more striking evolution. This means that we may not yet have achieved a notable change due to lack
of time and may well be transformed into another form in the course of unceasing evolution.The second flaw in the article’s argument is that primitive organisms could never have evolved into humans. The paper justifies this by saying that a cell contains a specific genetic code and can only be subject to small adaptive changes (Genesis File, 2021). Thus, the author argues that a unicellular organism cannot evolve into a multicellular organism. Furthermore, a unicellular organism cannot develop into a multicellular organism on its own. According to the author, for more striking evolution, the intervention of an intelligent being is necessary. The example of human birth can refute this argument. Man, a complex multicellular organism with consciousness, is born from the fusion of two unicellular organisms, the male sperm and the female testicle (Jantsch, 2019). This is an irrefutable experimental fact. As one can see, the process of human birth from unicellular microorganisms exists in nature and in no way needs divine intervention. Thus, a multicellular organism can emerge from a single-celled organism. Furthermore, when a new human being is born, evolution repeats the entire path from unicellulars to humans. Development is essentially chemically the same as the birth of a human being; the process is just greatly extended in time. This is precisely how it happened – from unicellular emerged multicellular. Another example can also illustrate this. Speciation due to acts of natural selection takes place today in a completely natural way without the slightest divine intervention. Sometimes even despite human intervention – for example,
the other (Dror, 2020).Those fish with slightly larger fins could occasionally feed near the ground and lay eggs there. Therefore, after one generation, the descendants of this population in these conditions had slightly longer fins. In the next generation, there were even longer fins. So, every year in the coastal fish population, fish with larger and larger fins survive and reproduce. After another few hundred years, they developed some semblance of paws. As a result, it turns out that the evolutionary transition is very fast by geological standards – only a few generations, not millions of years. Consequently, evolution took place by such rapid leaps caused by the variable pressure of natural selection, which varied depending on natural conditions – differences in resources and the level of competition in flora and fauna. This explains the scarcity of transitional forms in the fossil record.In conclusion, while many creationist articles are considered scientific, they contain many flaws in their reasoning. The main weaknesses were manipulating facts, dismissing a critical treatment of arguments, and the lack of a theoretical basis. Consequently, the author erroneously argued that the species homo sapiens is incapable of evolution and that a single-celled organism cannot transform into a multicellular organism on its own. To improve the argument, I advise the author to read scientific articles presenting an alternative view. This will help make the ideas more comprehensive and align with current scientific evidence.
The crime of extortion requires a criminal act element and a criminal intent element. The criminal act element characteristically implies obtaining property of another by using a threat to cause harm to the victim (Nikolić et al., 2017). The threat may be related to the victim’s health (to cause bodily injury), to property (to cause some damage on the victim’s property), to the victim’s reputation (to reveal some personal information). An example is a criminal demanding a victim to pay them twenty thousand dollars, or they will spread the victim’s private photos. However, some acts including threat, may not be considered the crime of extortion if they are not accompanied with the intent to thieve.Usually, the criminal intent element required for extortion is the purpose of obtaining money or property that one is not legally owning. Such specific intent should exist at the time of the threat to establish extortion. Conscious aim to commit the criminal act and making the threat is sufficient. It implies that the actual stealing of money or property is not required to commit the offense of extortion. Considering the previous example, if a person asks another to loan twenty thousand dollars and after getting refusal threats to spread photos – the criminal intent element required for extortion is lacking.A possible defense to extortion could be evidence that the money or property belonging to another person and taken with the use of threat are taken fairly, for example, as compensation. Thus, if an employee does not get the money earned and threatens the employer to cause harm in order to receive a salary, technically, it is not considered an offense of extortion. To protect oneself from being a victim of such crimes, “educational programs that address related aspects, such as cyberviolence risks, personal data protection, preservation of digital evidence, appropriate reactions to cyber threats, and incident reporting” may be helpful (Vasiu & Vasiu, 2020, p. 24). Such strategies are highlighted since, nowadays, extortion has become a widespread crime in cyberspace due to the availability of mass digital technologies.
Any change in social life patterns has the potential to impact criminal patterns. With Covid-19, while shoplifting rates have declined by 75 percent in some places throughout America, the surge of the virus has resulted in Coronavirus-related scum (Deloitte, 2020). A significant number of criminal activities has shifted, and as technology advances, some of the potential future crimes will entail surveillance. Law enforcement agencies will have challenges with legal requirements and privacy issues in operating vehicles that demand law enforcement agency compliance (Fortenbery, 2016). Law enforcement agencies will be forced to regulate surveillance when conducting data collection and item transportation operations. Another potential criminal analysis issue will be DNA testing (Fortenbery, 2016). Technology advancements have combined several existing approaches in massively parallel sequencing (MPS). With the procedure, the capacity to sequence DNA has become more accurate and efficient, and criminals might use various evidence types and techniques to interfere with samples (Fortenbery, 2016). DNA processing advances combined with increased known sample databases will offer future criminal analysis challenges for law enforcement agencies.One smartphone app that connects police departments with their constituents is SceneDoc, which enables police officers to gather notes, view constituents’ case files, issue citations, and complete FBR reports. The app provides a faster and more precise experience, richer information, and enhanced police safety while in the field (inTime, n.d.). The other law smartphone app that connect police to their constituents is USCop which provides law enforcement officers with over 1,400 content pages on training articles, case law resources, accident investigation formulas, law enforcement training modules, and pill identifiers, among others (inTime, n.d.). The other apps, by mention, comprise Miranda Warnings/Rights, PoliceOne App, First Aid App, Scanner 911, Notecam, InTime Scheduling App, Early Bird Alarm Clock, and Police Spanish Guide.
one can use a pencil, but for forensic experts, it is an unprofessional tool that can only harm the evidence. Indented entries often do not match the information written on the surface of the original document.To open the information, specialists use various professional equipment. It includes a device for a laboratory that works to restore documents with indents. In addition, a photographic method is used, which is based on sliding light, and an electrostatic detection device is also used (Girard, 2017). Naturally, specialists must have the necessary skills and knowledge to detect information written using indentation. Moreover, the use of a soft pencil or copy paper can spoil essential details, and therefore the use of these methods of amateur examination is prohibited.In conclusion, indented writing is a common practice in the criminal world. When writing with indents, the necessary information remains hidden since it is invisible and is printed on the pages following the original. With this tool, one can hide many important and personal data. To detect the inscriptions, specialists are needed and equipment that will allow the records to be declassified and not damage the evidence.
Fatigue is a common and debilitating symptom linked to a number of acute and chronic conditions such as chronic heart failure and acute myocardial infarction. Fatigue has not been analyzed in regards to patients with stable coronary heart disease (CHD), despite the fact that it might factor into new onsets or progression of CHD. Therefore, Eckhardt et al. (2014) decided that it was important to establish the severity of fatigue and its characteristics in a stable CHD population. There were three main purposes of the study conducted by these researchers, one of which was to describe fatigue in stable CHD patients. Moreover, Eckhardt et al. (2014) intended to determine whether certain demographic, physiological, or psychological variables were in correlation with fatigue. Finally, they aimed at identifying whether fatigue was related to health-related quality of life.Five people are cited as the authors of the research: Ann L. Eckhardt, Holli A. DeVon, Mariann R. Piano, Catherine J. Ryan, and Julie J. Zerwic. All of them have the credentials of PhD and RN. Ann L. Eckhardt is affiliated with School of Nursing at Illinois Wesleyan University in Bloomington where she holds the position of Assistant Professor. The other four researchers are affiliated with Department of Biobehavioral Health Science, College of Nursing at University of Illinois in Chicago. Holli A. DeVon is Associate Professor, Mariann R. Piano is Professor and Department Head, Catherine J. Ryan is Clinical Assistant Professor, and Julie J. Zerwic is Professor and Executive Associate Dean there.When it comes to the operational definition of fatigue, it was
described by the researchers as the subjective feeling of extreme and constant exhaustion, weariness, and energy deprivation. Conceptually, fatigue was compared to pain on the grounds of its multidimensionality, exposure to physical and psychosocial factors, and presence of common characteristics with some mood and anxiety disorders. Moreover, it was noted that in CHD patients, fatigue is a prevalent symptom associated with weakness, reduced physical activity, and poor life quality.The study utilized a partially mixed sequential dominant status research design. According to Eckhardt et al. (2014), in their work, the main design of the study was quantitative, followed by a qualitative element. This mixed-method structure was chosen to ensure complementarity, which aims at achieving convergence of quantitative and qualitative results and providing descriptive depth with the help of qualitative interviews. First occurred the collection of the cross-sectional quantitative data, after which participants were selected from this sample for the qualitative element. Qualitative and quantitative data were integrated at the stages of data analysis and discussion.Statistical analysis of data occurred with quantitative components; the Statistical Package for the Social Sciences was used for it. Eckhardt et al. (2014) report that a nominal alpha level of <.05 was selected for the outcomes to be statistically significant. For the analysis of demographic data and fatigue distinguished by gender, Chi-squared independence tests and independent samples t tests were utilized. The identification of factors connected to fatigue was conducted with the employment of Pearson’s correlation and Spearman’s rank correlation coefficient. Predictors of fatigue were determined with the use of multiple regression.One hundred
and two patients with stable CHD were the participants of this study. Eckhardt et al. (2014) recruited them during routine medical appointments from two cardiology clinics. One clinic mainly served urban minority patients (n = 51), and the other mainly served Caucasian patients from a small rural town (n = 51). Eligibility was decided on by the examination of medical records. Inclusion criteria involved a stable CHD diagnosis, the ability to speak and read English, and independent living. Exclusion criteria involved heart failure with reduced ejection fraction, coronary artery bypass grafting or myocardial infarction in the previous 2 months, and incurable disease with prediction to live for less than 6 months. In addition to that, patients with symptoms related to worsened or exacerbated cardiac disease, unstable angina, and hemodialysis were excluded from participation. Such exclusion criteria were due to the elimination of patients with a recent acute episode, new or worsening CHD symptoms, and co-occurring conditions known to be related to significant fatigue. The institutional review boards of both unspecified sites approved the study, and all participants gave their written informed consent.In terms of variables, the independent ones were various demographic (gender, age, race, employment), physiological (myocardial infarction, hypertension, diabetes), and psychological (depressive symptoms) factors. The dependent variable was the correlation of fatigue interference and intensity with the independent variables. Eckhardt et al. (2014) used the term ‘variables’ in regards to the independent ones; however, there was no mention of variables being independent or dependent. One specific relationship that was being investigated by the authors of
it to be easier perceived. The abstract speaks about background, objectives, methods, results, and discussion, and lists key words. From my perspective, the study must have taken several months to be completed. I came to that conclusion having taken into account the participant sample and the fact that the data gathered from questionnaires, inventories, and interviews had to be analyzed and systematized. If I could ask the authors a question about their research, I would ask them what they believe the best solution on the basis of the study’s outcomes could be.In conclusion, Eckhardt et al. (2014) conducted their study to explore fatigue in people with stable CHD. The researchers recruited one hundred and two participants from two unspecified cardiology clinics and employed a partially mixed sequential dominant status design. This work is an important contribution to the understanding of the phenomenon of fatigue in stable CHD patients. Further research is needed to explore the effectiveness of various interventions to facilitate the lives of people struggling with the problem and increase their health-related quality of life.
In the present day, cryptocurrency attracts more and more attention of people all over the world. Regardless of not being widespread yet among community members, cryptocurrency is used by a considerable number of financial institutions and companies for its potential to influence the financial market in the future. In general, it may be defined as a virtual of digital currency secured by cryptography – that is why it cannot be double-spent or counterfeited. There are currently several cryptocurrencies, and the majority of them are decentralized networks on the basis of blockchain technologies enforced by computer networks. Cryptocurrency cannot be affected by government manipulation or interference as it is not issued by it or any central authority.The significance of this study is determined by an unknown and controversial effect of cryptocurrency. While it is frequently regarded as a more convenient and stable alternative to traditional money, some experts state that the instability of cryptocurrency will have a devastating impact on many industries in the future (Nova, 2021). That is why the investigation and evaluation of its potential influence will be beneficial for the development of accurate strategies and preventative measures. The purpose of this paper is to examine the nature of cryptocurrency, its characteristics, and impact on the basis of literature review to answer the research question: Is cryptocurrency unstable? The answer will help to approve or reject a hypothesis that lies in the paper’s thesis statement – being a long-lasting uncontrolled bubble, cryptocurrency contributes to financial and monetary instability, a lack of investor protection, the global market’s downfall, and wealth inequity.According to previous research, a digital currency may be regarded as a highly convenient alternative to traditional money protected from government regulation. It cannot be double-spent or counterfeited, and its use is frequently defined as a future of the financial market. However, this study that incorporates available data related to cryptocurrency demonstrate its instability that may have highly negative consequences for different industries. According to modern studies, cryptocurrency is a long-lasting bubble which value is artificially created. Without proper control, the fluctuations of is value may lead to serious challenges in the financial market and lead to wealth inequities. In the future, more thorough comparison of cryptocurrency and traditional currency in relation to mechanism of its regulation may be required to support this paper’s results.
The purpose of cultural criminology is to examine and describe crime and forms of crime control as cultural products. Criminality and actors in crime control are seen as creative notions that can be expressed in symbolically mediated cultural practices. Thus, subculture members, politicians, media producers, commercial organizations, and other relevant actors provide meaningful explanations for their actions. Cultural criminology considers its task the analysis of the ongoing process of interpretation, reinterpretation, and deconstruction (Wickert, 2019). The theory does not see itself as a theory of crime in a narrow sense; instead, it is a paradigm or perspective approach of crime as a phenomenon, placing significant emphasis on the importance of images, symbols, and representations of self-staging. Cultural criminology qualitative relies on the social sense drawing meanings and methods of ethnography as well as textual and content analysis.Thus, the main point of difference between cultural criminology and other theories of crime is that it places criminality and control over it in a specific context that can be interpreted differently when viewed from varied perspectives. That is, the theory views crime and the relevant agencies and institutions of crime control as cultural products or as creative constructs. As such, corruption must be approached from the standpoint of the meanings that it carries. To facilitate an understanding of cultural criminology, it is essential to consider such ideas as crime as culture, culture as crime, the media constructions of crime control and corruption, and political dimensions of culture, crime, and cultural criminology.Crime as culture entails the characterization of deviant subcultures
as systems of symbols, which may include the style and appearance of their members, slang expressions, as well as any signs, slogans, and other methods of differentiation. In this sense, crime as culture means that individuals belong to a subculture that requires one’s capacity to construct and deconstruct the system of collective codes and practices. Besides, within the subculture that considers crime among its defining culture, symbolic communication may also often occur besides face-to-face interactions.Culture as crime is a thematic area of cultural criminology that entails the criminalization of cultural products and players. The analysis of the area depends, on the one hand, on the differentiation between the so-called high culture and, on the other hand, popular culture. Criminalizing cultural products and the various forms that it takes mainly influences popular culture. Although, it is necessary to note several isolated examples in which criminalization also influences the products of the so-called high culture. For instance, the photographs taken by Jock Sturges and Robert Mapplethorpe were deemed pornographic despite the fact that their intention was artistic expression. On the downside, the stigmatization and criminalization predominantly affect artists that belong to social minorities and subcultures, such as black rap musicians, punk musicians, LGBTQ artists, and others.The third thematic focus area, media constructions of crime control and crime, is focused on the analysis of reciprocal action mechanisms of the judicial system and the media. Drawing from the works of Cohen and Becker, such constructs as moral panics and folk devils have been heavily covered in media. An example of
the media construction of crime and crime control pertains to the Satanic panic, a national hysteria episode that dominated the media in the 1980s (Hughes, 2016). The event involved the severe moral panic associated with more than twelve thousand unsubstantiated satanic ritual abuse cases in the 1980s in the United States (Hughes, 2016). The issue with satanic panic relates to the extreme media coverage of the alleged abuse of satanic rituals, with the information not being verified or taken from unreliable sources. Therefore, due to the relationship of dependence between media coverage and crime, especially when it comes to the determination of which crime phenomena should be covered and which should not get any attention. In the thematic area of media constructions of crime control and crime, it is essential to consider media’s construction of crime as a product of entertainment.The thematic area of focus, which entails the political dimension of culture, crime, and cultural criminology, is concerned with the analysis of power relations in which social control, media, and crime stand. Specifically, deviant subcultures become targets of stately surveillance and control or are subject to a process of commodification. In the sense of “cultural wars,” the art establishment that includes alternative artists argues about the aesthetic value of works. However, the opponents of such art declare this alternative art a crime and take criminal justice actions against artists. The censorship that affects artists that are politically motivated provides an extreme case of the arguments regarding artistic interpretation from the hegemonic perspective. Mass media has succeeded
For decades, people’s perception of social equality has been intertwined with the phenomenon of paying no attention to ethnic affiliation. However, instead of embracing the idea of universal equity, this concept resulted in the explicit enablement of white supremacy. For example, celebrating equality in the US essentially meant being generalized and assimilated into the image of a Caucasian white male. Hence, while at some point, society wanted to eliminate discrimination through everyone being “the same underneath,” only ethnic, gender, and sexual minorities were forced to sacrifice their identity. The result of such assimilation is especially vivid in the case of Japanese Americans and their mass assimilation aimed at creating the model minority (Shih et al., 2019). In order to be accepted in the community, minority populations were threatened with embracing another culture as their own.Such ignorance should never be mistaken for equality of being the same. The power of equality is to allow one to express their cultural identity without the fear of being marginalized in society. Moreover, embracing genuine interest in different cultures is what makes people evolve in their perspective on the world and critical thinking. Years of discrimination have eliminated the history of hundreds of ethnic minorities, so now is the time to make sure that everyone learns and cherishes their ancestors to the same extent. Undeniably, many people dwell on the fact that the idea of multi-culturalism is highly complex, especially in working or educational settings. However, the study of cultural diversity should never focus on creating exclusive communities that have nothing in common. Diversity is about shared learning of one’s values to find common ground with no discrimination against minorities.
human life. The first one is the issue of identity – in Beowulf , people were entirely associated with the glory of their ancestors. They do not exist independently from their family lineage and kinship bonds. Thus, their desire of Beowulf to be recognizable and honored forces him to search for deeds and fame. Thus, another important theme of the poem is the maturity and responsibility that come with age. At the beginning of the poem, the main hero desires personal glory and has nothing to lose. However, after becoming a king, he realizes the importance of being a wise ruler who is responsible for his people’s lives. Finally, one more topic of the poem is the tension between personal value systems and the heroic code and between Christian and pagan values. It may be regarded as an example of the multifacetedness and complexity of human nature in comparison with fixed rules that frequently do not provide appropriate answers.
caregiving (McLennon et al., 2020). Another alleviating factor is religiosity that is used as a source of comfort and strength (McLennon et al., 2020). Both factors help African Americans cope with the caregiver’s burden.Culturally appropriate interventions for this cultural group should emphasize African American values. One particular intervention is psychoeducation that should be culturally tailored to include more information about the family as a caregiving resource (Brewster et al., 2020). Culturally sensitive interventions are important because it allows for forming therapeutic alliances with clients and addressing the systemic oppression faced by their cultural groups (National Association of Social Workers, 2010). In order to advocate for African American caregivers, social workers should be aware of policies applying to this group and defend their interests and cultural values in team meetings. They should also support policies and media that act to eliminate the institutional oppression of this group.
IntroductionMost religious people often tend to display prejudice at extremely high levels. There is a significant relationship between religion and prejudice that must consider the multifaceted religion nature and the prejudice target. Religion encompasses a multifaceted moral, social, emotional, and cognitive construct (Rowatt & Al-Kire, 2021). However, cognitive and social aspects are significant dimensions that determine in-group members and the constituents of a threat in a global religious view hence the relationship between religion and prejudices. Catholicism and Islam are outlined to play a vital role in religious prejudices.CatholicismDiscrimination and racism constitute the effective forms of prejudice that the Catholic Church opposes. However, research reports that other Catholics have worked tirelessly to promote racist practices in the recent past. Following this situation, the Catholic Church has taken the chance to acknowledge its complicity and moral shortcomings regarding such pressing issues. Since 1958, Rowatt & Al-Kire, (2021) the church has made enhanced and consistent efforts to resolve the unbecoming situation. Additionally, the church’s responses and the present mood regarding racism and discrimination, which comprise objectives of several catholic groups, were established to promote an inclusive culture and combat the ideology of racism. Pope John XXIII is renowned for affecting the Catholic Church’s changes since his induction.MuslimAccording to Rowatt & Al-Kire, (2021), there have been detectable higher levels of prejudice constantly accelerating among and within Muslims in the recent past. The Muslim community, particularly the Arabian and American Muslims, is often subjected to discrimination by their fellow Muslims, hence facing a lot of tension. These groups have constantly
been facing rejection by their religious community. Even worse, their entry to other countries has caused them much trouble and difficulties. All this results from discrimination tied to people’s attitudes towards others in the Muslim community. Several attempts to stop or reduce prejudice have not brought significant changes in this situation. Therefore, the Muslims are to blame for the increasing discrimination rate among their groups.Media’s Role in PrejudicesMedia has the power and potential to alter individual attitudes, beliefs, behaviors, and other social aspects. For some time, policy interventions have targeted and used media communications to influence and promote sexism, such as gender-based violence (Anwar et al., 2020). Media influences social norms through two effects, namely, social and individual effects. The information conveyed on media platforms creates a mutual knowledge of a norm regarding the social effect. Further, it augments social coordination as more individuals believe in the shared information, hoping that others have accepted similar information (Anwar et al., 2020). Consequently, media information concerning norms may tend to individuals to consent with them according to the individual effect. Therefore, the social and mechanisms of the media have on changing attitudes of violence against women, although the former mechanism holds more weight.Social Identity TheoryA person’s sense of self-identification based on their membership in a group is referred to as social identity. By belonging to groups, people can develop a sense of pride and self-esteem (McLeod, 2019). Racism can stem from prejudiced perceptions amongst civilizations, and it can even lead to genocide in its most extreme forms. The
group that we belong to is called the in-group, and that we do not belong to is called the out-group (McLeod, 2019). To better understand and recognize objects, we categorize them. To comprehend the social context, we similarly categorize people. We employ social categories like black, white, Australian, Christian, Muslim, student, and bus driver because they are helpful. We can learn a lot about people by classifying them into a category, as we saw with the bus driver.In and out-groupsAppropriate behavior is defined in-group norms, but this is only achievable if you know who belongs to your group. A person can be a member of several separate groups. In the second step, social identification, we adopt the group’s identity to which we have assigned ourselves. As a result of your affiliation with a group, your self-esteem will become entwined with group membership (Scheepers & Ellemers, 2019). Once we have classified ourselves as members of a group and established a relationship with it, we prefer to compare it to other groups. This is critical to comprehend because once two groups identify as rivals, they are forced to compete for members to retain their self-esteem. Competitiveness and hostility between groups occur due to clashing identities and resource competition.Effects of prejudiceWhen others underestimate people, their personality decreases, and they stop developing themselves; prejudice helps them feel less than entirely human. It frequently leads to bullying and other forms of prejudice because it fosters a dread of what could transpire at any time and of what the future may contain.
This can lead to an individual taking their personal life in difficult situations, in worst scenarios, murder. Individuals and entire groups might feel very vulnerable, afraid, and unworthy due to racism and discrimination.How Stereotype Threat is CriticalWhen people are aware of a negative stereotype about their group, they are often concerned that their performance on a task would confirm other people’s perceptions of their group. The phrase “stereotype danger” is used by psychologists to describe the state in which people are concerned about confirming a group stereotype (Meuleman et al., 2019). For those subjected to stereotype threat, it can be uncomfortable and distracting. This phenomenon is assumed to be situation-specific, with people only experiencing it when exposed to a negative stereotype about their group. Stereotype research supports research on microaggressions and bias in higher education, and it aids in better understanding underrepresented groups’ experiences (Liu et al., 2021). In other words, women may prefer to take classes in other fields to escape the stereotype threat they face in math classes.Real-World Problem and the Impact It Has on SocietyClimate change will get a significant impact on our student’s lives, and there will not be a single issue that has a more significant influence on them than this one. They understand that this is a serious issue that will affect nearly everything, including weather, rising seas, food and nutrition security, water quality, air quality, environmental sustainability, and much more (Gougis, 2020). Food insecurity is exacerbated by differences in socioeconomic factors, growth opportunities, housing, security, support services, and other
IntroductionThere has been significant evolution in the advertising industry from traditional advertising methods such as newspapers, print media, and television to digital advertising based on the internet.Therefore, advertising research has moved from considering consumers as passive to interact-ability, where consumers are active. This has been caused by a shift in the consumption habits of consumers. There has been a massive advertisement transfer from offline to online sources in the last few decades. With the new advancements in the advertising industry, innovations are occurring each year. It has created a large pool of advertising strategies leaving marketers with many challenges, including choosing the most effective method to reach their target audience. This study aims to highlight the problems of advertising by identifying the causes, finding solutions, and evaluating the effectiveness of the solutions.The Main Problems of AdvertisingBudget LimitsOne of the advertising problems is the budget limits of various companies and businesses.Unless for multinationals and other high-revenue businesses that have big budgets, smaller-entities have limited advertising budgets restricting their advertisements. Most businesses ensure they give the most amounts possible, hoping their consumers will notice their efforts (Moorman, Soli, and Cardoso, 2022). However, to achieve this effectively, one must find the correct audience, strategies, and platform in order to make the most of your limited resources. (Reinartz and Saffert, 2013). When businesses begin with a too-limited budget, they risk ending their advertising efforts without being noticed, while those who risk too much may lose their money (Moorman, Soli, and Cardoso, 2022). Therefore, not having the right budget is one
of the most common problems facing companies, especially in their early development stages.Choosing the Right MethodAnother problem of advertisement that has come up is choosing the right method.For a marketer to choose the right method, they must consider the target audience and how they can easily reach them. This process may involve having to do a trial test until the right advertising method is found. In some cases, they may be forced to combine two or more methods, which may involve both digital and traditional channels, making it even harder. This shows that choosing the right method of advertising is a major problem.Compelling ContentThe other problem that is facing advertising has compelling content.The challenge for marketers is to create a message and transform it into something that either sounds or appears different (Koob, 2021, p. 7). Sometimes the consumers may be interested in the characters of the advert and not see the main message; therefore, it is important to ensure that the message is directly linked to the characters, color, voice, and sometimes even the advertising channel (Sinclair, 2019). Thus, creating a compelling advertising message has become a significant challenge for marketers.Measuring EffectivenessThe next problem with advertising is measuring the effectiveness of the adverts.Nevertheless, determining the success of a marketing campaign is one of the most difficult aspects of advertising (Mafael et al., 2021, p. 5). This problem worsens when a company has different adverts; therefore not easy to determine the effectiveness of each method. Running advertisements that do not have much returns for a business
is expensive since advertising is quite expensive (Mafael et al., 2021, p. 7). For instance, a company could waste much money running YouTube ads for its audience only to find out a simple outdoor poster was enough to achieve its marketing purposes. This shows that measuring an advert’s effectiveness is a real problem; if not well done, a company may lose money in irrelevant adverts.Rising through the CompetitionThe final problem of advertising is making it through stiff competition. It is very challenging for companies with limited resources to keep up with competition levels (Akbar et al., 2021).These big companies have well-thought marketing strategies, but that does not mean that smaller businesses cannot beat them in the competition (Akbar et al., 2021). Advertising is a competitive business; thus, businesses and entrepreneurs should find out how to ensure they are competitive in the market (Akbar et al., 2021). Thus, beating the competition implies that the advertisement will get a good amount of attention; hence positive returns in terms of sending the message out.Solutions and Evaluation of EffectivenessIn solving the problem of a limited budget, businesses or entrepreneurs need to ensure that they keep their marketing goals clear and concise.A business entity should enlist all the costs required to carry out the business and prioritize the most impactful ones (Eyada and Milla, 2020, p. 67). In addition, they should divide the budget into weekly, monthly, semi-annually, or annually to ensure that they keep track of the advertisements and their returns. To measure the effectiveness of this strategy, the business
should conduct tests and tweak the campaigns. This will help them to identify if the allocated budget is enough for the advertisement and if it is effective in reaching the goals. If the budget is not enough for the ad, the business can change some strategies to make it more practical such as eliminating unbeneficial channels (Moorman, Ryan, and Tavassoli, 2022). In addition, the tweaks on the advertisement will help ensure that it aligns with the primary goals set for the business. If the budget is still too high or too low, the company can re-evaluate the set priorities to determine which are best aligned with the company goals.Solution to Compelling ContentCompelling content is essential in ensuring that an advertisement meets its objectives. Therefore, an ad needs to craft the right message for its audience.This process begins with identifying the target audience, the most effective channel to reach them, what they want to hear and what they need to know about the advertisement (Hsu, 2019). Marketers must create new sales pitches because the target audience is already used to the commonly used pitches, such as “limited products for a limited time.” In addition, consumers have increased their research capabilities and researched different adverts before purchasing (Eyada and Milla, 2020, p. 70). Therefore, the advertisement should ensure that it earns the audience’s trust by aligning its content with its core values (Eyada and Milla, 2020, p. 71). When creating digital advertisements, it is essential to ensure that the person used in the advert represents the culture and
most effective channel based on their gender, age, size, and physical location (Moorman, Ryan, and Tavassoli, 2022). For instance, if most prospective consumers are clustered in one place, creating offline adverts, such as billboards, and placing them in those places would effectively send the message.Effective advertisement channelThere are many ways of measuring the effectiveness of different advertising channels based on their form.Effective channels would be tracking leads from the marketing channel (Sinclair, 2019). This is whereby a business identifies the number of people converted from prospective consumers to buyers by the marketing channels (Danaher et al., 2020, p. 4). For digital channels, some factors to consider are click-through rates, website traffic, and cost per lead to determine the effectiveness of an advertising channel (Rathi et al., 2022). Businesses should ensure that they set a tracking system for their advertising methods and determine if they are working towards their goals (Danaher et al., 2020, p. 4). Effective tracking makes it easier to see the methods that are doing good and those that are doing badly in terms of advertisements.ConclusionAdvertising is essential; for attracting and retaining customers in a business. This is why many companies spend billions on advertising so that they can ensure they update their consumers about their products.This study has identified problems associated with advertising which include budget limits, compelling content, choosing the right method, measuring effectiveness, and rising through the competition. In addition, the study has proposed solutions to overcome the challenges and how to measure the effectiveness of those solutions.
IntroductionThis paper is based on “Case study Ista: Digging deep into CVC’s long-term investment.” The case notes that with roots dating back to 1902, the Ista group (Ista) has grown to become one of the world’s top producers of energy management services (Schaab & Frère, 2019). The company operates in 24 countries, employs around 5,500 people, and produced €881.1 million in sales in 2017, with 43 percent earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization (EBITDA) margin (Schaab & Frère, 2019). This discussion critically evaluates the benefits of the long-term investment to CVC Capital Partners (CVC) and Ista based on the case study. This paper also analyzes the changes in CVC’s revenues and EBITDA during the investment phase, examining the impact of the level of liabilities and interest payment obligations during each new transaction financing. The discussion concludes by proposing relevant recommendations to ensure a better financial position for the company.Benefits of the Long-Term InvestmentOffers Opportunity for Structured NegotiationsThe long-term investment seems to have allowed CVC and Ista to develop structured negotiations to benefit the companies. For instance, the case notes that in 2004, the corporation experienced further strategic readjustments reverted to its original name of Ista, and various responsibilities were transferred to the direct holding company for efficiency (Schaab & Frère, 2019). In the new structure, Ista International GmbH assumed responsibility for the group’s human resources and corporate finance functions, allowing Ista Deutschland GmbH to concentrate on sales and service. Meter Holding Corporation S.A. and Meter Service Corporation S.à r.l. were disengaged entirely from operating, significantly
improving overall efficiencies (Schaab & Frère, 2019). Such inter-organizational negations are critical in diversifying a company’s relationships in the market.Fostering Functional Business RelationshipProlonged exposure to specific business environments also helped establish the most effective coordination within a company. In the case study, CVC and ista seem to have benefited from the long-term investments initiatives through the informed organizational structure and company procedures (Schaab & Frère, 2019). The case study notes that CVC held shares in ista for 14 years. CVC’s long-term involvement seems to have achieved deal values and ideas that influenced Ista’s financials, strategy, and competitive positioning.The case study’s examination of the total transaction contract conditions also reveals a functional relationship between CVC and administration. For instance, Meter Holding Corporation S.A. issued common stock and approved the issuance of convertible redeemable preferred equity securities transferable into common stock (Schaab & Frère, 2019). Ordinary shareholders were allowed to contribute proportionately to the permitted capital, minimizing diluting impacts on management (Surasmi et al., 2019). CVC obtained pre-emptive privileges to manage shares, a threshold of one out of every three executive positions, and a baseline of three out of every five seats on the shareholders’ council, along with the nomination of the committee’s president. Such opportunities ensure established structures in the interest of the business.Low-Cost Trading Fees and CommissionsSome of the apparent needs for CVC and Ista seem to be the continuation of operations at optimum EBITDA. The long-term investment directly impacted the value in business negotiations that could have been influenced by the access to decision-making privileges.
For instance, Ista Luxemburg GmbH was valued at around €6.2 billion (Schaab & Frère, 2019). The venture capitalist paid €3.7 billion for the company’s share capital and granted preferred ownership certifications, the latter of which is worth around €748 million, including delayed interest charges (Schaab & Frère, 2019). The transaction is relatively fair considering the states at the company (Surasmi et al., 2019). In the case study, the debt capital is estimated to be valued at about €2.5 billion. The group repaid all outstanding debt funds contracts and entered into new senior financings totaling €1.950 million at borrowing costs ranging from 0.85 percent to 1.10 percent plus the Euro Interbank Offered Rate (EURIBOR) (Schaab & Frère, 2019). There is a clear cost-benefit in such negotiation on cost commitments.Better Long-Term ReturnsThe long-term investments may have also influenced the overall returns positively. The positive correlation is illustrated in the case, noting that CVC used the same share class structure as in the second transaction, as revealed by examining the official documentation. The negotiations seem to have ensured that share classes A to E got preferential dividends and buyback or cancellation proceeds. In contrast, classes F to J earned the profitability allocation’s remaining values (Schaab & Frère, 2019). The balance ensures distributed investment and security for both the stakeholders and the management.The connection between shareholders was more equitable in the share balance transaction. The case highlights that while CVC and Canada Pension Plan invested over 98 percent of their capital in preferential share classes, managers could devote approximately 92
percent of their capital to preferred investment options, compared to 40.2 percent in the prior transaction (Schaab & Frère, 2019). Such flexibility seems to have been established with prolonged exposure to the negotiation environment. The timeframe also influenced CVC’s action of shortening the contractual terms, mainly for the advantage of management, except for a strengthened share transfer provision. Consequently, any share transfer required CVC’s prior authorization guaranteeing control and relevance with prospects of a better return on investment.Gives Money More Growth TimeframeThe prolonged timeframe also allowed for the desired non-public sale of the company. The case study points out that Charterhouse began the tender process for Ista in December 2012, after over six years of project lifetime (Schaab & Frère, 2019). The reduced time constraints typically influence the sales approach (Dyahrini et al., 2021). The case study notes that although an initial public offering was a viable exit strategy, the shareholders chose a private sale. Since the company’s liabilities increased again, the equity worth stood at around €830 million, excluding the approximately €770 million convertible preferred stock securities and investor loans (Schaab & Frère, 2019). The comparative revenue shifts seem to contribute to CVC’s revenues and EBITDA and imply growth in quality of negotiations over time as one of the benefits of the long-term investment strategy.Changes in CVC’s Revenues and EBITDAThe opportunities that came with the long-term investment improved the revenue prospects and EBITDA of the company. The case study demonstrates how CVCs maintained constant revenue and EBITDA growth, increased employment, and created a corporate governance
structure throughout the investment period. Additionally, it made reasonable globalization efforts and industry sector expansion choices based on evolving laws and solid top-level management support (Prasanna et al., 2019). The use of Luxembourgian corporations to structure transactions is standard procedure in the sector. The contractual arrangements between the investors showed that CVC sought a more functional relationship with minority owners than Charterhouse’s principal business is the sub-metering of tenants’ thermal energy and water use in multi-tenant properties. Such technical readjustment in service delivery seems to have contributed to CVC’s revenue and EBITDA growth.CVC’s Diversification of ServiceSimilarly, the innovation around service delivery and merger with other institutions improved the stability in revenue streams contributing to a jump in revenue prospects. The case study recognizes that the solution facilitated building owners and operators to distribute resulting energy and water bills based on individual use during the investment phase. Additionally, the firm offers additional services such as hardware distribution, assembly, commissioning, and refinancing. The relatively broad scope of service contributed to the improved revenue and EBITDA necessary for growth.Productive Investment PhaseCVC’s strategic investment also emerges as a booster in the revenue status and profitability prospects. For instance, Exhibit 6 illustrates the revenue growth throughout the investment period in the case study. Ista’s overall business performance is strong, with a compound annual growth rate CAGR of 4.80 percent and moderate growth volatility (Schaab & Frère, 2019). The case study notes that the firm’s EBITDA is growing at an even faster rate of 7.94 percent (Schaab & Frère, 2019). Additionally, the
EBITDA margin was around 43% of sales in 2017, which is certainly a compelling case for an investment (Schaab & Frère, 2019). The changes in CVC’s Revenues and EBITDA tend to depend on the nature of investments and acquisitions directly.Access to Reliable Human ResourceThe quality of staff within the company also emerges as an important area of focus for the company’s revenue and EBITDA growth prospects. In the case study, Exhibit 8 illustrates that the organization hired over 1,700 more employees between the beginning and the conclusion of the investment periods (Schaab & Frère, 2019). Such improvement in access to human resource signal growth. The improvements are also evident, considering that several functional groups in companies with subsidiary relations and special interests were maintained practically unchanged. Referencing these advancements to the more than doubling sales and considerably expanded EBITDA margins indicates the efficiency advantages throughout the investment period. From an organizational labor perspective, the efficiency improvements might also be regarded adversely, depending upon the prospective rise in workload for the organization’s workers (Yusoff et al., 2020). Despite the potential concerns over workload, the demand for more resources signifies that the revenue could sustain the operations.Impact of the Level of Liabilities and Interest Payment ObligationsThe constraints in CVC’s attempt to optimize revenues and EBITDA could also be linked to the slow market growth for the company’s offers. One potential reason for the limited development of client base, household, and meter numbers is Ista’s international market penetration strategy that is complicated by the liabilities within the company. For
on both the internal and external business environments. The management recognizes that some of the determinants of the revenue and EBITDA could be linked to the quality of decisions made, the market reach, and access to a qualified labor force. The case study admits that the liabilities and interest payment requirements rose with each new transaction financing. Although constant development of the business model benefited the private equity firm, the issue of whether workers paid the price for efficiency gains is difficult to assess from a distance. Despite the difficulties, it seems as though Ista thrived throughout the investment period. CVC generated a net profit of around €2.25 billion in any event, including interest on shareholder loans. As such, the fund investors have reaped the benefits of their long-term commitment.
Supply chains can be highly vulnerable to hacking and malware attacks and, depending on the attacker’s motivation, are susceptible to actions aimed at stealing large amounts of money and disrupting business. Yeniyurt and Carnovale (2021) note that cybercriminals are unwilling to slow down the growth of cyber threats and invent new ways to steal information from individuals and organizations of all sizes. The most common cyber risks in supply chain management include data breaches, supply chain disruption, and malware attacks. Data breaches can occur through external and internal intruders. Employees, hackers, malicious competitors, and managers can leak sensitive data and personal information outside the business. Supply chain disruption occurs when a hacker or attacker breaks into an operating system or network without permission. The goal of penetration is to create havoc on the system by deleting, replicating, and corrupting data. Malware attacks can occur with the help of ransomware that blocks the computer until the company pays a certain amount of money.One of the cyberattack tools is sending a phishing email in order to obtain information. Ghadge et al. (2020) assert that clicking on a link in an email may result in data corruption and loss. If the phishing email is successful, the company can find the username and password used externally to collect information on the system. It can lead to unforeseen competition and serious leaks that could harm the entire corporation.The sophistication of attacks and the complexity of modern IT, using such technologies as virtualization, mobile, and cloud computing, are forcing companies to improve
Cystic Fibrosis Pathophysiology and EtiologyCystic Fibrosis (CF) is a genetic disorder that causes various digestion and breathing issues. Precisely, CF occurs due to a metamorphosis in the CF transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) gene. The gene produces the CFTR protein, which regulates the sodium and chloride ions movement across the epithelial cell membranes (Bowden & Greenberg, 2014). The mutations in a single or both replicas of the genetic factor make the ion conveyance unreliable and form a buildup of dense mucus in the whole body. The deformities serve as the basis of respiratory deficiency and other systemic anomalies and obstructions (Brown et al., 2017). Hence, people with CF have thick and sticky mucus that clocks their airways and causes lung damage, traps germs, increases the prevalence of infections, and prevents the entry of vital proteins into the intestines.CF Clinical Manifestations 1. Decreased appetite 2. Fatigue 3. Increased cough 4. Reduced spirometry values 5. Poor response to outpatient treatment measures 6. Hemoptysis (Bowden & Greenberg, 2014). 7. Recurrent wheezing 8. Infertility 9. Biliary cirrhosis10. Abdominal distension (Brown et al., 2017).Interdisciplinary Approach to CF TreatmentThe care of CF patients requires the coordination of different treatment measures and the integration of psychosocial counseling and management in medical treatment. Bowden and Greenberg (2014) describe CF as a complex disease that requires specialized care and treatment. Hence, although pediatric pulmonologists remain the prominent directors of CF centers, the institutions need other specialists like endocrinologists, specialists of infectious diseases, gastroenterologists, and geneticists (Bowden & Greenberg, 2014). Besides, additional team members like medical social
and the need for interdisciplinary care. However, the student should improve their presentation strategy to avoid giving unclear and unsatisfactory answers. Overall, the post makes it easy for any reader to understand the basic knowledge about CF and the most preferred treatment methods.Response to Second PostThe author does an incredible job in expressing their ideas in the essay. The writer addressed the questions systemically and concretely, making it easier for the reader to read and understand basic concepts about CF. I agree with the authors’ perceptions on the etiology and pathophysiology of the disease and the practitioner’s role in treating the disease. Besides, the way the author explained the basics of CF and its use in different ways is commendable. The post will go a long way in educating people on the nature of CF and how it affects children.
IntroductionThe author addresses the evolution of filmmaking from the early years to the 21st century. The argument is on how information technology has transformed the way viewers experience narratives and images while watching different movies. Advancement in technology gives the spectators powers to control both the image and storylines with an unexpected pleasures such that the viewers are lost in the film and experience the episodes as their own (Sobchack). The author postulates that with the integration of technology into filmmaking, viewers have new ways of experiencing the images of the cinema. Additionally, the hidden stillness of the movies comes to light making it visible and accessible. The computer system has made it possible for anyone to understand the individual frame and the film’s kept secrets easily, accurately, and effectively.The angle of approachThis book is a historical exploration of the role new media technology is giving to old cinemas by re-evaluating the history of films and their usefulness. New technologies give the viewers the ability to control both the image and story (Sobchack). Viewers are capable of repeating the episodes, they can do slow motions on sections of the film, and even free-frame the film (Mulvey, 147). This adventure makes spectators have an excessive and irrational devotion or commitment to continue watching. Further, the capacity of the viewers to manipulate the film images gives the cinema materials some aesthetic traits.Evaluating the breadth or scope of the argumentAlthough this book is talking about the film industry, the author’s narration of cinema’s psychic and social aspects of life
covers the events and discoveries prominent with the twentieth all through to the twenty-first century. During this period of time, several ways of doing things or systems changed into new ways because of computer technology (Grant). Many fields, disciplines, socialization, and human interactions started embracing information technology. The film industry was not left behind and the cinemas began integrating new technology. The book covers the aspects of classic visual pleasure and narrative film enabled by the digital spectrum which opens up other viewing positions of cinemas. The narrative captures the history of cinema indicating the “death” of traditional movies onto the birth of digital age films.There are case studies that have reinforced the argument that technology has revolutionized the film industry. For instance, about fifty years back, filmmakers had to assemble a full crew to be able to record movies; in cases where they needed aerial shots, they had to use aircraft mounted with cameras that were even heavier. Once the filming was over, editing was done physically by cutting and pasting the film together (“The Impact of Technology in the Film Industry”). The process was long and difficult and the quality of work was very poor. Technology took over in the late 20th century with the introduction of lighter cameras which capture clear and quality images. The synchronization of clouds has made editing of films much easier to an extent that filmmakers can work in collaboration from any part of the world. For the viewers it’s no longer a must they go to the theatre
to watch movies because on-demand, streaming services, computers, tablets, and smartphones have allowed them to watch the movies whenever and wherever they wish.Technology is used effectively in filmmaking through computer-generated graphics to produce special effects in the cinema business. This method is cheaper than the physical techniques because it employs computer software instead of creating physical settings to generate images. For example, in 1973, ‘Westworld’ film was created using computer-generated pictures (Sharma). This fictional movie included both robots and real people; other cases are like the iconic film ‘Star Wars’ and ‘Star Trek II’ which had effects such as laser weapons and robotic motions. Then there is also the use of animation and three-dimensional (3D).The connections the author draws across ideas and evidence presentedIn this book, the author draws several ideas linking the past and the present to demonstrate changes over time. In the introduction the book explains the technological advances between the 1970s all through to early 2000s; that in the 70s the films were always seen in rooms and were projected on frames. Then to the current changes dark spaces to self-directed viewing on DVDs or videos. Further, in old days the films were characterized by delays which technology has replaced with aspects like creating slow motions, editing, and freeze-frame which gives the viewer an excellent experience (Mulvey, 144). In chapter 1 of the book, “Passing Time,” there is a clear explanation about the relationship between past or early cinema and the new technological age films. It comes out that technology makes it possible
for the 21st-century viewer to be able to use imitation of an indexical image. To get the feeling of a similar stake of wonders like those who viewed the same cinema before technology integration.Strengths of the argumentComparing the stillness and technology in relation to the evolution of cinemas, the modern concept of films transformed the movie adventure by creating delays which makes it easy for spectators to evaluate the film. Now the digital mechanisms work on the films by delaying the movements, it is also capable of fragmenting the movie and even rewinding the film (Thompson). Meaning technology has total a new paradigm in the film industry by a new way to pause, initiate delays, and repetitions that were not applicable to projectors. In addition, the ability to pause the film can span the viewers into a position from which they can distinguish the indexicality of the image and its historical nature (Thompson). This mechanism is very important for analyzing politics and using the film to help close the gap especially in the modern-day world which tends to focus on things happening at present.Weaknesses of the argumentThe aspect of stillness and the moving image places the film actors within a context of unnatural fusion between the human body and the machine. The power to control the flow of the cinema through constants stops in between, creating delays and replaying the movie several times, could lead to spectators being too possessive. Technology has given the viewers’ power to dominant the film actors (Thompson). They develop an excessive

Additionally, technology has given the viewers’ power to dominate the film actors. Lastly, technology makes the audience develop an excessive attachment to the image that was once only possible with the help of external assistance such as production stills or calendar images.
In Looking for Alaska, John Green presents one of the most outstanding coming-of-age novels that explore profound existential questions about life, death, and the meaning of life. Green creates witty, well-drawn characters, full of individual quirks — to whom he affords the privilege of finding closure on their terms instead of resorting to the rather elusive happily ever after. In the book, the theme of death features prominently, and much of the plot is based on its events. Death shapes the lives of various characters, such as the protagonists, Miles, and Alaska. Alaska embodies the very nature through which death can change an individual’s life trajectory, as illustrated by her encounter with her mother’s death, and in more literal terms, by her death.Popular critique of the novel emphasizes the inevitability of death, and how despite the starkness of this reality, people can never really come to terms with death. However, in this essay, a different contention is taken. While the importance of death in the book is fully appreciated, this essay argues for Green using death as a means rather than an end. Death is used as a sort of midpoint, a signaler towards more urgent thematic preoccupations of this text: how to live and die. In addition, it shall be argued that the mediating process between how to live and how to die is another process in itself of finding the meaning of life.Death plays an instrumental role in this story, not only as a philosophical musing by the author and the characters but also
as a midpoint that effectively separates the story into before and after. Death moves the story as much as it moves the readers in the way it propels the characters’ actions. The first death in the story, and arguably one from which much of the action is premised or proceeds, is Alaska’s mother’s death. Alaska witnessed this death and failed to act at that critical moment, something she eternally felt guilty about throughout the rest of the story. Thoyyibah asserts that through this encounter, Alaska was burdened with self-blame, as she watched her mother dying on the floor, yet did not attempt to help her in any way, and instead resorts to screaming and crying (34). This self-blame was exacerbated by the fact that her father seemed to blame her for her mother’s death, and she thought he was justified so, “…so I just sat there on the floor with her until my dad came home an hour later and he’s screaming ‘Why didn’t you call 911?’” (Green 120). Alaska’s disposition throughout the story can be attributed to this feeling of guilt.The death of Alaska’s mother and the circumstances of her death changes Alaska completely, not only just her but the discourse of the life of those close to her. Thoyiba cites this event as the significant childhood trauma that shaped Alaska’s characterization as a coping mechanism (1). It influences her worldview, especially on the process of living. Alaska takes on a nihilistic approach to life as evidenced by her interpretation of the metaphor of labyrinth
“… It’s not life or death, the labyrinth. /Um, okay. So what is it? /Suffering,” she said. “Doing wrong and having wrong things happen to you. That’s the problem…” (Green 52). Her death, whether it was suicide or an accident, resulted from this impulsive worldview.The death of Alaska was the midpoint of the stories of various characters in the book and both literal and metaphorical senses of the word. In the literal sense, since Alaska’s death reinforces the storyline, the first part of the book traces the events of her life, and the second, the aftermath of her death. In the metaphorical sense, death serves to cause a remarked change in the other characters and fuels the processes of living and finding the meaning of life. In addition, the reader benefits from this event’s lessons on the continuation of life after grief and the hope of overcoming sorrow (Logara 12). One of the most immediate changes in Alaska’s death effects is in leading other characters to introspect about the nature of death. Takumi and Miles have a candid discussion in which they seem to concur on death being natural, despite a certain sense of dread permeating their conversation. Takumi contends, “It’s natural. I mean, it must be natural” (Green 253). To this, Miles expresses to have given it earlier thought, asserting that despite its goriness, death was universal.Apart from introspection on life and death, another effect that strongly comes out is the unbridled guilt that grasps those near Alaska. For one reason or the other, many
characters felt they could have somehow prevented this death. In particular, the feeling of guilt drives Miles to investigate whether the death was a suicide—a process through which Miles ends up discovering a lot about himself. A new part of him filled with love, grief, regret, sadness, and bitterness gets revealed, and by this Miles gains a more profound understanding of himself by experiencing all these thoughts and feelings.Despite death occupying a central role as a dominant theme in the book, it is inextricably tied to life and hope on the one hand and how to die on the other one. In the frequently asked questions page of his website, Green tackles this concern by properly contextualizing the role of death in this story. Green asserts that characters conventionally die in literature at the beginning or end. However, the book’s major death (that of Alaska) happens in the middle as he intended the readers to meet and get attached to Alaska and then lose her (“Looking For Alaska FAQ — John Green”). This, he says, would enable them to follow Pudge and Colonel make and the rest of the characters make in finding healing. Through journey would allow the readers to fight off nihilism that could accompany such loss and feelings of pointlessness and find hope amidst unresolved and unresolvable grief. Although an author’s interpretation of their text is in no way superior to a reader’s, a fact Green accedes to, these remarks by the author go a long way in supporting this essay’s thesis.This essay
contends that despite the instrumental role death plays in the text, it is merely meditating. The profoundness of death provides appropriate fodder for dialogue about other life’s phenomena. This is precisely how Green uses death in the novel. For instance, readers are opened to a discussion over profound societal concerns through the death of Alaska’s mother and the subsequent procession of Alaska. For example, Dunder subjects the book to postfeminist theory analysis and feminist criticism in her study. She posits that Alaska is a “Manic Pixie Dream Girls” character that perpetuates stereotypical gender roles and, in effect helps to preserve a glorified image of the muse (1). For example, Dunder cites Green’s representation of Alaska’s body through Miles’s distraction by her “sizeable cleavage” (p 53). This, she says, was Green choosing a stereotypical representation of female traits in conformity with the patriarchy and society by depicting Alaska as hot or pretty in the eyes of Miles.Such analysis as Dunder’s became so rampant, creating a dialogue among the readers and the general public that the novel remains the most challenging novel of 2015 under the young adult category. The main concerns that occasioned a ban on the book include issues on sex and language, especially a description of oral sex performed on Miles (Coles). However, the contention surrounding the scene is not this essay’s preoccupation. Instead, such conversations that arose from the culmination of the death of a character underscore the relevance of the role death played in the text.In addition, the ephemerality of the role of
death in the text is epitomized by the renewed vigor Alaska’s death sparked in the several characters towards defining how to live or die. Alaska’s death stops time, especially for Miles, who splits events into a before and after Alaska’s death timeline. For Miles, reality only exists within two-time intervals, and the death demonstrates his love for Alaska, a girl he could never be with (Hatmoko 2). Alaska’s death Miles and his best friends are on a whole new mission, to investigate what happened if the death was Alaska’s final step towards escaping the labyrinth.The novel is set in motion by two great philosophical pursuits by Miles and Alaska. The first pursuit is Miles’s search for “the great perhaps,” while the second is Alaska’s conviction in the “labyrinth.” The story is effectively set in motion by Miles’s decision to ask his parents to send him away for his junior year in Florida. He explains his decision as his way of seeking the great perhaps, quoting 15th-century French writer Francois Rabelais. While Miles interprets Rabelais’s quote as living rather than dying, initially, in seeking the great perhaps, Rabelais referred to the mystery surrounding what awaited him after death (Kinser 34). In this phrase, Miles intertwines the concepts of life and death, objectively setting the ground for the novel’s central theme: how to live and how to die. “That’s why I’m going…So I don’t have to wait until I die to start seeking a Great Perhaps,” Miles said to his parents (Green 5). And with those words, the
story and the lives of many of the characters were set into motion.Despite this fervent display of an adventurous spirit, Miles is, to a large extent, a studious, rule-following kid. Probably, Miles frequently fell victim to bullying back in Florida, and as a result, he remained laid back, not wanting to ruffle any feathers in school. Only two kids turned up at his sendoff party, and they were not attached to him. After a suggestion from his father about Culver Creek Academy in Alabama, Miles sees this as an opportunity to find who he is, reinvent himself, and create an alternative reality. Later, Miles achieves this by coming out of the quiet kid obsessed with other people’s final words cocoon and going on to become a bold prankster who asserts his existence.At Culver Creek, Miles becomes submerged in the process of finding himself. Joining his newfound friends, the Colonel, Alaska, and Takumi, he takes up smoking and ebulliently participates in the grand schemes of pranking their classmates. Although Miles still does not play the leading role in all of these, he becomes accommodative to new possibilities. Mile character shapes up more in this process, as occasioned with indulgences in crazy drinking on the weekends with friends, spending thanksgiving over at Alaska’s, and wild days roaming empty schools. To Miles, this might have been the “Great Perhaps” he had been seeking in the first place. In his religion class, in perhaps a more critical discourse, Miles delves deeper into exploring the meaning of Rabelais’s words. In a
midterm essay, the protagonist explores the religious take on the existential concern of dying. “I finally decided that people believed in an afterlife because they couldn’t bear to,” Miles says (Green 65). Through the process of finding himself, Miles arises full consciousness about his existence and that of the reality surrounding him.Still, Alaska is struggling with charting her path and finding the meaning of existence. Simon Bolivar’s question, “how will I ever get out of this labyrinth is one of her greatest preoccupations. Alaska equates labyrinths to suffering (Green 54). Later, we are given a glimpse into her labyrinth—its root cause being her witnessing her mother’s death and the accompanying guilt for her inaction, which might as well have driven her to get out of her labyrinth. If this is so, then the net effects of her actions pose far-reaching consequences for Miles. While death offers Alaska an escape from her labyrinth, it creates a new labyrinth for Miles (Rybakova 117). Miles gets submerged in a maze of grief, for which he strives to get answers while at a happenstance avoiding confronting. Although Miles harbors intense love for Alaska, ultimately, he realizes that she gave up, whether or not her death was intentional. The overwhelming guilt Alaska harbored sentenced her to a sad life. In seeking forgiveness—for Alaska, and more importantly for himself, Miles chooses to soldier on in his pursuit of his great perhaps. From Alaska’s mistakes, Miles realizes that the uncertainty of life makes it worth living in the first place. Alaska’s death renders
a certain sense of urgency to such existential questions, especially to Miles, who stops viewing them as theoretical. Miles finally concedes to the limitless possibilities of the great perhaps, because, in some way, he believes in an afterlife. This is particularly imperative as these musings enable characters to explore the theme of how to die. Miles makes peace with mortality, a fact he claims teenagers take for granted.In exploring how to live, there is an insistence on the value of living in the present, enjoying every minute of existence rather than anticipating future happiness. While admonishing Miles for not paying attention in class, Dr. Hyde succinctly delivers this lesson by reminding him of the Buddhist belief in being present at every moment of a person’s existence (Green 50). These words resonate with Miles, who largely detaches himself from the present instead of existing in a made-up world. Miles is constantly preoccupied with finding the great perhaps this pursuit robs him of an appreciation of the present, and a realization that his much sought great perhaps permeates the existence around him. Miles’s labyrinth is in his blatant refusal of engaging with the present, despite nudging to do so from Alaska and subtle recommendations such as Dr. Hyde’s. It takes the death of Alaska for Miles to confront the present fully, a fate that leads him to a fuller appreciation of existence and an acceptance of fate.Similarly, the Colonel seems to be a victim of this malady too. Being one of the poorer students at Culver Creek, Colonel
The original concept of a Decision Support System (DSS) defined it as a computerized supporting supplement for decision-makers. It serves to gather and analyze large amounts of data to expand the capabilities but not to replace the course of the initial decision. Such a system can be easily programmed for user needs and output data in graphical form, for example, to forecast a company’s future income. Business Intelligence (BI) is a generalized term that is used to describe a combination of analytical tools, methodologies, and applications. (Sharda 2019). DSS originated from BI, but in fact, remains the most used system at the moment. Reporting plays a huge role in the use of Business Intelligence, according to which the user must determine for himself whether a particular situation deserves attention, and only then can apply analytical methods.The key difference between these two definitions is that DSS is a computerized system for obtaining information that helps make decisions in an organization or business community. At the same time, BI acts as a tool that uses various programs that help in organizing and managing data or valuable information within an organization. While DSS helps the user detect errors existing in the program and analyze information for decision-making, BI helps with automatic analysis and, therefore, gives suggestions that have only the implementation stage left. Another difference is that DSS requires more time to start implementation since the processes mostly involve manual processing. BI requires less time to complete all functions since the computer thinks for itself and therefore does not
Naturally, for me, Mexican culture is hard to define within a paragraph or even a whole essay. It is because of the wide variety of nuances, influences, and history that reaches Mesoamerican civilizations such as Mayan and Aztec. There are many manifestations of Mexican culture – in art, food, customs, values, and religion. Hence, if I were to define Mexican culture, I would say that it is a unique blend of Mesoamerican heritage mixed with European cultural influences that shaped the linguistic and religious beliefs.In general, when describing Mexican culture, one of the first things that come to mind is religion. Mexican people are very religious as some of the significant Mexican holidays are religious, such as Feast of Our Lady of Guadeloupe, which is celebrated to 12th December. Although Christianity was imposed onto Aztec and Mayan civilizations, it later became an essential part of the Mexican belief system. Spirituality and family values are also key characteristics of Mexican culture. For example, the Day of the Dead festival (1st & 2nd November) represents both of those values as it unites all families to remember and honor relatives and friends who passed away. Their souls come back to Earth; hence, families prepare unique offerings to treat their ancestors.In modern popular culture, it is easy to imagine the first associations that people have when they hear about Mexico. They probably imagine something from this list: big hats, colorful clothes, delicious food, and mariachi bands. I would select three symbols representing Mexican culture: costumes during the Day of the Dead celebration (1), Mariachi band, and Pyramid of the Moon: Teotihuacán (3).Day of the Dead celebration represents the mystical, spiritual, and family-oriented tradition, which connects living people with the dead, creating a strong bond with one’s ancestors.It is hard to imagine any holiday without a decent mariachi band. Music is a big part of Mexican culture, as it represents the passion and the spirit of the human soul.Finally, the pyramids that can be found across Mexico symbolize the connection of Mexican culture with Mesoamerican civilizations.
to overcome obstacles to help those who need support. In both universes, strength and extreme physical abilities become objects of praise and reverence. In addition, a key factor contributing to the plot of the heroes’ destinies is the presence of an enemy, on whose destruction depends the survival of the world. However, the fundamental difference is that a hero’s physical strength is not enough to admire him for modern people. This characteristic must be complemented by the purity of thought and good intentions. The hero becomes much more complex as the modern world gets more sophisticated.The fact that people still draw inspiration from old stories correlates with the tenets of postmodernist theory. According to the latter, it is necessary to constantly reproduce what has passed, make sense of it, and experiment with its content. It can be seen that stories about legendary superheroes remain relevant to contemporary viewers, readers, and audiences in general. As in Saxon times, bravery and loyalty are revered, and having these characteristics is what makes an individual a role model.
From the lecture, I discovered that the word democracy partly originates from the word demes which means the small division of the bigger sections that Athens was divided into during the ancient time. The second half of the word is the Greek word Kratos which means the rule. Similarly to modern times, democracy means the rule of the people, which implies that the citizens of a certain region’s major political decisions are delivered collectively. However, there are also two main differences between Athenian and modern democracies.The major and most palpable difference between the two systems is who was considered eligible to vote. In Athens, only adult men could influence the city’s political and administrative decisions, while women, children, and enslaved people did not have this right. Although most modern states also do not allow underage participation in the voting process, women and adults of all classes are eligible to express their civil will officially. Therefore, it can be concluded that modern democracies are generally more inclusive and representative than ancient ones.Moreover, the prevalent number of modern democracies are representative, whereas, in ancient Greece, they were direct. It means that while citizens could directly vote for proposed laws and foreign policies in the past, individuals nowadays should elect representatives who would make legislative and policy-related decisions for them. Despite the fact that the original Greek way may seem fairer and more attractive, it is necessary to consider that, nowadays, this procedure would be nearly impossible. Indeed, in Athens, for instance, only approximately 30,000 residents had voting rights, whereas today, most countries have a population that is counted in millions and even in billions of citizens. For this reason, it becomes clear that voting for each bill would be associated with tremendous temporal and monetary investments compared to a representative system.Nevertheless, in a conclusion, it can be argued that the gist of modern democracy is not different from the one in ancient Greece. The idea that postulates that people can and should be the bearers of political power still remains the same. Despite the fact that there are some differences between the old and the modern systems, they rather reflect the evolution of society than changes in the main principle of democracy.
Departing from social norms could lead to a magnitude of progress. Social practices have a way of dictating what to do and how to react to certain situations. An institution sets rules to be followed and challenging such norms is termed disobedience. Society, including media, is used to portraying the black community as a sad one so seeing them happy seems like a way out of order. Sharing black joy might seem like resistance from the social norms but will have a positive effect on the whole American society. Adam also had to disobey God to be set free from pre-human state to human. Therefore, leaving social norms can lead to many forms of progress for humans.Resisting the ruling power may seem like disobedience but can result in major human development. For the African Americans, resisting the negative norms of sadness demand sharing more joy with the black community. However, it will take more than individuals to yield positive results. The artistic and media communities need to spread black joy to change the black practice of celebrating sadness and pain. Such actions would communicate the diversity of black, the need to take space and claim their belongings. According to Roderique, sharing black joy “would create spaces of opportunity, possibility, and affirmation” (4). This quote affirms that resisting negative social norms yield positive results. Therefore, if it takes resistance to achieve progress then in this case resistance is good.Acts of disobedience, although may seem wrong at first when they set in freedom, they are assumed right. When
while submitting to the set norms. However, the moment a man challenges the rules, he is termed disobedience but then finds progress. The decision to submit or disobey is a decision to stagnate or develop.Following rules and social norms set by the community is like agreeing to the dictation of the superego. According to Fromm “Super-Ego represents the internalized commands and prohibitions of father, accepted by the son out of fear” (3). Fear is known to set boundaries and limit the abilities of people. Social norms are set to limit human abilities and it is only by separating from them that a man can prosper. If Roderique, when shared the happy post about Black Panther allowed fear to limit him, she would not have written the excerpt. She would also not have written to call for black society to publicly share the joy and break the social norm of the sad black community.Disobeying set social practices is a psychological process that must entail the willingness to sin or make a mistake. Going against such norms will be termed immoral and rebellious thus one must toughen up. People can only become free of social practices by learning to say no to power. When a man frees himself from power and is psychologically free, he or she can develop positively.
is to evaluate the relationship between nurses’ knowledge of capnography and its use in coronary care units. The project will provide valuable insight into factors affecting the use of capnography, thus contributing to the field and filling the gap in the literature. The intervention protocol will train nurses on the benefit of capnography and test their implementation in critical care units. Based on the training and testing, the goal is to facilitate the implementation of capnography use in the selected CCU. The intervention will also enable accurate tube placement to stimulate normal chest circulation during resuscitation, improve quality care delivery, and patient recovery in critical care units. The project will recruit nurses working in the selected coronary care unit in Central Jersey. This setting was chosen because of the high incidence of nurse’s refusal to use capnography during resuscitation. The project timeline is twenty-four weeks. The selected participants will be based on the inclusion criteria, and their test results will be confidential and used solely for testing nursing knowledge of capnography. This project will facilitate positive health outcomes by providing evidence to support nursing practice in implementing capnography during resuscitation.
Type 1 and Type 2 diabetes contrast based on their definitions, the causes, and the management of the conditions. Type 1 manifests through the pancreas producing little to no insulin, which is why it is essential to monitor the glucose levels in the blood (DiMeglio et al., 2018). People who are genetically predisposed are the target groups, and the condition can correlate with symptoms such as thirst, weight loss, and feelings of hunger. Type 2 diabetes occurs when the pancreas does not create enough insulin while cells do not have an adequate reaction to the insulin that is being produced (Roden & Shulman, 2019). Research shows that more than 90% of Americans with diabetes are diagnosed with Type 2, while less than 6% have Type 1 (Xu et al., 2018). Thus, lifestyle is the most critical factor in terms of prevention and treatment.Table 1: Diabetes                              Type 1 Diabetes                                                         Type 2 Diabetes

Moreover, since the gene that regulates the production of resistin is overactive in people with obesity, it is evident that a diet that can
( US Department of Health and Human Services , 2022). Multiple teas, supplements, and powders that claim to be helpful for weight loss are unethically marketed since FDA often finds unlisted ingredients such as sibutramine, which increases blood pressure ( Center for Drug Evaluation and Research , 2022). Instead of opting for uncertified supplements, effective diabetes control correlates with a lifestyle change, including frequent exercise and a healthy and balanced diet. These measures are not only effective in terms of weight loss through calorie intake reduction but also beneficial for glucose regulation.The case study presents three options, Savannah’s recommendation of following the Atkins diet, Alan’s claim that exercise and healthy eating can lead to positive results, and grandfather’s option of natural remedies. As a low-carb diet, Atkins may be effective since obesity treatment often relies on a carb reduction (Westman & Yancy, 2020). However, Alan’s recommendation of approaching the condition with a balanced overview on health based on activity and avoidance of certain foods is easier to follow and, possibly, more sustainable in the long run (Rubin & Herreid, 2003). Implementing natural remedies may be harmful since, as mentioned prior, researchers refer to the low efficacy and side effects. Thus, Morgan should maintain a healthy weight through balanced meals and higher activity levels.
The healthcare problem discussed in this assignment is diabetes mellitus, which is increasingly becoming the leading cause of disability across the world. The disease manifests itself through hyperglycemia, and it is categorized into type 1 and type 2. Type 2 diabetes is the most prevalent and it consists of close to 90% of all infections. The causes of this disease are varied, including gestation, drugs, and lifestyles. Its complications affect all body organs, leading to lethal implications. The population to be studied in this assignment majorly comprises older people with diabetes type 2 in a setting with nurse-led management.The presence of this problem is substantiated by diverse information and data from different researchers. Macido (2019) found that Diabetes mellitus is among the leading medical concerns in the United states and the world at large. The researchers used data from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, where more than 12% of older people in the US live with the condition (Macido, 2019). Additionally, a significant number of the population remain undiagnosed with diabetes mellitus. According to the American Diabetes Association (ADA) (n. d.), the issue remains the seventh cause of death and morbidity, and there are more than one million newly reported cases per year. Therefore, diabetes is chronic illness that currently strains healthcare and stakeholders.The research is relevant because there is a need to improve population/patient knowledge and adherence to management strategies. Furthermore, the study will inform caregivers on better patient approaches beyond the clinical setting. Nikitara et al. (2019) states that most patients develop
clinical responsibility. This failure creates frustration among them because it affects patient adherence to treatment.Nursing standards and policies are effective in improving the health outcomes of a patient and the overall population. They emphasize care that is shared and nurse-led to achieve the desired health results. Nursing standards focus on autonomy, which helps patients manage the disease for lifelong bases. They emphasize day-to-care management to be individually-oriented and include skin care, dietary changes, physical activity and rest, self-monitoring, consulting healthcare professionals, and adherence to medication (AADE, 2017). They have brought changes that allow them to prescribe medicine. This step improves health outcomes, apart from reducing outpatient attendance and unnecessary referrals. Nurses set policies as advanced caregivers to be involved in conducting physical examinations and provide the best practice patient treatment.
Bowel disease is a collection of disorders that includes Crohn’s disease and ulcerative colitis, which causes pain and swelling in the intestines, affecting the digestive system. The first step in treating bowel disease involves a doctor taking a careful medical history and physical examination. Numerous diagnostic tests are conducted on the patient, such as blood tests, stool samples, endoscopy, colonoscopy, and imaging studies. During blood tests, providers test patients’ blood and evaluate how well a treatment works (Fiorino et al., 2019). Blood tests include measuring hematocrit, C-reaction protein, thrombocytes, and leucocytes. A stool sample is checked for infections or inflammation, while CT and MRI scans reveal internal images of the digestive system. Health providers also perform an upper endoscopy that involves looking inside the food pipe, stomach, and ileum and collecting biopsies for examination. A colonoscopy helps reveal infections in the rectum and it is done using a thin, flexible tube fitted with a light and camera lens at the end to allow examination of the inside large intestine.Bowel disease is a lifelong condition; therefore, the primary goal for its management is always to find ways to keep it in remission as long as possible so that the patient experiences few to no symptoms. There are various treatment and maintenance approaches for bowel disease, such as dietary changes and medications like biologics, immunomodulators, and aminosalicylates (Fiorino et al., 2019). There has been increased study on nutritional interventions for improving inflammation and helping control symptoms. Dieticians play a crucial role in designing a balanced nutrition program for patients to assist in the alleviation of symptoms.Aminosalicylates are aspirin-like maintenance medications such as balsalazide, sulfasalazine, and mesalamine that alleviate inflammation at the intestinal wall. Mainly these medications are used for the treatment of ulcerative colitis in mild-to-moderate form and sometimes in Crohn’s disease. Immunomodulators work by decreasing immune system activities, and the most commonly used are methotrexate, azathioprine, and 6-mercaptopurine. Biologics work by blocking inflammatory chemicals in the blood and reducing the number of immune system cells in the patient body. These medications are used when a patient does not respond to other medicines or experiences side effects from such treatments. In most cases, biologic medicines are given through infusions or injections and include Entyvio, Sterlara, Simponi, Humira, and Remicade.
The United States has a controversial history of dietary habits that are not determined as the healthiest ones. A separate topic on this matter is fast-food and its popularity among all age groups of the population. This amount of cholesterol and sugar has negative consequences for the body and has to be significantly reconsidered together with the number of vegetables and grains averagely consumed.Hot dogs and donuts on the go have become the norm for always rushing people. A 2004 US Eating Habit Survey found that about 75% of meals were from fast-food cafes (Hellas and Calder). Almost half of the ordered items were hamburgers, and about a third of them included sodas. Americans continue to consume about 20% of their daily calories in the form of hard-to-digest sugars like sodas (Hellas and Calder). All this negatively impacts well-being and leads to many severe issues like obesity.Healthy eating habits are incomprehensible without an adequate intake of vegetables. However, the consumption of vegetables is low: only 13% consumes the recommended amounts. Potatoes and tomatoes only make up 39% of the vegetables consumed by Americans (Hellas and Calder). According to statistics, boys aged 9 to 13 and girls aged 14 to 18 consume even fewer vegetables (Hellas and Calder). This topic demands to be discussed since it affects the nutrition of children and teenagers.The same questions arise when analyzing the consuming grain products. Whole grains should make more than half of total grain consumption, but 85.3% of the grain comes from refined products (Hellas and Calder). Refining grain
sugar, which cause even more harm to the body (Niland and Cash). Every decision to consume or refuse any food item should be well-founded and supported by relevant scientific evidence.On the other hand, food is increasingly becoming a matter of choice. A variety of goods and services are freely available; there are stores with organic food and diet centers where specialists help with habits regulation. There are still many concerns demanding detailed study, but a person with a focus on a healthy lifestyle can get help in this direction.The mentioned reasons serve as a warning about the severe eating habits violation. It is essential to take this topic thoughtfully and educate people. Comprehensive educational work has a high potential to improve the awareness and well-being of the entire nation. It is also necessary to monitor the financial availability of good quality products through market analysis and extensive surveys.
The modern culture of food consumption is very diverse, and there are many recommendations and prohibitions from different social groups. Sometimes food intake becomes part of a large-scale and widespread subculture, distinguished by a particular worldview. One of the most essential regulators of eating meat was religion. Now religion is not able to control most of the society and their food addictions. Sometimes the refusal to eat meat is due to some medical factors, for example, a previous surgery. Meat is heavy food, and it is vital to cook it the right way, using steam, and not fat and oil. Modern society provides a variety of reasons for grass-eaters to stick to their position. The noticeable difference between grass-eaters and meat-eaters is in the diet and sometimes in the way of life. In addition, these people have different medical conditions and often have different medical histories and risks.Grass-eaters do not eat meat, no matter how it is cooked. Sometimes they consume dairy products or eggs, especially if they understand that their bodies will weaken without animal fats. The severity of the herb-eater’s diet can vary based on health, lifestyle, age. Some grass-eaters fit their dietary habits into their lifestyle and eventually give up wearing leather and silk clothing. It is a strict option in which the grass-eater must adhere to a clear ideology (de Boer et al., 2017). In turn, if meat eaters have bans on consuming specific meat (Muslims do not eat pork for religious reasons), then the prohibitions are due to personal reasons and
IntroductionThe revolution in cooking has resulted in a huge evolution of cooking techniques. Cooking has been practiced throughout history since ancient times. Previously, an ancient man consumed only raw food; nevertheless, once, a piece of flesh fell into the fire and was roasted (Harold 6). The man ate the portion and declared it delicious. Thus, the cooking process began and evolved. Cooking food is critical because it facilitates digestion, enhances the appearance, flavor, color, texture. In addition, cooking adds taste of the food diversity to the meal, thus the food stays fresher and lasts longer.Cooking also requires an understanding of products and equipment and the ability to plan and organize meal preparation within time limits. Not to mention that traditional cooking techniques are more superior and healthier than newer ones such as microwave cooking (Harold 4). There are numerous cooking techniques such as boiling and steaming, the majority of which date back to ancient. Microwaving is a more recent innovation (Harold 784). Various methods employ varying degrees of heat and moisture and require varying amounts of time to cook. The method used significantly impacts the overall result, as certain foods are more suited to certain processes than others.Cooking TechniquesCooking is the art of preparing food for consumption, most typically by the use of heat. Cooking techniques and ingredients vary significantly across the globe, reflecting distinct climatic zones, economic conditions, cultural traditions, and trends (Harold 777). Cooking techniques also vary according to an individual’s skill level and type of training. Conduction, convection, and radiation all contribute to
the transfer of heat to the food during cooking (Harold 782). The method of cooking is determined by the way heat is applied to the meal. Certain foods, such as leafy greens such as spinach and fenugreek, contain high moisture. These foods are prepared in a way that takes advantage of this moisture. However, rice, wheat, and pulses have a low moisture content; they are cooked with more water (moisture) (Mwale et al. 1056). There are additional methods of cooking that do not require any water; in fact, these methods assist the food to remain crisp after completion. As a result, cooking techniques are classed as either moist heat, dry heat, or frying.Classification of Cooking MethodsCooking by Moist HeatMoist-heat cooking refers to cooking that uses watery substances as the primary cooking medium. The liquid is used for cooking food in moist heat (Bernhardt, Simone, and Elmar 328). The medium used during moist cooking include coconut cream, water or oil. Usually, the above liquids are included in cooked food or heated before the addition is done. Moist-heat cooking involves cooking at a lower temperature, often between 140 and 212 degrees Fahrenheit (which is, of course, the point at which water boils) (Lobefaro et al. 100381). In this research, we will discuss steaming, blanching, and boiling, as braising and poaching are often utilized for meat and fish preparation. This method includes submerging meals in boiling liquid or exposing them to steam to cook them. This highlights the food’s natural flavor and aroma. It is critical to understand the
many forms of moist cooking to determine the most appropriate approach for a particular dish. Steaming, boiling, blanching, simmering, and poaching are all moist-heat cooking methods.Cooking by Dry HeatDry heat cooking methods do not require the use of water to cook the meal. The meal is let to dry and then cooked using heat. In order for food to cook, it must either be heated in its juice or heated in a liquid that was added to it during cooking and evaporated, cooking the food. In fact, dry-heat cooking refers to any method of cooking that uses hot air, hot metal, a flame, or hot fat to transport heat to the meal without the need for moisture. Fat is an excellent medium for cooking on low heat (Mwale et al. 1056). At first, glance, because the fat in a deep fryer is liquid, it appears to be moist-heat cooking. Bear in mind that dry-heat cooking brown foods, whereas moist-heat cooking does not. As a result, it’s easy to see why fat is considered a dry-heat method, as dishes cooked in fat drippings turn golden and crispy when prepared correctly.Broiling, baking, roasting, grilling, pan-broiling, griddling, sautéing, pan-frying, and deep-frying is examples of dry-heat cooking methods. The ideal meats for dry cooking are extremely soft, have little connective tissue, and be served medium-rare.Moist Heat Cooking TechniquesBraising and StewingSearing or sautéing the food before partially covering it with liquid and simmering at a moderate temperature is the first step in braising. With braising, food cooks more evenly because heat
is uniformly distributed throughout the pot, making it possible to cook it on the stovetop or in an oven (Mwale et al. 1056). Briskets from older animals or those with a larger percentage of connective tissue might benefit from being braise-cooked. The procedure is more widely utilized in current food preparation methods than in traditional ways. Braising technique is commonly used to cook modern foods as they require uniform distribution of heat.PoachingIn poaching, food is immersed in a liquid such as wine, stock, or water and cooked at a low temperature. Poaching is distinguished from other “wet heat” cooking techniques, such as simmering and boiling, by its low temperature (about 160–180 °F (71–82 °C)) (Mwale et al. 1056). This temperature range is ideal for delicate foods like eggs, poultry, fish, and fruit, which can easily fall apart or dry out when cooked in other ways. Poaching is frequently seen as a healthy cooking method due to the absence of fat in the cooking and flavoring process (Roncero-Ramos et al. 294). Poaching is a simple way of cooking that requires no extra equipment and so saves fuel. Poached foods are easily digestible due to the absence of fat.SimmeringSimmering is a cooking method in which food is cooked at temperatures between 180°F and 205°F. When a chef looks at the water, he or she will see bubbles forming and slowly rising to the top, but the water is not yet boiling over. Simmered food cooks pretty evenly since it is surrounded by water that keeps a reasonably constant
temperature (Harold 784). It is the classic method for making stocks and soups, as well as starchy foods like potatoes or pasta dishes. The downside of simmering is that it leaches vitamins and other nutrients from the food into the cooking liquid. It is a fantastic choice for a variety of culinary preparations, including as stocks or soups, starchy things like potatoes or pasta, and many more. One disadvantage of this method of cooking is that it might lead the food to lose vitamins due to high temperatures of cooking involved.SteamingSteaming is a cooking method that involves exposing food to steam in a pressured steam cooker or heating it in a securely covered pan or other container. When cooking delicate foods like veggies, steaming is best. The cover of the pan traps the steam, creating a hot, moist atmosphere in which the food may cook. Steaming is not only wonderful for light meals like steamed pieces of bread, but it also helps maintain nutrients. When water is heated over 212°F, it ceases to be water and becomes steam (Harold 785). Steaming is quite gentle in physical agitation, making it perfect for preparing shellfish and other delicate things.Additionally, it offers the significance of cooking faster while reducing nutrient loss that may be caused by high temperature ranges. Interestingly, like water, steam has a maximum temperature of 212°F (Roncero-Ramos et al. 290). Unlike water, however, steam can be compelled to surpass this natural temperature limit through the use of pressurization (Harold 786). When the pressure is increased, the
steam grows hotter with time. However, since cooking with pressured steam needs specialized equipment, the ordinary home chef would not use it. The steps involved in steaming include:  * In the bottom section of a steamer, let the water boil.  * Arrange veggies in a steamer or perforated pan large enough to fit on top of a double boiler.  * Lid and steam until the vegetables are soft. Leave the lid slightly ajar if the vegetables are green to help keep their color.Dry heat cooking methodRoasting and BakingWhile roasting is comparable to baking, the technique is more commonly associated with meat and poultry. Roasting food is usually doused in oil or other fluids to prevent it from drying out during cooking as opposed to baking. Roasting and baking are virtually synonymous. Both terms refer to a method of cooking an item by surrounding it in hot, dry air, typically inside an oven at temperatures of at least 300°F (but often much hotter) (Harold 784). This method cooks food pretty evenly, as all of the food’s surfaces are exposed to approximately the same amount of heat. This is in contrast to pan-searing, in which the surface that comes into contact with the hot pan becomes significantly hotter than the side that faces up.Both roasting and baking require that the food is cooked uncovered so that the heat is provided by hot, dry air rather than steam from the food. Despite these similarities, roasting and baking might signify slightly different things to different people (Lobefaro
et al. 100381). Certain chefs reserve the term “baking” for bread, pastry, and other bakery dishes. Some people use the phrase “roasting” exclusively to refer to meats, poultry, and vegetables, but “baking” refers to fish and other seafood (Harold 784). Another contrast is possible in terms of temperature, with “roasting,” meaning increased heat and thus a more rapid and dramatic browning.Broiling and GrillingBroiling is a way of cooking that is very similar to grilling but is done in the oven. Broiling is the process of bringing food very close to an intense heat source to cook it quickly at a high temperature. Broiling is another type of dry-heat cooking that relies on heat conduction via the air (Harold 783). Broiling, similar to grilling, can also be done in the oven as a low-fat, direct-heat cooking method. Due to the fact that air is a poor conductor of heat, broiling and grilling require the food to be extremely close to the heat source, which is most frequently an open flame. Grilling is a quick and healthful form of cooking that preserves vitamins and minerals. As a result, the food’s surface cooks quickly, making this cooking method suitable for chicken, fish, and tender pieces of meat.Essentially, because this way of cooking is exceedingly hot and dry, it is normal to marinade foods that will be broiled or grilled. Usually, there is one crucial difference between broiling and grilling: grilling entails heating the meal below, and broiling requires heating the food from above (Harold 783). In both circumstances, the
food is normally flipped once while cooking, and a grid or grate of some form is utilized to impart the distinctive grill marks characteristic of this cooking method. As with sautéing, preheating the broiler or grill prior to placing the food on it is crucial.Deep-FryingAnother common form of cooking is the deep-fat frying technique. As strange as it may sound, deep frying is not a moist-heat approach but a dry-heat method. The temperature difference between deep frying and boiling is significant. Boiling water temperatures must never exceed 100C (212F), although deep frying temps can reach 200C. (400F) (Harold 784). These high temperatures enable the product to cook more quickly and to brown. Because deep-frying entails completely immersing the meal in hot, liquid oil, it may take some time to adjust to the fact that it is essentially a sort of dry-heat cooking (Harold 786). However, if one has ever witnessed the dramatic reaction of heated oil to even a tiny drop of water, they know that oil and water are opposed. The chef should ensure that anything they set in the hot fat is completely dry to avoid this. This may require patting an object dry with a paper towel prior to cooking.Deep-frying needs maintaining an oil temperature of 325°F to 400°F. If the oil gets any hotter than that, it may begin to smoke, and if it gets any cooler, it begins to seep into the food, causing it to get greasy. Deep-fried products should have very little oil on them after cooking, providing they
steak, pork chops, or fish fillets. Pan-frying demands a lower heat to prevent the exterior of the dish from overcooking before the interior reaches the right temperature, and it can help retain moisture in foods (Harold 786). The same amount of oil as in a sauté – just enough to coat the pan – is used in a pan fry, but the temperature should be reduced. The oil should constantly be heated enough to allow steam to escape from the food. Steam’s power prevents the oil from soaking into the meal.ConclusionIn conclusion, there are various cooking techniques categorized as either moist cooking or dry cooking techniques. In a review, the paper has demonstrated that moist cooking techniques include steaming, boiling, blanching, simmering, and poaching. Moist-heat cooking involves cooking at a lower temperature, often between 140 and 212 degrees Fahrenheit (which is, of course, the point at which water boils). On the other hand, dry cooking techniques entail broiling, baking, roasting, grilling, pan-broiling, griddling, sautéing, pan-frying, and deep-frying are all examples of dry-heat cooking methods. The ideal meats for dry cooking are extremely soft, have little connective tissue, and be served medium-rare.
The differential association theory was developed in 1939 by the veteran sociologist Edwin Sutherland. The study explains how prohibited manners master’s in social establishments can lead to criminology. Multiple people grasp the mindsets, methods, and justifications for illegal techniques by interacting with different persons. According to Lokanan (2018), people can minimize fraud-related cases by understanding the theory to maneuver positive results in the organizations such as schools. Students in high school interact with distinct people who possess offensive habits, and misconducts occur during this period.During my high school period, my classmates and other senior students abused drugs that caused a severe threat to their health. The use of alcohol and cocaine was considered a crucial practice by most cliques since they could access the drugs from the drug vendors in the nearest town. The drug dealers used to visit the school frequently to sell drugs to the addicted students within the school environment. Throughout my school experience, addictive students would rush to bathrooms to smoke, inject cocaine, and consume alcohol repeatedly. The actions arose since the learners’ parents could offer finances to the students hence, they could access the drugs.Drug abuse can lead to negative consequences such as low educational attainment, well-being problems such as brain disorders, and crime in society. The substance-induced in the body changes the brain functions through repeated use which determines the person’s genetic constituents (Fernàndez-Castillo et al., 2021). Drugs such as cocaine have enormous influences on individuals’ life and, and if overdosed, death can occur. Some individuals are better genetically sensitive
raise drug misuse. The study shows that multiple youths do not possess felony patterns in their adult life.The theory illustrates that forty percent of people below 21 years old execute offenses in society. In addition, another feature such as growing up in a poor environment can lead to criminal behavior because of poverty or lack of necessities. Sutherlands argues that factors such as moral reasoning and freedom can control the intention of the people indulging in crimes (Brookes, 2021). Parents should ensure their children have the basic needs by engaging them in school-based education and non-curriculum activities such as games to avoid misconduct.The approach explains how people should understand the purpose of declining fraud in the social domains. The utilization of the material is a crucial source to curb the behavior and improve the student’s performance by offering health education. Parents and tutors should play their roles effectively by taking actions such as punishing the learners who bully others or commit offenses during their high school life. Culture has also influenced young people to join organized syndicates where many young individuals have lost their lives. It is critical to educate the youths about the consequences of the breach and drug misuse to minimize the demeanor in society. Education can support youthful people to gain motivation by acquiring proper skills during school life and making reasonable decisions.
There are multiple factors that stand behind the successful implementation of the P-O-L-C framework. It is important to prioritize some of them duly in case a company faces serious issues, or when the market indicates upcoming challenges. The collapse of WorldCom in 2002, that led to one of the largest accounting scandals in the US, provides a nice example of the lack of proper communication in a corporation. The inability of various top managers and accountants to communicate efficiently in order to prevent frauds is always disastrous.WorldCom grew rapidly under Bernard Ebbers who managed to jump at the multiple opportunities that the growing interest for telecom services provided at that time. Nevertheless, the company went bankrupt in a matter of a few years. Moreover, Ebbers faced several charges, including one count of conspiracy, one count of securities fraud and seven counts of filing false statements with securities regulators. The fact that the large portion of Ebber’s wealth was in WorldCom stocks, let alone several loans and loan guarantees from the company, was also scrutinized.The top managers of the company faced numerous charges and started to testify against each other. Moreover, Ebbers and his subordinates alike claimed to know nothing of the fraudulent schemes. According to Knecht (2020), up to 80% of employees generally believe that their opinions are not taken into account. Therefore, the major factor that led to the collapse of the telecom giant was the diminished quality of communication within the company.The reasons for all the misunderstanding and complicated series of negotiations between Ebbers, directors and accountants are rooted in barriers to communication that include motive distortion and extreme self-absorption. The top managers and professionals who were expected to lead the company tended to prioritize their own interests and receive only the parts of information and data that was convenient to them. Thus, the atmosphere created by such an attitude eventually led to the collapse of the corporation, as a result of the lack of decently organized teamwork.
Digital forensics tools are highly popular among digital investigators, as they allow easily conducting of the necessary technical analyses. One of the most famous software programs for digital forensics is Autopsy, a toolkit that examines the images present on a device’s hard drive. Capable of interacting with personal computers and smartphones, Autopsy is highly versatile and contains several functions for properly investigating the image files present on the storage unit ( Autopsy , n.d.). Specifically, Autopsy allows viewing graphical information stored on the device, searching the repository for specific items, or extracting the data ( Autopsy , n.d.). Although this software is distributed freely, it remains an excellent tool for forensic analysis and is continuously updated to follow technological advances.Some digital forensics software is incredibly specific, created to examine a particular system. As such, Arsenal Recon is an instrument constructed to explore the Windows operating system and its registry, thus accessing information about the device’s configuration specifics. Considering that a Windows registry contains a vast amount of information about the applications installed and data processed, Arsenal Recon can be extremely valuable when conducting a digital forensic investigation ( Arsenal Recon , n.d.). However, this software is produced commercially, it cannot be obtained free of charge, and $65 a month or $756 a year must be paid to receive access.Finally, unique programs are required when working with a smartphone system. Cellebrite UFED is one of the methods used to retrieve data from various types of mobile devices, primarily modern-day smartphones that have distinct operating systems ( Cellebrite UFED , n.d.). In light of this evidence, Cellebrite UFED possesses a range of functions to remove the phone’s security measures, and access the information stored in the internal storage or on external cards ( Cellebrite UFED , n.d.). Nevertheless, the software can only be purchased for particular purposes, with prices starting at $2499.
SummaryAs a result of numerous socio-cultural and scientific revolutions that took place throughout the 20th century, the attitude towards many social groups was revised by the collective majority. In the process of social revolution, the scientific community coined the word “marginalized” groups to describe people who do not fit into the standard perception of the normalized American. These people are devoid of the social benefits that are implied to be inalienable to ordinary citizens. The disadvantaged as a category can include various social groups that are distinguished according to different characteristics, such as race, gender, sexual orientation, or disability. The same and unifying principle for these groups is their relationship with the surrounding society, in which they are deprived of the basic conditions that are considered necessary for a comfortable existence. This is due to their opposition to the mainstream of American society, as a result of which disadvantaged groups are in the position of a minority, suppressed by the systemic reality of the collective majority. Having considered two different social groups that fit this characteristic, it becomes possible not only to trace the history of changes in the political and cultural landscape but also to critically comprehend it.LGBTQ+ Rights: a HistoryThe struggle for homosexuals and transgender for the right to express is long enough and can officially date back to the founding of the Human Rights Society, one of the oldest human rights organizations in America. This society was the first to openly support people with non-normative sexual orientations, and their book Friendship and Freedom
was the first publication for homosexuals. Due to prolonged legislative pressure, this society was soon disbanded, but its appearance marked the beginning of the legal history of gay activism. This historical example seems indicative of demonstrating the pressure of the prevailing social forces over the groups marginalized by it. Subsequently, the fight against homosexuals was at the official level after the end of the post-war restoration (Portmann, 2018). During that time, thousands of people were fired from their jobs in government or military service. This was done because homosexuality was categorized as a mental illness that distorts the stable functioning of the psyche.LGBTQ+ Struggle for Rights NowMore recently, in America, LGBT + activism continues to bear fruit, seeking to neutralize the attitude of the social majority towards their representatives. The empowerment of the transgender community deserves a separate mention here since, at the moment, the normative restrictions that exclude transgender people from a number of social practices are really neutralized. Toilet visits consistent with gender identity have become a separate issue here, as the Obama administration’s rule was overturned by the next President, Donald Trump. For four years, a schoolboy suffering from gender dysphoria Gavin Grimm fought the court for the right to visit the women’s toilet and won the case in 2020 (Meyer & Keenan, 2017). This example is illustrative to demonstrate how the concept of gender identity overcomes the limitations posed by normative representations of sex. This year, President Biden allowed transgender military personnel to join the army, stating that every qualified American can
fulfill a duty to a country.Native American Populations: an OverviewNative American populations experienced an unthinkable number of acts of oppression and violence throughout the 19th century and beyond. Historically, following President Jackson’s decree, the forced relocation of tens of thousands of Indians resulted in a staggering number of deaths. Genocide or ethnic cleansing has led to the murder of over 50 million indigenous people in America over the course of a century (Hackel, 2017). To this day, Native Americans are a socially vulnerable group of the American population since a complete reparation of the damage caused to these people seems to be still impossible.Indigenous Populations’ Rights TodayThe main problem that Native Americans face in modern society is their primordially distorted and biased cultural perception of them. Indians in modern society are exoticized, considered different, and in this regard, they distance themselves from the mainstream of American society. The answer to this misunderstanding may be the spread of cultural knowledge that would destroy stereotypes. Only by educating others, who usually voluntarily abandon new knowledge in the name of a stereotype, will it be possible to overcome prejudice against the indigenous population of America. The Native American Rights Foundation is a prime example of a Native American rights organization that preserves not only their culture but also their tribal natural resources.Patriarchy and HomophobiaThe concept of patriarchy implies that in the system of social order, it is men who determine the organization and arrangement of society. In it, males have the highest authority and social privileges, being in a
Modern city planning studies how people interact with elements of the urban environment and each other. It seeks to determine what a city should be and meet the needs of its inhabitants. The city structure is widely dependent on external factors such as weather conditions, global diseases, and others. The question for urbanists following the results of the coronavirus epidemic is how to make the city resistant to quarantine. The emerging demand conditions the importance of the topic for improving city planning procedures in terms of the pandemic of COVID-19 that hit all major world cities (Kakderi, Oikonomaki, & Papadaki, 2021). Hence, it is vital to elaborate new strategies for more resilient urban design.There is no environment that would guarantee against infection with the virus. It is essential to imagine how the population moves around the city in urban planning – this is also one of the pandemic lessons. Approximately 95 percent of all cases of COVID-19 in the first months of the spread of infection occurred in cities (Batty, 2020). The pandemic has impoverished another 120 million people, and the quality of life worldwide has declined by 23 percent (Pineda & Corburn, 2020). Throughout the pandemic, local authorities have been responsible for quickly and decisively creating a barrier to the virus. In many places, municipal authorities have coped with this task with honor. People who live without basic amenities become infected more easily and transmit the virus to others (Kakderi et al., 2021). Therefore, it is imperative to create everyday living conditions for citizens, and
for this, it is necessary to fight inequality.Numerous megacities decided to impose restrictions by shutting down restaurants, malls, and other public facilities. In addition, the authorities demanded isolation, which, it seemed, was not an ideal means of fighting infections (Pineda & Corburn, 2020). In order to keep people from social contact, propaganda had to explain that a person is not a friend to a person but a threat to health. On the other hand, public transport could not have been excluded from the proper city functioning. Meanwhile, many cities have relied on a culture of interaction by introducing masks, social distancing, and vaccinations. Citizens’ self-organization, which was highly supported by local authorities, was perhaps the most effective policy in the fight against the pandemic.Regardless of the measures undertaken, the urban areas have undergone drastic changes since the beginning of the coronavirus epidemic. Numerous businesses went bankrupt and shut down, emptying the streets. What is more, one-fifth of the population moved out to countryside areas seeking more isolation and protection (Pineda & Corburn, 2020). However, there is a positive outcome, too – the city roads have become less congested and contaminated because citizens stopped going out every day.Even though it is impossible to completely re-plan the city for emergencies, it is necessary to introduce measures to mitigate the probable consequences of a pandemic. For instance, it is worth creating multifunctional residential quarters where all the essential services are within walking distance (Batty, 2020). This strategy will prevent residents from visiting crowded facilities and spreading the virus. Experts
for simultaneously reducing the concentration of individuals in the same place.Ultimately, the interaction between representatives of governments, civil society, and the private sector within the framework of a new social contract would be the most successful initiative. Such a contract should provide for the financing of citizens’ basic income, universal medical care, and affordable housing. This strategy could help the vulnerable groups of the population primarily. In case they do not have lodgings, they will be forced to reside in the streets, which can contribute to a broader spread of infection. Hence, this policy is aimed at protecting public health.In summary, urban planning can be significantly affected by the surge of a pandemic and destroy the infrastructure. Despite the impossibility of preparing the cities for the rise of pandemics, it is still vital to introduce the security measure to be undertaken in case of emergency. This policy should be aimed at reducing the number of people staying in the same place at the same time. In general, the world’s big cities have learned great lessons from the COVID-19 pandemic.
Nowadays, there is a rapid development of technologies in many spectra of human life. Modern developments’ main task is making a man’s life convenient and safe. However, it is also essential to remember the impact of human life on nature and the environment. Thus, the development of electronic vehicles provides additional comfort for movement and positively affects the environment. With the evolution of industry and traffic systems, one should understand that human influence on nature has become destructive. It is primarily due to the consequences of the development of transportation, especially cars, which has become a cause for concern and elaboration of alternatives. In particular, electric vehicles are gaining popularity as a replacement for internal combustion engines. Electric cars are better for the future due to the absence of negative impact on the environment since not have harmful substances emission.Carbon dioxide emissions, the main reason for which is the widespread use of vehicles with internal combustion engines, have a negative impact on the environment. It is formulated not only by air pollution but also by the destructive effect on the atmosphere. In turn, it has an effect on the climate, namely on the increase in average temperature, since the layers of the atmosphere have a protective function. Thus, the technologies of electric vehicles are essential to the automotive industry and the user due to better fuel economy and positive environmental impact (Mi and Masrur 11). In other words, electric cars will save humanity from the threats of warming-related cataclysms and help in the economic aspect. Electric
cars reduce fuel consumption, which will positively impact the exhaustive energy sources issue.The main argument for the necessity to replace cars with internal combustion engines with electric ones is the degree of influence of vehicles on the environment. Moreover, one should consider the number of engines and other types of vehicles: buses, trucks, and tractors. Passenger cars rank first in terms of the number of units used, respectively, having the most significant impact. In addition, passenger cars are ahead of other types of transport in terms of quantity, namely, airplanes, ships, and rail transport. Although passenger cars are used in most cases for trips up to 200 kilometers, they still have a significant degree of negative impact. It is stated by the fact that the number of simultaneously used units is large, which leads to the accumulation of emissions.Fig. 1. Chart Demonstrating Emission Degree in EUAll modes of transport, except for road transport, have lower carbon dioxide emissions, and the smallest share goes to rail transport. As can be seen in Figure 1, road transportation has 72% of overall emissions, and 60,7% goes to automobiles (See Fig. 1 above) (MLA 8th, 3). One may also notice that water and air transport have a fairly high share of emissions, although less compared to road transport. Thus, one may identify that replacing internal combustion engines with electric ones will significantly improve the situation.In regards to car-related issues, one should consider the long-term implications and results. It includes two aspects: the impact on the environment and the use of
natural resources. In recent years there has been a significant increase in oil extraction (Vilches and Jonatan 164). This is primarily due to the increased demand for gasoline extracted from oil. In turn, it is connected with the growth in the number of cars, especially personal ones. In other words, one may notice that the existing indicators showing the degree of negative impact on the environment may increase. Thus, the prospect of switching to electric engines, at least in passenger cars, is an effective way to solve the problem in the long term. At the same time, it will affect the two above-mentioned aspects, namely the impact on nature and the problem of using resources.Electric cars have another advantage in terms of consumables, energy savings, and machine functionality. It was possible to identify that the technologies of the interaction of mechanisms in electric cars, which reduce the degree of friction, could reduce energy losses by 18-40% (Holmberg and Erdemir 2). It is connected with the principle of operation of electric cars, namely the reduction of the pistons and levers quality, which wear out quickly in usual cars. In turn, applying electricity will reduce emissions and resource utilization for the construction of these parts.It was also possible to establish the advantage of electric cars in terms of carbon dioxide emissions compared to conventional cars. In combustion engine cars, the CO2 emission is 4.5 higher compared to electric cars (Holmberg and Erdemir 3). One may notice that the degree of difference is significant, considering the number and degree
of modern vehicles usage. Moreover, the electricity used to charge electric cars may come only from inexhaustible sources of energy in the future. Green energy, or energy produced with the help of natural forces, cancels the impact on the number of existing resources. It includes energy from wind, water, ebb and flow, sunlight, as well as geothermal energy, which is obtained using geothermal sources.Moreover, nowadays one has some outlines of switching to electricity not only in cars. Electric vehicle technology is applicable for locomotives, off-road vehicles (construction and mining vehicles), ships, and to some extent to, aircraft (Mi and Masrur 13). Certainly, it is necessary to apply technologies that are not yet available to people for such developments. However, it will be possible in the future, which in turn would entail a revolution in the context of energy use. Additionally, one will significantly improve the condition of the environment due to the fact that the number of emissions will approach zero. It would solve the climate issues and improve the air condition, which would positively affect the health of the population and flora and fauna. In other words, the use of electric transport has local and general long-term advantages.The application of electric engines will reduce the need to process materials and transport them to extract fuel and gasoline. Similar to burning gasoline in car engines, the refining oil process emits carbon dioxide. Moreover, a significant amount of pollution of the world’s oceans was provoked by waste from oil refining and accidents during the transportation of oil
much time to be resolved, my contributions do not necessarily promote rapid consensus achievement. Secondly, the tool uses effective questions to measure the respondent’s abilities since it recognizes the influences of experiences and attitudes towards conflicts on one’s capability instead of reducing it to the presence of formal training. With that in mind, I would assess the questionnaire positively.Finally, personal SWOT analysis is another useful tool for self-assessment. Some strengths peculiar to conflict management include my rather strong self-control skills, empathy, and experiences in communicating with culturally and socially diverse populations. However, the fear of open and aggressive confrontation can be considered as a weakness that might reduce my effectiveness in asserting my interests. The ability to observe more experienced negotiators in the workplace is the key opportunity that could support my self-improvement efforts, but it might involve the threat of adopting methods that only possess situational effectiveness. Based on the SWOT analysis, I have a moderate willingness to confront conflicts.
BackgroundWhile appearing to be simple stories about Damsels in distress, fairy tales are full of hidden messages that impact children’s perception of reality and influence their social relationships. Even though many fairy tales have been revised and rewritten over the years, they often remained their archaic and dichotomous worldviews, expressing discriminating gender roles and social norms, reinforced and propagated through a system of reward and punishment. Even in a more global and liberal world, the underlying values of these fairy tales continue to affect children, often unconsciously, for the rest of their lives. This research will explore several fairy tales, written by the Grimm Brothers, such as Cinderella, Snow White, and Briar Rose (Sleeping Beauty) that express, especially controversial social norms and gender roles. Through classroom discussions and performances children reevaluate meanings, scrutinize stereotypes and opinions they may have formed prematurely after first reading the fairy tales. While critical thinking is often considered as a product of education, age, and experience, this research shows that critical thinking is a skill that can be encouraged and actively reinforced at a young age already. The benefits of fostering and implementing critical thinking in young children in the context of fairy tales is especially crucial as critical thinking helps mitigate the strong influence of these fairy tales on the personalities of young children.Research QuestionsThis research aims to find answers to the following questions: 1. How do particular Grimms’ fairy tales affect children’s perception of reality? 2. Can we develop critical thinking in children by, for example, engaging the fairy
tale context critically through reading, analyzing, reenacting (role play), and discussing it with them? 3. After increasing children’s critical thinking, can we note changes in their judgments concerning social norms 4. What are the issues, thoughts, or ideas that children mention concerning their perceptions of social norms within studied fairy tales?Significance of the StudyIn an era where children are exposed to a vast amount of information, often receiving conflicting messages, fostering critical thinking at a young age becomes especially imperative. Critical thinking skills help students acknowledge different perspectives and sources of information and so making them more compassionate towards other people’s opinions. Moreover, to be able to scan sources critically helps students evaluate content, potentially protect them from manipulation. The benefits of thinking independently, reflectively, and innovatively that come with critical thinking are enormous. Most of all cultivating critical thinking helps students in their development as well-rounded human beings, able to make responsible and mature choices in life.Literature ReviewFairy talesFairy tales are defined as “traditional stories written for children that usually involves imaginary creatures and magic” (Cambridge dictionary). They are ordinarily meant for children and are characterized by extraordinary and grotesque elements such as wizards, goblins, elves, as well as nixies. The term “fairy” refers to the magical and fanciful setting of these tales. The term does not refer to the fairy character that a particular story presents. “Fairy tales are important pieces of children’s literature that have had a lasting impact on our society” (Nanda, 2104, 1). Fairy stories often refer to folk tales that
had been transferred from one generation to the next through story telling before being published in journals, chronicles or books.The Grimm BrothersThe Two early nineteenth century German authors, Jacob Ludwig Carl Grimm and Wilhelm Carl Grimm, collected fairy tales in what is usually called Grimm’s Fairy Tales , including Hansel and Gretel, Little Red Riding Hood, Rumpelstiltskin, Snow White, The Seven Dwarfs, and many others. According to Zipes (2015, 115), the early stories gathered by the Grimm Brothers are abrupt, rude, ridiculous, funny, and sad and the Grimms brothers never intended that they would be read aloud to youngsters. The stories are about children and families and how they dealt with challenging circumstances. The Grimms believed that the stories and morals came organically from the German people through an oral tradition, and they sought to preserve them before the tales were lost forever. The Grimms made a distinctive contribution to folklore by collecting the tales. The Grimms intended to pass down oral tales to the German people, not expecting that these tales would become relevant in other cultures as well. Although Zipes (2015, 114) states that the narratives can be regarded as part of the German nationalist movement in the 19th century, they are also connected to stories from many other nations.Critical ThinkingCritical thinking, among others, helps students understand different perspectives and imagine life situations from different point of views. The ability to think critically reflectively facilitates forming judgments individually, responsibly and more ethically, which has implications for many aspects in our lives, including decisions making.
According to Florea and Hurjui (2015), critical thinking refers to fact examination in order to reach a conclusion or form a judgment. In other words, it is an essential skill that enhances learning during the early stages of life. According to the actual educational situation (static environment) and the development stage of critical thinking (dynamic environment), early learning exercises and participation activities are developed (Florea & Hurjui, 2015). There are various teaching methods. Including the composition skills of analyzing arguments, using inductive or deductive reasoning for reasoning, judgment, or evaluation, and making decisions or solving problems. Prior knowledge about a given topic is a necessary, but not sufficient condition for students to engage the subject critically.Critical thinking is a processing and problem-solving method established on intelligent, logical, and cogent arguments. Furthermore, it includes the selection, evaluation, and verification of the right answer to a particular assignment. Critical thinking further provides adequate reasons for rejecting alternative solutions provided during the process. It is the process of learning to persistently combine different types of data to offer advantages and disadvantages, assess them to confirm the truth, modify information, and produce new conceptions. Additionally, it is a complicated, organized, and positive procedure essential in a person’s daily life. Similar to writing and reading, listening and speaking, it entails the process of thinking that originates from a point of accumulating positive data and utilizing it to obtain reasonable results.Previous Studies on Fairy Tales and Critical ThinkingAccording to recent research children engage in the same cognitive processes and are as capable
of critical thinking as adults (Lai, 2011, 465). Fairy tales play an important role in helping children to critically reflect on stereotypical nuances and gendered content narrated in various storybooks, preparing them for the challenges in the future. Transmitted through word of mouth from one generation to the next, storybooks are essential for entertainment and education. Storybooks reiterate imaginary situations that invigorate the brains of children and so encourage children to reflect, think critically, about various life situations. Children form opinions and make emotional judgments, face ethical dilemmas, recognize the importance of certain social situations and bonds, and formulate their own social responsibility (Lai, 2011, 466). Lai (2011, 466) adds that children are often able to distinctly appreciate the importance of family life, make important decisions when facing ethical dilemmas,Pulimeno et al. (2020, 14) performed an experiment in order to investigate pedagogic, didactic, and psychological dimensions in children’s literature, with the objective of identifying its role in advancing students’ holistic progress and wellbeing. Researchers have found that 17 studies, conducted between 1960 and 2019, focused on the pedagogical features of children’s literature. (Pulimeno 2020, 15) From a pedagogical perspective, the values in fairy tales help children to make judgments about culturally fitting moral norms. For instance, in Cinderella , children developed an analytical savvy with which they were able to better reflect on the moral of the story which, in this context, included rebuking lying and not treating others in a wicked manner. Other studies Pulimeno conducted focused on the therapeutic and didactic dimensions of fairy
practice pronunciation and so to better express themselves. Similarly, from a therapeutic point of view, researchers discovered that mental health professionals use fairy tales and storybooks to create healthy relationships among students (Pulimeno, 2011, 18). In Cinderella , for example, the stepmother’s actions warn children not to be cruel, while in the story of Red Riding Hood the appearance of the wolf warns children to not eat unhealthily.Grimm’s fairies allow children to scrutinize gender roles and friendships between men and women that are often presented in stereotypical ways. A study conducted in 2009, investigates the role of women in relation to men (Erum, 2009). Most of the fairy tales, including Snow White , Cinderella , Little Red Riding Hood , and Hansel and Gretel , present patriarchal worlds…. For example, Snow White and Sleeping Beauty are rescued from a deep sleep by a prince’s kiss and their relationship is described as true love. Moreover, Snow White, in her house with the seven dwarves, represents the perfect housewife.Erum writes that feminist movements such as the women’s liberation criticized the roles attributed to women in Grimm’s Fairy Tales fairy tales and therefore rewrote some of them. In their revisions, they highlighted masculine characters to female characters. Such revisions demonstrate how meanings are not fixed and can be altered easily just by changing the story line (Erum 2009). Presenting different versions to students, they learn how to distinguish the different social norms and understand what the reason for a certain change was.
IntroductionA front-load machine usually refers to an appliance whereby the user will be loading clothes using an opening found at the front side of the washer. The devices have a distinct detergent drawer whereby an individual places the powder to use in washing. One of its benefits is that it is more energy-efficient than other laundry machines such as top loaders. They save on time used for drying because water drains out of the clothes more effectively. In addition, it is environment-friendly since they require fewer detergents, which means fewer chemicals will be released to the groundwater and soil. Its tumbling movement uses less power from the dryer and the washer, reducing the greenhouse effect in households.Furthermore, this washer has a large drum that lacks a central axis, which means there is typically more space for laundry so that one can fit large loads into each cycle. Furthermore, the washing machine’s whirling motion depends on the gravitational pull to toss the garments over one another within the washer drum, making it rotate faster (Majewski & Ahearn, 2019). This creates increased friction among the items, resulting in a higher cleaning performance using less water. Another benefit is that the washers can be stacked on the drying machine, saving space in the utility room. This factor makes them ideal for smaller homes and apartments and makes it easier to unload and load. The machine uses paddles on the side of the drum and does not have an agitator meaning that they are generally gentle on the loads.The purpose
of instruction and procedure is to enlighten my target audience, both small-scale and large-scale households, of using a front load washing machine, which is a huge time saver. An individual can load the items on the device, begin the cycle, and walk away, so there is no need to sit and monitor the washing process. A user must read the labels since following the listed garments guidelines will increase the machine’s service life. They should never overload the dryer as this may cause a breakdown to the device, and they should sort the clothes by material color, type, and water temperature.Parts of a Front Load WasherOne of the parts of a washer is a water inlet control valve. It is located close to the water inlet point, and it closes and opens automatically when clothes are loaded based on the quantities of water needed. Secondly, a water pump is applied to discharge water in the spin cycle and flow through the wash cycle. The third part is the paddles which are structured to move the fabric during the wash to allow the detergent to function, helping the loads to rub together while washing to remove soiling and dirt particles from the clothes. The heating system boils water up inside the machine to the required temperature. Furthermore, the printed circuit board contains all the electrical appliances that operate the washing machine. It can be automated, serving as the artificial intelligence for the washer, and at times determining the time required for rinsing. After cleaning, all the dirty
water is expelled from the machine through a discharge pipe.Working DefinitionThe front-load washing machine functions by filling the base of the inner tube with little water and using gravity and rotation of the tub to pass the clothes through the water. The side agitator inside the drum lifts the garments and moves them forward and backward in the water. This gives the cleansing effect required to get rid of dirt from clothes effectively when the cleaning process begins.Required StepsStep 1: The user should follow the guidelines on the detergent bottle; for dirtier clothes, they should use more washing powder.Step 2: It involves placing the dirty clothes into the washer’s drum, ensuring that there is enough space left for the load to move around the wash. If the user’s palm fits between the machine and the fabric, it implies that the device has been loaded correctly.Step 3: This step entails adding a fabric conditioner to the dispensing drawer, and this should be made with caution not to fill past the top line; otherwise, it may not dispense at all.Step 4: This stage entails setting the optimum temperature based upon the labels of fabric care on the clothes. In the case of multiple temperatures, one should choose the lowest one.Step 5: This phase involves choosing the correct spin cycle; the durable clothes work better with faster cycles, while delicate require a slower one.Step 6: This step involves closing the door and pressing to unload the clean laundry immediately for maximum freshness, more preferably at least within two hours
of the cycle’s end.Washing Machine SettingsIt is essential to choose the correct settings in the instrument panel for the washing machines because the settings selected may influence the lifespan and color of the clothes. Hot water may give cleaner clothes even though it can cause fibers of the clothes to shrink and colors to bleed. Typically, the user should countercheck the tags on clothing for each item to know its right settings for washing. Some specify their specific temperature settings, while others are recommended to be hand washed. Normal cycles are mostly preferred for sheets, cotton, and linens.The delicate setting is for light clothing like those written handwash only and silks. Darks is recommended for bright or dull colors in a casual fabric and is mainly designed for dyed items that may bleed. Moreover, heavy-duty is used for large loads of colorfast clothes, sturdy and heavily soiled items, and can be used for blankets, rugs, heavy bedding, and comforters. Super speed is meant for small loads of lightly soiled garments that need to be washed quickly. Lastly, the water is expelled in the spin cycle, allowing the garments to spin off excess water.Using the WasherThe operator should pile clothes high up, making sure not to cram them beyond the last row of holes at the front while loading. Several steps should be followed while unloading the washer safely. One should use a stool to reach into the washing machine and a folded carpet to protect the knees. This is followed by lifting the basket with a
Care should be taken not to mix household cleaners since some chemical mixtures release dangerous fumes. Children and customers should never be allowed to hang on the doors of washers because this can make them tip over. The laundry chutes should be made more than thirty-six inches off the floor. Finally, it is always good to read and follow each product label instruction, understand where the safety information is located on the label, and take steps in case of injuries.TroubleshootingCommon problems with washing machines range from using excessive soaps to water covering the floor. Some may require contracting a professional to diagnose, while others are easy fixes. The first thing to check is if the machine is getting adequate power using a multimeter to examine the outlet voltage. When you realize that there is no electricity flowing into the washer, an individual is required to confirm the household electrical panel to inspect if the circuit breakers have been tripped. Secondly, when the motor is overheated, the washing machine will shut down to cool before starting it. The lid must permanently be shut for the switch to activate and check if the button is positioned correctly and in good repair.
Now humanity lives in an age of rapid information and technological progress; many technologies are being imported into every person’s daily life. Information technologies, in particular the Internet, permeate the environment of every person and become almost invisible. One of the relatively new concepts is the Internet of Things (IoT). IoT defines as a network of physical objects with built-in technologies that allow interacting with the external environment, transmitting information about their state and receiving data from the outside.Internet of Things implies connecting devices into a chain and allowing them to collect and analyze information. It involves processing and transmitting data to other objects through software, applications or technical devices. IoT devices function independently without requiring human-to-computer interaction. Nonetheless, people can customize such devices or provide access to data. IoT systems operate in real-time and usually consist of some “smart” devices and cloud platforms. Devices are connected to the cloud via WiFi, Bluetooth, or other means of communication.IoT may not be visible, but it is essential in everyday life and is integrated into many areas of human activity. The use of IoT is not limited by anything: the technology is used in smart homes and cars, in healthcare, in farming and the agricultural sector. Thus, air conditioning systems, video surveillance, pacemakers, animal biochips or monitoring systems in the fields are examples of a “thing”. IoT aims to optimize, increase efficiency, collect the necessary data in real-time for subsequent analysis to achieve specific improvements. These technologies make life easier, automate and speed up processes, and reduce the need for human interaction.However, IoT has some security and privacy challenges, and smart devices are often vulnerable. Such devices collect a lot of personal information from users, such as ages and names, addresses and phone numbers. Some of them contain data from social networks of users. Smart devices such as smartwatches or bracelets often have the ability to make payments, hence containing payment data of people. All this information is confidential and must be protected; however, IoT devices are often hacked, and private information is at risk of being stolen.
IntroductionRacism is a belief in certain human beings who possess or have different behavioral characteristics that correspond to inherited attributes. Racial inequalities have also manifested in most American societies through the racial differences in the health sector, bankruptcy, police brutality, housing privileges, unemployment rates, and incarceration rates (Barkan, 2017). Therefore, this research paper will look at racial and ethnic inequality and healthcare as a social problem.Summary of the ArticleIn the news article titled “A history of race and racism in America,” racial inequality is regarded as a form of American tradition as black people earn close to less than 23% compared to their fellow American counterparts. The black people in America also have a higher probability of getting incarcerated on a specific day. During early 1991, several black people were under the correction system’s jurisdiction compared to colleges, universities, and other learning institutions (Kendi, 2017). However, over recent years, there has been an increase in social progress and economic barometers. Nevertheless, the country still has a lot of work to do and implement policies to give black people equal rights. The black people also firmly believe that someday they will have equal rights just like their American counterparts (Kendi, 2017). In addition, most Americans tend to think that being white is a privilege in society. At the same time, close to half of the population in America says that being black or Hispanic influences one’s ability to get ahead.Analysis of the Article Concerning Health Care as a Social ProblemRace is among the four social concepts that
2017). However, the vent may vary from one state to another. Nonetheless, social stratification is also a social construct that plays a crucial role in ranking people and classifying them in society. It also brings several universal inequalities as it advocates for unequal distribution of resources, promoting discrimination and racial and ethnic disparities.ConclusionIn addition, black women also have a higher probability of being overweight than white Americans. Nonetheless, in most American hospitals, black people do not receive premium and optimum care compared to white people (Friesen & Blease, 2018). Kendi (2017) argues that the whites have a high probability of getting services. Thus, the African American individuals are not likely to gain access to potentially life-saving cardiac procedures, mainly because of their skin color.In conclusion, racial and ethnic inequalities over the past years were an American dilemma as there were no appropriate policies and regulations for curbing this challenge. However, after the 1960 demonstrations and riots, the discrimination against black Americans became a topic of discussion. Moreover, it is clear that racial and ethnic inequalities are depicted through police brutality, income, education, and health statistics. Although in the recent years there has been an increase in diversity and social progress.
December, she had her greatest college results of the year in Ohio, when she competed in the two hundred and five hundred meter sprints. After Lia Thomas’ successes at university swimming pools, she was criticized following the fact that she was born a male, which gave him an advantage. Some people argued that because Thomas was taking testosterone therapy, he had an unfair advantage over other athletes. Describing her victory to be unfair was completely wrong following the fact that trans genders are always allowed to compete by themselves. Various suggestions have been put up, including the creation of a transsexual division in the NCAA if trans individuals have such an unfair edge. Men compete with men, women compete with women, and transsexuals compete against one another.Thomas’s success in the past seasons is a testament to his hard work and dedication. He has shown that transgender athletes can also be as successful as anyone else and should be respected for their achievements. However, the fact is that Thomas has been subject to all the same testing and regulations as any other athlete. He was not allowed to take more testosterone than any other male athlete, and his testosterone levels are closely monitored by officials. A year-long course of testosterone-suppressing therapy was prescribed following NCAA guidelines for the swimmer’s recovery. These restrictions have been deemed inadequate by the Women’s Sports Policy Task Force, for example, in the case of athletes who begin their transitioning after puberty.

obtain information on current events.However, there are issues that are associated with such patterns, which lie in the anonymity and speed of spread of news online. There is no avoidance of a certain level of bias with any sort of news reporting, and the alternative news media are not exempt from this rule. Furthermore, there is often a lack of consequences associated with the news reporting through social media, which can be even more harmful than the potentially misleading mainstream news.Response to the Peer PostIn your post, you talked about the pros and cons of lobbyists as a tool for special interest groups. The latter have a significant impact on decision makers and voters, contributing information and advertising their position (Wolton, 2019). Therefore, it is vital to make use of the tools available to maximize the positive effect. I agree with your point that lobbyists “provide an elegant avenue” for groups and “help influence new proposals.” Furthermore, they do have a risk of creating bias, as you have stated. It is a complex topic and your answer provides an extensive analysis of it.
A strategic initiative in a business organization is a comprehensive plan that links up the companies’ objectives and its future goals and visions. Based on the results and outcomes from the SWOT analysis we conducted, as a measure to assess the establishment’s strengths, weaknesses, opportunities, and threats, my team came up with a tremendous life-changing initiative to upgrade the financial management of the DIVERSICARE HEALTHCARE organization. Referring to the financial statements we looked into, one of them being the organization’s income statement, it is discovered that the business was not on a sound financial footing and hence required critical and quick changes to rescue it from potential financial crises.Some of the changes agreed upon for the organization’s financial betterments were that the organization would look into ways of reducing operational costs as lowest as possible to increase its gross profit. Reduction of these costs will create room to reduce expenses on the business, and hence with fewer expenses, the revenue increases; therefore, the organization will increase profit. For the coming financial years, an increase in sales revenue was also suggested by strategizing on the best possible ways to bring revenue in. The revenue would be increased by reducing the overall labor costs for the business, reducing the insurance premiums, and finally reducing the organization’s utilities to maximize incomes and save on expenses (Fischer et al., 2018). All these changes set aside had the same outcomes, and that was that it would have maximized and stabilized the business’s financial standing by increasing its revenue and hence a
high business growth rate.The budget figure below illustrates the proposed comprehensive plan and a simple budget to accomplish all changes and obligations after the financial management was revised and improved.1. Income                           Amount in $Revenue (salaries)                  $10000     Extra benefits                      $5000      Total income                        $15000     2. expenses                         Amount     Equipment                           $1500      Training and education              $5000      Space                           
different reviews to the analysts. Some analysts consider the firm’s equity to be from the deduction of the liabilities from the assets, while others look into the firm’s entire capital.The income statement accesses the income a business earns and the cost of the expenses involved in its operational activities within the company. Management of income by examining income statements reduces the taxable income content, and therefore firms defer information by managing accounting income (Hamedian et al.2016). It also shows with clarity all direct and indirect expenses a company incurs. For example, in the profit and loss account, total sales were $100000 while the expenditures totaled $ 115000 hence giving a noticeable loss of &15000 in the data we examined during the research. In conclusion, all three financial statements co-relate and work together to provide an overview and information about the business’s financial standing. Hence, the analysts should consider reviewing current data to make a sound decision and financial planning on any strategic initiative.
first time was surprising for me as a child that had never been in a group of people that at first glance are so different from me. However, already at that moment, I felt that it was the only difference in our appearance. After a while, I met so many interesting and kind people from different backgrounds. That experience taught me that an individual’s personality does not depend on the color of their skin, ethnic background, or nationality. I am grateful for the fact that I realized it in the early stages of my life.As a person who is against discrimination, it is a pity to see how people might remove themselves from people from minority groups just because of their skin color, ethnicity, or other characteristics that are different from those people. I see such behavior as quite unfair, and I suppose that people who are imposing discrimination in today’s society should be more open-minded and educate themselves on the topic of diversity and equality.
Diversity is one issue that has been observed in several institutions in the world. People from different walks of life are united through religion, education, entertainment, and living together. When people embrace their differences, existing peacefully becomes a result (Bell, 2021). However, when people cannot harmonize their differences and coexist, chaos becomes the character of existence. Education is one of the significant aspects that bring people from diverse backgrounds together. Some researchers have identified diversity to affect students’ performance in their studies. The diversity of the students comes in terms of ethnic, racial, gender, and age distribution. This paper seeks to research the impact of the above factors on performance in my school.Age and gender cause a difference in performance in my school. According to the research, the composition of females and males in the school is15000 and 13500 respectively. This means that the number of females admitted to my school is slightly higher than males accepted each year. According to my research, 9% of females graduated with distinction while 15% of males graduated with distinction. This finding indicates a performance difference between males and females that other factors may cause. Another research done from the different learning institutions show that males perform averagely better than females, though there is a slight difference in performance (Bush et al., 2017). Most of the students in my college are 17 to 24 years of age. From the research findings, age does not have a significant influence on performance. However, the findings also indicated that some students who enter
There is sufficient reason to think that the two-nucleotide code evolved to form the current triplet genetic code. With this in mind, one can conclude that the number of amino acids was slightly less than the current 20 because the two nucleotide codes could constitute only 16 amino acids. Sixteen possible combinations of the four nucleotide bases of the DNA would give rise to the 16 amino acids. Therefore, it posits that the ancient primitive proteins constituted fewer amino acids encoded by the two-nucleotide code. Furthermore, deletion or insertion mutation experiments of one or two nucleotides into a gene formed no protein (Frank & Froese, 2018). However, the reading frame of the mRNA got restored once a third nucleotide was deleted or inserted. Nonetheless, the current triplet genetic code entails 64 codons encoding for the twenty amino acids.The genetic code is termed degenerate, where a single amino acid can specify more than one codon. Each codon specifies a single amino acid, while the amino acids can have more than two codons. For instance, tryptophan and methionine have a single codon each except for UGA, UAG, and UAA termination codons. Isoleucine has three codons, valine, threonine, and glycine, proline, and alanine have four codons. Arginine, serine, and leucine have six codons, and the remaining nine amino acids have two codons (Frank & Froese, 2018). The genetic code’s degeneracy feature helps prove that in ancient times, there was a two-nucleotide code that translated into the 16 amino acids in primitive proteins. The first two bases of each codon
Indeed, given the fact that wealth as a long-term asset defines the extent of one’s political influence within a community, equal distribution of wealth implies the promotion of democracy (Mijs, 2021). However, one could argue that building equal wealth is impossible without equal income. Namely, as long as income inequality remains an issue, poverty and, thus, drastic wealth inequality will remain a social concern (Le et al., 2019). Therefore, it could be argued that democracy requires equality of wealth, which, in turn, is based on the equality of income.While wealth equality as the presence of equivalent opportunities to exert political power appears to be the essential factor in establishing democracy, income equality as the opportunity to build wealth is also a factor. Therefore, though wealth equality seems to be the crucial factor in creating an egalitarian community, both concepts play a notably large role in promoting the principles of democracy within a community. Consequently, both income equality as a short-term chance at acquiring power and wealth equality as a long-term option for retaining it must be regulated accordingly.
Mercator is a commonly used projection, but it does not adequately represent the real size of the country. The most common complaint is that the size of the country is extremely biased. The sizes of Greenland and Africa are classic examples. According to the Mercator projector, they have the same size. The Mercator projection mistakenly exaggerates the size of Europe and North America. Greenland, which appears as a huge frozen land in the Mercator projection, has shrunk dramatically. The African Continent occupies a far more prominent place on this new life-size map. Distorted sizes aren’t just worrisome, as they give the wrong impression of what the world looks like. In relation to non-white nations, Mercator is expanding and perhaps increasing the importance of white nations.As far as I know, the real size of a country differs from the size illustrated by the Mercator projection. I started to get a new perspective on the world with a new map. One of them is Google Maps, where at higher zoom settings, the Earth will appear as a globe. This completely avoids the difficulty of map projection and displays the planet as it is in a circle (Setiawan & Sediyono, 2017). This means that countries and land are more accurately mapped. Users often use maps at narrower zoom levels, such as for navigation designed with the Mercator projection. The exact angle between the lane and the boundary is preserved in this projection.In an increasingly globalized world, having relevant geographic knowledge is essential. Misunderstandings about the size of continents can disappear as people become accustomed to maps of the same area and the spherical Earth. My view of the world changed when I realized that the Mercator projection wasn’t accurate. I understand that the actual size of a country may differ from the size and proportions shown on the map.
Dreaming is an exciting and still inexplicable human experience that occurs entirely in one’s brain during sleeping. Before taking this course, I was skeptical about the value of dreams. Indeed, I was influenced mainly by the studies that explained this phenomenon from the point of continuous activity of people’s minds that processes daily routine during the night. However, after studying various sources about our visions during sleep, I understood the reasoning behind less scientific explanations. This class allowed me to be more attentive to dreams to understand my emotional problems and helped me learn about the causes of students’ nightmares.The new information that interested me was the dreaming experiences of Jordanian students that were similar to their counterparts from Western countries. It was unusual to learn from this chapter by Nasser & Bulkeley (2009) that negative dreams were recalled and reported more frequently. Most of the participants’ nightmares had some association with their daily concerns. Dreaming about elements of the supernatural world, like jinn, was the reflection of these individuals’ cultural and religious beliefs (Nasser & Bulkeley, 2009). Even though it is logical to think that people’s habits and thoughts would appear in their dreams, it was still fascinating to read how their brains were able to reconstruct these ideas into realistic images. I used to dream about book and movie characters, but I only recently admitted that my mind could create imaginary scenarios involving me in these fictional stories. Analyzing my behavior in these nightmares revealed that I isolated myself from my friends and became
in our brains (Heijnen, 2005). Nevertheless, this manuscript helped me realize that science still cannot explain many events and behaviors; thus, I should remain open to various theories about human mental potential.In summary, this course about dreaming helped me learn various opinions about this brain activity. I used to view dreams as processing information and experiences of our daily lives. In fact, it is partly true because studies demonstrated that people dreamed about the same concerns but mainly in a negative sense, which might be explained by cultural constraints and anticipation of a bad outcome. The most puzzling components of this phenomenon are people’s nightmares about the supernatural world that are probably caused by individuals’ beliefs, accentuated by their imagination. These elements are not universal across the globe, and thus it is hard to apply psychoanalytic principles to explain such visions. Overall, I think that this part of human life requires more research that should involve professionals in both scientific and non-scientific fields.
fast-food is an integral part of the American way of life – intrigues the audience and compels them to read the book. The story provided in the introduction is supported by conclusive statistics and brief history recap, as well as by enumeration of different American regions and fast-food chains without which one cannot imagine these areas. The intended audience is any American interested in the topic – of any age, gender, or race.Eric Schlosser implements an approach resembling Chandler’s in the introduction to his book, Fast Food Nation: The Dark Side of the All-American Meal . Pathos as a method of convincing the audience in the argument he makes is employed by Schlosser (2012) in a similar fashion: he tells a fascinating story of the military installation in Colorado mountains. The build-up to the facility’s rugged workers being reliant on fast-food chains to provide them food takes a reader’s breath away and makes them want to explore the rest of the book. Schlosser’s (2012) claim is similar to the one Chandler (2019) makes: fast-food, its history and influence on the United States’ national culture are impossible to ignore. Support to the story is provided by a couple-of-pages-long foreword, epitomizing the fast-food industry’s influence in facts and numbers, as well as in the author’s reasoning about the cultural impact it has made. The book is intended for every American who wants to find out more about the subject.
consists of African-Americans and Caucasians. Local shops are tourist-oriented and provide a wide variety of souvenirs and vintage goods such as books and wine. Since Atlantic City is a city located near the ocean, many local restaurants specialize in seafood. The average income for an individual who resides in Atlantic City, per the 2021 was only 29,232 USD for a household.The culture and ambiance may be categorized as a “party” or “fun” city. Because of this, alcohol and drugs are very popular among residents, which may pose a community health issue and is applicable for all ages entering or residing within the city. Additionally, this issue may only amplify, as a new law was passed in 2020 allowing for the public consumption of alcohol within the city’s tourism district. Unfortunately, alcohol is a part of the city’s culture and is embraced, even with the potential long term effects drinking can cause to a person’s health. Luckily, there is an Alcoholics Anonymous outreach facility for those who find themselves in need of such assistance and several medical emergency facilities, including psychiatric and behavorial health facilities.
Beverly Daniel Tatum, a prominent expert on education and psychology, argues that racial identity is one of the most pressing matters in contemporary society. The issue of discrimination against people of color is ubiquitous despite democracy and international law. Why are all the black kids sitting together in the cafeteria?: And other conversations about race is the author’s sincere monolog about injustice, which provides insight into its grounds, effects, and approaches to overpower it.The book reveals the issue of inequality from multiple angles, and it is demanding to pick out a few leading ideas, as Tatum tries to cover distinct topics in a certain number of pages. She starts with a definition of racism and explains that it is challenging to have an honest conversation about race due to its negative stigma. Furthermore, the author’s point is to define the state of discrimination in the country and the world nowadays and explore what steps need to be taken to develop identity. The book educates readers on how black people perform in white society and how white ones act in their community, noting the various subtleties and characteristics of security and privilege.Moreover, one of the central themes is the concern of patience and silence. People need to understand that black children sit together because they feel understood and can develop a part of their identity that remains unformed without these connections. They think that other individuals are incapable of sharing their values, and therefore it is unsafe to be a part of their circle. One of the
first efforts to comprehend systemic discrimination is eliminating the fear, shame, and protection around the word racist. Whether white or colored, everyone is exposed to the smog of stereotypes, misinformation, prejudice, and disregarded history.There is a tendency, especially among whites, to deny the existence of systemic racism because accepting it as truth is like admitting that they are racist, and that needs to be altered. The author’s idea is that there must be a clear distinction between the negative attitudes, assumptions, and stereotypes that one person may project on another and how racism operates in society. If everyone understood discrimination as a set of policies and practices that systematically give white people an advantage over people of color, the matter would become apparent.Why are all the black kids sitting together in the cafeteria?: And other conversations about race raises fundamental issues of discrimination that are particularly acute in education. The negative racial biases that black children face lead to frequent suspensions, resulting in excessive absences and the fact that they cannot receive the same quality of education as their white counterparts. After reading, it becomes apparent that it is necessary to create encouraging conditions for communication between diverse students. It is the educator who can control the nature of this interaction directly. The book helps comprehend that education is the most promising tool to fight racism and build inclusive societies. Children can and should be taught equality, respect, and tolerance from a young age. Moreover, the author’s thoughts inspire a shift in the approach to learning
especially noticeable in the drug situation, where the number of crimes for different races is approximately the same (The Sentencing Project, 2018). The police distribute their efforts focusing on areas where they believe a crime is more likely, and policies like “Broken Windows” and “Stop, Question, and Frisk” make people of color the target (The Sentencing Project, 2018). Given the disproportionate level of poverty, structural racism, and small efforts to combat these problems, the drug war is a more significant burden for minorities.The fight against drugs also unfairly affects women, especially women of color. Racial bias is also relevant to them, but several other problems supplement it. Women have less access than men to treatment during detention (Drug Policy Alliance, n.d.). Child protection policies fight drugs, and sometimes children can be taken from mothers only for suspicion of them in connection with drug crimes (Drug Policy Alliance, n.d.). Conspiracy laws are also severely used against women, imposing penalties for not informing about the involvement of a partner or family member in drug sales (Drug Policy Alliance, n.d.). Thus, existing laws against drugs are unfair to racial minorities and women.
Alcohol and substance abuse is a massive issue in New Jersey, and one of its outcomes is the opioid epidemic that emerged in the state during the last decade. In 2021, Governor Phil Murphy passed several bills based on the provision of harm reduction services, hypodermic syringe distribution, and local drug overdose fatality review teams established to respond to the challenge (State of New Jersey’s Department of Health, 2022). The latter is a relatively new policy for New Jersey, and local communities are discussing its impact on population health and healthcare services practice. Bill A798/S52 is deployed according to the example of other states where opioid use is regulated legislatively, and people with sufficient knowledge and experience in working with addiction treatment are involved (Senate Health, Human Services and Senior Citizens Committee 2021). This paper aims to critically analyze the policy about local drug overdose fatality review teams’ establishment and discuss how it aligns with the concepts of advocacy, population health, and the ANA ethical statements.The Bill A798/S52Legislative regulation is essential to fight against the opioid epidemic because it provides sufficient power to make practice changes, track and eliminate violations, and predict improvements. Bill A798/S52 was officially released on January 18, 2022, to establish local drug overdose fatality review teams and provide healthcare and social support for people with alcohol and drug addictions (State of New Jersey’s Department of Health, 2022). The primary sponsors were Verrelli, Vainieri Huttle, Armato/Singer, and Greenstein; they also participated in passing other opioid epidemic-related regulations. The policy identifies the responsible groups’
Primary education for children in bilingual immigrant families can be challenging for parents. They often face problems of cultural inconsistency, that is, a lack of understanding of certain self-evident norms and traditions. For example, in the United States, it is common practice for parents to attend school, while in South Korea this behavior is considered impolite. Parents can also experience psychological discomfort when communicating with teachers due to language barriers. Therefore, family engagement is the most common approach to reduce the distance between teachers and parents and improve communication. This paper aims to discuss how family engagement and other teaching strategies address the needs of dual language learners.Dual Language Learners and Family EngagementDual language learners (DLL) are students who are educated in a language different from the one, primarily spoken at their homes. Interestingly, these students often also face a different cultural setting. DLLs usually are US-born children of immigrants, and sometimes of US-born parents. The most populous immigrant groups in California are Spanish, Vietnamese, Korean, and Tagalog. Since the immigrant population usually presents a considerable cohort of US citizens there are widespread educational practices developed specifically for the DLLs. For instance, the strategy of family engagement was created to improve the communication between the DLL’s parents and teachers.The US educational system recognizes the importance of the family in the process of learning new knowledge. Therefore, the concept of engagement was introduced at an early stage in the scientific discussion of DLL learning strategies. The idea behind this concept is to provide broader expectations for the
families of students, that is, the perception of them as a strong partner with many opportunities. In other words, the modern US educational system is based on the idea that the family has more wisdom about the education of children than the school curriculum. In this regard, one of the main goals and objectives of the system is to create the prerequisites for improved interaction between families and schools.Equally important are such generally accepted concepts in the educational system as cultural capital, social capital, and human capital, as well as the approach based on the ecological theory fundamentals. In general, the ecological theory considers the children’s developmental systems such as proximal systems and distal systems. Proximal systems are the systems common for learners like school, and home, this is a tangible system in which the students exist. At the same time, the distal system is the concept that describes the more intangible, ideological aspects of learning like culture and neighborhoods.There is also a perception that these two systems present a bi-directional interaction, which is also studied. According to the theory, the only way to establish optimal learning is to harmonize the two systems. Then, the concept of cultural capital embodies the idea of the cultural knowledge, beliefs, and customs inherent among the students’ family members. At the same time, social capital refers to the students’ social networks as valuable assets of support and influence. Finally, human capital is the concept describing students ‘personal qualities that help them succeed in the learning process. These qualities may include
the initial education, competencies, and skills, as well as the personal attributes.Scholarly DiscourseScholars generally recognize the family engagement approach as correct and offer ways to implement this approach within the school curriculum and lesson plans. For example, Quin et al. (2018) recognize the importance of introducing the ecological model for students ‘learning development and consider the most critical factors inherent in the model, such as teacher’s support that has a high positive relation with the student’s engagement. The scholars also admit the great influence on behalf of the students’ community, family, and peers. Quin et al. (2018) determined the factors perceived as protective concerning the learning success. These are teacher support, academic grades, prior engagement, family management practices, and others. The risk factors included antisocial peer affiliation, community disorganization, absences from school, and school dropout.Although these factors were developed for the 10th and 11th graders, they are also appropriate for younger students, as they discuss the common situation of receiving education by younger and older children. Interestingly, these factors could be introduced into the initial and more generally perceived family engagement approach since, according to the scholars ’report, they have shown a high potential. The presented information can as well be used to develop the requirements and evaluations of the students ’success and when looking for the red flags in students’ school performance. For example, teachers could develop questionnaires for parents where family members could answer questions related to the presence or absence of risk factors or supportive factors.Consultation is one of the acceptable forms of
family engagement in the learning process. Teachers can provide valuable insights on which home-based family practices will be most effective for DLL students. For instance, there are widespread and commonly accepted practices or characteristics of family engagement. These practices include joint decision making, regular two-way communication, collaboration with teachers and exchange of knowledge, learning in-home and in the community, and joint family-program setting of learning goals. Therefore, the consultations can be seen as the feature of the two-way communication between the teachers and family.Smith et al. (2019) assert that consultations are an appropriate way of promoting family-school engagement. They positively correlate with the children’s social-behavioral competence, academic achievement, and mental health. No less important, consultations affect the relational outcomes, parent practices, and parent attitudes (Smith et al., 2019). Therefore, the scholars conclude that there is strong evidence that consultations improve the critical students’ outcomes. Importantly, this claim also correlates with the family engagement approach.Interestingly, given that the practice of counseling is so beneficial for both teachers and students, teachers should include weekly parenting counseling in their curriculum and create separate programs to engage and motivate parents. The implementation of such plans will create an environment in which children can receive support in learning both at home and school. Given the general difficulties faced by DLLs, this educational environment can be an indispensable condition for the quality assimilation of new knowledge.Teacher-training programs are a particular factor that has a positive influence on DLL’s educational success. Interestingly, these practices can be seen in the framework of the ecological
IntroductionDuke Ellington is an American composer and pianist who played a major role in the revolution of Jazz music across America. Ellington recorded his music with his band and became one of the composers of distinctive jazz sounds highlighted in his concert in Copenhagen in 1965. His band is comprised of fourteen members whereby each is tasked to play a different musical instrument during the performance. The members of Ellington’s ensemble include Duke Ellington, Billy Strayhorn, John Lamb, Sam Woodyard, Paul Gonsalves, Russel Procope, Jimmy Hamiliton, Chuck Connos, Buster Cooper, Cootie Williams, Herbie Jones, Cat Anderson, Ray Nance and Harry Carney. The band played a set of air and string instruments in the performance, which included trumpets, violins, trombone, clarinet, tenor saxophone, alto saxophone, baritone saxophone, bass clarinet, bass guitar, drums, and piano, which was Ellington’s specialty. The Copenhagen performance is divided into five shows that constitute different musical aspects. The pieces in the concerto are live performances, namely midriff, Ad Lib on Nipon, Part three, Tutti for Cootie, and Rockin’ in Rhythm, respectively. The concert is vibrant as the ensemble plays the musical instruments in a happy and fast melody which, on the other hand, engages the crowd. The concert plays a major role in indicating the development of music as Ellington explains to the crowd about every piece that is presented, which gives information about the genre of music to be performed. The crowd is involved in the music as it is hard to sing and clap along to the music in the concert.
Telling jokes before a performance engages the crowd to be more attentive hence making the performance to be more lively.Main bodyThe Midriff Live is the first piece that was presented in the Copenhagen performance, which involves a fast melody that welcomes the audience to the concerto. The melodies that are played in this piece include fast tubas and clarinets. The most thrilling part of the performance is when Duke instructs the general ensemble on the melody they are going to start with. Ellington is seen to begin by setting the tone for the performance by playing his piano then, followed by the band who play the music in a fast rhythm which indicates the beginning of the performance. In this piece, the band plays a high-pitched melody that indicates the distinctive style of jazz known as Swing jazz. In the Copenhagen performance, swing jazz is the dominant style played as it comprises a large ensemble that is divided into three or four members playing similar instruments. The swing melody is also characterized by the feeling of snapping fingers to the melody, which also is heard from the crowd as the orchestra plays the music.The fourth part of the performance was also fascinating, especially the music texture of the performance. The piece applies the fast, slow, fast style of jazz music, which is important in engaging an audience. The piece is also classified by the orchestra members playing solo which captivates the attention of the audience. The performance Tutti for Cootie has musical elements such as syncopation
whereby the orchestra sets accentuation melodies that sound like as bombardment of musical instruments. Syncopation helps the orchestra to indicate the beginning of a new song or the end of the performance. The use of syncopation helps in creating a happy mood through the performance that promotes audience participation. The performance has an element of improvisation whereby Ellington plays the clarinet which is backed up by the trumpets to create a singular tune. Improvisation plays a major role in ensuring the coordination of similar musical instruments to produce a similar melody. The key musical factor in the Copenhagen performance is the use of fast, slow, fast rhythm, as it ensures that the audience remains focused on the performance. The performances, especially Tutti for Cootie, act as a reminder to the American citizens of the tunes that were played during the attainment of independence; hence the performance is not only entertaining but also a cultural event. The tone gravity of this particular performance indicates the melodious coordination of the violin and the piano to create a happy mood across the performance. In the background, the audience is heard singing, clapping, and snapping along to the performance, which indicates that the performance has a vibrant tone row.The overall performance at Copenhagen depicts swing jazz as the orchestra maintains a happy melody across the performance. The alteration of musical chords and tunes is excellent, as there is a smooth transition of the musical instruments into one melody. The overall augmentation of the melodies in the performances is generally short,
In order to understand the structure and functions of society, it is essential to study a vast number of sociological theories and perspectives created by various scientists. For example, Emile Durkheim, a French sociologist, expressed his view of society in the theory of functionalism. According to Durkheim, there is vital interconnectivity of all the elements of any society that share common ideas and principles, and the sum of these elements is not as great as the society itself. The sociologist viewed society as a huge biological organism that requires all its parts to function properly in order to remain alive. Further, when discussing collective and individual behavior, Durkheim stated that these two concepts are entirely different, and there is the collective conscience that makes people adapt their actions and act in predictable ways. The concept of collective conscience is beneficial and positive as it defines and evaluates the norms of behavior.Nevertheless, not all sociologists share the same view on society. For example, there is also a conflict theory developed by Karl Marx. Unlike functionalism, conflict theory views society as a system with an ongoing class conflict, primarily between the proletariats and the bourgeoisie. The main cause of this conflict is the lack of resources and their unequal distribution, while its effects are connected with the necessary changes happening in society. Further, while functionalism focuses on collectivism, social integration, and the necessity of acting in similar and predictable ways, Karl Marx emphasizes individualism and promotes alienation that isolates a person from society. Finally, while Durkheim insisted on the ability of collective consciousness to hold people together and unite them into society, conflict theory tried to eliminate false consciousness and replace it with class one.It is evident that functionalism and conflict theory contradict each other. They are different in almost all ideas and concepts, including the primary structure of society. The main purpose of functionalism is to promote stability and make all elements of society function properly to avoid errors. At the same time, the key goal of conflict theory is to emphasize change because, without it, society cannot exist. Therefore, it is completely or almost impossible to see how these theories may complement each other.
The United States’ health policies are unique and developed to provide the nation with accessible and optimally effective care. The option to establish state regulations also benefits the local citizens and sets the standards for practitioners’ and physicians’ education and career. Although providing healthcare administration authority for entities is relatively uncommon, regulations passed by local legislators are similar to European countries. For instance, in the Netherlands, the law allows practitioners to advise medication the patients after completing specific pharmacology programs and practicum hours (Maier, 2019). This paper aims to compare the Dutch and American prescriptive authority for nurses and identify the role of international organizations in developing policies to regulate healthcare.Prescriptive authority for nursing professionals is widely discussed in the United States because of its benefits and disadvantages for patient outcomes. While most states admit that timely medication advice makes healthcare services more efficient, there are several entities where drug abuse is perceived as connected to the practitioners’ rights to distribute substances (Bodenheimer & Grumbach, 2020). However, the prescriptive authority is developing and expanding in most states, and the policies around it are similar to European. Indeed, nursing practitioners from countries such as the Netherlands are required to receive licensing based on specific educational and practical courses to get the right medication advice.The Dutch policy that regulates prescriptive nursing authority is universal for the entire country in contrast to the American state-based regulatory power; however, these conditions are applicable to countries’ political systems in general. In the Netherlands, a specialist can prescribe any medication within their
suffer from Dyslexia; however, the disorder affects people of all ages, socioeconomic, and ethnic backgrounds. Children born with dyslexia struggle with reading, understanding, and spelling. The article expands my topic understanding in several ways. I learned that Dyslexic children are great empathizers; many people with Dyslexia have a real personality. The writing and reading difficulties might help children empathize with those struggling. The article’s strength is that it has discussed the causes and effects of Dyslexia with the right age bracket consideration, that is, from age 4 to 10. The article’s weakness is that it generalized the genders without being specific; again, it only mentioned that Dyslexia is more often experienced in male children compared to females without explaining the reasons. Concerning race, there is a sparse number of research papers regarding Dyslexia among black children and its consequences. Dyslexia mainly affects white children than black children, and thus the article addresses white children widely. I will use this article as part of my capstone project by generating public health education proposal on Dyslexia to prevent the public from viewing Dyslexia as a curse.
IntroductionReliance on the internet and mobile devices to do business leads to the so-called E-commerce. The term is hardly old, based on its adoption in the 2000s after the internet revolution. E-commerce is a real force in the present and future business world due to several facets. For example, the invention’s capacity to eliminate reliance on the costly brick-and-mortar system of doing business makes it favorable to many investors. Equally, e-commerce’s unique traits, such as reduced entry barriers and readily available large stocks of online customers, make the aspect highly cherished. The invention comes at the right time when the world’s population leads a busy life, while its needs often beat local producers’ ability.The world’s rapid adoption of e-commerce justifies the invention’s match to people’s unique needs. Citizens worldwide never have to walk or travel to buy commodities or struggle to search for unavailable stuff inside sparingly located stores like before during the e-commerce age. Such unmatchable benefits make e-commerce a real force cherished by many.Nothing reveals the essence of e-commerce more than the COVID-19 pandemic state. Reported first in the mid of 2019, the epidemic causes significant pressure on humans by changing virtually every past way of living. The closure of businesses to protect people from contracting the deadly contagious virus changed working conditions significantly (Saeed, Bader, Al-Naffouri, and Alouini, 2020). Organizations seeking to survive the global plague thus resulted in working online, using the internet and e-commerce strategies to beat the challenging situation. Moreover, the worldwide population relied substantially on technology to acquire life’s
necessities due to the enacted quarantines. Such benefits make many people blindly accept the invention without caring about its effects on other fundamental aspects, such as the environment. Like any other facet, e-commerce exhibits both beneficial and harmful effects on the environment, thus requiring moderation.Positive Impacts of E-Commerce on the EnvironmentOther than making people’s lives easier and fairer, e-commerce poses several beneficial effects on the environment. The following discussion reveals some of the invention’s paybacks about the surroundings.Transport EmissionsThe e-commerce business model operates differently from the traditional brick-and-mortar structure that requires vast parcels of land and a large workforce traveling to the offices every morning. Relying on the internet means that businesses selling items online requires a lesser number of stores or smaller size machine-intensive production units that can produce on-demand items (Gaffer, 2016). Therefore, the reduced need for land parcels implies a decrease in the natural ecosystem’s destruction, thus saving the environment. According to Collins (2021), transportation is one of the largest contributors to greenhouse gases that harm the environment substantially. Therefore, having people work from home makes the e-commerce model beneficial to the environment by reducing harmful transportation emissions from commuter vehicles.Paper WasteBusiness records play a major role in organizations’ survival, leading to the storage of almost every activity’s details. Filling physical receipts, invoices, purchasing orders, permits, and other essential documents formed a crucial part of businesses’ operations prior to the e-commerce era. Some companies even set aside massive record stores to manage the aspect. Most of the papers used in storing such details,
In Chapter 3, there is a discussion on the early evolution of parole in the US, as well as its utilization in the current sentencing practices. Among the most critical points of the chapter is that recent studies show that inmates who tend to leave prisons without parole supervisions demonstrate higher failure indicators in comparison with ones released with parole requirements. Then, it is suggested that reinstated discretionary parole release is to be provided for an inmate, given solid pieces of evidence. Then, the authors assume that parole release decisions are to be made by a competent and proficient board. The latter should have particular guidelines and formally established principles that would make its functioning smooth and transparent. Overall, the content of this chapter is delivered clearly and precisely; however, there might be more elaboration on the crucial points, such as the operational process of the professional parole board.Chapter 4 depicts parole supervision – with an emphasis on how it distinguishes from parole release – in the framework of the related modern practices. According to this chapter’s content, once parolees arrive at the parole establishment in order to check-in, there are considerably different conditions if comparing with the ones before the 1980s. Here, the authors describe effective rehabilitation programs that are able to decrease recidivism within the given scope, as well as to be appropriate in financial terms. They assume that the mentioned programs should be the main focus of current research and policymakers’ initiatives. Nevertheless, despite the fact that these programs are described expediently, there could have been more retrospective that would justify them even to a greater extent, which would be a good foundation for the following chapters.
Unfortunately, middle-aged women may run a risk of pathologic menopause. Therefore, it is necessary to take into account what specific features may aggravate the problem. The author of the post under consideration suggests that their patient with obesity and predisposition to breast cancer should take Metoprolol instead of Norvasc to illuminate the symptoms of premature menopause. Also, it would be of help to keep a diet and give up smoking. Such recommendations are bound to be efficient because they fully correspond to the patient’s needs.Admittedly, in case of menopause, a patient’s hormone levels and BMI are measured to find out whether there is a possibility of severe impairment. According to recent studies, “sex hormone levels after menopause are associated with women’s increased CVD risk later in life” (as cited in J Am Coll Cardiol, 2018, p. 2555–66). It sounds sensible that the patient under analysis should discontinue Norvasc intake because of its side effects, causing the risk of heart diseases in the long run because of reduced of motor activity. Being a beta-blocker, Metoprolol is sure to be an accurate decision for this particular case.However, the patient’s obesity status is better to be reconsidered before prescribing an exact diet. Banack and their team of researchers conducted a research, the results of which “demonstrate that a BMI cut-point of 30 kg/m 2 does not appear to be an appropriate indicator of true obesity status in post-menopausal women” (Banack et al., 2018). It means that fast weight loss can be useless and even harmful. The same concerns HRT application as the patient has a cancer predisposition. Doctors claim that “although less effective than HRT, SSRIs/SNRIs are demonstrated to reduce hot flashes and may be recommended for women who wish to avoid the risks of HRT” (Stubbs et al., 2017). Thus, HRT is not to recommend because it is generally believed to increase the risk of cancer.To sum it up, the author’s recommendations are likely to lead to a successful treatment of the symptoms of premature menopause. The suggestion to replace Norvasc with Metoprolol seems to be a reasonable decision. As far as HRT is concerned, it is of utmost importance to diminish the risk of cancer. That is why SSRIs/SNRIs may prove to be the right approach to hot flushes treatment. Still, the prescription of a diet should be reconsidered according to new data.
The Bhagavad Gita is an ancient Indian scripture that consists of 700 verses and is part of the larger epic Mahabharata. This book is one of the central holy scriptures of Hinduism and dates from the second half of the first millennium BC. e. The plot of the Gita unfolds within the framework of a conversation between Arjuna, the prince of the Pandavas, and Krishna, his guide, charioteer, and the supreme God incarnate. Krishna prompts Arjuna’s behavior patterns and helps to solve some moral expectations. The latter is connected with the need for the Pandavas to fight against the Kauravas. This paper aims to reflect on the Bhagavad Gita , one of the most outstanding books of the Indian epic.Arjuna exhibits characteristic traits, such as self-confidence, arrogance, pride. Arjuna demonstrates outstanding martial skills and is one of the best warriors. Krishna is the personification of the Supreme God and his traits include wisdom, humility, knowledge, and benevolence. The two characters have a close relationship: “Then, Madhava (Krishna) and the son of Pandu (Arjuna), stationed in their magnificent chariot with white horses yoked to it, loudly blew their divine conchs” (“Bhagavad Gita,” 2021, p. 13). Other characters are the Kaurava king Dhritarashtra and his adviser Sanjaya, secondary characters.The purpose of the author of the epic was to tell about the battle of Kurukshetra, where two Indian armies gathered to fight until the final victory. Arjuna asks Krishna to drive up to the center of the battlefield and finds those who will participate and those who want war – his relatives, friends, and teachers. Arjuna feels betrayed as he doesn’t want to fight and kill them. Full of doubt, he drops his bow and asks his charioteer Krishna many questions about the reasons for the war, the possibility of renouncing the battle, the correctness of his action, and ethical dilemmas.Thus, the reflection on the Bhagavad Gita, one of the most outstanding books of the Indian epic, was provided. The book is relevant, as it reveals eternal themes – morality, justice, a sense of duty, a feeling of love for one’s neighbor. The philosophical dialogue between Arjuna and Krishna touches on the most challenging ethical topics that apply to both war and peace. The characters discuss identity crisis, the purpose of life, the human self, and human temperament.

Economic globalization is an inevitable process due to many reasons, but many people argue that it has a detrimental effect on the development of many countries or even the entire world. Nevertheless, globalization positively influences the evolution of human society at large, although some adverse effects are apparent (Wade, 2004). First, it is essential to understand the benefits of economic globalization to embrace it rather than try to oppose it.Undoubtedly, economic globalization enables people to trade more efficiently and effectively as they have access to diverse resources and markets. An entrepreneur in every part of the world can offer products and services to people from other continents with the help of technology. The abundance of ideas contributes to the creation of new products making people’s lives more comfortable (Sen, 2012). Individuals, companies, and countries can collaborate to conduct complex projects.However, such aspects as inequality are often raised in relation to economic globalization. It is argued that globalization is a manifestation of western imperialism as rich countries exploit the resources of developing countries (Sen, 2012). As a result, the opponents of globalization argue poor countries become even poorer. However, it is found that globalization is not directly linked to poverty and equality (Wade, 2004). Poor countries’ governments’ inability to cope with corruption and the lack of flexibility to adapt to new technological and cultural realms leads to inequality. Moreover, Sen (2012) stresses that emerging countries can and will also benefit from economic globalization if specific measures are undertaken. Thus, technologically advanced countries must be responsible in terms of using resources (supplied by developing countries), and developing countries must be committed to change and social stability within their boundaries (eliminating corruption and other issues). All in all, globalization can make all societies better and even contribute to the decrease in inequality globally.
Transportation plays a leading role in global logistics; at the moment, a digital revolution is taking place in this area, the speed of which is increasing due to the epidemic that has arisen in the world. Digitalization is the factor that opens up new opportunities in logistics such as acceleration, restructuring of the business model, provision of an expanded range of services. The speed of change is such that logistics does not have time to rebuild and entails disruption of the supply chain. The activity of transport companies consists in continuous cargo flow. In order to avoid the suspension of global cargo traffic, it is necessary to digitalize the five existing modes of transportation. Although it is difficult to imagine a completely new type of transportation in the foreseeable future, the impact of new technologies (especially of AI) on the Big Five opens up many logistics opportunities.The attributes of the Fourth Industrial Revolution – machine learning and artificial intelligence, big data and the Internet of Things – laid the foundation for a new approach to supply chain management – Supply Chain 4.0 (Klumpp & Zijm, 2019). The point of growth was the initial development of AI-based cargo routing technologies by companies. Supply chains consist of links; the company has many such logistics links: suppliers of components (raw materials), manufacturers, logistics companies, distributors, warehouses, carriers, retail chains, etc (Bowersox, 2019). The business efficiency of all participants in the supply chain depends on the speed of this exchange and the quality of the transmitted data. With the advent
of the Supply Chain 4.0 era, the logistics of companies has become more predictable — facts, not a subjective vision of a person, have come to the fore (Klumpp & Zijm, 2019). Moreover, AI finds such interdependencies that a person cannot build, because there is no direct connection between the data, and the amount of data is huge.One of the most striking examples of the use of AI in the field of logistics is predictive analytics systems. The traditional approach to route planning is based on a limited number of factors that are largely static and do not take into account current changes. Using AI, the model can include data on traffic, weather, waiting time, loading and unloading speeds at specific points and at certain suppliers, the influence of specific company and customer personnel on the speed of delivery. Focusing on the data coming in real time, such a model will be able to build the optimal route with much higher accuracy and calculate the ideal delivery time. This means that at the same time it is possible to reduce costs and delivery times and increase customer satisfaction with quality service.At the moment, the global market is dominated by the unique model that looks like a combination of sales channels. The omnical model’s policy is set up so that the consumer should not feel the difference between an online store and an offline store (Wang et al., 2019). In this regard, the number of small orders is increasing, as well as the functions of stores that
“Edges of the Rainbow” was created by Michael Delsol and Haruku Shinozaki in 2017. It is a collection of photographs and personal stories of LGBT+Q community representatives from different parts of Japan. Michael Delsos is a French photographer who depicts the people connected with art creation, and his pictures are published in magazines and newspapers. He also participates in the exhibits where Delsol presents his work separately or with other photographers. Haruku Shinozaki is a journalist, and he explores the marginal communities and minorities in Japan, particularly LGBTQ+ community members. This book applies to a specific audience, such as social activists, representatives of minority groups, demographic researchers, and those who are interested to learn more about the experience of the marginal communities in Japan.The purpose of the work is to tell the audience about the experience of minorities in one of the most conformist and traditional countries in the world. The title of the book means the two different sides of the LGBTQ+ culture in Japan, implying that, on the one hand, it is a general topic that appears in books, shows, anime, the Japanese cartoons (Delsol & Shinozaki, 2017). On the other hand, underneath it, there is a certain amount of prejudice and conservatism, which is clearly depicted by the name “Edges of the Rainbow.”The confessions of the people whose stories are told on the pages of the book are intriguing and fascinating since, eventually, the person of different professions and class belonging can represent the LGBTQ+ community. Delsol and Shinozaki (2017) mention an Episcopal
IntroductionDue to rising meat consumption and decreasing farmland supply, creating alternate protein sources is pressing. According to Van Huis (2015), food security occurs when all populations have physical, societal, and financial access to adequate, secure, and healthier meals to suit their dietary requirements for an active lifestyle at all times. Globally, meat consumption is anticipated to rise by 76% between 2005/2007 and 2050 (Van Huis, 2015). Therefore, alternate protein supplements, such as duckweed, seaweed, and cultured meat and insects, would represent a dietary adjustment. This paper aims to critically analyze the various sources of meat and their biochemical compositions. Additionally, the essay highlights the advantages and limitations of edible insects as a source of protein.Sources of Meat and Their Basic CompositionThe various sources of meat, as discussed herein, including beef, fish, pork, and poultry. Beef is the flesh of cattle, Bos taurus, and is classified as red meat. It refers to mammalian meat that contains more iron than fish or chicken (Michael et al., 2019). Beef is mostly protein with various quantities of fat. Animal protein is often of excellent quality, including all nine necessary amino acids required for proper bodily development and enhancement. Beef includes a range of fats, generally known as beef tallow. Water, protein, fat, and ash are the four primary elements of fish’s edible parts. Liquids serve as a conduit for the movement of nutrients and molecules, with water constituting the majority of these fluids. Lipids are mostly composed of triacylglycerol and phosphoglycerides in fish muscle, both of which include nonesterified fatty
acids (Kiczorowska et al., 2019). Protein is the second most prevalent element in fish myocytes, often ranging between 16 and 18% (Kiczorowska et al., 2019). The eating patterns and reproductive cycle affect the protein content of fish tissues.Pork is the household pig’s (Sus domesticus) meat, and just like all meat, pork is primarily composed of protein. When dry, lean pork has a protein concentration of up to 89%, making it one of the most protein-dense foods available (Adamczak et al., 2018). Like other classifications of red meat, pork is mainly comprised of saturated and unsaturated fats in roughly equal proportions, thus an important protein source.The bulk composition of poultry flesh comprises copper, fat, water, iron, phosphorus, protein, and other nutrients necessary for proper digestion. Cooked poultry flesh contains between 25% and 30% protein, contingent on the section of the carcasses and the cooking process (Gumułka & Połtowicz, 2020). Poultry flesh is very protein-dense and is often recognized as a substantial source of high-quality protein and has more protein than red meat.Examples of Other Sources of MeatVenisonOther illustrations of where meat can be obtained include venison and chicken. Venison is a phrase that relates to deer meat, which is a type of red meat. Venison is an excellent source of zinc and includes trace levels of the majority of other micronutrients. This meat is a high-protein meal with a reduced fat and calorie content and B vitamins (Nagy et al., 2019). Venison meat is derived from mammals that can graze naturally in their native habitat. Chicken contains
Supervision is a process of knowledge exchange, social experience, and psychological support received by trainees in work, career, and professional development. It includes informal communication, usually between two people, over a long period, between an employee who has a large amount of relevant knowledge, wisdom, or experience, and an employee or student who has these qualities to a lesser extent. In this regard, the supervisors must have particular traits and specific demeanor to succeed in their activities.One of the essential personality traits of a supervisor that makes him the ideal professional is adaptability. Nowadays, almost everything is changing – science is developing by leaps and bounds, new technologies are being introduced every day, approaches to how students need to learn and how teachers need to convey information are changing. In such an environment, the supervisor must be flexible and open to new ideas and knowledge to meet ever-increasing demands. Davis (2020) notes that especially important are such human qualities of a supervisor as humanity, kindness, patience, decency, honesty, responsibility, fairness, commitment, emotional balance, and self-criticism, which become professionally significant prerequisites for creating favorable supervision relationships.The ideal supervisor is distinguished by the manner of communication. The ability to build effective and friendly communication is one of the most significant aspects of perfect supervisors who will never raise their voice or overstep the boundaries of what is acceptable in communicating with students. Beckett (2020) asserts that the supervisor must structure the work experience, transfer it to the young specialist, and clearly and consistently state the necessary information and
studying these points.Thus, based on the above characteristics of an ideal supervisor, a portrait of an ineffective supervisor can be drawn up. The traits of such an employee are partiality, inability, and unwillingness to perceive another point of view, different from his own, irresponsibility, incontinence in communication, demonstration of personal superiority, and indifference to the profession. Moreover, ineffective supervisors cannot communicate as they expect others to read their minds and meet their unspecified expectations. In other cases, they are incredibly boring to listen to when they try to communicate and convey their message to students. Moreover, such specialists love to criticize and, more importantly, they rarely praise students.The personality of the supervisor plays a crucial role in the successful or negative adaptation of students or new employees. Supervisors must not only have the appropriate skills, knowledge or experience, but also be able to communicate them correctly and on time to students and new employees. Therefore, not every person is capable of performing the functions of a supervisor. In addition to excellent proficiency in occupational skills, supervisors must possess versatile knowledge, be carriers of the key values of corporate culture, as well as have several personal qualities and a particular model of behavior.
The following project proposal considers a number of factors that makes a coworking space effective and productive through the means of design choices. In order to create a space that adheres to the values of the company and to the needs of its employees, certain features were thoroughly considered and integrated into the final design. These include the safety, health, and wellbeing of the employees, the elimination of social, environmental, and community issues, and the inclusion of appropriate spatial and design elements. As a result, certain components such as health and safety prioritization, adaptability, and sustainability were chosen as thematic guides for the project. Sustainability and health-related changes mainly affect the environmental aspects of the working space, while adaptability responds to concerns over social and communal conflicts.There are a myriad of features that can distinguish an effective co-working space from a dysfunctional one, but only four core characteristics are really necessary. First, the space must be inhabited by a community with either a like-minded purpose or attitude. While this is not a direct facet that can be controlled by interior design, the appearance of a space is likely to attract individuals that are more responsive to it. As such, a community found within a co-working space with an appealing yet productive appearance is more likely to function in a way that adheres to their overarching goals and ideals. Second, hospitality is integral to creating a space that values the wellbeing of those inside it. Similarly, while design does not directly create hospitality, the presence of better
lighting, friendlier colors, or non-claustrophobic spaces is likely to instill a more engaging atmosphere. Third, the space must be primarily designed to uphold certain facilities, such as specialized equipment or work spaces for certain professional operations. Fourth, business is essential not only for the main purpose of conducting production but also in the maintenance and correct workflow of the space.A number of factors within the design of a workspace can impact the health, safety, and wellbeing of employees. In order to maintain the health of those inhabiting such spaces, it is essential that a designer consider the things that usually cause a drawback on the wellbeing of employees. Though some changes may seem small, they may have a large impact on the physical health of those working in these spaces. For instance, making a staircase more accessible and easy to reach can encourage employees to take the stairs instead of an elevator for additional exercise (Kohll, 2019). It is also essential to consider mental well-being, as employees will spend a significant amount of time within the designed space. A primary concern is the lack of natural light, which has been linked to decreased physical, psychological health, and energy. The safety of the space’s inhabitants is also incredibly important as even non-hazardous workplaces may cause issues in the health of employees. Some common issues found within office spaces include poor posture as a result of seating and lack of good air quality. As such, the design of the space must account for ergonomic seating and working spaces
as well as ventilation that will be appropriate for a given area.In the case of co-working spaces, social issues can often stem from concerns regarding privacy, hierarchy, and personal necessities. Certain working spaces do not allow for employees to remove themselves from busy environments in order to be productive or require spaces to remain non-individualized. Similarly, certain working spaces make stratification of employees distinct through design, creating a sense of disbalance and inequality (Vijay, n.d.). As such, it is vital that co-working spaces are designed in ways that permit both collaborative and individual work. This can be achieved through the introduction of open spaces or conference rooms as well as work spaces that are isolated from main areas which are usually used for breaks or loud work. Cubicles are largely ineffective and more modern individualized work spaces are suggested, such as the placement of worktables or labs in more remote and quiet locations. If any distinctions are made between the workpaces of employees and managerial or administrative staff, they should not compromise on the comfort and visual quality of the employee work spaces.In an effort to make an office more environmentally conscious it is essential to consider the sustainability of its functions. Much of the detriment that working spaces cause to the environment currently are the result of the ease with which inferior but cheaper products are utilized and then discarded. As such, a design space that aims to curb such an issue will implement items, concepts, and functions that are sustainable, maintainable, and directly environmentally
to any necessary change, especially in accordance to the community inhabiting it. This can often manifest as multifunctional items, mobility, and the consideration of local cultural norms (Chang et al., 2017). Similarly, branding is essential in making the space unique and creating a company identity among the community associated with it.The design proposal considers all the aforementioned concepts within its creation while incorporating it into spatial planning and design elements. The project prioritizes open, but strategically organized spaces that make use of natural light, adequate ventilation, and the reduction of noise pollution. Elements that will be commonly seen within the research include organic, ergonomic, and appropriate furniture, tools, and other components. Similarly, multi functionality and sustainability is important in order to promote adaptability, environmental consciousness, and community prioritization. Materials and equipment were chosen based on their negative or positive impact on the environment. Certain other essentials, especially those that are usually disposable, were replaced with more sustainable or recyclable options where possible. The larger features of the design, or those that are expected to be in use frequently, also utilize mobility where possible in order to allow employees the option to individualize or increase the comfort of a work space. In conclusion, many modern design spaces createthe general appeal of the physical appearance and the functionality of a space for its original intended purpose, but it is also vital to encourage changes that facilitate other benefits. As such, this design project attempts to introduce these new features in a seamless and beneficial way.
Elon Musk is one of the smartest and wealthiest people on the planet. The engineer is considered the genius of the modern world. Musk achieved everything himself through hard work. Despite a difficult childhood, he stubbornly went forward and reached great heights. The primary mission of the Mask is to help humanity and improve all areas of life. His main virtues are his desire to work and create something new, listening to criticism, not being afraid of risks, and achieving great goals other people would not understand.Elon Musk faced many difficulties on the way to his current status, but this did not stop him. He started working at an early age, and at the age of 12, he created his first video game. Currently, the engineer works about 80 hours a week and follows the development of his two companies, which is admirable. Musk believes that working harder than others is the most critical key to success because life is short, and a person must do everything possible for a successful existence (Fernholz 16). He maintains that the ability to work should be so high as to achieve what some take years to complete in months. However, Musk says that not everything depends on performance (Higgins 35). The most important is the organization of hard work to achieve results. Musk works hard and does things that are different from many others. He believes that his competition in the market is less this way, and his constant work pays off better (Higgins 35). The engineer focuses on
creating innovative technologies with a small number of these products. Additionally, his ability to work depends on his passion for his work. If a person hates his job, he will never achieve high results and will quickly give up. Elon Musk entered the engineering industry with innovations initially not accepted by society (Musk 57). As a result, he almost went bankrupt but could avoid it through hard work. Thus, he listened to the criticism, understood his risks, and successfully coped with them.Despite earning money from his first projects, Elon Musk wanted more recognition for his technologies. In this regard, he was not afraid to take risks and sell his first companies for the sake of the new SpaceX and Tesla, which subsequently entered the world market. However, Musk’s ideas were initially on the verge of collapse, and he understood his risk when entering the market with new products. His ability to take responsibility even in such difficult moments is admirable. Elon Musk did not give up because of the initial failure of the company and put all his savings into the cause. It was a significant risk, as the entrepreneur did not know if his investment would pay off. However, at the same time, he advises taking on such responsibility at a younger age, when a person does not have to feed his family. At an older age, risk should be calculated more carefully, and savings should be left in case of failure. This approach causes respect for a person and highlights positive qualities in him.
more time a person has and the smaller his plan, the weaker progress he will achieve. This approach is admirable since the engineer does not buy time and justify his inaction. Thus, Musk continues to work, ignoring ridicule from the outside. At the same time, he always treats negative statements with respect and does not enter into controversy. As a result, Elon Musk achieved big goals, allowing him to become one of the wealthiest and most successful.Musk is admired for the many positive traits he brings to his work. First of all, he works hard despite the difficulties he faces. He constantly creates something new to improve humankind’s life and contributes considerably to technical innovation. He is thriving and famous since he always steadfastly accepts criticism and listens to every negative review. Moreover, he takes responsibility for his actions and understands that every risk can lead to the collapse of both companies. One of their main features of Musk is a global goal, which he seeks to achieve by all available means.
IntroductionThe Battle of Gettysburg in 1863 is considered a turning point in the American Civil War. The following year, the main leitmotif of the North’s military campaign was an attempt to stiffen Confederate defenses on all fronts and, if not to defeat them in a decisive battle, at least to deplete the South’s living and material resources and destroy its economy. Nevertheless, the Confederacy was not yet broken and was unwilling to admit defeat. In May 1864, the enemies met again at the Spotsylvania settlement, a series of cabins made strategically important by their proximity to the crossroads.Yankee Blitzkrieg. Wilson’s Raid Through Alabama and Georgia ReviewThe book Yankee Blitzkrieg. Wilson’s Raid Through Alabama and Georgia explores primarily the U.S. Civil War, highlighting significant figures and battles for one side or the other. One of these generals, reviewed and studied in this book, is Emory Upton, who made a tremendous contribution to the war effort (Jones, 2021). The book analyzes every action and decision the general made, step by step, and focuses on the battle of 1864, where Emory created a whole new type of offensive.MethodsIn order to understand Upton’s contribution to the development of strategy and combat tactics, it is necessary to pay attention to what factors he considered significant. From the text of the book and the general’s own reasoning, it can be seen that Emory Upton considered two factors to be fundamental to success on the battlefield. It is namely the number of soldiers and time in terms of the amount of it in
the enemies (Jones, 2021). From this point of view it is necessary to conduct a detailed analysis of his strategy, and to identify the reasons for the failure of the most significant battle in the history of the general.Results of FindingsThen, it was decided to throw units of General Governor Warren’s 5th Corps in support of Upton. Once again the choice proved unsuccessful, Warren’s men had already participated in a hopeless attack a few hours earlier that had ended in profuse bloodshed. The order to attack Confederate positions did not excite the troops (Jones, 2021). The soldiers were reluctant to advance, but when they entered a field littered with blue uniforms, they turned back and quietly occupied their trenches.It was at that moment that the fate of Upton’s men was decided. Taking advantage of the confusion among the Federals, the Southerners moved three infantry brigades to the site of the breach. Deployed in lines, the Confederates advanced on three sides toward the plucky colonel’s position. Fortified in the trenches, the Federals fought off fierce enemy attacks for hours, hoping in vain that backup was imminent. Upton simply could not believe that everything had gone to waste and that the successful breakthrough would end in nothing. Nevertheless, the Confederates succeeded in breaking the resistance of the irrepressible Yankees. The Federals lost more than a thousand soldiers, Colonel Upton himself was wounded, and was eventually forced to order a retreat (Jones, 2021). Keeping order, the shot regiments of Northerners left the dead-covered trenches and returned to their original
positions, bringing several hundred prisoners with them.Upton’s Strategy ResearchBefore the attack, Upton decided to inspect the formation to determine the weaknesses of the opponent and to determine which vector to take. Ultimately, the officer concluded that the main objective was to break through the fortifications, since the situation did not allow for bypassing or outmaneuvering them. It should be noted that the positions of the opponents were better fortified than usual, which made the task much more difficult. Then Emory Upton decided that a classic attack would be defeated by musket-wielding detachments. Then the general decided to divide the troops into four sections so that each had a width of three.At that time, the advancing infantry often lost formation and the attackers mingled into one unruly crowd. The general decided to deal with this problem not in the classic way through training, but by stealth. He gave each squad a tactical assignment that prevented soldiers from mixing among themselves and disrupting the strategic formation (Jones, 2021). After the breakthrough, the 121st New York and 96th Pennsylvania Regiments would deploy to the right and capture an artillery battery, while the 5th Maine would deploy to the left, extending the breakthrough area (Jones, 2021, p.88). The 2nd and 3rd attacking lines would enter the breach, while Vermont regiments would remain behind and act based on the situation. One point Upton stressed was that officers had been ordered not to allow soldiers to stop, even to help the wounded.Notably, Upton’s regiment was tasked with breaking through enemy fortifications. At
the beginning of the battle, Upton’s detachment came out of the woods and was immediately hit by a musket volley. Without stopping, the attackers rushed forward, crossed the open space in a minute, and rushed the fortifications. The barrage broke their line, then they were hit by the second volley, but did not stop, and the fight in the fortifications began (Fitzpatrick, 2017). The second wave of attackers broke through the line and the regiments began to turn left and right, widening the breach. So Upton’s objective was accomplished and the fortifications were destroyed. The remaining regiments immediately continued their advance, suffering fewer casualties because the musketry was destroyed or scattered. However, the plan was thwarted and could not be executed to the end, resulting in defeat. Upton accomplished his mission – he broke through the enemy’s fortifications and waited for Mott’s advance, not yet knowing that he would not be there. Meanwhile, the Southerners moved to counterattack, pushing their positions back (Fitzpatrick, 2017). Upton’s entire plan was based on the idea that additional units would be brought into the breach, but Mott’s attack was repulsed, and General Wright did not know how to proceed.Although the attack resulted in defeat, one cannot overlook Upton’s enormous contribution to infantry strategy. The fact is that such an attack alarmed enemy generals, who began to develop defenses against such attacks. Upton’s actions were extremely effective against infantry fortifications, which were very popular in ground strategies (Fitzpatrick, 2017). Thus, the general’s main contribution consists of new insights into the fight
against defenses and barrier units. His actions forced modern generals to reconsider both defense positions and attack capabilities (Fitzpatrick, 2017). In addition, tactical decisions at the time were made on the battlefield rather than analyzed afterward. With this in mind, Upton introduced the concept of unpredictable troops, that is, actions on the part of the enemy that cannot be predicted.While on the front lines, the commander of the 2nd Infantry Brigade, Emory Upton, watched the battle intently. In spite of his youth, Upton was considered an experienced serviceman: just before the war he graduated from West Point, began his service as a second lieutenant in the artillery, advanced quickly because of his ability and scientific mindset, and at Gettysburg was already in command of an infantry brigade (Jones, 2021). Upton suggested to General Grant, commander of the Army of the Potomac, that he abandoned the satchel and break the Confederate positions with a massive infantry attack on a narrow section of the front. The attack was directed at the weakest part of the enemy’s trenches, which due to their configuration became known as the Horseshoe of the Mule (Jones, 2021). The offensive was to be carried out by twelve reliable infantry regiments, arranged in a powerful assault column of four successive lines (Jones, 2021). The attack was to be conducted at an accelerated pace, turning into a run, while the personnel were strictly forbidden to stop and get involved in a firefight with the enemy.Knowing that no one would follow instructions in combat, Upton made sure
In humanism and human rights, personal dignity implies respect and a sense of worth and value inherent in every human being. In medical care and clinical ethics, this concept is associated with respect for the patient’s health, physical and psychological, as well as their emotional state, privacy, and self-perception (Kadivar, Mardani-Hamooleh & Kouhnavard, 2018). In a clinical setting, patients may feel dependent and vulnerable (Crump, 2019). It is a vital part of the professional values ​​of nursing to ensure the preservation of patients’ dignity and develop a delicate and respectful approach to healthcare (Sæteren & Nåden, 2021). The challenge to advocating for dignity in the medical environment is that patients and caregivers do not always have a universal understanding of human dignity. Its concept changes depending on the person and the circumstances. The promotion of human dignity is essential in the care of palliative and end-of-life patients who require special treatment and an attentive approach. Thus, nurses play a critical role in providing the environment and protecting the personal dignity of their patients.In nursing, the fundamental principles of healthcare include ensuring respectful, positive, and kind treatment of patients and dealing with their stress, nervousness, or fear with understanding and empathy. Handling the patient requires the nurse to have emotional intelligence, compassion, and commitment while performing all medical procedures in a timely and professional manner (Crump, 2019). Particular attention should be followed with aged patients. Sometimes, preserving the human dignity of retired patients is associated with providing them with a sense of greater autonomy and support. In many cases, elderly patients need intense listening and choice. A friendly and respectful conversation and a personal approach will help to establish such interaction.
The TED Talks are illustrations of bio-psycho-social-spiritual developmental issues which ultimately create circumstances in which certain people do not feel fully included in society. For example, Smith (2015) refers to the differences correlating with raising a white and a black child. Abdel-Magied (2014), on the other hand, exemplifies how a piece of clothing changes the way people treat, view, and evaluate Muslim women. It is certain that discrimination starts with bias, which is a layered concept. An article published by New York Times (2016) refers to the experiences of non-white people in the US, which often correlate with the lack of feeling of inclusion.This is also perpetrated by bias, which creates specific overviews in which people tend to favor a group of people over another one. The bias may be automatic, ambiguous, and ambivalent depending on its characteristics and how it manifests in terms of people’s opinions on certain groups of individuals (Fiske, 2022). While such incidents have never been personally experienced, it is certain that the lives of people I know have been affected in terms of self-esteem and confidence, which can often be negatively impacted because of discrimination. I would like to explore racial bias due to its relevance in today’s day and age, namely how it manifests on structural levels.
Due to rapid population increases, human-generated conditions have caused significant disruption in the earth’s biosphere. Increased population has caused an increase in deforestation and the burning of fossil fuels. According to Brusseau et al. (2019), the world’s population is progressively increasing at a rapid rate. This increase has promoted encroachment of forested land for human settlement. Forest clearance causes climate change, soil erosion, and flooding. Moreover, the burning of fossil fuels due to the development of technology has led to increased emissions of carbon dioxide, which destroys the ozone layer, worsening the problem of climate change. According to research done on the effect of fossil fuel on the environment, fossil fuel is the leading cause of the environmental population (Li et al., 2019). Population pressure and technology have caused significant disruption of the biosphere through deforestation and fossil fuel use.The earth faces three major environmental crises: overpopulation, climate change, and global warming. Overpopulation is the leading cause of the two other problems. Overpopulation has been caused by the rapid increase in population in developing countries. The rapid population leads to an increase in the clearance of forests and industrialization. The gases produced in these industries disrupt the ozone layer, increasing temperatures. This situation with high temperatures causes the melting of glacial ice and increased precipitation promoting global warming (Tebaldi et al., 2021). Continued global warming slowly leads to changes in climate over time. The continued increase in population, global warming, and climate change has caused an environmental crisis.In conclusion, human beings should take good care of their planet. They should use birth control measures to control the rate of population growth. Moreover, governments should encourage the use of renewable energy sources to fossil fuels to reduce the effects of climate change and global warming. More effort should be given to planting trees to encounter the impact of deforestation (Al-Ghussain, 2018). Every person has to take care of the environment. Therefore, every person should make it their role to conserve the environment and save the world from environmental crises.
Environmental protection has been at the forefront of people’s minds for a number of years recently, with a lot of effort going into protecting and conserving the planet we all live on. The reduction in personal waste, as well as systematic change both work towards the same goal of reducing carbon emissions and protecting the sanctity of natural resources. Many politicians and activists notice and understand the importance climate action has on securing a future for the entire human population. However, there are also significant problems that still have to be solved, many of which might uproot the entire foundation of modern economy. For the most prime example, it is interesting to explore the fossil fuel industry. The term used to describe a combination of oil and petroleum-related businesses, fossil fuel has been continuously cited as being dangerous for the planet.1 (Fossil fuels and climate change: The Facts).The acquisition of oil, as shown by research, as well as its processing, emits gasses into the atmosphere, creating pollution. In addition, oil fuels cars and other types of vehicles, all of which contribute to the global pool of CO2 emissions. 2018 research has cited fossil fuels and the connected industries as 89% of the reason responsible for global CO2 output ( Fossil fuels and climate change: The Facts ). This means that a number of companies and organizations involved in this industry have an incredibly large influence over the wellbeing and prosperity of the planet. Furthermore, it has been noted that the oil firms knew and understood their
that their precursor is tyrosine. All three mentioned neurotransmitters are synthesized through enzyme conversion. So, in the next paragraphs, the process of an enzyme conversion for dopamine, norepinephrine, and serotonin is briefly explored.As such, for dopamine, the first step of conversion involves a reaction with tyrosine hydroxylase, which is a catalyzer (Purves et al., 2018). DOPA, created after this step, interacts with DOPA decarboxylase (or aromatic L-amino acid decarboxylase). The result of this reaction is dopamine, as shown in Figure 1. Therefore, dopamine is a biogenic amine neurotransmitter synthesized through the two-step conversion of tyrosine.Next, dopamine substances might be converted into norepinephrine via an enzyme. Precisely, dopamine β-hydroxylase is necessary for the next step of catalysis (Purves et al., 2018). The synthesis is shown in Figure 2, where norepinephrine is formed from dopamine. Hence, norepinephrine is a catecholamine, meaning that it is synthesized in the process of enzyme conversion with tyrosine being a precursor that needs three steps of interaction for a successful reaction.Finally, serotonin synthesis is different from that of dopamine and norepinephrine. Its precursor is the amino acid tryptophan, which is at first hydroxylated and then catalyzed by tryptophan hydroxylase. Figure 3 depicts the synthesis of serotonin in two steps that have been mentioned. In this way, serotonin is a biogenic amine neurotransmitter, which precursor is tryptophan that undergoes two-step catalysis.
Evidence-based decision-making necessary for efficient work enables practitioners to search and explore different studies formats, such as cohort or randomized controlled trials. The method determines the scope of participants, the hypotheses formulation, possible outcomes, and even ethical considerations (Wang & Kattan, 2020). A well-prepared practitioner should obtain theoretical knowledge about all research types to distinct them and use them for gathering information in professional circumstances. This paper aims to discuss, compare, and characterize cohort studies and randomized controlled trial formats.The cohort study is a valuable method for healthcare research because it analyzes several hypotheses and compares the outcomes simultaneously. Indeed, multiple samples (cohorts) are followed longitudinally to reveal the results of interventions (Teague et al., 2018). Another method selected for this assignment is the randomized controlled trial (RCT) which is based on dividing participants into groups without considering any specific factors. In such studies, half receive the intervention to be tested, while the rest get alternative treatment (Naidoo et al., 2020). RCTs are helpful when biases and other influences on a result must be minimized, and it allows to study and measure specific actions or products.The fundamental difference between the cohort study method and RCT is how the sampling is performed. The former requires considering the participants’ characteristics to form groups and study intervention, and, in contrast, the randomized format makes researchers eliminate any individualized factors from the equation (Naidoo et al., 2020). Another significant distinction is the timing because cohort studies require to be conducted for a prolonged period to retrieve sufficient evidence to make
and survey and the expected correlation-based results (Rezigalla, 2020). Moreover, the research does not provide evidence for cause and effect, yet the conclusions tend to contain significant statistical data about the variables (Rezigalla, 2020). Correlational design can be selected for quantitative studies where the goal of identifying the relationship between variables does not require direct intervention.A research pyramid is a valuable tool for healthcare professionals to select the right design applicable to the desired outcomes. The scheme levels the evidence-based on its weight for decision-making and can be used to identify if the results are worth considering (Thampy et al., 2019). The cohort study design is in the middle of the research pyramid, meaning that the quality of conclusions is not the highest, yet sufficient for gathering information for further decision-making.All types of research are valuable for evidence-based decisions in nursing, and a practitioner must be able to identify and select them according to their needs. The cohort study design is necessary for retrieving the information about the longitudinal following of specific populations. The RCT type provides sufficient data about certain interventions and eliminates the biases that weaken the conclusions. The research pyramid is a tool to select the study to conduct or explore based on the strength of its evidence.
IntroductionWith the development of the gaming industry, growth of its target audience’s amount, and the spreading of the Internet, electronic sports are becoming more and more popular competitive activity. Electronic sports are often referred to as eSports or egames, and imply organized video gaming. The primary concept of eSports can be seen as a competition of teams against each other in tournaments for a prize, usually in the form of cash and a title. From this perspective, eSports are similar to traditional sports competitions.The Transition of Games from Singleplayer to MultiplayerThe history of transferring games from a hobby to professional sports began in the 1990s. It is connected to the rise of the accessible worldwide web. The Internet has connected gamers; thus, it enabled competitive gaming and contributed to the growth of the popularity of games. Then, in 1997, the world’s first eSports event, the Red Annihilation tournament for Quake game was conducted and held about 2000 participants. A short time after this competition, a gaming league named Cyberathlete Professional League (CPL) was formed. In 2017, the total Esports prize money amounted to $110.6 million from a total of 3765 tournaments.Gamers used to compete playing through game consoles before the industry went online. Playing with another player via the same console offline is still a common way to have fun with friends and relatives living in the same place. It also enables to deepen into competition due to specific atmosphere complementing the process, which is also why many tournaments prefer to gather teams in one room
adjusted for playing. In addition, few games do not support online multiplayer mode still. However, all the other benefits are attributed to playing games online. It is simpler to connect with people through the word via Internet, and more and more games have a well-functioning multiplayer.The Discussion of Two Popular Multiplayer Games and Their ConceptsBackground and Development of League of LegendsLeague of Legends is currently one of the world’s biggest eSports that emerged from the Warcraft 3 mod Defence of the Ancients. In 2005, Feak and Mescon created a company named Riot Games. After fours years, the idea of League of Legends came alive and became popular for both amateurs and professionals Free-To-Play game. This game is compared to DOTA, which has a similar concept. Currently, League of Legends counts millions of active players, hundreds of teams, and dozens of regular tournaments.The concept of League of Legends and the viewer or gamer perspectiveLeague of Legends is a Multiplayer Online Battle Arena (MOBA), which is usually played with two teams consisting of 5 players. This concept enables the high competitiveness of the process and requires teamwork for the win. Each team has its primary building – the base and towers that are defensive structures. The objective of a team is to destroy the opponents’ main building. Isometric battle arena has three lanes, a jungle between them, and a river dividing the map between two teams. Gamers choose champions with unique abilities they will be playing for the next game. Depending on the champion, each player has a
role they usually stick to for the benefit of team play. Gamers have access to the internal market, where they can purchase items that strengthen their characters for gold, which is earned for killing opponents’ champions and neutral enemies. Professional players try to fully express the strengths of their characters and not opponents to use their weaknesses, such and vulnerabilities to some form of damage, low health points, low speed, inability to buy artifacts fast, and others.With respect to the viewer and gamer point of view, League of Legends has an isometric perspective for them both, as it is the most convenient for such type of strategy-like games. Viewers and gamers and switch between locked and free cameras and choose whether it is fixed on a specific character or not. The two differences between ones who watch the game and one who plays are the opportunity of the last to see through the fog of war through every champions’ “eyes” and the additional statistics. Simultaneously, players can only see what is revealed by their and their allies’ champions.Background and Development of ValorantValorant is another popular Free-To-Play AAA game supported by Riot company. The genre of the game is tactical team-based FPS shooter. The game’s development started in 2014, and it was officially released in June 2020, after a closed beta period. This game’s producers were inspired by a series of shooters Counter-strike. What is interesting about Valorant is that Riot pays great attention to storytelling, making every of the game’s champions more than a playable character
but rather a living person with their background and unique features. Even though this innovative game intended to gather the strengths of its close competitors has begun to grow activity not so long ago, it is already popular enough to be claimed as a future of multiplayer shooters.The concept of Valorant and the viewer or gamer perspectiveValorant is slightly similar to League of Legends, as it is also focused on the competition between two teams. However, a broad list of differences confirms the uniqueness of Valorant’s concept. The goal of each team is to win 13 rounds, which is done by killing all the opponents’ champions (agents) or detonating the “spike” (bomb). The game can be compared with such tactical shooters as Counter-strike, Overwatch, and Apex Legends. All the playable characters have unique abilities that determine their role, which can be duelist (DPS class), initiator (intending to initiate fights), or sentinel (supports). After choosing a unique agent, there is a buy phase, during which players can buy guns and abilities, and then, a round begins.Valorant is the first-person shooter that implies that a gamer does not see his own character but only the weapons he holds. During a game, a player does not track his opponents until they are visible for the agent they are playing for. However, while viewing a match, it is possible to see red figures indicating an opponent team’s agents, while the perspective stays the same (first-person). It is possible to make a camera free to have an overview of the entire
battlefield without sticking to one of 10 players.The Platforms to Play the Games, Selection of Characters and the Use of AvatarsIt is possible to list all game platforms to provide an overview of what is actually can be used to play before proceeding to opportunities Valorant and League of Legends provide to their audiences. It includes: Personal computers (PC), consoles, mobile, virtual reality, arcade, television, web browser, and streaming.The most popular and oldest platform to experience video games are PC, suitable for most games while enabling customization of a gaming place with different accessories. It is not surprising that both of the games are available to play via this platform. The mobile platform, including both Android and IOS based devices, is expected to support Valorant in the nearest future, while League of Legends is already available for gamers to download and play.Riot Games company also promises to launch both their games via consoles in a year or two. It is possible that television is also can be used to play those games, for instance, with the help of the connected PC. However, it is likely that neither Valorant nor League of Legends will be ported to arcades or will be available to play via a web browser.Speaking about picking characters in Valorant and League of legends, the system is the same for both games. All the player has a set of playable characters, more than 140 for League of Legends and 15 for Valorant. There is a specific order for picking champions or agents that depends
on the mode of the game. For instance, in a regular game, a player can choose any hero at any time, if only it is not banned by others (every player has a limited number of votes to ban one or another champion). In a tournament or in certain game modes, teams pick a champion each by order. The only rule that is always must be adhered to is that it is not possible to pick the same hero twice. Basically, all these nuances are needed for the balance of the games and their fairness.With respect to players’ avatars in those games, each player has an avatar of the champion/ agent they play for, known as summoner icon. They are used to determine who plays for a specific hero that enables to coordinate team play. Moreover, League of Legends enables players to use and customize their personal avatar intended to personalize a gamer’s profile for their convenience and a better experience. Avatar creator enables to choose among a broad range of facial features, hairstyles, and outfits. Although it is not essential for gameplay, it does influence the attractiveness of a game for players.ESport Tournaments and Gaming as a Career15 years ago, no one could imagine that playing games would become a lucrative career opportunity. About 80% of teenage girls and 95% of teenage boys play video games, and it reveals the close attention of the younger generation to the global eSports market. The other representative indicator of the industry’s potential is that it has grown to
$1.9 billion by the end of 2018. Speaking about the earning of gamers, in 2015, four people made more than $1.73 million, while members of many other professional teams had more than $100,000 in income. ESports players earn money in prizes for winning events, advertising, sponsorships, and salaries. Although not many gamers make sums enough for living, with the maturing of the industry, so will be growing players’ incomes. There is only one way in eSports to become a valuable professional; it is to improve skills and to win. Then, there is a chance to join a team and sign a contract with its owner that will eventually lead to global tournaments and opportunities to win high prizes.The above-mentioned eSports tournaments are competitions between two teams consisting of 5-6 players each. The most popular games to duel in are League of Legends, Overwatch, Fortnite, Dota, Valorant, and others. Most amateur and professional events cost about $10-20 to spectate or participate, while a ticket to the League of Legends Championships can cost up to $70. The prize or the jackpot for winning teams can vary from a few thousand to millions dollars. Such events take place around the world, including cities like Lo Angeles, San Francisco, Seoul, Tokyo, Shanghai, Hong Kong, and others.The Investing Companies of ESports and the Development of Mobile versions of the GamesThe above-mentioned mobile devices are one of the platforms many games can be developed for or ported into. While League of Legends can already be downloaded as a mobile game, it is
makes gaming companies attractive for potential investors. Some of the investing companies (ones having esports stocks) are Activision Blizzard Inc. (ATVI), a video game developer known for Overwatch and Call of Duty, and the owner of Grand Theft Auto Take-Two Interactive Software Inc. (TTWO). It is also can be recommended to consider Electronic Arts Inc. (EA) known for Apex Legends and FIFA and Roblox Corp. (RBLX) owning a platform enabling users to make their own games.ConclusionCurrently, more and more people are becoming engaged in eSports as viewers or players, which makes the industry, which began as a casual hobby, grow to a huge market. With the spread of the Internet, multiplayer obtained popularity, making competitions, such as amateur and professional tournaments be world-class events with high prices. Riot company, the famous game developer, is known for League of Legends, MOBA game, and Valorant, tactical team-based FPS shooter. The common platform for playing those games is PC, but League of Legends has a mobile version, and both of the games are expected to be ported to a console. Playing games is a solid career opportunity now, as many professional players have high income due to prizes, salaries, and advertising. Some of the largest companies even have their own stock, which anyone can invest in. Predictably, the industry will be growing further, which brings to the conclusion that eSports will not only continue to be popular but will even rise in activity.
that (Corey, 2015). By that time, the trust between the client and Kiara had already been established, but it began to fade after that situation. Eventually, the customer left the therapy and never returned.To understand the situation with Kiara, one should analyze the ethical code and client’s rights and then understand which of them were followed and not followed. While she explicitly stated the confidentiality right and the therapy’s process description, she forgot to mention the limitations of confidentiality and other sides of the practice, such as financial considerations (Corey, 2015). In addition, she only said those descriptions verbally, without making a written agreement or consent form. As her colleague, I would advise Kiara to ensure that a client will fill out the informed consent form next time. If she did not make it, I think it will not be good to mention it: she only must ensure that the client’s personal information will not be shared. In my opinion, it was an excellent alternative to her action: it would save the trust between her and the client. It would be ethical, as Kiara would not actually compromise the customer and, thus, should ensure that they will not stop trusting her.
Richard Mason (1986) summarizes the most important ethical issues of the information age in a single acronym – PAPA (privacy, accuracy, property, accessibility). Privacy stands for the level of exposure of personal information to other users. Accuracy refers to the accountability for errors in information and the subsequent choice of the person to blame. Property deals with the question of ownership of information and the means of its transmission. Finally, accessibility underscores the opportunity and conditions of obtaining information. Analyzing real-life examples is essential in understanding the exact nature of each ethical issue.I personally experienced the inadvertent invasion of privacy when a professor instructed students to bring laptops for presentations. We connected the laptops to a projector in order to make the audience see the slides for themselves. Unfortunately, everyone also observed the layout of the desktop, which contained numerous shortcuts, some of which were of delicate nature. This situation was also indicative of access problems, as the lack of computer equipment in the classroom forced the students and the professor to use their own devices. Had there been a computer provided by the administration, no violation of privacy or the necessity to resort to personal gadgets would have taken place.Another episode highlights the issues of accuracy and property of information. At some point, I had to take a seasonal job with an employer who paid most of my salary in cash in order to minimize taxes. However, when I contacted him for subsequent tax deductions, I suddenly realized that most of the transactions were never officially registered, which was a violation of accuracy. I tried to learn how much money he had actually saved by paying in cash. However, my employer framed my inquiry as a violation of his informational property, which was completely reasonable.
It is important to note that the core ethical principles of the Belmont Report clearly outline three core elements. In accordance with the report, these include respect for persons, beneficence, and justice (Office for Human Research Protections, 1979). The case study presents a situation where the researcher, Dr. Jones, failed to comply with the ethical principles by justifying such measure with risk-benefit assessment in favor of children. It is evident that all three principles have not adhered to some degree or extent.Firstly, Dr. Jones failed to comply with the principle of respect for all persons. The report states that the given principle is rooted in “the requirement to acknowledge autonomy and the requirement to protect those with diminished autonomy” (Office for Human Research Protections, 1979, para. 12). In other words, since the subjects of the research were drug abusers, they could fall into both categories. By not informing the parents about the primary purpose of the research, Dr. Jones exhibited disrespect for all persons, which include drug abusers and child abusers as well. Parents are autonomous agents who must be informed about the research in which they are deciding to participate. A similar case can be observed in the Milgram study, which also involved deception and non-provision of the research objectives. The main reason is that subjects were led to believe they were to administer shocks for fake test subjects, and they were the primary research interest in order to observe the impact of authority on obedience (Yanow & Schwartz-Shea, 2018). In both cases, there is
to each person an equal share, (2) to each person according to individual need, (3) to each person according to individual effort, (4) to each person according to societal contribution, and (5) to each person according to merit” (Office for Human Research Protections, 1979, para. 21). The researcher did not ensure the presence of justice by not properly informing the parents on the primary purpose of the research. All other research projects involving human subjects provide clear and succinct information to the participants, but the researcher decided that the subjects of the given study were not entitled to such transparency. Therefore, it was unjust of Dr. Jones to conduct such research, and no risk-benefit assessment can provide sufficient justification for it.In conclusion, one should be aware of three fundamental principles of ethics. The latter includes respect for all persons, beneficence, and justice. Dr. Jones primarily failed to comply with the former two, but the last one was also dismissed to a certain extent.
On the one hand, the concept of ethical relativism provides a unique opportunity of finding the middle ground and introducing a compromise into the discussion of a contentious moral issue. On the other hand, ethical relativism incorporates quite a range of contradictions and challenges to resolving moral concerns. Therefore, considering the essential objections to the idea of ethical relativism is vital to the development of a cohesive argument.The attempt at establishing the idea that no objective truth can be located in any circumstances and that every situation could be seen as ethically ambiguous is the main issue that ethical relativism suggests. The challenge of maintaining some semblance of moral standards and differentiating between the objective good and the objective evil increases exponentially with the incorporation of ethical relativism into the discussion, as s Pojman warns (MacKInnon & Fiala, 2017). Therefore, the continuous focus on ethical relativism may blur the boundaries between right and wrong.Additionally, ethical relativism may turn out to be self-contradictory after closer consideration of its key postulates. Namely, Pojman explains that the core argument of ethical relativism may imply the creation of a strawman, therefore, leading to a logical fallacy and failing to represent a real-life scenario fully (MacKInnon & Fiala, 2017). Specifically, Pojman explains that the application of moral relativism often implies distorting the opposing perspective, thus, representing the proponents of a specific viewpoint as those on the extreme side of the debate (MacKInnon & Fiala, 2017). Although adhering strictly to a specific ethical position without considering the effort to examine the opposing standpoints does have a distinctive air of rigidity, it still does not approach the notion of ethical extremism, which is why ethical relativism fails to represent the opponents properly. Thus, ethical relativism has a range of dents in its framework, which must be considered closely prior to selecting the theory as the foundation for decision-making.
Culture is one of the main characteristics of human behavior that can be shaped through the existing beliefs, norms, and values. There are several ways to learn the importance and impact of culture, and the two most common approaches are cultural relativism and ethnocentrism. For a long period, ethnocentrism was the norm for understanding the context of a culture in human interactions. The main idea is that someone’s culture should be considered a standard for measuring other cultures. In other words, researchers aim at comparing similarities of different cultural elements (beliefs or practices) through the prism of a particular culture. It is enough to use one culture for analysis and rely on its origins for judging other cultures. However, this method is usually associated with incorrect or subjective assumptions about behaviors. To eliminate provocative biases and questions, cultural relativism was introduced as a possibility to assess cultures using their specific standards instead of focusing on the basics of one culture. Thus, the main difference between cultural relativism and ethnocentrism is the role of foreign cultures in evaluation.There are many examples of ethnocentrism and cultural relativism in the modern world. One of the most evident illustrations of ethnocentrism is the American belief that all people, regardless of their origins, should know and speak English as it is the world’s dominant language. Using the same example, cultural relativism helps explain a variety of languages across the globe and justify this diversity as an attempt to recognize the validity of choices and moral rights. In this case, cultural relativism may be too extreme because it is difficult for people to communicate in different languages. There has to be a rule or a standard beyond cultures that allows individuals to cooperate internationally. The processes of globalization and industrialization are inevitable today, and cultural relativism may be inappropriate when equal conditions should be created for some activities.
Horror films have become one of the fundamental genres of cinema, the popularity of which is not inferior to the other styles. The reason for it is the specific reaction of the target audience, namely a powerful emotional impulse. Moreover, it becomes a psychological relief for some persons, which helps to distract from one’s problems. Horror films are not the modern version of public lynching; they formulate a way for people to obtain a strong emotional response through fear.Fear is a primary human emotion, which manifests itself as an instinct for self-preservation, namely a reaction to a potential threat. It may seem strange for one that people pay money to feel such an unpleasant emotion while watching horror films. However, in the essay Why We Crave Horror Movies , Stephen King argued that people aim to re-establish their feelings of essential normality (King, 1). In other words, one tries to reset their ordinary feelings for many reasons. Some are distracting from problems in this way, others get a dose of adrenaline, and sometimes horror films become a way to throw out their emotions in a movie theater and not on other people.Any art must evoke emotion and promote the individual experiencing ethical pleasure. Watching horror movies seems to have nothing to do with the ethical aspect. However, the success of horror movies, to more extent than other genres, depends on the audience’s reaction (Glasby, 7). The strong reaction makes horror films stand out in terms of the criteria for assessing art. Indeed, few people can lag behind absolutely indifferent when watching scary scenes. Besides, the powerful emotional response makes horror films so popular and successful nowadays.To conclude, one identified that horror films do not formulate a form of modern public lynching. They are the one’s method to receive the bright, emotive response. There are various reasons for it, beginning from obtaining psychological discharge and ending to distracting from reality and one’s urgent problems. The audience’s reaction is the key point to evaluating the horror film’s success and why it is considered art.
meet everyone’s needs. In addition, the lack of knowledge of how the programs process data and make conclusions does not help eliminate the risks.In turn, the possible ways of reducing this type of bias attributed to present-day facial recognition algorithms are to prevent their implementation in legal proceedings and police activity in general and introduce practical improvements. The former means accepting responsibility for decisions, and the latter suggestion is multi-faceted and should begin with updating databases to increase their variety and conducting independent assessments to confirm efficiency. By adopting these measures, bias based on race and gender can be addressed over time, and the appropriate quality of operations can be guaranteed.The mentioned ideas seem crucial for promoting proper use of technology; however, they can not only increase the precision of programs but also resolve the challenge concerning surveillance and racialized minorities. This standpoint is based on the above consideration, according to which accountability for decisions should be clearly established. This change can be performed if the algorithms work correctly, and minimizing or eliminating bias, in this case, is possible if internal and external evaluations correlate with each other. In this way, the future of this field in terms of its suitability for investigations is conditional upon the efforts of specialists in resolving the existing issues to address major concerns of Nakamura and Browne.
genetic testing allows establishing which genes are damaged and how severe the occurrence of albinism is.In the majority of albinos, the lack of melanin leads to such symptoms as the absence of pigmentation in skin and hair. As such, people with albinism usually have very brightly colored skin, translucent irises, and blond or white eyelashes and eyebrows (Liu et al., 2021). Furthermore, the limited production of melanin also results in eye disorders, for example, crossed eyes, sensitivity to light, astigmatism, or involuntary eye movements (Liu et al., 2021). In some cases, the person’s vision might become severely impaired, even leading to blindness.As albinism is inherited genetically, it can only be acquired if an individual’s parents possess malfunctioning genes. For a person to develop this condition, both parents must have albinism or carry the relevant gene (Liu et al., 2021). As a result, this disorder cannot be fully treated, but some methods can alleviate the severity of the symptoms. Although some strategies have shown great promise in eliminating gene malfunctions, their further efficiency for the broad population is yet to be proven (Liu et al., 2021). Therefore, diagnosed individuals primarily rely on sunglasses and sunscreen to protect themselves from the ultraviolet rays and might also receive surgery to reduce involuntary eye movements.
the detailed analysis of particular cases. Woking with the practicing specialist allowed me to learn about the insights and difficulties of this profession. The mentor’s experience, which she shared with me, helped me match the theoretical knowledge and practice.The most valuable experience I have gained is the knowledge of working with the representatives of different minorities. The nurse practitioner is the one to ensure the rights of protection, education, and equal treatment for patients of various religions and races. Such cases require profound communication knowledge and experience to build trustful relationships between medical providers and patients. This experience is highly relevant because it empowers me to work further in providing better healthcare services. Helping patients from different minority groups, especially those of Arabian origin, get high-quality treatment is one of my primary aims. Thus, the gained experience and knowledge allowed me to advance from both theoretical and practical perspectives in my physician assistant career.
Face recognition is the automatic localization of a human face in an image or video and, if necessary, identifying a person’s identity based on available databases. Interest in these systems is very high due to the wide range of problems they solve (Jeevan et al., 2022). This technology is a biometric software application capable of identifying a person by comparing and analyzing templates based on facial contours. This is possible because each person has unique facial contours (Kumar and Munish, 2019). In this regard, it is essential to understand what this technology is used for today and whether it poses a danger to people.Technology DevelopmentMachine vision and face recognition technologies have been developing very actively since the middle of the last century. However, they have only reached a significant level and begun recognizing faces with almost perfect accuracy (Wang et al., 2020). Technology’s rapid development was preceded by several reasons that together have become critical factors in its improvement. First, powerful computers could cope with processing significant amounts of information. Secondly, databases appeared with photographs of many people, which made it possible to develop machine intelligence (Adjabi et al., 2020). The third factor was the leap in developing neural networks, which play an essential role in face recognition.Possibilities of UseThe technology is applied in a large number of spheres of human activity. These include the security and safety sector, bank card verification, online payments, forensics, mobile applications, searching for photos in large image databases, and tagging people on social networks (Li et al., 2020). All this
that private corporations or the state may use personal photographs of people for their purposes without their consent (Guo and Xiaoguo, 2019). This, in turn, raises ethical questions about the use of facial recognition. It is still being determined whether people lose the right to privacy when many cities worldwide have many facial recognition cameras installed on the streets (Raji et al., 2020). On the one hand, this helps to improve security in cities significantly. However, it can also make people feel uncomfortable because of the feeling of constant surveillance.ConclusionPrograms that rely on face recognition may not be confidential or leak personal data. This is possible, for example, if one of the databases with pictures and videos of faces is hacked. In this case, the attacker can use them at their discretion. Based on the above options for applying the technology, this can become a severe problem. However, there are positives, such as improved city security systems and more convenient use of financial applications. In this regard, the technology requires further study and improvement to be fully used.
The core idea of the collision theory is manifested in the notion that reactions only occur when particles collide with each other. In addition, the colliding particles must carry enough energy for the reaction to occur. The overall orientation of the particles is also critical for the reaction since they need to be oriented accordingly. In short, according to the collision theory, the factors affecting reaction rates include collisions, orientation, and activation energy levels. When applying the framework, the key elements are a steric factor, collision frequency, and activation energy per unit, as well as other important chemical variables, such as temperature, concentration, and constants (Gottfried 418). Therefore, the collision theory is comprised of three core factors as well as additional variables.It is important to note the fact that activation sources can be different. Reactions between ions in solution occur with small activation energy, which is required to dehydrate the ions. Reactions between free atoms and radicals do not require activation energy since atoms and radicals are active species (Timberlake 107). In homogeneous gas reactions, the main source of activation is collisions, the proportion of which is determined by the Boltzmann distribution law and increases with temperature. Activation can also be caused by external causes, such as the absorption of light quanta during photochemical reactions, the action of electrical discharges, the impact of electrons, a-particles, neutrons, and other radiations (Gottfried 423). In heterogeneous catalytic reactions, the sources of activation can be the changes that occur in the reacting molecules when they are adsorbed by the catalyst
AbstractIt has been more than a decade since first commercial flight and the Airbus A380has not experienced the success once thought it would. Many airlines have retired the A380 and opted for smaller planes for various reasons. However, it is unknown why the production of the plane has stopped. This research is conducted to find out the reasons behind the failure of the production of Airbus A380. Three methods of data collection, that is using documents and records from the company, survey and interview, were used. For the survey, one hundred and twenty participants agreed to be involved and three others for the interview. After analysing the data, some of the reasons behind the failure include inaccurate predictions, size, as well as its inefficiency. With the current situation of the fuel prices and reduced number of passengers, having a plane that uses four engines is not economical.IntroductionAirbus Company decided to come up with a spacious plane model named Airbus A380. Throughout the entire world and among all aircrafts ever constructed, it is ranked as the largest. In 1990, with the intention of fighting for the market share with Boeing 747, the company announced its intentions of coming up with the plane. To start the process, it launched more than ten billion programme ten years later. The initial model was revealed in 2005 in Toulouse with its first flight in the same year. Issues with the electrical wiring resulted in a 2-year delay plus the development cost rose to eighteen billion pounds. The company received its certificate
from EASA as well as the United States Federal Aviation Administration in 2006. The aircraft was delivered to Singapore Airlines as the first delivery in 2007 and started service a few days later after delivery. The production of the aircraft climaxed at thirty annually in 2012 as well as 2014. Nevertheless, the company admits that the twenty-five billion dollars it invested in the project cannot be recovered. Airbus announced in early 2019 that production of the aircraft would end in 2021 after last delivery to Emirates.More than a decade after first air travel for commercial purposes, several airline companies have opted for stopping the use of the A380 plus its production is no longer going on. In spite of the plane being spoken so highly of as compared to others including the Boeing 747, it has remained unsuccessful in the market. Apart from focusing on the plane alone, it is essential to identify the issues that hinder the air travel sector and thus airlines. Understanding the issues can help in pinpointing the root cause behind the issue of Airbus A380. The air transport industry is huge and supports so many people working as staff of various airline companies. It also contributes a large portion to the world economy. Regardless of the many challenges until the COVID-19 pandemic emerged, it was on the path to success. It is correct to claim that even though the pandemic adversely affected the industry, it has started recovering from the impact left by the pandemic and may get back to where
it was prior to the pandemic. This paper looks at the review of the problems facing the airline industry as a whole, the methodology used in the research, findings on the failure of A380 production and the analysis.Narrative BodyReview of the Airline IndustryAlmost fourteen years from the initial commercial flight, many airlines have retired the A380 and its production has stopped. Even though the aircraft is an engineering masterpiece, it was not successful in the market, as suggested by (Nelson, 2020). Apart from just focusing on the aircraft alone, it is important to understand the challenges that face airlines. The air transport industry is a universe in itself and encompasses a huge workforce plus contributes a major portion to the world economy (Arjomandi et al., 2018). It was set for significant growth, regardless of the many challenges until the COVID-19 pandemic emerged (Gupta et al., 2020). It is correct to claim that even though the pandemic adversely affected the industry, it has started recovering from the impact and may get back to where it was prior to the pandemic.The air transport market has been on the rise and appeared to have success before the pandemic hit. In 2018, a study revealed that the world aviation market outlook had been positive within a few years earlier (Jackson, 2021). The study report shared that at that moment, the world air transport industry supported more than sixty five million jobs plus contributed more than two trillion dollars in global financial activity (Jackson, 2021). Moreover, it stated that a free-trade
strategy would aid further the growth in the sector. It will also come to record more than five trillion dollars in financial activities by 2036 while also guaranteeing close to one hundred million job opportunities (Jackson, 2021). The sector plays a key role in the modern society but it is essential to point out that it has its own challenges. From struggling with recessions to governmental regulations as well as terrorism to labour shortage, such issues can lead to airline reducing or even stopping production.Fuel efficiency is among the main challenges facing the airlines. Availability of fuel as well as costs remains a significant financial factor impacting the airline (Belhadi et al., 2021). High prices have a direct influence on the financial portfolio of airlines. With the increase of airline companies every year, the prices of fuel have skyrocketed which has resulted in a vicious cycle. Other alternatives for fuel have failed to be impactful and thus maintaining efficiency has remained a challenge for the industry.The global economy is also a challenge for the sector and thus the airlines. The status of the global economy is a primary issue in the market. For instance, the 2008 economy crisis had a major effect on the sector. As the economy takes a hit, travel as well as fuel prices rise while the number of passengers reduces. The effect of the recession on other sectors such as tourism is also a critical factor impacting the sector. As the travel companies seek development in different nations plus explore new ways,
they have to remember the market situation as well as volatility in the regions. Different nations have unique economic situations which airliners need to consider when they plan for global expansion.The experience and comfort of a passenger while on a journey is also a challenge in the sector. The air transport sector is service-oriented and its success is reliant on how great the passengers feel, as suggested by (Ika et al., 2021). The reason why this is a challenge is because there is always a group of passengers who are not contented with the services. Nevertheless, this is something that has resulted in companies being seamless through the entire air travel. To accomplish a state whereby all passengers are satisfied with the services is difficult because no customer is alike. Surveys on customers and their feedbacks show that not every passenger has a great travel experience, as suggested by (Ika et al., 2021). For example, an IATA survey in 2017 showed that only about fifty-six per cent of North American customers were okay with the travel experience. This shows that companies will continue to struggle to impress all their customers at once.Airline infrastructure is also a huge challenge for the airlines worldwide. Airports require consistent upgrade of its infrastructure such as terminals, runways, hotels, lounges, among others (Li et al., 2020). There is a significant competition in the area of infrastructure as it determines how even customers view a company. To sustain the image of an airline and stay ahead of others, onsite facilities like the
aircraft ground handling systems will require regular renovation. While doing that a few times can be beneficial to a company and increase the number of customers, doing it regularly requires a huge financial investment (Ika et al., 2021). Even more crucial is the fact that an aircraft needs a regular upgrade and maintenance too. This is because the safety of the customer depends on the condition of an aircraft. Having faulty aircraft seating or doors is liable to get an airline sued. Infrastructure is among the most crucial challenges of the market as carriers are support to maintain available fleet plus also guarantee to buy the latest ones while ensuring lowering costs as well as fuel efficiency.Worldwide congestion is also a major challenge facing airlines around the world and thus the sector. Several years ago, the air travel was a luxurious event, which a few rich people engaged in (Ika et al., 2021). It is no longer the same and more people are traveling using air transport which has resulted in overcrowding of many airports globally and flight delays. Majority of flights appear to be full, the terminals congested, and the skies overcrowded with the excessive number of aircrafts. Air traffic plus airport congestion are significant challenges facing the market which appears to lack the solutions. Carriers are still struggling to make seamless trips for customers and thus remain to be a viable problem.Advancement in technology is among the challenges the airline sector is facing. Technology is a double-edged sword that in spite of the good
it has brought to the world, the increase on its dependence has resulted in vulnerability of the sector. For example, if there is a software problem, the operations may remain crippled until resolution. If there is inadequate financing, upgrade of infrastructure like the communication system may prove impossible which might result in the failure if the whole system.Terrorism which is a security issue is among the major challenges of the modern times. Tragedies from past times have resulted in fear of many passengers as well as staff (Woo et al., 2021). Even though, terrorist attacks have reduced recently, it still remains a threat as companies in the sector have to remain vigilant always. The rise in fear results in rigorous check-ins plus consequently longer lines as well as delays. It has in the past forced companies to develop highly secure screening methods as well as equipment (Woo et al., 2021). Even political conflicts between countries can be viewed as a major challenge of the industry. Irrational regulations by one nation because of conflict can make it hard for carriers to transport passengers conveniently as well as move cargo in the international territories. Lastly, without doubt, climate changes as well as environmental problems are issues that prove to be a challenge to airlines globally. It is something that has gone on for a long time spanning for more than three decades.MethodologyIn this research, the main research question is the reason behind the failure of the Airbus A380 production. Knowing this, it is important to find the right
method of data collection that suits such a study. Studying about an aircraft involves much review of available data in documents and records as well as online surveys and interviews. I decided to contact the Airbus Company through email and ask for a chance to access some documents and records that would help in my study. After they agreed, it was a great opportunity as I analysed the data myself and therefore it was difficult to obtain incorrect information. The advantage of using documents in such a research is that it allows an individual to obtain consistent information so that analysing it becomes easy.After studying the documents consisting of information of the plane, I decided to use survey method. Conducting a survey can be difficult and has its limitations especially if people one requires response from are far. Therefore, to counter this, I settled for the online survey which can accommodate anyone and from any distance. Through the use of mail services, I reached out to over one hundred individuals who work and those who worked for the air travel company to get their opinion on the issue. While sending the surveys to them, I also attached another document that explained how I had accessed their contact information and what the research is about as well as their information would not be revealed to anyone else. Ensuring that they do not have the fear of being exposed empowers them to give unbiased responses.I collected and analysed the responses through the mail services too as nearly ninety-five
per cent of participants submitted their responses. After the survey, it was important to interview a few managers of the company to get their opinion on the issue. Most of them declined as they cited their employment status as a concern. However, three executive managers accepted but in the condition it does not involve questions that would put their jobs at risk. After the interview, the information gathered was enough to come up with reasons why the production stopped.FindingsThe aircraft is among the largest commercial models with many claiming it as the largest one with the capacity to hold up to eight hundred and fifty-three passengers at once. Being the lone commercial aircraft to have more than full deck, it is considered an engineering masterpiece (Woo et al., 2021). Since the first flight more than a decade ago, it has two hundred and fifty one orders with one hundred and twenty-three belonging to the Emirates Airlines. Nevertheless, several airlines have already started retiring the aircraft and one of the reasons is the pandemic. Airbus has closed production plus it is testing last aircraft after fourteen years of production.Among the reasons behind failure of its production is that the aircraft is too big. It is noteworthy to know that many companies did not order for the aircraft because of its massive size. With a wingspan that is bigger than several Boeing 737s, it proved impossible to fill the plane to full capacity on a trip to a particular route. Due to size, the aircraft could only land
at particular airports which needed renovation including having wider gates that could accommodate the plane.Another reason is that the aircraft was inefficient and that because of its size, more issues of inefficiency arose, as suggested by (GENG & BHATTACHARYA, 2021). The plane needed four engines to remain on air which is highly inefficient for companies because of the amount of fuel burning. The smaller Boeing 787 with two engines consumes five thousand and four hundred litres of fuel every hour while A380 consumes more than twice the amount every hour. After the tragedy in 2001, fuel costs skyrocketed which decreased the popularity of four engine aircrafts. Nevertheless, Airbus had already invested much in the study plus development of the model that it appeared too late.Another reason is the Airbus company inaccurate predictions of the aviation market. At the start of the twenty-first century, the company projected that the future of aviation was going to be big size long-term airlines like the Boeing 747 (Ferreira et al., 2020). According to the company, smaller planes would utilize less preferred routes and airports to a hub airport plus fly to a second hub airport and then to another less preferred airport. Nonetheless, the trend did not last and the hub-and-spoke model as it was known no longer was popular. In addition to above reasons, it can also be said that the recent pandemic to hit the world, COVID-19, has resulted in a significant drop in air travel demand. The lockdown restrictions as they began to be implemented by different
reason for this was that many saw the practices of New Criticism and the practices of biblical exegesis as interrelated.In paragraph thirteen, the author discusses the relationship between Christianity and art. The author says that many Christian philosophers have always given the arts an important place in the life and learning of the Christian. Some of them also believed that creativity and imagination were a gift from God to men (Dockery 446). The text also emphasizes that the arts are necessary for people who want to strengthen their connection with God. Art played an essential role in the history of Christianity because it gave a visual representation of the lord’s teachings. The author also calls the craving for art the hallmark of Christians. At all times, parochial schools have had a place for art instruction. To this day, it holds an important place in the hearts of Christians around the world and serves to demonstrate the diversity of faith.
The authors of the article Feature engineering for crime hotspot detection state that cities with a complex infrastructure require ‘smart’ systems of crime detection; they claim the hotspot detection approach to be highly effective. The reviewed article focuses on two cities: San Fransisco (US) and Natal (Brazil); the authors analyzed “spatio-temporal and urban features” of both cities in order to evaluate their significance in crime detection (Borges et al., 2019, p. 2). Such factors as the number of odds per area, prosecution rate per area, road types, police types, and time features have been taken into account for a proper depiction of the criminal hotspots (Borges et al., 2019). The interlink between particular infrastructural specificities and areas with high crime records has been analyzed (Borges et al., 2019). In addition, “the urban space was discretized into cells using the k-means clustering algorithm”; after that, the cells were “labeled into criminal hotspots or inconspicuous cells” (Borges et al., 2019, p. 4). As a result, this approach allowed the researchers to create a map that uses various urban features to effectively detect criminal hotspots in relation to both cities’ infrastructure.The main findings of the reviewed study have shown that there is a clear interlink between particular urban features of the city and crime levels. Such specificities as the capacity or length of a road or pedestrian area play an essential role in forming local crime hotspots (Borges et al., 2019). In addition, the features of a particular city were also considered. Thus, the “presence of college in the area” had a correlation with local crime levels in Natal (Borges et al., 2019, p. 8). Thus, the method of city infrastructure analysis, together with the hotspot detection approach, has proven to be quite effective.
The virtual exhibition that I chose to visit is the one at the Smithsonian National Museum of American History, exploring the American food culture from the second half of the twentieth century up to the present day. The exhibition presents five different sections, each of which is devoted to exploring a particular phenomenon. Julia Child’s Kitchen explores the impact that a legendary cook Julia Child made on the way Americans viewed cooking, transforming the art of cookbooks and becoming one of the biggest television stars along the way. New and Improved! The section provides insight into how attitudes about an improved way of living alongside new technologies influenced the food culture in postwar America. Resetting the Table expands on various sources that contributed to the Americans’ thoughts and feelings about food – from immigrants’ cultures to activists’ principles of life. Brewing a Revolution speaks about brewing in the United States, and Wine for the Table communicates how with no wine traditions beforehand, America eventually sparked a revolution in the wine industry in the 20th century.When it comes to identifying the fields of social studies this exhibition is related to, it is linked to communication studies and history. By visiting different sections and reading about factors contributing to the alterations in American food culture, one develops an understanding of how important it is for us to communicate with one another. Without ideas brought by Americans to their country from abroad and unique manifestations of different cultures that immigrants aim to preserve, it is hard to imagine how
non-traditional classroom way – it is like a trip down memory lane. The way in which the exhibition’s format can be used is to encourage intergenerational communication. Since all information provided covers the second half of the 20th century, parents and grandparents of students, as well as other relatives, are certain to remember these times. Home assignments may include family members sharing their stories or giving feedback on how events covered in the exhibition have affected their lives in terms of eating culture. In this way, students are to remember this lesson’s contents since they will have a sort of a personal connection to at least some of the information.In my opinion, students tend to be engaged in what they are presented with when information is delivered in an entertaining way. Exhibitions such as Food: Transforming the American Table are great at capturing a student’s attention while giving them a unique history lesson. When one looks at photographs capturing processes that resulted in a cultural phenomenon or familiarizes themselves with images of artifacts of a particular time period, they are likely to not look away. At least less likely than while listening to a lecture – no matter how interesting – or reading a paragraph in a book. Therefore, such virtual field trips are incredibly useful in a classroom.
of insurance for one employee has more than doubled. A significant part of the population remains uninsured, and the proportion of such people is growing (Jankowski et al., 2021). The insurance market provided by employers is extremely monopolized, which hinders the mobility of labor resources and creates conditions for discrimination of patients both before and after the conclusion of an insurance contract.My opinion is that the current medical system is characterized by unresolved interaction between the public and private sectors of the economy. Even though the state allocates huge sums to the industry, it does not have effective levers to control the prices and costs of services and drugs. As a result, medicine that is almost completely given into private hands, although it meets American ideals, turns out to be prohibitively expensive.
OutlineThe presentation will begin with a detailed description of psychotropic medication and the possible risks related to its use during pregnancy. The research will offer a thorough review of the consequences of using psychotic medicines during pregnancy. The paper will then address the use of folic acid during the pregnancy period, which is an essential vitamin that prevents abnormalities. In this segment, the report will address the recommended doses and anticipated benefits of use.Furthermore, the paper will explore toxicity of folic acid and symptoms of the drug overdose. Additionally, the paper will review the impacts of folic overdose during pregnancy. A case study within this project will help elaborate on using folic acid supplements among women using psychotic medications. The findings of this study will help the researcher come to recommendations to improve the understanding of the relationship between the use of folic acid and psychotic medicines during pregnancy.Psychotropic MedicationPsychotropic medications describe any drugs that affect the users’ behaviors, perceptions, moods, and thoughts. It is an umbrella for different medicines, including mood stabilizers, antidepressants, antipsychotics, stimulants, and anti-anxiety agents. Psychotic drugs are vital tools in the society that helps promote wellbeing, since mental health and illnesses affect our daily livelihoods. These psychotic medications do not cure mental illnesses but rather help suppress the symptoms that might interfere with the therapy. Indeed, the drugs take the edge off and allow the patient to develop skills to cope with and better manage their mental health. Additionally, the psychotrophic medicines do not work instantly but take weeks before a
patient experiences their full effect.Risks of Psychotropic Medication during PregnancyAlthough the evidence on the risks of prescribing psychotropic medications remains limited, studies have linked exposure to antidepressants during pregnancy to malformations and long-term developmental outcomes. The drugs also cause neonatal and pregnancy complications, such as low birth weight, spontaneous abortion, persistent pulmonary hypertension of the newborn, developmental disorders, autism spectrum disorder, and neonatal serotonin discontinuation symptoms (Samochowiec et al., 2019). Niethe and Whitfield (2018) also note that exposure of the fetal to lithium during pregnancy increases the risk of cardiac malformations and other congenital disabilities. Hence, psychotropic medications may have a wide range of adverse impacts on the unborn child. The use of psychotic drugs during pregnancy can also cause long-term neurobehavioral sequelae, direct neonatal toxicity, and teratogenic effects. However, of the growing concern is the risk of untreated mental disorders, which can influence the fetoplacental integrity and the development of the central nervous systems of the fetus. Hence, weighing the benefits and risks of using psychotic medicines during pregnancy is essential.Consequences of Using Psychotic MedicationDespite the risks these medications might pose to the unborn baby, these drugs help promote mental well-being for pregnant mothers suffering from different mental illnesses. They do so by adjusting the level of brain neurotransmitters or brain chemicals like serotonin, norepinephrine, dopamine, and gamma aminobutyric acid. However, the side effects linked to these medications are more pronounced. Commonly reported side effects to include exhaustion, nausea, blurry vision, nightmares, headaches, trembling, and dry mouth. According to Goldberg and Ernst (2018), psychotic agents
cause massive weight loss and other gastrointestinal complications. Therefore, psychotic medication can cause both mental well-being and adverse health effects to the user.Folic AcidFolic acid is a synthetic form of vitamin B called folate that promotes the manufacture of red blood cells. The vitamin also facilitates the growth of the baby’s neural tube into the spinal cord and brain. Folic acid serves as a dietary supplement that the body converts into folate. Some people use folate in food fortification since it is more stable during handling and storage. However, folate is a vital component that enables the body to make RNA and DNA and the metabolism of amino acids, essential for cell division. Although the vitamin occurs naturally in some foods, the recommended daily intake of the vitamin among pregnant women cannot be met through foods alone.Recommended DosageThe Institute of Medicine Food and Nutrition Board of the National Academy of Sciences recommends all expectant mothers take a 400 mcg dose of folic acid afore and after the perinatal period to inhibit congenital infirmities (Centers of Disease Control and Prevention, 2021). However, the user can consume up to 600 mcg between the fourth and final months of pregnancy. For the folic acid to be helpful, women should take the vitamins daily, starting a period before she becomes pregnant.Components of Folic AcidIt comprises inactive ingredients like lactose monohydrate, stearic acid, sodium starch glycolate, and microcrystalline cellulose. The folic acid supplements contain three large sub-components: glutamic acid, para-aminobenzoic acid, and pteridine ring. The glutamic acid serves as an amino
acid that the body can synthesize by itself. These components of the folic acid contribute to the growth of maternal tissues and hemopoiesis during pregnancy.Benefits of Folic AcidFolic acid helps reduce the plasma concentration of homocysteine during pregnancy. According to a study by Shiralizadeh et al. (2017), folic supplements decrease homocysteine levels during the prenatal period. Reducing plasma homocysteine plasma levels and protein oxidation helps condense oxidative pressure and prevent the commencement of illnesses like a congenital abnormality, hypertension, and other sicknesses that emerge during the prenatal period resulting from oxidative stress. The intake of folic acid supplements is vital in different metabolic pathways, promotes nucleic acid synthesis, growth, and healthy development of the fetus.Additional Benefits of Folic AcidBesides the impact of folic acid use on protecting against neural tube defects and other mental illnesses, it can also safeguard the mother and the unborn child from adverse health outcomes. The supplements reduce the risk of premature birth and miscarriage. According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (2021), the intake of the recommended dosage of folic acid during pregnancy reduces the risk of low birth weight, poor development in the uterus, cleft lip, and palate. Among pregnant women, the intake of folates diminishes the risk of heart disease, stroke, some forms of cancer, Alzheimer’s disease, and pregnancy complications like preeclampsia. Hence, the intake of 400 mcg during pregnancy may positively impact both the mother and the unborn baby.Women who Need more FolateHealthcare providers recommend consistent intake of folic acid supplements among women who have a
higher risk of giving birth to a baby with neural tube defects. The at-high risk women include parents with neural tube effects, history of the flaws within the family, diagnosis with type 1 diabetes, and if the mother takes seizures and epilepsy medications that affect the folate absorption. Medical professionals should prescribe the dosages with care to pregnant women with various lifestyle diseases since the medicines can affect the treatment and control of other illnesses like seizures. High-risk women should take 5 mg of folate every day, within is ten times higher than the dosage recommended to lower-risk women. However, the women should take these medications under medical supervision.Toxic Dose of Folic Acid1000 mcg of folic acid intake is more than twice the recommended dietary allowance of 400 mcg. Indeed, a folic acid overdose occurs from taking a toxic level of folic acid supplements other than consuming too many folate-rich foods. Although the overdose can benefit a specific group of people like the elderly, the practice may negatively impact the users’ health. Consuming more than 1000 mcg of folic acid every day may have no benefit to the pregnant woman but can pose severe health damages.Symptoms of Folic Acid OverdoseThe development of excessive intake of the folic acid supplement can cause hypersensitive reactions, gastrointestinal issues, and difficulties sleeping due to irritability, hyperactivity, excitability, and inability to concentrate. Moreover, the overdose also causes psychotic behaviors, depression, masking the deficiency of vitamin B12, and derails the absorption of zinc in the gut (Shiralizadeh et al., 2017). Other indirect
impacts entail seizures since the medication decreases the functionality of anticonvulsant drugs among the users. Hence, the overdose of folic acid may have adverse health impacts on the users. Common folic acid overdose signs include gastrointestinal difficulties like gas, nausea, bloating, diarrhea, and abdominal cramps. In extreme cases, the overdose may result in irritability and depression.Consequences of Folic Acid Overdose among Pregnant WomenThe excess intake of folic acid supplements can use adverse side effects like slower brain development for children and fastened mental decline in older women. The extra intake masks the vitamin B12 deficiency, which consequently causes irreversible brain damage, megaloblastic anemia, and thus, speed age-related mental decline (Bailey et al. 2020). Supplementing with too much folic acid increases insulin resistance and slows down children’s brain development. People who take more than 1000 mcg of folic acid stand a higher chance of developing cancer later in life. Altogether, the excessive intake of folic acid during pregnancy may affect the child’s brain development, mask a B12 deficiency, speed mental decline, and increase cancer recurrence.Meta-analysis Case StudyBender et al. (2017) carried out meta-analyses to assess the influence of folate levels on the functionality of psychotic medications. The study is a meta-analysis exploration that carried out a statistical analysis by combining the findings of multiple scientific studies. The researcher entails a collection of reflections about folates among pregnant women with mental illnesses. The reliance on several experiments allows Bender et al. (2017) to establish a statistical significance across the studies with conflicting results.Study BackgroundBased on the analysis, people
so it did not explain the variance of personal study effect sizes. Additionally, the study explored the affiliation between folate levels and depression, and thus, the findings cannot infer casualty. Bender et al. (2017) did not include scientific experiments that measured folate with cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) methods. These limitations can have a detrimental impact on the validity and reliability of the study results.RecommendationsMedical scientists should consider and explore the interaction between folic acid supplements and psychotropic medications during medication. There is a literature gap in the published data on how folic acid intake during pregnancy might affect pregnant women on psychotropic drugs. The research will close the current knowledge gap and denote research areas for future scholars.Moreover, future studies should also explore how higher or lower doses of folic acid affect the effectiveness of psychotropic medications. Indeed, there is an increased need for how underdose and overdose of folic acid supplements influence the efficacy of psychotic drugs among mentally ill pregnant women. Future studies should also collect data from pregnant women from different cultural background. The findings of such future studies will help enhance the overall well-being of pregnant women and reduce the overall cost of care. The results will also leave a substantial impact on the current body of the literature.
Biomedical research includes direct interaction with individuals, and rules exist to set boundaries for studying subjects in a morally appropriate manner. After terrifying experiments conducted on humans during World War II, ethical regulations were established to regulate scientific work and eliminate harm or disrespect to the participants (Piasecki & Dranseika, 2019). History revealed that although rapid technological progress is impossible without research, respect for subjects must always be shown regardless of how it might complicate the process. The latest studies include ethical considerations and peer-reviewing boards also check if the biomedical studies have doubtful aspects in their methodologies. This paper aims to discuss the impact of the history of research ethics on modern approaches and the protection of the rights of human subjects.Ethics are vital for biomedical research because their methodologies include direct intervention into an individual’s private space, body, or mental health conditions. The history of regulations began with the Nuremberg Code established in 1948 which declared that no study could be conducted on a person without their voluntary consent (Dawson et al., 2020). Another significant part of the research ethics in biomedicine is the Declaration of Helsinki which provided the guidelines which, for instance, prohibit the conduct of studies without prior laboratory testing on animals (Piasecki & Dranseika, 2019). The regulations address main principles such as respect, beneficence, and justice through informed consent, risk assessment, and fair outcomes prognosis. Learning the history of research ethics impacts the view of biomedical studies by providing the understanding of the priority of human rights over any scientific
became possible through the precise team-building around a solid central structure. His anecdotal decision to pay his repair workers for the time they rest rather than the time work to ensure that the assembly line remains functional for as long as possible is a case in point. The key to success lay in charismatic leadership that relied on shared values and clear, motivating priorities that guided the structure.Overall, the case of the early 20 th -century Ford Motor Company is one of the most prominent examples of successful team-building at the dawn of corporate studies. Henry Ford was able to create a fully functional mechanism that relied on a solid structure that paved the way to efficient production and distribution patterns. Subsequently, all links of this supply chain saw strong benefits of the organizational efforts made by Ford and his team. While it was not perfect, Ford Motor Company provides an important lesson for today’s research into organizational structure.
Ford Motor Company presents a clear and concise business strategy that consists of four key elements. In particular, the company strives to improve people’s lives, strengthen the bonds between communities, and make our planet healthier ( Ford , “Our Purpose”). Therefore, it is important to hire employees who will be committed to these elements of corporate strategy. Aligning their talent with the company’s strategy would demand clear communication; as such, an HR specialist must recruit capable people and build an atmosphere of trust and cooperation among them. In addition, the employees must be motivated — in this regard, it would be necessary to maintain high job satisfaction rates through friendliness, fairness, and adequate pay for their work.These tasks are accomplished on multiple levels within the typical HR Department. For instance, the U.S. Bureau of Labor and Statistics offers two variants of the HR Department job positions: Human Resources specialist and Human Resources manager. The HR specialist screens candidates conduct interviews and introduce new employees to their professional roles ( U.S. Bureau of Labor and Statistics , “Human Resources Specialists”). The HR manager operates on a strategic level by planning, coordinating, and directing recruitment efforts for the whole organization ( U.S. Bureau of Labor and Statistics , “Human Resources Managers”). Consequently, the HR manager is usually required to have several years of experience in a related occupation and receives considerably higher pay. Given these facts, I would prefer the position of an HR manager since it offers better pay and implies significant influence over matters critical for
Coglianese, 2021). The study’s primary goal is to obtain a forecast of the overall unemployment rate, using the authors ‘ value-factor model.As a result of the research, the authors use basic modeling to determine the peak and its estimated duration. According to researchers, the number of people unemployed for more than 26 weeks peaks in December 2020 at 4.2 million people (Chodorow-Reich & Coglianese, 2021). The rise of very long-term unemployment peaks around the present time, namely at the beginning of 2022. Based on their analysis, the authors also assume a historically rapid recovery of the labor market. That is true: in some areas, there is already a decrease in unemployment by 35 percent or more (Raifman et al., 2021). In addition, many studies point to an increasing trend of remote work.I like the Chodorow-Reich and Coglianese study because the authors propose a new three-stage factor flow modeling approach to predict the duration distribution of unemployment. The article presents numerous graphs explaining the operation and features of their model. For example, the heterogeneity of re-employment after dismissal dramatically affects the unemployment rate. Chodorow-Reich and Coglianese analyze other studies on the topic and put forward their predictive model.
Four Seasons Riyadh hotel competitorsFour Seasons hotel is a five star hotel that fosters prominent competition within Saudi Arabia’s hospitality industry. The main reason for optimal overlap against competitors lies in the ability of establishing major outliers concerning service delivery system. According to researchers, it is the responsibility of indicating major outliers that enhance the development of advantages within the key framework (Wan & Rob, 2017). The lack of institutionalized mainframes regarding the structural enterprise risks client dissatisfaction.Four Seasons Riyadh hotel business descriptionFour Seasons hotel is a hospitality industry sector that offers dynamic services to enhance client satisfaction. The diversification of certain features boosts the value of purchase and render the prominent essence of brand positioning (Wan & Rob, 2017). The establishment of competitive advantages fostered the intensification in acquiring significant market share. The main economic issues within the mainframe enshrine pricing, social spectrum, style, performance index, fuel optimization, brand, space, and safety that influence patronage. Primarily, the concept of buyers’ intention is a framework encompassing an interplay of distinct entities to steer satisfaction.Four Seasons Riyadh establishment fosters significant competence based on the optimal options for leisure activities within the region. The illustrations of distinct variations of services enhances customer satisfaction and worthiness of the purchasing price (Lu & Saloomeh, 2019). The diversification of entities plays a vital role in determination of competitive advantages against other hotels. It is crucial to indicate the managerial strategies that enhance performance in the company’s operations. The intensification in business activities is an issue that involves the intersection of market

Gender identity and stereotyping begin the moment a child is born. The first question asked by relatives and friends is, “Is it a “boy” or a “girl”? Society has already formed a classification based on the two genders. The two genders have identifiable features, mainly contributing to gender identification and stereotype. They include body shape, hairstyles, walking styles, clothing types, voice, etcetera. These can be said to be some of the main identification attributes that society forms to identify the two genders. We can define gender identity as “the ability for one to label their sex accurately” (Bergin & Bergin, 2019). Various complex concepts play an integral part in the gender identity in children.One of the concepts is the distinctive qualities and features that define us in our gender and how comfortable we feel. The other is how we define ourselves and are proud to identify with our gender. The conformity and content in our gender is also a critical concept. These concepts play a critical role in how people live their lives from childhood to their adult life. Starting at infancy and in toddlers, in my opinion, it is arguably to state that infants can create categories, and one of them is gender. At a very early age, they can distinguish between males and females using some of the features earlier discussed. They progress to differentiating between a boy and a girl as they start to label people like girls and boys as early as two years of age. It is also critical to note
point, and they tend to become sexist.Middle childhood is argued to be the stage that children tend to bully or punish others who step out of their gender boundaries. However, boys show more aggression in their gender boundaries than girls. Children tend to lessen their sex and gender rigidity regarding stereotypes at the end of elementary school (Halim et al., 2018). They begin to understand the bigger worldview in gender stereotyping and how it will affect their adult life between about 7 to 15 years. As they enter adolescence, children become more content with their gender and feel more typical (Bergin & Bergin, 2019). This phase of their lives plays a critical role in better understanding their gender, values, and characteristics that define them.Moreover, I believe children’s “gender crisis” ends in adolescence as they understand themselves and become content with their gender. However, for others, this is the start of their internal gender conflict when forced overtime to conform to their gender-type values. Youngsters also drop activity stereotyping in adolescence as they become comfortable getting involved in activities deemed to be associated with the opposite gender.
In the Heat of the NightThe idea behind Supertom can be described as a trope used to make a black character heroic. The result is a peculiar image of a magical black, who is a minor or even almost background character, whose mission is to help the protagonist guide him. To show the audience that ethnic minority characters are not bad people, Supertom takes a step forward to help others. They usually enter into the life of a much more privileged and, in particular, almost always white, the central character, and in some way enrich the life of this main character. Some examples of Supertom include Lucius Fox from Christopher Nolan’s The Dark Knight, Michael Clarke Duncan in The Green Mile , Bagger Vance in The Legend of Bagger Vance, and Uncle Remus from Song of the South.Thus, a black character is endowed with high achievements and extraordinary positive characteristics, and Supertom is obtained. Mr. Tibbs is Supertom as he “is smarter than all the white people, the best homicide detective in Philadelphia, brave enough to face down a lynch mob,” and exhibits “a somewhat unexpected knowledge of varieties of plant life.” (Vera, 156) He is a kind of racial Sherlock Holmes.In other words, the relationship in the movie suggests the kind of friendship between blacks and whites that Americans like to think of as accurate, but that is not true in the context of the time frame in which In the Heat of the Night takes place. In the film, at no point or scene
t-shirts. He also does this in his portrayal of Radio Raheem with an African locket necklace and a big boom box playing loud rap music. Even tertiary characters, for example, a group of Puerto Rican friends, are shown listening to salsa, speaking Spanish, and drinking beer on the porch of their apartment building. During the film’s culmination and the verbal screaming fight between Sal and Buggin’ Out, the former uses racial epithets, telling Radio Raheem to turn off the jungle music and using profanity.Despite the explosive denouement, one of the film’s strengths is the complexity of its characters and the portrayal of blackness on screen. Lee went beyond the stereotypes of African Americans in movies and created characters that are reflected in everyday life. In Do the Right Thing , blacks are not represented in the traditional binary of inferior and smiling, aggressive and dangerous, but rather can exist as fuller expressions of themselves.
Gender Differences in Climate ChangeThe paper discussed in this precis is “Gendering Climate Change: Geographical Insights” by Farhana Sultana. It was published in the 2014 issue of The Professional Geographer after its initial submission in 2011. In the given article, the author discusses the implications of climate change on gender and social relations and encourages scholars and activists to think critically and engage in debates on a global scale.The leading argument of this publication is related to gender differences in the effects of climate change and adaptation policies. Sultana (2014) argues that “the majority of the policy discourses and debates as well as academic writing on climate change have been largely ungendered, yet the impacts of climate change are acutely felt along gender lines and adaptation to climate change is a gendered process” (p. 373). It means that policymakers and climate change scholars currently disregard the fact that climate change affects men and women differently. Yet, for adaptation policies to be truly effective and comprehensive, they should consider the gender-specific challenges experienced by women.Throughout the paper, the author provides numerous arguments to support her point. Firstly, she mentions the disproportionate effect climate change would have on different genders, increasing the existing divide (Sultana, 2014). Since gender relations are already made more difficult by other social factors, such as race and religion, the addition of climate change might bring irrevocable problems. Further, Sultana (2014) argues that women, particularly in South Asia, are more significantly affected by climate change because the patriarchal system limits their power and access
save boys rather than girls when they cannot rescue all of their children. Thus, it is crucial to address these gender inequalities to ensure that all people have equal rights and opportunities.The author used intersectionality when suggesting that scholars should focus on different perspectives when studying climate change instead of viewing the population as a homogenous group. Using an intersectional approach is important because it may help achieve equality. Intersectionality refers to one person incorporating several social identities, and the combination of these identities affects the person’s experiences. For example, women tend to be more significantly affected by climate change than men. However, black women may experience more adversity than white women because they may experience two-fold discrimination based on their gender and race.Gender differences and intersectionality can also be applied to circumstances other than climate change. For instance, this perspective can be used in disability justice policies. Men and women can be affected by disability differently. Being disabled can be more difficult for women because of their generally accepted role of a caregiver and often experienced discrimination in employment and other areas. Overall, taking gender differences into account is important in order to ensure that no population group appears to be more disadvantaged than others.
a broader range of circumstances. Generalizing responses means summarizing various reactions under one common category that unites them (Žukauskas et al., 2018). It is necessary to prove that the differences in the form of specific answers are insignificant, are private, and do not affect the final result and the relationship between cause and effect.Generalization at the level of personalities is the recognition of the representativeness of the sample, that is, the correspondence of the responses of this contingent of subjects in this type of situation to a wider set of people. The connection between variables can be established at different levels of generalization (Žukauskas et al., 2018). As the spectrum of relationships expands, it becomes possible to compare variables by an increasing number of indicators. The generalized form of communication also becomes an explanatory factor concerning particular types of behavior.Research is a type of cognitive activity of a person, a system of logically consistent methodological, methodological organizational and technical procedures that allow obtaining reliable data about the object, phenomenon, or process being studied. Scientific research is the process of acquiring new scientific knowledge, the content of which is the processes of study, experiment, conceptualization, and verification of theoretical ideas (Žukauskas et al., 2018). There are two levels of scientific expertise: empirical and theoretical, and the corresponding methods – empirical and theoretical research.
Every individual in a family has a diverse character depending on the generation they find themselves hailing from; as a result, such personnel is fueled towards achieving different ambitions and desires. In this context, characters have portrayed disproportionate aspirations. For instance, in Lorraine Hansberry’s play Raisin in the Sun , the concept is shown via the manifestation of generational parity and its influence on the Youngers family’s characters. Furthermore, in a society or family aspect, people often have unique personalities based on the generation from which they come or are raised; consequently, the particular person is motivated to accomplish a variety of goals and aspirations.Selflessness is a virtue that is critical towards ensuring the bond within a family is maintained, while greed has separated many families. As demonstrated in the play Raisin in the Sun , Mama worries about the entire family’s future. Therefore, she asserts that she will purchase a better house for the family away from the slums upon receiving the insurance payout. Moreover, Mama feels like men today; Walter, an example, is lazy and does not want to toil to earn wealth; instead, they want it easy; she further aspires for Walter to work hard as other men she saw in the past generation.I come from five generations of people who were slaves and sharecroppers – but ain’t nobody in my family never let nobody pay ’em no money that was a way of telling us we wasn’t fit to walk the earth (p. 89).Evidently, the above quote illustrates that African American forefathers
were independent in the past and did not accept gifts they did not rightfully earn. Mama appeals to Walter not to take Mr. Lindner’s money, a notion which Walter is pondering. She argues that hardly any of her forefathers acknowledged payoffs intended to suggest that they were unfit to exist on the earth a few centuries ago. Mama again emphasizes to Walter that he hails from a proud legacy of consciousness and identity despite the world’s attempts to diminish him as an individual due to his poverty.Today, most men dream of being rich and successful by engaging in business activities. As seen from the play Raisin in the Sun, Walters’s idea, like most men of his age, dreams of being successful business owners, and thence he wants the compensation money to start a liquor store. He has demonstrated that he desires to become extremely wealthy by running a liquor store and using it to support his family. He asserts that money is the foundation of a family; life would face extinction without it. Walter is a depiction of the recurring power of money’s influence in today’s society. He is also an example of young African Americans viewed in the play as lesser and worthless throughout the historical past. Since ancient times, their sole interest in society has been liberty upon its fulfillment, their desires shift towards success.Education has influenced individuals to acquire desirable characters as some literate African America who acquired formal education were enlightened towards the current issues around the world. In the play Raisin
in the Sun, Beneatha Younger’s trait is portrayed more contrasted as compared to her other family members. Her educative background played a fundamental role in influencing her ambitions. Her ambitions are to further her education and fulfill her dreams of becoming a doctor.Walter: Who the hell told you you had to be a doctor? If you so crazy ’bout messing ’round with sick people – then go be a nurse like other women – or just get married and be quiet…Beneatha: Well – you finally got it said…It took you three years but you finally got it (p. 38).From the preceding quote, it is evident that Beneatha aspires to be a doctor, a concept which Walter belittles. He does not believe women can be doctors; he perceives them as fit only in supportive roles. Therefore, Walter feels he is entitled to the insurance payment so that he can accomplish his dream of being a renowned businessman, whereas Beneatha, who also needs the same money to further her education, can be get married or be a nurse like other women.In today’s culture, cases of unwarranted abortion are rampant as compared to the preceding cultures. The play Raisin in the Sun has demonstrated this fact as highlighted in Ruth’s predicaments. She aspires to keep her pregnancy a secret as she is sympathetic to the family’s financial constraints and struggle. Regrettably, she plans on aborting the child as she feels the baby will be more of a liability to the family, but after contemplating, she decides to keep the
pregnancy. Ruth is an example of an unselfish woman who puts other individuals’ needs before hers. Albeit, she is further the opposite of today’s women who lacks patience and compassion, she endures the hurdles she faces in her marriage with Walter.Giving back to society has always been an aspiration for many young learners studying abroad, as evident in Lorraine Hansberry’s play Raisin in the Sun . Asagai hopes to return to Nigeria, bring his knowledge from abroad, and share it with the citizens living in his hometown to better their lives. Likewise, he has confidence in transferring the technological developments he learned in the West to Africa so as to better the continent’s living standards. He is positive about his ambition while being cognizant of the obstacles ahead. Asagai also proposes to Beneatha as he always aspires to marry her. Asagai assures he will educate and guide the people while Beneatha study’s medicine and assist in the care of others. She seems reluctant to accept Asagai’s offer, but she will eventually accept.Racial segregation dates back to ancient times, and it has encroached on most neighborhoods to date. Segregation has impacted harmonious coexistence in society; as a result, it is few and between to see a black man living in an all-white neighborhood. As seen from the play, Karl Lindner, a white man representing Clybourne Park, has his character as a racist influenced by the fact that he is a white representative of the neighboring Clybourne Park.It is a matter of the people of Clybourne Park believing,
new home would be attacked. Even though her warnings are about the very serious risk to the Youngers, her tone is so insulting that she looks almost laughable.In general, Lorraine Hansberry’s Raisin in the Sun vividly depicted how generational distinctive can influence individuals to seize notable traits to fuel achieving their ambitions today. In as much as some of them may be too overambitious and difficult to achieve. The play has depicted the diverse traits regarding different generations as per the Younger’s family. For instance, Mama is preservative of her culture, which drives her to be independent and believes in hard work to achieve possession. On the other hand, Walter believes he should be a prominent businessman as he is droved by the success of his fellow men. Beneatha, since she is educated, dreams of being a doctor upon completion of her study, something which is difficult due to financial constraints. A racial generation has also manifested the play as it can be seen that whites did not like the blacks in their neighborhood. Lastly, Asagai aspires to return to Nigeria and transform his hometown with the new ideas he learned in school.
In the modern world, the practice of generic tourism is gaining more and more popularity. Its essence is moving to another country for the further birth of a child and acquiring citizenship in it. This right in the United States of America is given on the basis of the right of birth or jus soli on the territory of the country. Hence the concept of an “anchor child”, since he or she becomes a tool for his or her walkers to acquire a permanent place of residence. However, with the spread of this phenomenon, many problems have arisen. An example of such an issue was a case that happened in a Chinese ancestral home in Flushing, Queens. A woman from China stabbed five people. This research paper aims to examine this case and its circumstances in order to gain knowledge about how this problem can be prevented in the future.First of all, it is necessary to understand the phenomenon of generic tourism. Foreigners resort to this action often to find a better life and in the desire to follow the American dream. In this case, children born to all persons living in the United States automatically receive American citizenship (Rodriguez 3). Another reason is the desire to provide better education to descendants, as well as health care and other services provided to society by the state (Jaramillo et al. 96). If the research considers the legislation of China, many foreigners want to circumvent the two-child policy. These reasons are the main driving forces for residents of
other countries.This study deals with a specific example of what happened in the ancestral home in Queens. It happened recently and received a lot of coverage by the American media. Henceforth, in a boarding house for Chinese “child tourists” in the city of Flushing, in September 2018, one of the workers committed a brutal crime (Moore et al. para 2). A woman stabbed three newborns and two adults before trying to commit suicide. The incident occurred in the early morning at an institution that provides assistance in caring for the children of immigrants who were born in America and were sold for thousands of dollars. A woman named Yu Fen Wang suffered a nervous breakdown and attacked an elderly colleague and a man. The injured man was the father of one of the children who were in the house. After that, the woman attacked three babies and ran into the basement of the building to commit suicide, but she did not succeed. The reason for this strange behavior was the presence of a psychological disorder in the employee of the ancestral home. Thanks to the quick work of medical specialists, all the victims were rescued, but one of the wounded was very seriously injured.After getting to the hospital, a psychological examination was carried out on the criminal, which showed that the woman had mental health problems. The place where these traumatic events occurred is a registered state enterprise called Mei Xin Care Inc. However, employees secretly provided citizenship services for foreigners, known as birth tourism. On
the basis of a tourist visa, pregnant Chinese women came to the United States to give birth to a child in order to obtain citizenship of the country. Newborns in America have this right in accordance with the 14th Amendment and have a few weeks to get all the necessary documents. This procedure is aimed at a long-term perspective since adult children can then apply for the return of the parents and their receipt of a green card. Such manipulations of generic tourism are gaining more and more popularity due to their relative simplicity, compared with other methods of obtaining permanent residence.After conducting an audit, the US Department of Children and Families Affairs determined that the facility in Flushing is not a licensed care program. The main reason for this was that the organization violated the law, which prohibits the provision of services for the care of newborns up to six weeks babies. Moreover, in addition to illegal activities, the organization placed false advertising on the Internet as a licensed daycare facility. At the same time, the maternity tourism institution charged the parents who resorted to their services (Laudick 281). One woman said that she laid out 4,600 dollars to stay in the institution for a month (Moore et al. para 15). This fact proves that families resorting to this practice have specific resources to purchase generic tourism as a way to settle in the United States.Therefore, after analyzing this case, it can be concluded that it is necessary to take a number of measures to
for the care of minors, especially for the availability of a license and the psychological state of people who work there. Based on the results of such a study, an organization can obtain data on how easily and quickly employees can provide the services required from them. The most critical aspect is the ability of people to withstand pressure and various difficult situations that arise when working with pregnant women and children. Thus, this work investigated a case of abuse of minors that occurred in the city of Flushing in the United States of America. Hence, a woman in the background of a psychological disorder tried to stab two adults and three babies. Upon further investigation, it turned out that the institution in Flushing was engaged in illegal undercover activities and provided child care services for up to six weeks, which is contrary to US law. Further, it is necessary not only to regulate the immigration policy in the country but also to constantly check the license and legality of the activities of institutions that provide assistance in caring for children.
Biracial people have many advantages that open many opportunities for the non-standard perception of the world. In this case, the reader is confronted with the story of a girl who has problems with the perception of her own identity. There are problems associated with the fact that the girl cannot detect her belonging to a particular group, which causes anxiety about the impossibility of having friends. This essay reveals various features of biracial people that allow them to feel their identity better. This is an opportunity to combine different cultural characteristics, which manifests itself in confidence and a decrease in the feeling of belonging to one particular group.Multi-racial persons can have better self-esteem than mono-racial people if they are nurtured to identify with both parents and comprehend their diverse racial ancestry. An important feature here is that biracial people do not depend on the stereotypes that society imposes on other people. An example here is a situation where a person may face uncertainty or fear of failure since others may judge him as a stupid or uneducated person based on their race. That is why being a biracial person is less influenced by someone else’s opinion. The girl needs to realize her main feature, which allows her to adopt the qualities and characteristics of different cultures. In addition, another important characteristic that allows people to develop their own confidence better is a more excellent range of interests and hobbies (Weaver, 2020). This allows biracial people to strengthen their self-confidence since they are also independent of stereotypical
a particular group, but the set opens up more opportunities. In this case, the feeling of dissimilarity should not become an obstacle, but on the contrary, it should be an advantage for the girl.The sensation of vulnerability that comes with feeling like a person is just a part of a small minority in society is fading. Mixed-race persons are tired of constantly defending their identification and are more secure in asserting their own identity rather than accepting whatever society assigns them. Mixed-race persons have seldom opposed this imposition because they have historically been conditioned by the necessity to live in cultures controlled by single racial groupings (Weaver, 2020). Instead, people have merely conformed to whatever identity designations others have assigned to them or have arisen from previous interracial confrontations. On the other hand, the girl must recognize that the opportunity to establish her own identity is a significant duty.Thus, summing up, it should be noted that biracial have unique characteristics that allow them to perceive the surrounding reality in a different way. This is manifested in overcoming the framework of stereotypical judgments and reducing the level of dependence on one racial group. All this also makes it possible to increase confidence and strengthen interactions with representatives of different, heterogeneous cultures. Thus, the girl from this case needs to learn to be aware of her own special identity.
The primary objective of the presentation is to explain the hardships the Israelites had to pass through after they fled from Egypt and the harsh conditions they had to make through. The presentation also pertains to the way of living of the Israelites during the Exodus. There is no undeniable archeological proof to verify the story of the Exodus. Some intellectuals date the Exodus around 1260 BC during the leadership of Ramesses II (1290-12130). Some suggest an earlier date, around 1440BC, under the reign of Thutmosis III (1490-1436). The kingdom period is between 1550-1069, according to Egyptian history. The red sea had two arms–the Gulf of Suez (nearEgypt, Suez canal today) and the Gulf of Aqaba (North-Eastern arm pointing towards the Dead Sea). Israelites left Egypt for Canaan to the North part of the Red seaExodus is the freeing of the people of Israel from slavery in Egypt in the 13 th -century AD under the leadership of Moses. It dictates the living delivery of the Israelites by their God, Yahweh. This is the Journey that the Israelites had to take before reaching the Promised Land, Canaan. It also defines the memories of the Israel community and the hardship they experienced in Egypt. The route the Israelites were instructed to take passed through a wilderness where there was no water, no growing food, and was inhabited by hostile tribes. Water was accessed through the wells at particular points. Sometimes, they had to request water directly from their God via Moses conducting miracles; thus, in this context,
Global economic justice is a concept that presupposes equal distribution of resources between all people of the Earth, taking into account their necessities and their input into the world’s economy. An ethical issue of whether wealthy people should share their resources with the poorer population has continuously stirred people’s minds. On the one hand, it seems unfair that wages for the same work differ drastically across the continents. On the other hand, the distribution of benefits by the states does not often take into account how much a person works and are allocated on the basis of needs rather than actual merits. This paper hypothesizes that the notion that the wealthier population should help the poorer is, in essence, right, and fair. Within this paper, two moral theories are applied to prove the validity of this position. Natural law theory and virtue ethics theory show that the notion that the wealthy should partially provide for the poorer is correct (Murdoch and Oater 561). Moreover, the arguments covered within two scientific articles are given to support the justice of such a notion.The ethical issue of helping the poor is firmly rooted in our life. Many people donate money to the disabled or those who find themselves in severe life circumstances. All people are prone to illnesses, and there is no guarantee that one will not need help sooner or later (Singer 232). Economic crises or natural disasters leave people without money and shelter or without a job and the ability to provide for one’s family. While some
people have too much money to spend, others suffer from hunger and water shortage. The concept of global economic justice presupposes distribution of recourses on account of people’s needs, allowing to avoid the situation when the most significant part of the planet’s resources is concentrated in the hands of a minority group.To evaluate the issue of global economic justice two theories will be used. Natural law theory evaluates an issue through a series of tests that assess its intent and effects. When the overall benefits are compared against general harms, it is imperative to look at which side outweighs (Singer 231). The first step of analysis within the natural law theory is to see whether an action is permissible. Since there are no laws against helping the poor, and charity organizations enjoy exemption from taxes in many countries, the action is permissible. The next step of the analysis is to determine the positive and adverse effects of the issue. The positive effects are that the action benefits many people by reducing the level of poverty and providing access to medicine for low-income families. Moreover, the action helps combat many world diseases that abound in third-world countries due to the absence of hygiene, crowdedness, and extreme poverty. The adverse effects are not many since wealthy people here do not give away much-needed resources but share only the surplus of money they can spend on luxury goods (Murdoch and Oater 561). Adverse effects do not stem from the beneficial ones as, indeed, if not given to charity, the
funds would probably remain in a bank account for a long time. Beneficial effects by far outweigh the adverse ones since they allow millions of people to improve their living conditions, get rid of diseases, and lead an economically active life, thus returning the money into the global economy. The intention of wealthy people who share their recourses with the low-income populace is, by all means, a noble one since they give away something that belongs to them for free. The overall picture shows that all three tests are passed within natural law theory: the action is permissible, the good effects outweigh the adverse ones, and the intention can be described as positive. So, the issue that wealthier people should share with the less fortunate ones seems well-grounded.Virtue ethics theory seeks to find a golden middle, considering whether an act tends to go to extremes or is reasonably balanced. The balanced action is considered to be correct. Another test performed within this theory is evaluating an issue in terms of its merits and vices (Singer 241). If the action is performed to excess, rich people will give all their money to the poor, which does not seem fair since wealthy people worked hard to earn it. At the other end of the scale, if people do not share their resources, millions of people would live in poverty while billions of dollars would stay in the banks, not contributing to the world’s economy. The issue is balanced as neither the first nor the second extreme can get
Canada was chosen as a state for international market expansion. When domestic organizations expand globally, their intention is to reach new markets and expand their product’s relevance. The other benefits of global expansion include increases in revenue streams, acquiring new customers, obtaining access to talent pools, and competitive advantage in the addressable market. As far as Canada is concerned, the evident advantage of global expansion includes a beneficial environment for trade and international partnerships, as Canada is a tariff-free zone for manufacturers regardless of the location within the state (Kreklewetz & Raphael, 2018). When it comes to the expansion’s impact on the business, the product introduction in the new markets increases the company’s recognition outside the domestic audience. The business’s integration into the global trade community may provide the company with the advantage of finding cost-efficient suppliers and a secure customer base throughout the world, increasing the product’s resilience to local market trends and influences (Osano, 2019). Hence, the strategic planning and the supply-chain management of the company gain more security due to the variety of supplier options and market entry possibilities.The societal impact of businesses’ global expansion cannot be overlooked. The existing environment is designed to encourage small and medium domestic enterprises to create internationalized products that can be easily tailored according to the target customer’s needs. In the case of baseball bats, the product itself is highly dependent on the target culture, as baseball is a product with less relevance in the European and Asian markets. For this reason, the choice in favor of international expansion to Canada is based on the societal needs and perception of the product. Globalization in the market, by all means, promotes the rapid development of modern transportation and infrastructure. For example, the Asian market segment has evolved significantly in terms of supply chain and transportation over the past years in order to secure international cooperation with western countries.The target culture of global expansion is another significant aspect to consider. In order for the product to be successful, it is of paramount importance to study the customers’ values, purchase behavior, and relevant marketing strategies. In the case of the US domestic business expanding to Canada, the customer portfolio, along with the customer needs, is relatively easy to identify. Hence, it can be concluded that expansion abroad is a promising strategic move for the company to avoid further sales flattening.
The number of factors that influence oil prices is always large. And now, there are so many of them that an ordinary investor does not understand at all which news to follow and which to ignore. Is it worth worrying about changes in US crude oil inventories, or should one primarily monitor the decline in supplies from Iran? Sometimes it is not easy to answer such questions – much depends on the specific market moment. For the purpose of this assignment: the historical change in the price per barrel of Brent was selected from 2010 to 2021. It is assumed that this time is the most interesting for understanding the influence of modern political and economic trends on price fluctuations.Source: International Monetary Fund. (2021).Based on the resulting graph, you can see several critical fluctuations. First, the price per barrel of Brent rose rapidly throughout 2010. In March-December 2010, oil prices stabilized after the global crisis at $ 70-80 per barrel; growth resumed at the very end of 2010. The subsequent fluctuation was in 2014 and represented a sharp collapse in the price of Brent – the oil brand lost 51% in value from January to December. It is also important to note the drop in price registered from January to May 2020.The fluctuation that happened in 2014 seems to be interesting to investigate in detail due to its amplitude and causes. Analysts attribute the decline in prices to an oversupply of oil on the world market due to several factors. Thus, the United States and Canada
accompanied by a complex of reasons. In this case, it is both the supply side with increasing production in the United States and the demand side, which in turn weakened significantly due to the economic contraction of significant economic and geopolitical players, China and Japan. In addition, it can be assumed that OPEC’s decision not to cut production added fuel to the fire for a reason (Prest, 2018). It is impossible to exclude geopolitical reasons and the desire to undermine the growth of the American economy, which could occur against the backdrop of the sale of large quantities of oil. The latter argument can, of course, be disputed and cannot be objectively assessed. In any case, in 2014, the collapse in prices for Brent played several factors that worked together.Here is how the fall of Brent prices happened in 2014 can be illustrated on a supply and demand graph. The chart focuses on the impact of increased supply amid US shale oil production and OPEC’s unwillingness to cut production and the effect of weakening demand due to the weakening Chinese economy.
tariffs and costs for both businesses and consumers. As tariffs were imposed on numerous trading partners of the United States, including China, Canada, Mexico, and the European Union, many exporting industries faced increased costs and partners’ retaliation. Furthermore, according to Seddiq et al. (2022), “Trump sought to use pandemic supply chain issues to make the case for increasing domestic manufacturing” (para. 10). As a result, the US faced a significant supply chain crisis and widespread shortages of essential goods.The COVID-19 PandemicThe coronavirus outbreak is another impactful factor associated with critical challenges for global supply chains, namely, decreased production and border closures. Numerous businesses have faced the adverse effects of the pandemic, in particular, the automotive industry, which is characterized by a complex system of suppliers, manufacturers, and retailers. As reported by Wayland (2021), “automakers across the globe are expected to lose billions of dollars in earnings this year due to a shortage of semiconductor chips” that hinders production (para. 1). Furthermore, border closures aggravate the situation by disrupting supply chains, increasing delays, and reducing the capacity of air cargo. Overall, recent events have revealed the vulnerabilities in global supply chains that need to be addressed in a strategic and timely manner.
In the globalization era where many different countries closely cooperate in achieving manufacturing goals to satisfy the needs of their internal markets, the country’s economic efficiency is determined by its readiness for international cooperation. The transportation environment and global policies substantially contribute to the country’s successful participation in globalized trade. This essay will compare and contrast differences in the European and North American freight transportation systems, globalized trade, and global policy implications.First, the practical organization of the transportation system within a country favors its economic growth by creating favorable trade conditions in domestic and foreign markets. According to Wiegmans et al. (2018), The freight transportation system in Europe is presented by dense road and rails infrastructure, accompanied by inland waterways. The authors’ study estimated that the most developed transporting infrastructure in Europe is the roads system which accounts for 75% of the freight operations. On the other hand, the distribution of population in the North America required an extensive transportation system. According to Wiegmans et al. (2018), the United States’ transportations system favors the use of trucks and railways. The road infrastructure accounts for nearly 45% of the freight operations, and railways are used for 30% of the freights in the United States (Wiegmans et al., 2018). Comparing the area of both regions and the population’s distribution patterns explains the differences in the transportations systems of the two regions. Therefore, the differences in geography contribute to the choice of the transportation systems and determine the speed of the local and global trade operations.Next, comparing the level
The modern world is currently facing a significant change under globalization trends that shape economies, politics, the workplace, education, and even everyday behavior. Most importantly, due to the active exchange of information between people worldwide, culture is changing. Researchers try to understand whether the culture will be further homogenized in globalization or diversified. This paper will argue that culture will become more diverse under the influence of globalization due to the introduction of multiple cultural elements into societies.The latest processes in cultural change demonstrate that both sides of the argument, namely those supporting diversification and the ones claiming homogeneity, have reasonable grounds. On the one hand, Cowen (2010) states that in a globalized society where a dominant culture prevails, diversity will be substituted with the culture that is imposed on others through such means as cinema. Indeed, Hollywood promotes American codes around the world because the US cinema market is the largest in the world. Thus, globalization allows Hollywood to reach all parts of the world, integrating the same culture codes everywhere.However, the other side of the argument is more compelling because it considers the strengths of local cultures. In particular, an example of sushi’s popularity in American society and cultures of other nations demonstrates that people adopt new cultural phenomena with acknowledgment of their origin. According to Bestor (2010), “Japan remains the world’s primary market for fresh tuna for sushi and sashimi” (p. 110). Thus, having integrated its product into the cultures of other countries, Japan has expanded its market share.In such a manner, with the ease of transportation and communication enabled by globalization, there is a merge of cultures around the world. However, since market forces commonly rule these processes, the host cultures are aware of the origins of the borrowed cultural clusters. Therefore, to summarize the discussion, one might state that culture will not be homogenized in globalization but rather diversified with credit given to each cultural component.
The “Good Samaritan” law in Louisiana was enacted to protect a passerby rendering aid to a stranger from incurring liability and criminal charges in case of a bad outcome. No individual gratuitously providing first aid or rescue in good faith to an injured person, including transfer to a location with medical services, is liable for civil damages (Dudley DeBosier, 2021). Furthermore, this law extends to physicians gratuitously acting outside of medical facilities, even if they are not licensed in the state of Louisiana (Dudley DeBosier, 2021). A passerby can be sued for additional injuries or damages only if their actions can be proven to have been grossly negligent. The Louisiana “Good Samaritan” law encourages citizens to help each other if the police and emergency service are unavailable or too far away.Bill has a heart attack in the provided scenario, and his colleague, Stan, takes him to the hospital and leaves immediately. Stan cannot be sued because, under the “Good Samaritan” law, he was not legally responsible for calling Bill’s family or making further hospital arrangements. He saw a colleague in a state of medical emergency and gratuitously transferred him a to hospital in good faith. Stan is thus protected under the Louisiana law and is not liable for later events or any additional injuries because he was acting as a passerby. However, the same protection does not apply to Sally, the nurse attending Bill. She is a registered professional providing service inside a medical facility and will be held to the standard of her nursing license and employment contract. Sally is legally responsible for assessing and advocating for Bill, recording his medical history, and administering treatment. The “Good Samaritan” law only covers help given gratuitously by a passerby, not professional business relationships such as between a nurse and a patient.
The three main benefits offered by Grammarly and Turnitin used for text editing purposes are significant amounts of time saved on proofreading, simplified writing process through recommendations and help in maintaining tone through the paper. Moreover, as a form of text editing tool, Turnitin and Grammarly utilize elaborated AI and machine learning processes that offer more text editing opportunities. For example, once the app detects that the text features listing elements, it will automatically provide the user with an option to make a list of these items for more comfortable reading. According to Wang (2020), AI presents a vital part in Turnitin, and its work within the app focuses on improving the quality of students’ writing.On the other hand, mistakes can always occur with text editing applications, as speech recognition algorithms can fail to detect specific sentence structures. While proofreading papers using Grammarly and Turnitin saves a significant amount of time, one should carefully approach the task without overly relying on the apps. In writing responses to assignments and personal correspondence, the apps will help by automatically detecting any grammar or punctuation mistakes and ensuring the use of tone suitable for conversation purposes. When the user confuses different words for formal and informal tones, the app will correct the text and help choose the right sentence structure. Moreover, the use of such applications could become essential for non-native English speakers and their career progression. Many companies are now starting to implement remote job principles in their work, which means more room for misunderstandings in communication. Using applications like Grammarly and Turnitin for academic or business teamwork will help to maintain productive collaboration through effective communication that leaves no misunderstandings.
Knowledge and theories produced by the representatives of different ethnicities in American society play a crucial role in learning the country’s history and current interpersonal relationships. Many critical events, personal stories, and intellectual traditions unite people across the United States. However, despite the intention to live in an equal and fair society, certain social struggles of ethnic groups cannot be ignored. Today, Americans continue living in a world where racial inequality determines the quality of life, and group affirmation turns out to be one of the possible solutions for minorities. City of Ghosts and other class readings create a solid background for identifying and understanding the uniqueness of community stories and realizing that ethnic differences still matter. It is hard for some people to live around reasoned and irrational biases and neglect their interests, beliefs, and attitudes toward social obligations. Sometimes, it is extremely important to consider cultural roots and respect differences. In some cases, people should learn to diminish the power of their emotions and cultures and assimilate with dignity to avoid unnecessary conflicts, following the rules of self-affirmation and historical trauma theories. The history of American society is long and complex, including the struggles of Latinx and Mexican communities against discrimination, unequal interpersonal relationships and educational restrictions, and the ways how to share feelings and intentions.Common struggles and movements to support equal interpersonal relationships and reduce discrimination impact are probably the most significant events in the lives of ethnic minorities who live in the United States. People believe that their society offers equal conditions
for developing work and life affairs and decision-making. However, the differences between black and white Americans exist and affect their choices in terms of interracial friendships. Ingraham indicates that about 75% of whites have only white social networks, with no minorities present. The quality of such relationships may be understood through the historical trauma theory when populations experience slavery outcomes and cannot eliminate certain associations and prejudices. Many individuals immigrate to the United States admiring the dream of having a better life, employment, and a safe future. They cannot realize that borders between countries are not just barbed-wire fences with multiple political and legal rules but the line that divides people physically and spiritually (Náñez). Discrimination is both abstract social and concrete brick-and-mortar walls that people create to keep everything in order. In the third episode of City of Ghosts , the old lady shared her memories of no fences in the park, and everybody contributed to the community’s heartbeat. Mexican and Latinx communities have to live in a world full of such walls and fences that divide people from being themselves.Another serious lived experience that challenges many American Latinx, Mexicans, and other ethnic groups includes education restrictions that promote group affirmation. In addition to routine relationships and communication, ethnic groups prove their right to equal education and skill development. Colton is one of the characters in the second episode of City of Ghosts who represents a common image of a white boy in American society: parental support, high expectations, and multiple opportunities. Not all children
from minority communities have the same chances. In Arizona, the decision to ban Mexican-American studies is discussed to improve state tests and remove controversies about ethnic studies (Planas). This course is associated with multiple benefits for young people to better understand their society. Students should know how to reflect on their cultural experiences, diversity, and history. It is wrong to believe that education in the United States would automatically give some priority in the country or abroad (Carcamo). Education is just another criterion according to which ethnic groups are divided, and the self-affirmation theory explains the essence of this challenge. People are motivated to maintain their integrity and predict outcomes. Self-affirmation shows if there are any threats to the self-using reflection and acknowledgment of personal responsibilities. Almost the same happens in the case of group affirmation for education – people unite their efforts to prove their rights in American society.Finally, social struggles experienced by Latinx, Mexican, and other communities are related to the personalities and the ability to cope with feelings and emotions. Ethnic minorities continue facing social injustices, biases, and controversies regularly. Although the governments make policies and create laws where all citizens are equal regardless of their age, gender, or skin color, it is impossible to control people at the individual level. Thus, many recommendations are given to support people, motivate them properly, and demonstrate that some decisions and relationships depend not on the history of inequality but on personal achievements. In the first episode of City of Ghosts, one of the characters, Mariko,
The Caribbean history includes the ruthless colonization by Western countries like Spain. Upon colonization, the area was home to native groups such as the Ciboney or Guanahuatebey, Taino Arawak, and Carib. The colonizers brought a bunch of enslaved Africans who would work in their homes and plantations. The Whites were the minority and foreigners in the Caribbean but brutally seized and ruled against the Blacks majority. However, the Blacks maintained their identity and self-expression through various cultural activities evident to date.The Caribbean is the home for many musical genres expressing human freedom and revolution. Reggae is associated with the Caribbean people, and it is the unofficial soundtrack of many Caribbean vacations. Reggae musicians such as Bob Marley and the Wailers produced revolutionary and redemptions songs protesting against the White brutal rule in the Caribbean. Therefore, through Reggae, the Caribbean people expressed their anger against the ruthless White control.The majority African population in the Caribbean identified themselves with their cuisines and customs, including religious beliefs. The enslaved people maintained their African culinary art and cherished their cuisines. For instance, the Callaloo, the Caribbean vegetable soup, is one of the national dishes in Tobago and Trinidad. Furthermore, carnivores and parades are serious business in the area. The Caribbean parades manifest the area’s folklores and customs of African origin. The Caribbean people commemorate events in history like slavery through carnivals. The distinct African heritage in the Caribbean helped in identifying the Blacks.The Caribbean was colonized by the whites, who were the minority of the area’s population. The colonizers brought Africans who worked in their homes and plantations under the fierce rule. However, the enslaved people and the Blacks in the area expressed and identified themselves through music and distinct African heritage. Reggae songs helped the Blacks protest against the pitiless white rule, and events such as the parades and carnivals commemorated slavery. Furthermore, African cuisines such as Callaloo identified Africanism in the Caribbean. Despite the brutal rule by the White minority, the Blacks in the Caribbean expressed and identified themselves through songs and events that are evident to date.
The source of information for this blog post was Google Arts and Cultures’ explore page. An original search led to the discovery of the subject, and some of the keywords used were “modern art” and “modern European paintings.” The most important element of the explored exhibition is a representation of modern European art from Croatia by Gruž Harbour. In particular, there is a painting depicting a harbor and two people, a man, and a woman, displayed in Picture 1. This painting was created in 1965 in Croatia, which is consistent with the modernist art movement. This movement originates in the early decades of the 20th century, reflecting the new culture created by artists globally (Tate, n.d.).I decided to explore modern art and this work in particular because this movement is the reflection of the artists’ views of modern times; hence this art is easier to understand for people of my age. This topic is important for the understanding of the arts and cultures in the global environment because, in many cases, regional arts, synch as the one from small European states, for example, Croatia, is not studied by students. Still, it reflects some of the tendencies and trends of the years and allows one to see the diversity of modern art. The original search led to this topic as I was exploring modern art from different states and found it interesting to look at paintings of lesser-known artists.My blog relates to the intercultural thinking and creativity issues because it explores the art that the majority of people are not familiar with, and the information provided by Google enhances this. Google allows access to artworks and museums all over the world; for example, the painting in Picture 1 is from the Croatian museum of modern art. Hence, Google Art and Culture influences understanding about art by allowing us to see the varied examples of artworks. I was feeling excited and overwhelmed when I explored Google Arts and Cultures because many of the paintings and artworks I had never heard of or seen before. My subject search integrates the knowledge of the interconnections between culture, art, politics, the economy, and the social environment because it reflects the pattern of the artists’ thinking and the issues that the society was concerned with at that time. Picture 1 represents the social relationships and Croatia’s economy that is linked to the sea and ships.Picture 1. Gruž Harbour, 1965
The challenges which Hamlet faces during his story seem truly harsh and brutal to endure without them affecting at least slightly his mental condition and developing obsessional grief. Therefore, it is unmistakable that the main character may experience difficulties withstanding all the issues during his life. By and whole, it appears that Hamlet’s complicated relationships with his relatives, along with their actions, are the reasons for him becoming uncertain about him continuing to live his life.To begin with, it is evident to the reader that the main character is overwhelmed by the grief and mourning of his father. As a matter of fact, his father was killed by his uncle, Claudius, who then became his step-father (Shakespeare, 2016). Undoubtedly, such a situation is likely to negatively impact anyone’s health, considering that the deaths of loved ones seem challenging to withstand at any time. Indeed, Hamlet is no exception as he experiences a vicious cycle of mania replacing depression, which affects his moods, leading to him obsessing over his father’s death and seeking his revenge.Furthermore, Hamlet experiences difficulties in explaining his grief to his mother, Gertrude. It seems that the fact that they do not share the same opinion about his father’s death complicates Hamlet’s grief even more. Therefore, the character recognizes this loss as something more profound in his soul that never lets him just be. That is why when Hamlet meets his father’s ghost, he experiences a feeling of importance, meaning that he has to do something to not only make himself feel better but
pain, “and by a sleep to say we end / The heart-ache and the thousand … shocks” (Shakespeare, 2016, p. 25). In other words, Ophelia’s death leads to Hamlet losing his mind entirely and falling into an endless cycle of grief, uncertainty, and depression.To sum up, Hamlet’s insanity seems understandable after comprehending what he has experienced in his life. Losses of his two loved ones led to him developing an obsession and suicidal inclinations, which is an endless cycle of manic episodes and depression. In addition, Hamlet feels guilty for not avenging his father and making his uncle pay for his cruel misdeed. However, the death of the love of his life is the last straw, so he ends this journey by losing his mind once and for all.
Mission StatementThe organization is dedicated to supporting families and children who are deaf or exhibiting hearing problems. Hand and Voices is a parent-driven and non-profit organization whose main concerns are the conditions and nature of children with hearing complexities. They strive to provide resources, networks, and information to improve communication and educational outcomes for these vulnerable groups. The organization’s main mission is partnering with parents and interest groups in intervening for children who have deaf to unlock opportunities so that they realize their highest potential. In achieving its mission, the organization is partnering with the right people, including parents and consumers who are deaf, thus giving a basis for handling the vulnerable in the community.Summary of ServicesHand and Voice is one of the organizations in the world whose main agenda is to support and open opportunities to those who have auditory problems. The organization’s goals are anchored in that communication among vulnerable groups is vital, just like normal people. Therefore, through experts, the organization trains the deaf sign languages and extends the courtesy by finding them opportunities (Hands & Voices, 2022). A good example of a Hand and Voice organization is the American Society for Deaf Children, whose attention supports families living with deaf children. This is done through training and creating awareness in the community. The organization has taken and given hope to these families, takes responsibility for educating both the families and the deaf individuals, and provided researched information about handling the deaf. Moreover, the Hand and Voices, through partners, have opened several opportunities for this group and are providing vital resources that are basics for the existence of the deaf.
Health Information Technology (HIT) is a crucial tool in improving nursing quality and security. The proliferation of IT in the healthcare sector increases the population’s overall health through quick and timely medical treatment. Doctors employ HIT to gather data that help to evaluate the effectiveness of curative mediation required in a medical routine. Experts need to optimize training and align with medical trends to ensure patient protection and safety.In facilities where HIT has not been introduced, disruptions may occur in the work of the medical staff and in determining the treatment of patients. The establishments need to use the appropriate resources to procure high-standard tools which offer quality medical assistance (Kruse & Beane, 2018). In addition, organizations should employ an experienced workforce to maximize service delivery and diminish the miscalculations occurring during patients’ examinations. The HIT ensures services delivered to the people are efficient and effective within the healthcare contexts. Organizations should remain furnished with modernized appliances that increase the quality of care, which is the targeted goal.In addition, HIT helps healthcare practitioners reduce adverse drug reactions in patients by prescribing appropriate treatments. Doctors can research medicines suitable for use to diminish the severe impacts on the sick people. The regulation of drugs requires doctors’ intelligence and the person’s positive response to the guidelines to minimize the reactions. The patients’ negligence concerning medical instructions can bear effects such as depression or death. Many diseases are cured, prevented and treated when doctors’ guidelines are followed.HIT has facilitated the protection and confidentiality of information in organizations through the imposition of computerized systems. Securing people’s privacy and confidentiality is essential in promoting public confidence in wellness services such as laboratory and diagnostic care to reduce stigma or discrimination. The execution of HIT tools at institutions is likely to grow because their targeted outcomes are more promising in securing privacy.Various HIT trends implemented in pharmaceutical systems improve patient safety by helping them understand the importance of healthcare procedures. Artificial intelligence and voice search are new trends useful in recognizing patients’ needs. The HIT deviations can decrease the doctors’ efforts in the patient treatment and boost service commitment for the clients. Medical faults in organizations can decline through the demand for improved HIT modes in healthcare to maintain good health for the people.
Health administration is challenging and requires excellent memory, high concentration, and stamina. Thanks to the development of information technology, a significant part of the administrator’s work can be transferred to spreadsheets (for example, Excel) or other programs. Computers and sophisticated technology can now be found in any hospital, and using them is one of the critical skills of an administrator. Excel does a great job with concepts such as probability and measures of central tendency, and it helps medical staff to have straightforward access to extensive databases. It is also easy for administrators to manage hospitals or departments within Lean and Six Sigma using information technology.Probability in work can be calculated using a unique formula given in the table. This function is called PROB, and it divides the number of favorable events by the total number of possible events. These calculations are quick and easy; the specialist can vary the events and numbers. For example, people can calculate the probability of emergencies per shift in this way. Based on the results obtained, it can be concluded how many specialists should be ready and what equipment should always be available. Sometimes people can use the OR and AND tools to calculate the probability.In addition to probability, Excel allows people to calculate measures of the central tendency. Kros and Rosenthal (2016) postulate: “Time spent by physicians with patients what is called the central tendency of the data. There are three commonly employed measures of central tendency: the mean, the median, and the mode” (p. 184). These complex calculations
is essential not to forget the biblical truth: “On hearing this, Jesus said, “It is not healthy who need a doctor, but the sick” ( English Standard Version Bible , 2001, Matt, 9:12). It is impossible to depersonalize the doctor or turn him into a cold machine, even though hospitals are increasingly dependent on machine work. The device only helps the doctor to carry out his plan.Thus, Excel allows people to achieve quick results in work by processing large databases and calculating the necessary information using formulas. Formulas allow managers to easily and quickly calculate probabilities, which helps people predict the future in the short term. Knowing the likelihood of a particular event, the administrator can calculate the necessary medicines and medical equipment. Excel allows people to calculate complex central tendency measures, which helps to organize large layers of information. The Lean and Six Sigma management concept is based on constant development and striving for new successes. It is essential for administrators in this concept to predict further actions, possible risks, and successes. In addition, they need to see the mistakes made and quickly correct them. In the future, the studied material will help solve critical administrative tasks: the purchase of medicines in the right quantities, equipment, training of doctors and nurses.
The United States’ healthcare system is regulated on federal and private levels, and policy-making processes are distributed to multiple state and local administrations. Consequently, the regulations can be complicated, slow to establish, lobbied in political or business interests, and be duplicated on different governmental levels. (Bodenheimer & Grumbach, 2020). The fragmentation caused by the states’ ability to pass their policies is beneficial when a local problem requires an urgent legislative solution; however, it is a massive obstacle to developing a strong public health infrastructure. After the Affordable Care Act (ACA) passage in 2010, regions developed their insurance programs based on the insurance marketplaces allowed by the ACA. For instance, the New Jersey Health Insurance Market Preservation Act requires tax residents to get the coverage, duplicating the ACA’s initiatives. This paper aims to explore the two similar health care regulations passed on different levels, discuss the implications of federalism, and identify how the government should be involved in policy-making.The New Jersey Health Insurance Market Preservation Act enabled the state to develop the Get Covered program to enroll the residents to receive basic insurance. Although the ACA established the regulations for getting the coverage on federal levels, the government had to allow local policy-making due to the high autonomy of many regions (Bodenheimer & Grumbach, 2020). New Jersey’s program and insurance policies duplicate the national insurance legislation, making the state’s financing system benefit from the residents’ payments. Get Covered offers the taxpayers to qualify for receiving local government’s support for essential health services, similar to the national Medicaid
IntroductionThis community assessment will address the city of Orlando, Florida. It is a city in central Florida with a population of over 300,000 individuals (United States Census Bureau, 2021). It provides an overview of critical determinants for health as outlined by Healthy People 2030 program, and enable public health nurses to evaluate the community for potential interventions. It features a plan for potential intervention, including roles and responsibilities and community partners.PopulationAge, Gender and Race DistributionTotal population numbers of Orlando, Florida, as of April 1st, 2020, is 307,537 individuals. The age makeup of the city indicates a prevalence towards the middle, as 62% of these people are between 18 and 65 years of age. Geriatric population is at 10.2%, whereas children and teens stand for 27.8% of the total (United States Census Bureau, 2021).Fig. 1. Population AgeWhen it comes to gender makeup, the population is divided relatively equally, with females having a slight advantage, being at 52%, with male individuals constituting the remaining 48%. This could be explained by the fact that women, on average, tend to live several years longer than men. This corresponds to the country’s average male to female ratio (United States Census Bureau, 2021).Fig. 2. Orlando Gender MakeupOrlando is a predominantly white community, but many individuals of different races also live here. Whites alone constitute 61.3% of the population. The second largest group are blacks, with 24.5%. White Hispanics constitute 32.6% of the total. Asian-Americans and Natives are a relative minority, with 4.2% for the former and 0.2% for the latter (United States
Census Bureau, 2021).Fig. 3. Population by RaceBiology and GeneticsCertain diseases often correspond to racial makeup of the population. Black populations are typically exposed to diabetes, sickle cell anemia, cancer, heart disease, stroke, asthma, pneumonia, and HIV/AIDS. Hispanic populations are more at risk for diabetes, hypertension, obesity, elevated low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol, low levels of high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol, and smoking. Asian-Americans are more likely to contract hepatitis B, liver cancer, tuberculosis, and lung cancer, among other conditions. Native Americans are at risk for chronic liver disease and cirrhosis, diabetes mellitus, unintentional injuries, assault/homicide, intentional self-harm/suicide, and chronic lower respiratory diseases. White non-Hispanic population is more likely to be affected by anemia, iron deficiency, arthritis, cancer, cardiovascular diseases, dementia, diabetes, and kidney diseases. Knowing this data as a PHN is important for predicting the likelihood of occurrence of certain diseases based on the population makeup. Based on the community census, diseases affecting white, black, and Hispanic populations are likely to be the most common.Mortality and Morbidity RatesOrlando city’s mortality and morbidity rates are not too different from state statistics. Florida saw 239,381 deaths in 2020, with the three top leading causes being heart disease, cancer, and COVID-19. These diseases alone account for over 100,000 deaths, with the other half associated with unintentional injuries, strokes, lung diseases, diabetes, and others (Florida Health, 2020).Fig. 4. Leading Causes of Death in FloridaMorbidity rates reflect mortality rates in that those causing the most damage are the ones most prevalent in the population. Throughout the year 2021, COVID-19 saw more emergence, even
as death rates saw a relative decrease in relation to the number of incidents in the population. COVID-19 is the only pandemic currently affecting Orlando city (Florida Health, 2020).Social FactorsHealth ServicesOrlando City offers a broad variety of healthcare services available to the population. These include primary care facilities, rehab facilities, LTC, assisted living, hospice care, mental health and home care, as well as various dental, vision, chiropractor, and alternative services. The majority of the facilities offering care operate in networks, which provide reimbursements to individuals possessing Medicare and Medicaid (“Healthcare,” 2022).Access to Health CareThe majority of the communities in Orlando city have a primary care center or a kind of other medical facility within 15 minutes of their location. The majority of hospitals and large-scale medical centers is located near the center of the city. Physical access to healthcare, thus, is relatively robust. Availability of care to individuals with insurance and those eligible for Medicare and Medicaid is slightly higher than average in Florida and the US (“Access healthcare of Orlando,” 2022).Social ServicesOrlando city’s social services are presented by the Orange County Social Service Department, which is a government agency providing services for residents of the city. These include healthcare, human services, low-income programs and government benefits. They aim to assist children, the elderly, and vulnerable adults, especially women (“Orange County Social Service Department,” 2022). Besides government programs, there is also a food stamp program, shelter facilities, and several non-government agencies operating in the area. They assist the community by providing services and assistance to individuals
that live below the poverty rate and/or experience problems beyond their ability to handle.Safety and TransportationThe majority of Orlando’s population travels using cars. Public transportation is present, represented by buses and rail services. They are, however, limited, mirroring the situation in the majority of the US. Taxi services are represented by Uber and similar services. Car-sharing is available to the general populace as well (Visit Orlando, 2022). However, taxi services are expensive and cannot be relied on for regular transportation. The city has its own law enforcement, fire department, and emergency services present and in adequate condition to address the needs of the community.Economics and Housing: Orlando city features low unemployment rates at about 4.5%, which is lower than that in the US, which is approximately at 6.5%. Average weekly wages vary between 850$ to 1100$, which is higher compared to the county and state levels. Leading industries in Orlando are trade, professional and business services, as well as education, leisure, and hospitality (“Orlando, FL, area economic summary,” 2022). Poverty levels are relatively high, with over 17% of individuals living in poverty, including a substantial number of children. Only 35% of people in Orlando city own their own house. Around 2,000 individuals are estimated to be homeless (“Orlando, FL, area economic summary,” 2022). The conditions of the available housing are not readily available.Environment: Quality of air in Orlando city is considered reasonably good, with readings for the presence of pollutants varying between 2 to 9 μg/m³, depending on the month (IQAir, 2022). The primary toxin found
in the air is PM2.5, which is dangerous in high concentrations, able to cause lung diseases, skin diseases, and cancer. The primary pollutant in the water is water algae (IQAir, 2022). Environment can significantly affect population health by facilitating the spread of diseases. Being a coastal city, Orlando is in danger of floods caused by hurricanes.Recreation: Orlando city features 148 parks, gardens, recreational areas, and hobby centers to address the needs of the populace (City of Orlando, 2022). Cinemas, private entertainment establishments, and similar facilities are also present. Many of these do not require payment for entering, thus being available to the impoverished populations as well. Overall, the city features nearly any form of entertainment available state-wide (City of Orlando, 2022).Education: Orlando city provides options for primary, secondary, and post-grad education. Graduation rates for the city in 2020 have been over 90%, though these parameters dropped after COVID-19 went into full swing (Postal, 2021). Special education is provided to individuals with limitation, and the availability of these services has been increasing since 2015. Schools typically feature wellness and health education programs, as well as physical education for children and teenagers. Free or reduced meal plans are available in some facilities. College accessibility is also slowly growing, especially for blacks, Hispanics, and impoverished families (Postal, 2021).Policies and Government: The city adopts a liberal approach to policies regarding vaccination and immunization. In regards to COVID-19, Orlando city has a mandatory vaccination ban, meaning that employers and other authorities cannot force individuals to undergo vaccination (“COVID-19 latest information,” 2022).
Masks and social distancing are considered optional. Nevertheless, these policies are not helping slow down COVID-19, as daily infections are at around 10,000 new cases a day (“COVID-19 latest information,” 2022).Behavior: Smoking, inactivity, and obesity remain some of the biggest risk behaviors in Orlando city. These factors increased due to COVID-19 lockdowns. About 30% of all Orlando citizens are obese (“These are the top health concerns,” 2019). Drug usage is another risky behavior that is present in Orlando city. Positive factors include exercise, gym attendance, hiking, walking, and swimming, but those were limited by various mandates previously in place in the area. Healthy dieting is presented in several restaurants, but cheap fast foods remain popular among the population.Fig. 5. Obesity in FloridaVulnerable Populations: Vulnerable populations in Orlando city include homeless, migrants, and the poor. According to statistics, around 17% of the city’s population live at or below the poverty line. The city also has over 2,000 homeless individuals (“Orlando, FL, area economic summary,” 2022). They are exposed to the elements, hunger, drug addictions, and crime. The primary determinant of health for these individuals relates to the economy, as often they do not have enough money to pay for health services, proper food, or accommodations.Analysis of Community Assessment: Healthy People 2030 health indicators state that social determinants of health include economic stability, educational access, health access, neighborhood and built environment, and social contexts (Healthy People 2030, 2022). The analysis of the community assessment indicates that the economic factor remains dominant in determining access to health and education
facilities. Availability of these services is correlated with the individuals’ ability to afford and get to them, as most of them are located near the center of the city. Impoverished individuals and the homeless are the most vulnerable.Priority Community Health IssuePriority community health issue in Orlando city is obesity. Obesity relates to poverty, poor health, availability of health prevention services, and income inequality. Overweight individuals often do not have transportation to travel to markets and shops, and have to rely on fast food services for nourishment. Providing healthy alternatives to traditional high-fat dishes and encourage healthy eating would help reduce obesity in vulnerable populations.PlanThe proposed plan of action focuses on three priority interventions from the PHN Intervention wheel. They are as follows (Schaffer & Strohschein, 2019):  * Social marketing: Provide access to cheap and healthy nutrition for the poor populations;  * Collaboration: Work with fast-food chains to offer healthier menus as part of their regular course;  * Health teaching: Educate individuals vulnerable to obesity about the dangers of unhealthy eating as well as recipes and routines on how to cook healthily.Community Resources and ReferralsHealthy Weight – provides general information on obesity the BMI index, as well as links to helpful sources and organizations dealing with obesity in Florida.Beltre Bariatrics Center for Metabolic and Obesity Surgery – a helpful resource for individuals in need of surgical interventions in Central Florida.Healthy Lifestyles Program – a step-by-step guide for children and parents, involving exercises, challenges, and dieting.MobilizeOrganizations involved in the proposed interventions have to have the
What is the issue?In the East Orange Hospital Clinic (Carewell Health Medical Center), most beneficiaries represent the impoverished population, and the problem of skipping the follow-up appointments has recently occurred. More than 25% of patients did not attend the planned visit with their doctor during the last month, and the attendance keeps decreasing. The problem of skipped follow-ups is significant, and multiple reasons cause patients to non-attend their doctor after the initial visit. One of such factors is the socio-economic status of beneficiaries as it influences their priorities and healthcare insurance services affordability (Dantas et al., 2018). Employment and family obligations, costly transportation, and long clinic wait times prevent impoverished populations’ representatives from re-attending a hospital (Ofei-Dodoo et al., 2019). The issue is also related to the clinical practice as the patients lack education about the importance of the follow-up visits, cannot communicate their needs, or do not receive additional reminders.Why the issue is urgent?The problem is urgent because the growing number of skipped follow-up visits signals lower satisfaction with the quality of the services. The lack of additional examination negatively influences the initial treatment outcomes and can worsen patients’ conditions. Consequently, they will have to return to the hospital, and the costs for it would be much higher than for attending a follow-up visit on time. It will result in a financial burden not only for the impoverished clients but also for the organization that will have to organize services and human resources for treatment (Dantas et al., 2018). The practical intervention to influence the
practices, such as reaching through messengers and emails. Nursing practitioners adjust their communication to tailor the importance of follow-up visits and ensure that the client understands. Participants are also encouraged to take notes about patients’ reactions to the topic, their understanding of hospital attendance, and important considerations about the services.How to evaluate the effectiveness?The outcome is the decrease of the skipped follow-up visits by the impoverished populations, and it can be calculated through attendance tracking. The hospital operates through an electronic record system, and data to analyze would be retrieved from there. Timeframe to realize the initiative and achieve notable results depends on the number of follow-up visits assigned by physicians to their impoverished patients. The average period, such as two months, can be chosen for checking if the percentage of missed appointments changed. Furthermore, physicians and nursing practitioners are encouraged to collect patient feedback and take notes about their perception of the follow-up visits’ costs, aims, and outcomes (Rew et al., 2020). After the first two months of the intervention, the efficiency will be evaluated, and the knowledge of clients’ opinions will be the foundation for further change in practice.
Charlotte Perkins Gilman wrote the novel Herland during the times of suffragettes. Unable to embrace life in its full volume, women started to issue the restrictions put on them by society. Being a feminist herself, Charlotte Perkins Gilman displayed many of her beliefs in literary works. In this novel, Charlotte Perkins sheds light on the theme of women’s emancipation. One of the ideas Herland reflects is that women’s domestic duties and societal roles are the main reasons they are perceived as weak and inferior creatures and the main things that restrain women’s true potential. Men, many of whom find an idea of an independent woman unpleasant, have to accept that women obtain the same abilities and intelligence and reject a concept of women’s inferiority.Women, which conduct the population of Herland, represent the author’s position towards their capability to be independent; Herland’s residents have mastered agriculture, they sustain advanced infrastructure, and they maintain a healthy society without men’s help. “Strong, free, active women, the sturdy, field-working peasant, the burden-bearing savage, are no less good mothers for their human strength” (Gozlet 23). Thus, Charlotte Perkins attempts to object to the concept that was popular among her contemporaries – the assumption that a woman cannot manage without a strong hand of man. In addition, Herland’s society represents a system that is less chaotic than the whole Western civilization of her time. For example, child-rearing has become a public matter and is strictly separated from motherhood. “Gilman believed that fit women had the moral duty to produce more than one
child in order to prevent race suicide just as she believed in Herland, unfit mothers should forego their opportunity to do so, even when it was biologically possible” (Gozlet 23). The population of Herlanders constantly grows, providing the country with new residents. Thus, the society of Herland represents a strong, autonomous, patriarchy-free, and prospering environment.The complete understanding of women’s emancipation requires defining the difference between patriarchal and matriarchal systems, and this is what the author tries to do; these two systems are different in various aspects. First of all, the portrayal of the world, which men built, is strongly connected with an understanding that it cannot be a safe place for women. At the same time, the male heroes regard their world as “safe and civilized enough” (Gilman 14). In the matriarchal society of Herland, the concept of ‘femininity’ is absent; thus, from the author’s point of view, the women are free from being bound to their sex. A well-trained society of hunters and warriors functions as a single organism – everybody understands his duties. Unlike the default Western patriarchal environment, Herland is devoid of such social problems as economic inequality or influential struggle on higher echelons of society (Gozlet 26). On the other hand, the male intruders depict the default patriarchal attitude towards an independent woman: almost everyone finds what he observes unsettling. Moreover, throughout the story, they often refer to Herland as a “national harem” (Gilman 15). Therefore, the matriarchal society of Herland often represents a more just and balanced system of values.It is
the perception, distorted by patriarchal values, which pushes society to overlook women as weak creatures incapable of building their own state, having their own opinion, or protecting their own beliefs. At the beginning of the story, male protagonists question the possibility of matriarchal society’s existence. “They would fight among themselves; women always do,” – says Terry, one of the male explorers (Gilman 10). Although women are often depicted as inferior creatures, they do not intend to harm the intruders directly. However, men in this novel are shown as creatures who are willing to act aggressively towards women. Terry is possibly the worst example of this behavior. He fantasizes “of turning the land into his personal Harem and becoming the king of Herland” (Gozlet 26). When a man avoids the attempt to convert him and introduce him to the new system of values, he rapes his wife and escapes Herland. One negative aspect, which may be noted in the author’s depiction of this problem, is the generalization implemented towards both men and women; feminism criticizes the system, not the gender (Roy 762). In overall, the issue of gender-based bias has always been present in Western society.However, the author’s viewpoint often raises quite disturbing topics, promoting and supporting ideas of racism, ethnocentrism, and societal hierarchy. Even though the discussed topic, which was raised by Gilman represents an acute problem, which is present even in modern society, the novel often offers wrong answers to the raised questions. For example, the appearance of all residents of Herland is described as
of the Roman Empire. As seen from the events of the year of six Emperors, civil and internal wars significantly weakened both the economy and the army. They also caused a crisis of power when the rulers could not reach a compromise. A clear example of such a feud was when Balbin and Pupiennus were unable to agree and were publically humiliated and later killed (Herodian, 1961 ). As a result of their feud, a thirteen years old Gordian III was left to rule a huge empire with millions of citizens to take care of and an enormous amount of obligations to bear.However, modern historians single out several other reasons for the fall of the Roman Empire. The first one is the financial crisis since the huge Empire required a lot of money for the army and different needs. It led to the growth of taxes and provoked inflation and public rage. Another reason is the emergence of a prosperous opponent – Byzantium, which flourished when Rome faced several crises. There exists one more reason, but it was implicitly mentioned in Herodian’s writing. It was the weakening of the army since Roman people were not eager to enroll in the army, and those already registered were tired of constant battles (Herodian, 1961 ). Hence, the fall of the Roman Empire was caused by several factors that influenced both the economy and the army.
The history of blood transfusion dates back to ancient times when people tried to treat animals with blood. Hippocrates recommended that patients suffering from mental disorders drink the blood of healthy people (Community Blood Center, 2020). Blood was commonly credited as having a rejuvenating effect. It is also believed that blood is a miraculous liquid: once it is applied, life can be extended for many years (Community Blood Center, 2020). I find those facts especially interesting in the context of how blood transfusion and blood banks would be further developing.The development of donation was accompanied by numerous ups and downs – from the deification of this method to the state ban on its use. The first documented intravenous injections refer to the beginning of the world’s first academy of sciences – the Royal Society of London, founded in the 60s of the 17th century (Community Blood Center, 2020). It was not easy to make an intravenous infusion of blood to a person in those days: before the invention of a hollow injection needle and a modern syringe, there were still two centuries left. Christopher Wren, in 1656 used a bird’s feather as an injection needle and bladders of fish and animals instead of a syringe (Community Blood Center, 2020). Although the first attempts gave good results, blood transfusion was not widely used. It was a technically rather complicated operation, and in several patients, the transfused blood caused severe complications.Moreover, the works of early researchers showed that blood transfusion remains an exotic method of medicine, in which
progress greatly accelerate the study and application of blood transfusion. Thanks to different methods of blood storage, as well as the invention of freon freezing chambers, blood began to be transported over long distances and stored for a longer time. In 1932, the world’s first blood bank was established in a Leningrad hospital (Community Blood Center, 2020). Soon after establishing the Institute, Leningrad scientists A.N. Filatov and N.G. Kartashevsky acquired a world priority in producing and using blood components: erythrocyte mass and plasma (Community Blood Center, 2020).Strict adherence to blood collection and transfusion instructions has made blood transfusion relatively safe. This procedure has acquired the features of almost a universal method of treatment. It began to be advertised not only for the treatment of blood loss and anemia but also for strengthening strength, nutrition, fighting infection, and preventing various diseases. And so it went on almost until the mid-80s, until the AIDS epidemic radically changed the attitude towards blood transfusion.Currently, the blood service is one of the dynamically developing sectors of health care that is focused on ensuring the quality, safety, and availability of transfusion care. Priority areas at the present stage of the development of transfusion medicine are the maximum automation of work processes based on the development of information systems, the use of high-tech equipment, and the improvement of the product quality management system.
Hewlett Packard (HP) has a matrix organizational structure, which implies the distribution of responsibilities based on the different products that the company offers. In particular, in a matrix structure, there are usually two lines of command: one responsible for the functional line, and the other for the product or project line (Iyer, 2021). Within an organization, there are various divisions that interact with each other and are responsible to functional managers ( Working together , n.d). Within divisions, there is also a hierarchy of employees and managers. The image of the HP organizational structure, which was modified in 1975, is shown in Figure 1.Fig. 1. HP organizational structureThe company’s current CEO is Enrique Lores and the CFO is Marie Myers. Lores has been in the position since November 2019 and Myers since February 2021 ( Executive leadership , n.d; HP Inc. appoints Marie Myers , 2021). Reporting directly to the CEO and CFO at Tuan Tran, who is President of imaging, printing & solutions, and Santi Morera, who is President of personalization & industrialization business. Thus, the directors of divisions are direct subordinates of the company’s executive leaders.The HP CEO is currently exemplifying a transformational leadership style. Lores focuses on “differentiated innovation, business model evolution and strategic M&A” ( Executive biography , n.d, para, 4). This aspect emphasizes that he is trying to develop and maintain a certain vision in the company. This vision allows it to move forward and maintain a competitive advantage in today’s market. In particular, the CEO promotes innovative solutions to change HP’s strategy and operations in today’s environment, making him a bold transformational leader. These aspects emphasize that Lores is an example of this leadership style.
The relentless predators that attack people can be not only bears or wolves coming out of the forest. Sometimes, seagulls also are merciless, like in “The Birds” by Daphne du Maurier – a short story written in 1952. In the center of this work is the story of a farmer and his family, whose settlement is attacked by whole flocks of sea birds. In 1963, Alfred Hitchcock made a film of the same name, which differs significantly from the idea of du Maurier. Although the short story “The Birds” and the movie The Birds are often perceived as a single entity, it is possible to consider all differences between these two versions thoroughly due to historical criticism.Even though the film and story have the same name and base, which involves a narrative about people suffering from the birds’ attacks, many episodes make them different. Firstly, while the written version focuses only on the farmer Nat Hocken, the movie has a lot of heroes. For instance, the viewers can see Melanie Daniels and Mitch Brenner. Secondly, in The Birds , there are more storylines: the birds’ attacks, the line of relationship between Melanie and Mitch, Cathy’s party, and episodes with her teacher. Finally, there are also less visible differences: the events of the printed story occur in London, and events of the movie – in California. The film starts from the meeting in the pet shop, while the written version begins from the moment where Nat sees a lot of birds, “jackdaw and gull, mingled in strange
to the USA. Although the film has more characters and storylines, the written version seems more dynamic. It would be wrong to forget that Daphne du Maurier disliked the final script of the movie due to the numerous changes (Carr). I think the printed version is more substantial and more profound.The differences between the written story and the film were made due to technical and stylistic reasons. Even if Hitchcock wanted to create the movie wholly based on du Maurier’s work, he could not do it because the full-length film required more actions and heroes (Carr). However, it accounts only for the emergence of new heroes but does not explain the missing of Nat. As for stylistic, The Birds is not a full-screen adaptation, but only the movie with the use of some aspects of the written story: the name, the general idea, and the atmosphere.Although certain elements unite the story by du Maurier and film by Hitchcock, they should not be perceived as two parts of one artwork. Due to the historical criticism, it becomes clear that du Maurier puts more meaning into the narrative, symbolizing both the attack of nature and the threat of the East. However, both film and story are bright, engaging, and make people think; therefore, they are worthy of reading and watching.
“that slavery was practiced in pre-Confederation Canada until 1834” (Clarke, 1997, p.103). Finally, Clarke’s (1997) opinion that Canadian whiteness can be explained due to the weather conditions is unexpected. In addition, although the unwillingness of African American people to admit their origin and unite can be understood, racial solidarity would help them more. However, it would be wrong to argue against the author’s idea that the lack of racial solidarity is one of the main reasons for the onset of Canadian “ideal whiteness” (Clarke, 1997, p. 100). It is one of the most compelling facts in the reading since challenges with the self-perception of people of color explain the existence of Canadian whiteness as “an ethereal force” (Clarke, 1997, p. 100). Thus, this work, full of not boring historical data but exciting ideas, is worthy of reading.This article is a significant contribution to the exploration of Canadian history since it shows the inner mechanisms of the state. The author focuses on various facts of Canadian history that emphasize the depreciation of the role of people of color. Clark chooses an unexpected manner of narrating, describing historical events, and diluting them with elements of imagery. Therefore, this work is as surprising as it is compelling.
IntroductionCaring for a chronically ill relative by family members is a network of multifaceted activities and psychological adaptive mechanisms that aim to show empathy and meet the suffering relative. Relatives everywhere influence the patient’s life by scheduling meetings with them, choosing food and gifts for them, and giving them their time and attention to communicate. Emotional support from the relatives’ side is capable of underestimating the level of stress in self-management. Emotional investment has a beneficial effect on the process of adaptation to illness and the search for the most comfortable and at the same time productive life.Aging Process and the Stigma of AgingIf a chronically sick relative is elderly, this can impose additional complications on acceptance and assistance to loved ones. The stigma of aging is usually not only internally psychological but also social. This implies that the patient not only experiences discomfort and an urge to realize his age but may also feel an increasing distance between himself and his family. In such situations, the patient’s level of suspicion and distrust can increase, and a sense of detachment and abandonment can grow. This leads to depressive effects of the state, which is implicitly an obstacle to a comfortable life in the future. That is why a high level of family support through communication, frequency of visits, and involvement in an activity, can objectively increase the level of the patient’s self-management, give them a feeling of support, but at the same time the full value and independence of their personality.The Process of Coping and Tolerance
to DistressAmong the traditional problem reactions that chronically ill patients faces are grief and its various stages with high emotional dispersion. The mechanisms of humility that patients use to adapt to their condition are in many ways similar to the strategies of coping with grief since they include similar parameters. Emotional responses such as disappointment, anger, and ignorance, as a result, are replaced by acceptance in the case of positive dynamics of psychological self-regulation (Russell et al., 2019). Impulsive and unhealthy habits, on the other hand, underestimate the tolerance to distress and, accordingly, minimize the future chances of a healthy life. Such tolerance is formed independently, yet with the help of medical personnel and the environment of loved ones, further priorities and quality of life of the patient depend on it.The Concept of Power and Helplessness in the Context of the Chronically IllThe situation of helplessness in the context of the chronically ill can grow not only because of the awareness of their illness but also because of the lack of proper support provided by the nurse. Once in the health care system, a person may receive an insufficient number of not only the proposed adaptive strategies but also real human attention. The time that nurses devote to patients should be allocated from the point of view of real psychological adjustment, so as not to make the patient feel helpless. It is on how the attending staff interacts with the patient that their willingness to receive help and seek support in their psyche depends.A person in
a situation of such heavy pressure should be able to find independent strength to come to terms with the fact of the disease and learn to live with it and resist it. The feeling of control over the disease or, accordingly, helplessness in front of it is largely formed through communication with medical personnel and loved ones. It also depends on the nurses how to communicate with relatives so that they cannot harm the patient with their braces.There are specific methodologies for communication between nurses and patients that can give the patient’s relatives sufficient instructions on how to give them a sense of motivation and not downplay that feeling. It should also be noted that a feeling of helplessness may appear in a chronically ill person who is feeling like being torn out of the usual cultural context. In the situation of the modern world, a willingness for multicultural adaptation and the ability to show empathy towards a member of a minority should be completely natural in any nurse practitioner.Health PromotionHealth promotion has historically been the primary concern of nurses focused on improving patient health, both physically and mentally. In the case of critically ill patients, promotion implies all kinds of support and provision of access to services that patients are still able to receive. These services include suitable and proper nutrition, social support, and relaxation programs. Particular attention should be paid to stress management programs which can be of different dimensions, both psychological and spiritual. Yoga and meditation in this aspect can be quite practically
effective practices for perfecting the patient’s internal balance.In general, maintaining the patient’s health at this stage of the end of life should imply the provision of a psychologically and socially comfortable life. It adapts to the primary and secondary changes that happened along with the disease and its development (Lubkin & Larsen, 2013). Thus, this practice turns out to be focused on activating human potential and giving it a positive realization even at critical moments in life, which is one of the main tasks of a health worker. Expressions of grief in the context of the chronically ill involve the ability of the nurse to convey information about the patient’s health in a way that makes sad news sound as traumatic as possible (Patinadan et al., 2020). The information itself should not serve as a reason for despair, but the search for hope.Holistic PracticesIn addition to the aforementioned health care practices that should help patients shape their psychological state more naturally, there are so-called holistic medical practices. The idea of a holistic relationship between a nurse and a terminally ill patient is to develop initially beneficial communication. The idea of centralization and balance plays a significant role in building such an attitude since it implies the constant presence of the nurse’s awareness of oneself at a particular moment of what is happening. From the feeling of being with the patient, the actual presence of a psychologically healing environment is created (Dossey & Keegan, 2013). Getting rid of critical and value judgments is also encouraged in a
The first major takeaway from this week’s reading is the complex role nature of parenting. As a preschool teacher, I had an opportunity to witness the massive impact created by parental roles personally. According to Gestwicki (2016), parents fulfill various roles, ranging from workers to consumers and nurturers. I can confirm that many parents are virtually consumed, even overwhelmed by these roles. The constant deficit of time and possible conflicts between the roles create immense pressure on parents. Raising a child in good conditions is costly, which often forces parents to prioritize the worker’s role. However, emphasizing work sometimes leads to a lack of attention to the educator’s role, which can also hurt a child. In a way, I feel that my professional duty as a preschool education worker lies in helping those parents and their children.Secondly, I can confirm the emotional responses and attachment types associated with parenting, as I have seen them in my work. Gestwicki (2016) described the following attachment types: secure, anxious-ambivalent, and anxious-avoidant. As a preschool teacher, I have to be especially caring and comforting while working with children who demonstrated anxious-ambivalent and anxious-avoidant behavior. From my perspective, such behavior is a warning signal, which has to be taken seriously and corrected by the teacher’s actions.Finally, this week’s reading provided a list of reasons for parenthood, which define it as an emotional experience. People perceive children as an expansion of self, try to fulfill moral obligations, look for affection and fun, or follow certain achievements (Gestwicki, 2016). In regard to my work, I think that some of these reasons may lead to harmful consequences for a child. For instance, I feel that pushing a child into disliked activities to satisfy the parent’s ambitions is a traumatizing experience for a child. As such, an educational worker should communicate with parents and warn them if they spot any troubling signs. Parents may be responsible for a child’s upbringing; however, that responsibility does not turn a child into a property object.
highest level, and cargos are administrated with the frames of computer-generated plans.One of the main elements of high-tech methods to sort, track, and control shipments at Hong Kong Air Cargo is the absence of direct human activities and total automation endorsement. According to Elias (2018), enhanced targeting depends on how well automated systems are implemented to measure potential threats to security. Unit and pallet handling must also be improved to reduce the participation of people (go to the container directly from the tarmac). The “sushi-bar” style for conveyors allow holding about 10,000 storage positions for clients’ consignments.Japanese air freight industry continues developing and setting high standards in the sphere of management. Today, the country’s terminals are directed to support the population’s growth and establish positive trends in marketing and managing (Bhattacharya, 2018). If I were a manager in the air cargo industry, I would use the Hong Kong system as one of the best examples to be followed. First, it is necessary to use computer-controlled conveyors to reduce the human impact on shipment activities. Second, the implementation of mapping systems cannot be ignored because they enhance security and flexibility. Finally, the idea of pack tool BSS is a good chance to support total security in the cargo system.
IntroductionGenerally, the market for housing is categorized at the regional and national levels. The two providers tend to relate and consider the rate each use in terms of pricing and average square footage. It, therefore, requires real estate managers to conduct proper analysis to identify the prevailing charges in the sector. To determine the significant relationship in the industry, data containing the name of the state, county, region, house listing price, cost per square foot, and the square footage.PurposeThe project’s purposes are to analyze housing sales prices in a local region in the United States and determine if they are higher than that of the set standard housing price of the national market. The project addresses this claim (hypothesis) by first carrying out a statistical test of means of both the local housing sales market and the national market price. This will be archived through a test statistics T-test on the two means: the local housing sales market price and the national market price. Additionally, the project will use a simple comparison method by getting summary statistics of the local housing sales market price compared to that of the national market price. After that, the conclusion will be drawn based on the findings on whether to reject or accept the null hypothesis.A random sample represents a group or population in which each item in the representation has an equal chance of being chosen (Tamhane & Gou, 2018). Random samples are meant to eliminate biasness in the population depiction. On the other hand, a Hypothesis is a
statistical claim or assumption where an analyst tests those assumptions (claim) regarding a population parameter that is valid.Sample SizeThe main focus of the statistical analysis is to evaluate and determine if there is a significant difference between the housing issue in the region and those in the national market. A random sample of size 100 houses picked from various counties will be used to establish the findings, after which a general conclusion will be deduced concerning the population under study. The sub-set of the population contains state, county, region, house listing price (HLP), cost per square footage (CSF), and square footage (SF). In the research, the means to be analyzed are average prices and the cost per square footage.The project subjects’ samples from the housing sales market price data of size 100 are chosen at random (each sample has an equal probability of being sampled) to minimize type one error in the project. The sampled data has an appropriate sample size, and the process of extraction involves randomization. To very further the condition of the data, I need to confirm if it is normally distributed to ensure it meets the necessary conditions for the analysis.The samples include explanatory variables such as State, County, Region, house listing price, cost per square footage, and square footage. The main focus will be to establish if there is variation between the house listing prices and the cost per square footage in the region and national market. The state and county variables will not be included in the analysis as part
of the population parameter.Questions and Type of TestsHypothesesTo test the hypothesis, the project employs paired T-test statistics. Population parameters in the project based on the samples are the Housing listing price and square footage of homes under the analysis. A hypothesis is an unproved claim or judgment that is not tested and proven true or false. The test aims to confirm the claim if it is true or otherwise.In this project, the Null hypothesis is that the local housing sales market’s mean price is higher than that of the National housing market sales price. However, the alternative hypothesis is that the mean market price of local housing price is below or equal to the national housing market price.In the selected sample, the following are the hypothesized claims: 1. Mean housing listing price, mean cost per square footage, and mean square footage are greater than that of the national market.Where μ 0 is the mean of the local housing market price, and μ 1 is the mean of the national market price. 1. Mean housing listing price, mean cost per square footage, and mean square footage are equal to or lower than that of the national market.Test StatisticsThe project’s statistical test inference will be the student’s test (t) of comparing the sampled mean to the national mean price. The test is defined as follows:Xbar is the sample mean, s is the sample variance, and n is the sample size. The above formula will lead to the value of t critical, which is essential in decision-making. If the
estimated confidence interval is outside the calculated range of the data, we will reject the Null Hypothesis; otherwise, the project advises that the null hypothesis is true. Moreover, suppose the estimated value is much higher or lower than the calculated data or set measure. In that case, the project advises rejecting the null hypothesis; this is true if the estimated value is in the range of -0.5 to +0.5 of the set measure of the national market price (Tamhane & Gou, 2018). A 1-tail test suggests that the calculated (estimated) value is either on the negative or positive side of the set mean.Confidence LevelThroughout this project, a 95% level of significance is used; because a 95% level of significance describes 95% of the data values that contain the true actual mean of the population. It is effective based on this analysis which uses a large sample; thus, the interval range enhances precision.Data AnalysisThe following figure and table give a summary of statistics on the housing market price.Table 1.Table 2.The table below shows the summary of the spread of the data in terms of mean, mode, median, sample variance, and standard deviation.The following figure gives a bar graph of the house listing price.Figure 1.The histogram below summarizes the house listing price.Figure 2.The following table gives test statistics on the house price listing, and the cost per square footage meansTable 3.InterpretationThe appropriate test statistic used in this project is a t-test and based on the results in table 3 above, the t-value is 22.597, and the P-value of
As for goal attainment, an individual coaching group unsurprisingly presented the highest results, though not differing a lot for self-coaching and group training. Lastly, procrastination was reduced to a greater extent with the help of individual coaching and group training. The leadership strategies were perceived as mediation effects and hence, were considered separately. The results showed that more transformational leadership behaviors were observed in individual coaching that led to higher goal attainment and satisfaction. However, the transactional style brought the same results contributing to autonomy support and intrinsic motivation. At the same time, the coaches’ transactional leadership behaviors were proved to be unnecessary for influencing clients’ experiences.Therefore, the initial hypotheses of the research were partly supported, though, for instance, the presumable effectiveness of the group training for goal attainment was not so significant in comparison with other groups. Overall, the practical implications of the empirical evidence include that both individual coaching and group training are similarly successful ways of intervention for the fight with procrastination as well as for skills and knowledge development in general. Self-coaching, in turn, appears to be not sufficient for performance improvement. The leadership strategy plays an essential role in clients’ perceptions that influence the final results.
Bankers used to determine if a person was worthy of being granted a loan or not. The criteria for granting loans were based on the applicant’s habits and relationship with the bankers. People close to the bankers were granted loans causing women and minority ethnic groups to suffer. The loaning system changed when Earl Isaac and Bill Fair invented a system known as FICO. FICO used algorithms to determine the defaulting chances of a loan applicant by comparing their income and expense records. Credit agencies like Equifax use the FICO model to identify default customers. Credit scores are clear, and its industry is regulated, unlike the modern e-score, which is vague and unregulated. E-score algorithms use data like real estate, websites, and items purchased to determine the e-score rating. For example, wealthy estates are given more ratings than poor ones. Since it is illegal for organizations to use credit scores for marketing, companies tap into massive unregulated personal information they use in the marketplace. The E-score model uses proxies that categorize people into races, and if someone’s race turns out to have criminal, the person is considered unworthy of loans.Data scientists should be taught that including race and zip codes in ethics classes is unfair and unethical when building E-score models. Statistics models have always been efficient in the modern world. However, the models sometimes fail, and the victims are seen as collateral damage. Creditworthiness is no longer about the ability to pay debts, as companies use credit reports to make different versions of credit scores
buys people’s data and uses it to create a credit rating system. Many ideas built on the Weapons of Math Destruction are doomed to fail. For example, Lending Club and Prosper generated $10 billion in a $3 trillion market despite having E-scores better than the credit score systems. Their stunted growth is because 80% of the money in their platforms is institutional money. Banks use peer-to-peer platforms to escape banking regulations and create their E-score rating systems.Loan disbursement systems have changed with time and have become more effective. Credit score systems have proven to be more effective than E-score models. Data brokerage algorithms are prone to computer errors that deny loan disbursements to people from poor regions. Companies like Zest finance want to reduce people’s loan interest. Banks use platforms such as Zest Finance to escape banking regulations.
The rapid globalization of the 21st century caused the emergence of distinctive characteristics of modern times. The major change in this respect is attributed to the development of technologies, especially to the emergence of the Internet. In 2021, 4.6 billion people had access to the Internet worldwide (Johnson, 2021), so almost everyone could express his or her opinion about any acute topic. For this reason, ​​Chareonwongsak (2002) sees the emergence of a multidimensional view of truth. The goal of a thoughtful Internet user is not to find necessary information but to sort the relevant one from random speculations. This trait is seen in Singapore’s reality, where the users of messengers and social media can spread fake information about vaccination and coronavirus.The fact that thousands of millions of people almost live on social media provoked many debates about the future implications of such a process. Eveleth (2019) claims that “often consumers don’t have much power of selection at all”. Indeed, many people, especially the modern generation, lost their ability to identify the truth from lies. ​​Chareonwongsak (2002) suggests that the right way for state agencies to act is to try to direct public opinion in the right direction. Although freedom of speech and expression should be protected, the state has tools to deliver and explain verified information about the COVID-19 pandemic. For example, in the US, ‘big tech’ companies agreed to market unscientific comments and opinions with a special ‘fact check’ button. In the case of the Singaporean government, special state agencies can monitor social media with the aim of finding common patterns of misinformation. After that, the government can publish statements or publish videos explaining why the prevalent social media agenda is incorrect.
The Cult of the Head StartSalaryTips, incentives, and overtime compensation are not included in the salary when working as a BCBA. In the United States, the average BCBA pay is around $62,000 per year and the worst ten percent make $47,000 per year, whereas the top ten percent get $97,000 per year, excluding bonuses (Epstein, 2020). BCBAs at the entry-level earn around $57,000 per year, with annual wages rising in the following order: Humble beginnings: $60,000, immediate post: $65,000, and late-career get about $75,000 to $68,000 for a seasoned BCBA and $71,000 in final years (Dounavi et al., 2019). As a person develops expertise as a BCBA, you may anticipate your income to rise.Similarly, an individual’s place of work can have a substantial impact on the compensation. A BCBA who works in the private sector, for example, typically receives more pay than a BCBA who works for a state agency or learning institution. BCaBAs make an average of $44,000 every year, with the top earners receiving more than $70,000 after rewards (Lotfizadeh et al., 2020). However, the annual pay for BCBAs often tends to grow with time.When Less of the Same is MoreSkillsFor an individual to get certified, all BCBAs need to complete stringent conditions, although some BCBAs are in greater competition than others due to added talents. BCBAs with competence in clinical management, ABA, Autism Spectrum Disorder, Structural Analysis and creating processes and standards are sought by employers. BCBAs with functional analytic expertise, for example, recorded a compensation rise of 5%, while clinical supervision abilities
can boost your pay by about 2% or more (Lotfizadeh et al., 2020). Although there is a high demand for BCBAs right now, having extra abilities can give you confidence and generate more revenue.The BCBAs are known for their robust and effective communication and a desire to inform and assist others. They are skilled at interpreting individuals’ attitudes and body posture. BCBAs must evaluate a patient’s behavioral issues and come up with the appropriate treatment plan for that person (Lotfizadeh et al., 2020). The patient’s condition often determines their method; for example, somebody with autism will react differently than somebody with a personality defect.Thinking Outside ExperienceExperienceA professional who has earned accreditation in applied behavior analysis is a Board-Certified Behavior Analyst. The Behavior Analyst Credential Board issues the certification to BCBAs (Epstein, 2020). For those who wish to train, BCBAs must have attained a master’s degree and be board-certified prior to start working on their own, and they usually need roughly six years to acquire their training and gain experience.Behavior analysts need to demonstrate that they have undergone the requisite level of practice in one of three methods. Practicum, which requires a minimum of 1000 hours of medical practice under strict monitoring, independent monitored research work requiring not less than 1,500 hours of medical practice under the supervision of a qualified behavior analyst. An Intensive practicum that needs not less than 750 hours of medical practice under the most stringent supervision is required (Epstein, 2020). BCBAs often undergo job training to understand the company’s systems and procedures
after the job opportunity.The Trouble with Too Much GritNames of Relevant DepartmentsThe growth of the market for BCBAs results from an attribute to increase in public knowledge of autism and the use of applied behavior analysis as a therapy method. Individuals also realize the value that a qualified BCBA may bring to other fields (Dounavi et al., 2019). The following professions are steering for an increase in demand for behavior analysts: therapy for drug addiction, gerontology of conduct, sport behavior psychology, long-term environmental stability and pediatric psychiatry. There has been a considerable growing market for BCBAs due to a recent broadening of what behavioral analysis and therapy can be used for inpatients.Flirting with Your Possible SelvesTypes of Organizations and Actual organizationsBehavior analysts can work in colleges, health centers, clinics, and nonprofit organizations. However, most behavior analysts mainly focus on specific areas such as psychological issues, autism and developmental disorders. Companies that hire behavior analysts include Devereux Advanced Behavioral Health, The ABRITE Organization, The Columbus organization and many more (Boydston & Jowett Hirst, 2020). It is a good moment in the United States to be a board-certified behavior analyst, as BCBAs are in the growing market.ABA treatment companies throughout the state are on the lookout for licensed behavior therapists to be part of their staff. There is an enormous job opportunity for either BCBA or a junior behavior analyst, regardless of certification. In recent times, demand for trained behavior analysts has surged in all fifty states (Boydston & Jowett Hirst, 2020). The BCBA job market has grown
The article How Sushi Went Global by Theodore C. Bestor explores the phenomenon of the sushi boom that occurred in the United States and the world, in general, in 1970th. Such growth in popularity of Japanese food and culture was explained by the fact that more people started thinking about leading a healthier life and replacing red meat with fish, rice, and vegetables. The Japanese way of life and food preparation appealed to many people, and from the local dish, sushi became a symbol of Japanese culture that is famous all around the globe.Sushi expansion caused the growing demand for tuna for sushi and sashimi making. Though in 1970th, Japan remained the leading producer of the raw fish that is used during the process of sushi preparation, tuna-producing farms appeared in many countries, including Spain, New England, and Canada. Though the workers there were not Japanese people, the majority of the technologies used in these farms came from Japan. At the same time, the sushi boom was influenced by the globalization process that made Japanese culture and cuisine even more recognizable. Moreover, sushi gained such popularity that it even made the owners of Chinese or Vietnamese restaurants change their course towards Japanese cuisine in order to get more profit and new clientele.After sushi was recognized globally, Japanese people created a whole industry to teach sushi chefs and other workers relating to the global sushi business. However, sushi is currently associated not only with the Japanese but the Asian culture in general since people from Korea, China,
of viewers. Hollywood movies are designed not only for the American audience but for audiences all over the world.The author states that unlike Hollywood producers and directors, who perceive the movies as handmaidens for the theatrical markets, European movie-makers regard television revenues as a substitute for the theatrical ones. That is why Hollywood films have such an enormous success, as they rely on the advanced publicity that is usually launched before a film is officially released. European films, in contrast, are designed to be placed on the TV, and that is why they do not often meet theatrical success.Apart from that, Hollywood movie-makers learned to meet consumers’ demands in a global sense what makes its movies interesting for people outside the American culture. In addition, Hollywood studios pay attention to such aspects as the commercial success of the film and refuse to work with those that have lower chances of obtaining it. However, it is wrong to say that Hollywood studios contribute to American cultural imperialism since a lot of directors and actors are non-American by birth. Hence, when speaking about Hollywood, it is better to regard it as a universal movie-making industry that is based on American ethos.
some nurses used to pin the call bell to the nightshirts of the most restless patients. Thus, it activated the emergency call bell systems when patients climbed out of bed.Numerous studies have been conducted recently to develop and establish a single framework that can help reduce the frequency of patient falls at all hospitals nationwide. According to Watson et al. (2019), hospital policies, reduced supervision, disease processes, the environment, and patients transferring without assistance dominated the increased risks of patient falls. Therefore, hospitals can improve supervision and provide various enhancements, such as introducing lower beds, among other measures.Patient falls represent a unique problem directly linked to the environment medical workers create and sustain at a given hospital. High patient fall rates can unexpectedly undermine all the efforts of doctors and nurses. Therefore, it is crucial to address the issue by encouraging nurses to care about the environment and safety standards at hospitals as much as about the treatment process.
Organization Development & Manpower Planning and Information Reporting  * Organization development targets improving the organization’s capabilities through the alignment of people, structure, strategy, and management processes.  * The main aim of manpower planning is to estimate the number of people for the successful work of an organization. They do it by counting the number of working personnel, establishing the types of skills required for the job, and analyzing demand and supply trends.  * Information reporting section specialists research the ratio of customers’ approval of the services. They gather statistics through phone calls or public polls for the clients.Recruitment  * Recruitment specialists search for new employees and lead them through all the stages of employment.  * It is the responsibility of the recruitment section workers to decide upon the employees’ promotion.  * When the term of the contracts between the institution and the employee is over, and the latter is willing to stay, recruitment specialists renew his contract.Salary Management & Benefits  * Salary managers provide statistics and reports on the payments and benefits to the workers released in a certain period of time.  * Salary managers establish the amount of severance pay for the employees who decide to quit.  * Salary managers deal with the retirement pay for those who are not capable of performing the job due to old age.Employee Relations & Performance Management  * Performance managers analyze statistics on each worker as well as the feedback of other managers to establish the efficacy of each employee’s work performance.  * They also establish strategies that will help boost the efficacy of the institution’s work.  * Employee relations specialists are responsible for providing healthy relations among employees, employees, and managers.
Technological development is becoming the dominant factor influencing the transformation of modern society. It creates unique opportunities, opens horizons for personal growth, and contributes to the shift of the values of humanity and its social structures (Quinn, 2020). However, besides the noticeable positive transformations, technology poses a threat to civilization, and its containment, regulation, and implementation are challenging. An average person cannot stop the constant process of technological expansion, and it is impossible to conclude which way the result of specific means will go in advance (Quinn, 2020). However, it does not signify that it follows its path. People should not simply observe the industrial growth and produce everything they can or set in motion processes that lead to the destruction of natural living conditions. On the contrary, each person has a great deal of control over how to use machinery.One of the most controversial modern technologies is artificial intelligence, the scope of which is vast. It makes it possible to track anyone offline and digitally and gain control over a considerable amount of personal data, which threatens privacy (Quinn, 2020). Furthermore, it simplifies hacking, financial fraud, and other illegal activities. On the other hand, artificial intelligence is also operated to combat these violations successfully. It can monitor and repel cyber-attacks, identify the perpetrators, and save time and resources. From this example, it can be deduced that technology has many harmful and promising applications. However, it is noteworthy that the chief property of any intellect is the ability to learn, which is not a self-governing process.Technology cannot perform specific actions independently without prior human intervention; hence, its work and application are primarily people’s responsibility. Therefore, individuals must be guided by values while realizing that the choice of exploitation has severe consequences (Quinn, 2020). Technology itself cannot create or destroy societal values; on the contrary, the environment in which it develops determines how it will continue to work. Significances such as the rule of law, democracy, individual liberty, and human rights are reasonable for overcoming the direct consequences of industrialization. These principles make the use of technology ethical and preserve all social benefits.
most effective measures to prevent comorbidities and complications for already infected patients. For the investigation of the question, the observational design will be used, which is widely used in epidemiology to collect data (Paneth & Joyner, 2021). As part of this study, the researcher monitors “the exposure and disease status of each study participant” ( Section 7: Analytic epidemiology , n.d). To answer a research question, a cohort study is most suitable, which will identify exposure to the disease. Based on the data obtained as part of the study, it will be possible to analyze existing risk factors that take into account the possibility of developing cancer.The advantage of this method in the framework of this study is the ability to collect relevant information. When conducting observations, the researcher can collect the necessary statistical data on the incidence of cancer due to HPV infection and consider risk factors that potentially increase the possibility of developing the disease. Most importantly, observational design as part of a research question will collect data for future statistical analysis. Follow-ups of patients who already have cancer due to HPV and a study of their lifestyle will help identify contributing factors. On their basis, later, it will be possible to make an analysis to identify patterns of cancer development as a consequence of HPV. The information obtained in the framework of an observational study may be sufficient to consider the question posed.
or duplicated in many situations (Lazer et al., 2021). Within a dominant and larger society, societies can also be composed of like-minded people dominated by their own customs and values. This is sometimes referred to as a subculture, a term widely used in criminology.Society can also be thought of as an economic, social, or industrial infrastructure made up of diverse groups of people. Members of the society can come from several ethnic groups. Society can be a specific ethnic group like the Saxons, a nation-state like Bhutan, or a broader cultural community like Western culture. An association is a voluntary group of people organized for religious, philanthropic, cultural, scientific, political, patriotic, or other purposes.I have walked to Miami beach and started to observe the environment around me in order to see the society. I saw people doing morning jogging, families having time together, and many different people who were walking to work. All of these people were of various ethnicities, genders, and probably with many other individual characteristics. Despite that, all of them are living in the same geographical area and are bound by certain social relationships. That is what made me recognize and explore the society around me.
Para Nuestras Hijas is a civil organization that was created in 2002 in the city of Chihuahua (Mexico) with the purpose of promoting access justice in the cases of missing or murdered women (HHRI, 2017). This phenomenon is particularly serious in the state of Chihuahua, where the organization was created, as the murder and kidnapping rates of women were very high in the 2000s (HHRI, 2017). I would allocate the funding to the expansion of the program and building direct relationships with the US to maximize the efficiency of preventing human trafficking. Moreover, I would focus on advertising the organization in the country so that women in danger could contact it using the most convenient way. Increased awareness about the organization could also encourage people to report any known cases of women and children abuse.
the points of growth, which ultimately contributes to the natural development of the academic success and career.In James 4:6, it is said: “But he gives us more grace. That is why Scripture says: “God opposes the proud but shows favor to the humble.” This message reflects the aforementioned vision of humility as the primary tool against the pride. The latter feeling is detrimental, it poisons the soul and pushes a person toward rash, unreasonable decisions. A proud person is often disrespectful of others, showing no love or compassion because of their clouded judgment. This characteristic does not align with an image of a successful and educated person that is evoked by Weil. An individual who truly excels in academics, learning the subject in all its depth and complexity will be humble and methodical in their development. This way, they truly fulfill their purpose as the conduits of God’s will favored by the Lord.
step toward the development of science, but it should be used carefully. While nature “has a marvelous mechanism to ensure that each human life has an identical number of chromosomes” and is unique, genetic changes should be utilized only in urgent situations (Belsky, 2015, p. 38). Genetic manipulations are a good idea for two profound reasons: a child’s abnormality or disease. The bioethicist Kevin Smith claims: “if several disorders could be avoided or delayed by genetically modifying humans, the average disease-free lifespan could be substantially extended” (as cited in Guy, 2019, para. 9). Other factors, such as parents’ wish to have a blue-eyed child or a boy instead of a girl, have ethical implications: those manipulations are intervention into the lives of minors and can damage the embryo. The altering DNA for such reasons should hardly be admissible. Therefore, a significant gap lies between the desire to choose the child’s sex or eye color and the striving to save the life or prevent the disease.The idea of “designer babies” can hardly be evaluated as exclusively positive or negative. On the one hand, it indicates the development of genetics and contributes to the destruction of some diseases a child could suffer. On the other hand, the idea of designing unborn humans in the same way that technologists create computer machines seems unnatural. Therefore, in several cases, the manipulations with genes are indispensable and can bring extraordinary benefit, but in other situations, perhaps it would be better to entrust this matter to nature.
process. Moreover, nowadays, this problem only devastates me, which literally increases my wish to help others due to the risk of being the victim of such a phenomenon. Many people face the obstacle connected with continuing living in a country that does not meet their expectations and cannot provide the needed conditions of residing and working throughout their whole life. As a result, the world population experience a significant decrease in overall quality of life. From the global perspective, the most influencing countries in the world use visa and other conditions of entering the country as a migration regulating tool. However, when it comes to the emergency outflow of the country’s citizens, these tools should be banned owing to the high amount of pressure made on migrants who are trying to escape their home country to avoid more significant problems.Turning to the solution contribution, I would force private entities, which succeed to become international “players” to help those people who cannot properly become political migrants due to the severe regime which does not admit such status officially. This solution would increase private companies’ reputation in the world society. Moreover, due to the great social responsibility reliance, local and global authorities might decrease the international companies’ tax pressure, which will relatively compensate the company’s losses on the social responsibility programs. From the other perspective, the tax exemption and companies’ contribution to the migration process easing are mutually eliminating operations, which might stop inflation from increasing when it comes to countries with unstable domestic currency.
Boeing is the largest aircraft manufacturer of all time, having success stories running throughout U.S business history. The company is well-known for its commercial airplanes and input in space and security. William E. Boeing established the company in 1916 in Seattle before moving to Chicago (O’Connell, 2020). Boeing started manufacturing by transforming a building plant designed for wooden boats. The company earned its first income from the United States military and contracted it to develop aircraft. Due to the influence the firm had in the market, the owner focused on ensuring that he gathered input and ideas from all staff members.Boeing also developed aircraft specifically designed to deliver mail to faraway cities and towns in the country. The aircraft provided a faster way for people to share information despite having distance barriers. This forced the company to change its business model to incorporate airplane manufacturing and flights. In 1931, Boing transformed other airlines into a single one to form United Airlines (UAL) and also purchased other airplane manufacturing companies to expand its operations (O’Connell, 2020). Later, the firm changed its name to Boeing Airline Company and played a significant role in developing military aircraft used during World War II.When the war was over, Boeing shifted back to manufacturing commercial aircraft to make single trips across the country. This meant that the company had to eliminate aircraft that used propellers and adapt turbojets. Boeing started receiving large orders from the United States air force, which made it roll out the 707, commonly used by Pan American Airlines.
This airplane model was the public’s favorite since it allowed them to move from one city to another within a few hours. Becoming the public’s favorite aircraft enabled Boeing to manage large orders for the airplane model. The high number of orders for the 707 made Boeing develop the 737 and 747, which affected the production process, almost making the company announced bankruptcy.As Boeing considered the production of the 747 models, the industry was hit by a recession which acted as a barrier to domestic carriers purchasing new aircraft. The production of the 747 was also affected when the company started building the 2707 model, whose production had been halted due to the high costs involved. However, the 747 became the highest-selling aircraft since they were bigger and had faster engines (Hayward, 2020). Boeing never gave up on the airplane model, which was fruitful. The company has seen an increase in revenue coming from its diverse product line and a high number of orders from customers. With time the company has opened up multiple subsidiaries to handle various operations. Despite being a giant in the aircraft manufacturing industry, Boeing still has many competitors seeking to overtake its position.Boeing started expanding its operations to enable the production of helicopters. Boeing’s assembly lines also integrated the manufacture of missiles for the military, with the first missile being launched in 1962. Boeing also expanded its processes to allow air and land craft building, with NASA being the main customer. This enabled the company to produce rockets to take human
interactive time machine clearly shows how the Arctic sea has shrunk since 1979 by a significant margin, whereas CO2 concentration in the atmosphere has increased drastically in less than two last decades (“Carbon dioxide”). In other words, major indicators of climate change are all pointing towards the fact that some measures need to be taken in order to stop further catastrophes ahead. Similar observations can be made in regard to temperature, which also shows significant heating of the planet. In addition, a simulation of sea-level increase by six meters, major cities, such as Miami and New Orleans, can go completely underwater.One of the most dangerous and immediate dangers of such a quick climate change is food production. It is stated that “the soil microbiome governs biogeochemical cycling of macronutrients, micronutrients and other elements vital for the growth of plants and animal life” (Jansson and Hofmockel 35). In other words, the microbiome of soil is a key determining factor for food production since both animal and plant lives depend on it. However, drastic changes in the climate not only hinder the growth of crops through increased rates of natural disasters and droughts but also soil depletion and scarcity of essential nutrients. Therefore, it is a highly probable possibility that the most significant threat of climate change is global hunger and famine. With an ever-increasing world population, demand for food is growing as well, which means that food shortage might become the most impactful effect of climate change.
Human beings always encounter conflicts in their daily lives, and, unfortunately, many of them fail to deal with these challenges effectively. Undoubtedly, they are inevitable and make a negative impact on individuals if not properly resolved. Therefore, it is essential to invest time and effort in advancing one’s conflict resolution skills in order to positively affect different areas of life, ranging from family relationships to work performance. One of the useful ways to achieve it is to reflect upon the conflicts, which occurred in the past.To begin with, during the last year, I dealt with a number of conflicts, both effectively and ineffectively. For example, my friends often disagreed with me about various issues, such as the place to travel together, different perspectives on social problems, or ways to complete some tasks. I also had multiple arguments with my relatives and neighbors over either minor or major questions. It can be concluded that I faced conflicts almost every day in the past year. I suppose that most people do it as well, though they may not recognize all disagreements, as they are a routine part of humans’ lives.The be honest, I clearly realize that it is more effective to adopt the interest-based approach to addressing conflicts, though sometimes I concentrated too much on my own position and refused to consider others’ needs. Nevertheless, in most conflicts, I endeavored to collaborate with another party in order to find solutions, which would benefit everyone. I tried to focus on others’ desires, fears, and concerns, as well as to
the significance of the interest-based approach, though I failed to give up my position and recognize others’ concerns occasionally. Finally, I avoided numerous conflicts in the past year due to various reasons; thus, now, I need to prevent such behavior from occurring to be more effective in conflict resolution.In conclusion, humans encounter different challenges every day, and disagreements with other individuals are among them. It is critical to reflect upon one’s past disputes in order to become better in conflict resolution and positively influence many areas of life. I believe that I successfully dealt with a number of disagreements in the past year. However, sometimes I failed to address them properly by either avoiding or competing. This knowledge offers many valuable insights, which I can use this year while facing both minor and major conflicts.
As a matter of fact, renewable energy that includes wind, solar, hydropower, biomass, ocean, geothermal, or biofuel energy, may be regarded as a highly essential power generation source in the nearest future due to its efficiency and the impact on ecosystems. The major benefit of the generation of renewable energy is the minimization of water and air pollution as it does not presuppose carbon dioxide emission and soil erosion. Consequently, clean soil, water, and air contribute to the safety of ecosystems all over the world. However, regardless of its multiple advantages, the sources of renewable energy may be potentially harmful to the environment. Their negative influence is predominantly connected with the location and peculiarities of facilities, the production of constructions’ parts, and the improper utilization of materials required for production.For instance, the use of wind energy is highly beneficial for the preservation of ecosystems in the future. First of all, it may be regarded as a free and renewable source the supply of which will not change in the course of time. Moreover, wind energy is a source of non-polluting and clean electricity – in comparison with traditional power plants, wind stations do not emit greenhouse gases and other air pollutants.At the same time, wind energy may have a negative effect on wildlife through the constructions for its generation. Thus, all wind plants have “the potential to disrupt wildlife behavior through day-to-day turbine operation, maintenance activity, and construction noise” (NREL, 2020, para. 4). In addition, spinning turbine blades may be dangerous for lying species, including birds
the value based on the investor’s percentage of ownership in net income, loss, and dividend payouts (Tuovila, 2021). This implies that Company F will need to record the initial investment as an asset and then make adjustments to this value due to the investor’s share in the company’s income or losses (Tuovila, 2021). Let’s assume that the initial investment of Company F was $4 million, and Company K reported $500,000 in net income and paid $100,000 in dividends. Then, the following entries should be made: 1. Company F should record a debit to the asset account on June 30 for $4,000,000 as “Investment in Company K.” 2. Company F should record a credit of $4,000,000 as to its cash value on June 30. 3. On December 31 st , Company F should record a debit of $200,000 (40% of Company K’s income) as “Investment in Company K” to the asset account. 4. On December 31 st , Company F should report a credit of $200,000 to Investment Revenue. 5. Similarly, on December 31 st , the company should record a credit of $40,000 (40% of Company K’s dividends) to cash. 6. Additionally, on December 31 st , Company F should report a credit of $40,000 from the asset account as “Investment in Company K.”Thus, at the end of the year, investment recorded in the balance sheet will be $4,160,000 ($4,000,000 + $200,000 – $40,000). At the same time, the income statement will demonstrate a change in cash value by $3,960,000 ($4,000,000 – $40,000).
A cardiac angiography entails the determination of any form of blockage in blood vessels. The procedure is done by injecting contrast dyes through a catheter, followed by the visualization of the flow of the pigment through blood vessels (SCOT-Heart Investigators, 2018). Any impediment to the movement of the dye is an indication of blockage of blood vessels and restricted blood flow to the heart.The doctor ordered this test because the patient complained of chest pains when climbing up the stairs. Chest pain is a common problem for people with heart disease even though other organs could contribute to this discomfort. However, the patient’s weight and lifestyle (smoking, sedentary lifestyle, and consumption of fatty and sweet foods) predispose him to heart disease. Mr. Perkins’ diagnosis is angina pectoris, which is chest pain attributed to the inadequate flow of blood to cardiac muscles. The organ system that is mainly affected by Mr. Perkins’ condition is the cardiovascular system, which includes the heart and blood vessels. However,Cardiovascular disease impairs the transport of blood to and from the lungs, which ultimately affects the respiratory system. Other organs that may be damaged by poor blood flow are the kidney and brain. Insulin resistance may also develop due to being overweight. The doctor ordered an angiography to find out whether the patient’s blood vessels were blocked and contributing to the chest pain. Mr. Perkins’ blood work might show high levels of cholesterol, triglycerides, low-density lipoproteins, and glucose as well as low levels of high-density lipoproteins.Suggested treatment plans for Mr. Perkins include pharmacological
BackgroundClinical laboratory science is very essential in the diagnosis of infections and disorders. It provides information that guides in the collection and examination of a specimen. The results obtained enable doctors and other physicians to make the accurate diagnosis and therefore design the appropriate drug therapy for the patients. Some diseases like rheumatoid arthritis are interesting to learn due to their unique laboratory tests performed. Anti- cyclic citrullinated peptide test is carried out to check presence or absence of anti- cyclic citrullinated peptide antibodies. This test is positive for people who are prone to these diseases. Such diseases have promoted research in this department, enabling more accurate diagnosis and therefore treatment of patients.Point of Care TestingThis is the laboratory testing of patients in operating rooms, recovery areas, patient’s bedside, or home testing. This has increased the interaction of laboratory physicians, respiratory therapists, nurses, assistant physicians, operating room technologists, and anaesthesiologists. It provides cost effective methods and advancements in medical care and enables an immediate and accurate assessment in intensive care units or parent units, emergency departments, and operating rooms. Tests performed mostly are analytical, such as prothrombin time coagulation test, partial thromboplastin time coagulation, and erythrocyte measurements like hematocrit. The regulations of CLIA’88 are followed to ensure accurate and quality results are obtained as well as quality control and proficiency testing is provided. The laboratory director ensures that all regulations are implemented and adhered to.SafetyThe safety of the patients and the laboratory personnel should be maintained. Most of laboratory accidents are usually caused by lack of
paying attention to instructions, carelessness, and lack of concise and proper communication during the testing. By use of suitable mechanism, strategies, common sense, and staying alert can be used to minimize such accidents. There are bodies that are responsible for ensuring blood borne pathogen prevention and protection, and ensuring electrical, fire, and chemical safety is guaranteed which Health Administration, and Occupational Safety and other bodies. Musculoskeletal disorders are the most common physical, ergonomic stressors where muscles, nerves, tendons are affected, for example, tendinitis and sciatica.Workers are vaccinated against hepatitis B, rubella, and measles infections. Conducive working conditions, education on first aid methods, and personal protective equipment are provided. The Joint Commission and National Patient Safety Goals reinforce patient safety methods. Therefore, errors in the pre-analytical phase, for example, in blood sample collection and patient identification, and analytical errors like verifying the accuracy of abnormal results are avoided as well as Post-analytical mistakes like communication of tests results are avoided.PhlebotomyThis is the process of making a puncture in a vein, usually in the arm, with a cannula for the purpose of drawing blood; It is also referred as a venipuncture. Factors such as ambient temperature, altitude, humidity, and light are considered during this procedure. This procedure should be carried out by trained personnel to ensure the patient’s safety and that the correct results are obtained, and no complications like iatrogenic anemia arise. Anticoagulants such as ethylene diamine tetra-acetic acid prevent coagulation caused by fibrinogen. Blood cultures should be protected from contamination. Specimens are susceptible to clotting, hemolysis;
icterus, and lipemia, in addition, tests performed are mostly pre-analytical. Laboratory and clinical standards institute are responsible for regulating laws and legislations governing phlebotomy.Clinical Chemistry: LipidsLipids are biochemical molecules with cholesterol and triglycerides; they are plasma-bound, forming lipoproteins. They have functions in the body, for example, insulation to allow nerve impulses and heat loss, energy storage, structural components of cell membranes, and they act as hormones.70% of the cholesterol in the human body is from the liver, the rest if from dietary intake. High levels of cholesterol increase the risk of atherosclerotic disease. Cholesterol is an essential structural component of the animal cell membrane and precursor of bile acids and steroidal hormones.The serum is the specimen used by a patient who has fasted for 12-15 hours. The instrument used is a serum separator evacuated tube, and an enzymatic cholesterol assay is carried out. The desirable amount is less than 180mg/dl, the moderate amount is between 200-239mg/dl, and those at high risk have levels of more than 240mg/dl. Familial lecithin cholesterol acyltransferase deficiency is a disease transmitted as a recessive trait. It is usually associated with hyperphospholipidemia and hypercholesterolemia with underlying conditions of hypertriglyceridemia.Hematology: LeukemiaThis is an uncontrollable and abnormal proliferation and progressive displacement of hematopoietic cells with standard cellular elements.They are classified morphologically into lymphocytic and myelogenous, they termed as acute or chronic, depending on the amount or number of blasts available. Examples include acute myelogenous leukemia, chronic myeloproliferative disorder, and lymphoblastic anemia. Flow cytometry identifies specific cluster designation and cell surface membrane markers.

are subjected to platelets concentrates due to low platelet count, abnormal platelets, or after massive transfusions. Platelets are harvested by the process of plateletpheresis or from a single unit of fresh, whole blood. Plateletpheresis allows for a yield of 200 to 500mL of a single donor platelet unit with a minimum of 3.0×1011 platelets. They are prepared by centrifugation and removal of plasma from a new division of donor blood and subsequent separation of platelets from platelet-poor plasma.They are stored at room temperature (20°C – 24°C) with continuous, gentle agitation for 5days, although bacterial contamination occurs sometimes. Generally, the process of blood banking usually takes place in the lab to ensure that the blood products or any donated blood are saved before they are engaged in medical procedures or blood transfusions. This process can be conducted by testing the presence of diseases in the blood or typing the blood before it is transmitted. Such an approach is fundamental during the patient care unit because it helps the physician avoid any medical-related errors before donating or transfusing the blood.Coagulation: Therapeutic Anticoagulant TherapyCoagulation is the process by which coagulation factors, plasma proteins, and calcium are subjected to work together on the platelets’ surface to make or form a strong fibrin clot.Therapeutic anticoagulation therapy uses glycoprotein receptor drugs such as abciximab, eptifibatide, aspirin and clopidogrel, intravenous antiplatelet membrane, and thrombolytics. Direct thrombin inhibitors (DTI) such as new oral anticoagulants, warfarin, a vitamin K antagonist analog, and anti-Xa anticoagulants such as heparin are also used.
Toxic water pollutants have an adverse impact on the environment and people’s health. Nowadays, due to the tremendous amount of factories’ wastes, many dangerous emissions fill the air, water, and, unfortunately, human bodies. One of the most life-threatening toxic elements is mercury pollutant. It causes irreparable consequences for the environment and human health. Every year vast amounts of mercury are found in the different water pools. The toxic metal connections, contaminating the water inhabitants, cumulate in the fish. Then, people eating fish and shellfish get themselves exposed to mercury contamination. As a result, life-threatening diseases incrementally develop and can lead to abrupt death. Therefore, to reduce the risks, environmental health specialists should adequately analyze the potential threat of mercury contamination and provide recommendations. Mercury contamination prevention practices are also vital for ensuring public health safety.Mercury pollutants are dangerous for all park users because of their adverse effects on human health. The toxic contamination can spread through swimming and fishing in water pools. The skin is one of the direct channels of how mercury can get into the human body. Due to the highly toxic and corrosive nature of mercury, this pollutant can pass through the exterior layers of the epidermis and have a high chance of getting into the blood (Casso-Hartmann, et al., 2021). As far as mercury is pretty heavy, it can accumulate in the blood supply system causing frequent damage to the neurological system. This process is especially dangerous for adults and the elderly who suffer from tachycardia. Moreover, mercury can damage the skin
causing allergy or severe skin irritation (Casso-Hartmann, et al., 2021). Thus, swimming in the lake, estimated to have mercury pollutants, is dangerous and should be strongly prohibited.Lake fish is also exposed to the long-lasting effect of mercury. The longer fish is affected by the dangerous pollutants, the more it can harm the human. The fish scale is a perfect material to accumulate mercury elements because of its patchy texture (“Persistent organic pollutants”). Therefore, the fish contains much more pollutants in its body than people can get through swimming. Getting mercury with fish while eating is the easiest way to be exposed to mercury pollution. The digestion system quickly spreads all the mercury particles into vital body organs, and people risk having severe health problems (Casso-Hartmann, et al., 2021). Thus, as far as eating fish is the most dangerous way to get mercury contamination, fishery in the contaminated lake and further fish selling should be prohibited. People’s health directly depends on their understanding of risks and awareness about how to avoid contamination. Park visitors should be mindful of their safety and stop fishing and swimming in the lake.The risks of mercury pollution to the different types of lake users are various. The severity of the mercury contamination consequences depends on the age of the person exposed to the contamination, the way of contamination, the health condition, and many other factors. Scientists believe that age is one of the most common factors determining contamination exposure (“Health Effects of Exposures to Mercury”). However, the most dangerous effects mercury has
on unborn children in the womb of pregnant women. Scientists, analyzing the social-medical consequences of mercury pollution, state that methylmercury is often found in fish and has adverse effects on unborn children’s brain development (Budnik & Casteleyn, 2018). The infants are at high risk of severe neurological distractions and different kinds of malformations, which can even cause the abrupt death of the newborn (“Health Effects of Exposures to Mercury”). Therefore, mercury pollution is hazardous for pregnant women and their future kids.Young children also run a risk of falling victim to the adverse consequences of mercury lake pollution. According to practical research, children exposed to mercury contamination in the age of eight to fourteen often have different kinds of neurological disorders like attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (Figueira, et al., 2017). Usually, such neurological distractions are temporal and disappear after the neurological system changes. The symptoms disappearing is possible only under the condition of complete mercury exposure avoidance (Figueira, et al., 2017). The young children’s brain activity is still unstable and continues to develop. As a result, they are also at a high risk of being badly harmed by mercury contamination.Speaking about older children, they seem to be less vulnerable to toxic emissions. However, the investigated practical examples showed that the children after fourteen being exposed to mercury contamination often have such adverse effects as coordination disorders and sometimes even tremors (Figueira, et al., 2017). Moreover, the contamination can affect the neurological systems, hearts, lungs, or kidneys in a long-term perspective (“Health Effects of Exposures to Mercury”). The
being exposed to mercury contamination. However, people of all ages should avoid using water pools estimated to have a high mercury pollution level. Therefore, to ensure health safety, the usage of contaminated lakes should be prohibited.Many researchers are aiming to reduce the amount of mercury in the water. The most decent one is considered to be implementing the plankton, which absorbs the mercury particles while filtering the water (Wang, 2018). This research can be helpful in the long-term perspective.Swimming 1. People should avoid swimming in the lake, especially on a regular basis. 2. People should check whether the water they are going to swim in does not contain dangerous pollutants. 3. To ensure safety, a regular estimation of mercury pollution should be held.Fish consumption 1. Pregnant women should avoid eating lake fish. 2. The fish should take only one-six of the healthy adult nutrition. 3. If scientific analysis proved the high mercury concentration, people should be informed about this fact (Wang, 2018). 4. The programs to increase people’s awareness of the adverse mercury effects should be held. 5. The fishery must be prohibited in the contaminated lake.
international trade?In order to research these two questions, the study employs quantitative research methods and secondary data.Firstly, the correlation research will be conducted to establish the relationship between two closely connected entities, such as cross-border e-commerce and international trade. It will help to determine how one aspect impacts another and what are possible changes that can be observed. Data of the most influential platforms such as AliExpress, Taobao, or RED, will be correlated with information about international trade, recent changes, and tendencies that can be linked to these organisations. The correlational analysis presupposes the employment of a quantitative statistical technique to characterise the nature of relations between two investigated phenomena.Secondly, the data acquired during the correlation research will be analysed with the primary goal to conclude where there are positive changes in the second variable (Chinese international trade) that can be related to the rise of cross-border e-commerce and whether they can be traced at different periods. This approach is linked to the second research question and helps to cogitate about the existence of positive or negative trends that should be considered while analysing the problem.
IntroductionThe British company ASOS is an example of a company that has very successfully adapted to the new age of the Internet. The brand launched its online store in 2006 and began selling its clothes and shoes. The new generation of millennials was the company’s target audience. Now the total revenue of ASOS is growing very fast. ASOS demonstrates how online commerce can allow the company to become an international market leader. The promotional events held by ASOS and the wide range of products help the economic growth. However, the current measures are not enough to ensure such intensive growth.The Context of the ProblemThe emergence of online commerce has opened up new opportunities for both manufacturers and consumers. The world economy has evolved significantly with the advent of the Internet. A powerful logistics system made it possible to deliver goods worldwide and provide services remotely. Large firms managed to create a particular model of doing business on the Internet. Its features include incentives, a focus on the global marketplace, and the integration of new technologies to drive growth. All of this saves customers time and, during discount periods, saves them money. The Asian, U.S., and European sales market has moved almost entirely online, and major local and international leaders are emerging.The sharp decline in ASOS quotations at the end of 2018 led the media to believe that the end of the era of online shopping was near. Sales are no longer as intense as they used to be, and therefore profits are down. The reason for
this is the fact that traditional online retailers cannot keep up with a market ruled by infrastructure companies. Shoppers are no longer satisfied with waiting weeks for an order and demand next-day delivery. However, due to logistical difficulties, not every company can meet this demand. This level of quality is not yet available to many companies. In addition, revelations about the nature of sales promotion have driven some customers away from retailers.ASOS should have thought about competing with stationary retail outlets, where customers can hold goods in their hands and start using them immediately, without waiting for order delivery. Promotions and special offers have spoiled European and American shoppers. That is why they are often unwilling to accept discounts of less than 50%, for example, during the pre-New Year period. ASOS, an experienced player in the market, has to take this factor into account. The company monitors sales dynamics and, if necessary, can pull up the statistics by stimulating marketing activities. However, it did not do so, for example, when the stock collapsed at the end of 2018.Three Solutions to the Problem: Improved LogisticsSolutions to the problem can include ways such as teaming up with other companies, changing the existing logistics system to focus on Amazon’s experience, and improving the site to meet customers’ high expectations. Long delivery times are one of the most common customer complaints. Amazon, the largest online commerce site, deals with this problem quite effectively. In particular, the company has begun reserving space for its shipments on cargo ships. This helps the
company get rid of go-mediators, which will make the delivery process faster. Amazon is also working with its fleet and testing drone delivery. The company plans to create a flying warehouse, which will also reduce logistics costs.ASOS should consider using Amazon’s expertise. The company does continue to implement a single warehousing system between the U.K. and the U.S. and promotes the development of partners’ operational capabilities. In addition, the firm’s investment in improving logistics is significant, and there are known cases of building partnerships with firms in this area. However, more intensive measures, such as those taken by Amazon, are needed. Amazon’s separate, powerful analytics system calculates the most economical way to deliver packages. It calculates the shortest route for each parcel, saving the company millions of dollars in fuel costs. ASOS’s revenue allows the firm to budget extra money for better logistics.Improving Site Performance and DesignThe Internet is a significant source of growth for the company, but the retailer’s surge in popularity has repeatedly caused numerous website glitches. In addition to technical errors, some questions are raised by the ASOS interface, which would lead to improved customer satisfaction. Although the company has several subsidiary brands, its advertising is poorly represented. In addition, there are problems with positioning – most customers know ASOS only as a clothing store. Moreover, the case analysis mentions that visitors to the site and its primary customers are women and men between 16 and 34. People in this age category make up only twenty percent of the total number of online
shoppers. Accordingly, some aspects of the ASOS site and its appearance could be improved.The solution to this problem has to do with site analysis. As noted in the case study, the staff at ASOS is now organized by hierarchy. There are separate departments that deal with specific tasks. Therefore, it would be advisable to assign or create a department that would conduct a UX audit to verify the site’s usability. The result of a usability audit is usually a document that explains the site’s problems in detail and suggests solutions and notes best practices as examples. Due to the customer information collected on the site, online retailers know exactly what customers are looking for. Accordingly, ASOS needs to make sure that the site is performing as well as it should in order not to lose profits.Company Growth through IntegrationThe integration process leads to the merger of companies operating in the market. Horizontal integration is the merger of companies producing the same type of product. Its benefit is to reduce costs and increase market share. After this type of merger, the product made remains the same. Companies resort to vertical integration to reduce operating costs. The company already has a successful integration experience, for example, with Topshop. ASOS then reported results for the second half of the fiscal year 2020. According to it, even in a pandemic, there was an increase in profits. Immediately after the merger, a significant increase in traffic was recorded. Accordingly, integration can be an effective way for the company to grow further.Eliminating
Two SolutionsThe company should not consider a website redesign only based on aesthetic needs. Changing the external interface has no direct correlation with an increase in the company’s income. And in an attempt to create the perfect site, clients and performers lose a lot of time that could have been spent on more productive changes. Website redesigns can cause an adverse reaction, even if the previous site was far from perfect. It is necessary and keeps in mind that radical modifications often lead to unpredictable consequences. All of the above suggests that ASOS should pay attention to other ways to increase company growth and profits.Vertical integration coordinates the various components of an industry chain in an environment where bilateral trade is not profitable. While this type of integration usually reduces some risks and transaction costs, it also requires significant upfront capital investment. Moreover, the effectiveness of such coordination is often questionable. Horizontal integration increases resource efficiency, lowers prices, and lowers costs. However, weaker competition and increased concentration of sellers in the market worsen the efficiency of resource allocation, which poses a threat to monopoly. Integration is not the best way to develop ASOS because efficiency is questionable and monetary costs are high.Creating an Action Plan with the Remaining Way to Solve the ProblemASOS sales growth seriously slowed down late last year due to the difficult situation caused by a new strain of Omicron coronavirus infection. Revenues fell by one-fifth, the exception being the local U.K. market. One should pay attention to Amazon’s experience. The company has
other than the United States. ASOS’ investment in logistics is still significant, but the company does not resort to such radical methods as, for example, renting seats on planes.ConclusionASOS grew quickly in online sales, but new solutions need to be implemented to ensure further growth. Of the three paths discovered, two had to be found unsuitable for one reason or another. Thus, the only possible way to ensure further development of the firm is to improve the logistics. Logistics costs can be reduced by eliminating unproductive operations, such as cargo handling. ASOS needs to ensure optimal warehouse locations and eliminate activities and intermediaries that do not add value for consumers and other supply chain participants. Optimizing the use of vehicles by capacity and mileage to minimize delivery costs and other solutions can also increase company profits. ASOS should choose this path to ensure the company’s growth.
IntroductionKrisna Hospital provides secondary and tertiary healthcare services to its patients. The hospital is committed to providing patient-centered care, which resulted in introducing a new position as a patient care executive (PCE). This professional is in close contact with patients and families to help physicians spend more time on medical aspects and less time on communication with patients. Patient retention, as well as revenue, increased, but the hospital is also witnessing an increasing turnover rate among physicians. Due to a significant deficit of high-profile physicians in India, losing a high-skilled practitioner is a serious problem to be addressed as hospitals try to attract talent. Discussions with the staff make it clear that the clash between PCEs and physicians is one of the primary reasons for leaving. This paper includes a brief analysis of the problem and a solution to ensure the sustainable development of the healthcare facility by improving the quality of care.Phycological Contract Breach at Krisna Hospital and Ways to Address ItOne of the issues the physicians employed at Krisna Hospital find influential is the psychological contract breach. It has been found that psychological contract breach has serious adverse effects on employee job satisfaction (Collins and Beauregard, 2020). The practitioners expect to be trusted professionals influencing patients’ health-related decisions. However, this expectation is not met as PCEs appear to be the central figures who affect patients’ behaviors and decisions. At that, trustful relationships between the doctor and the patient are the basis of patients’ adherence to treatment regimen and, as a result, patient outcomes (Cánovas
et al., 2018; Hefner et al., 2018; Chandra, Mohammadnezhad, and Ward, 2018). The fact that patients are willing to communicate with PCEs rather than physicians and follow the recommendations of the former can be seen as an influential factor contributing to the breach of the psychological contract.One of the causes of this serious problem, leading to the high turnover among physicians, is the existing patterns of sources of power in the hospital. PCEs are responsible for maintaining proper communication between the physician and the patient. However, they are more than that as they become the major source of information and support for patients. These professionals exercise expert and referent power regarding patients’ decision-making process. These types of power encompass trust and proper relationships based on the belief in the person’s expertise and positive personal attitude (admiration, close connection, and so on) (Håvold and Håvold, 2019). These types of power are critical in healthcare settings as patients feel vulnerable and need support and empathy in addition to expertise and clinical care.At the same time, physicians’ source of power is associated with their position within the healthcare facility (legitimate) and their expertise (limited expert power). At Krisna Hospital, physicians are completely responsible for patient treatment, and their authority is not expected to be questioned by PCEs (which happens quite often). Patients also understand that doctors have the necessary expertise, but in many cases, people choose to follow the recommendations of PCEs whose expertise is valued more than that of physicians. Patients trust PCEs rather than their doctors, which
has negative effects.To address the psychological breach and improve communication between patients and doctors, it is necessary to design detailed sets of responsibilities for both positions. These responsibilities should be clear to physicians and PCEs, who should collaborate rather than compete. It is critical to creating teams consisting of physicians, a PCE, and other healthcare professionals. PCEs should stick to the treatment plan and provide recommendations consistent with these plans, ensuring proper communication between the medical staff and patients.Main Reasons for Resisting the PCE ProgramAs mentioned above, the psychological contract breach is one of the primary reasons for resisting the PCE program at the healthcare facility. Physicians believe that patients should follow their recommendations while people often disregard them and follow PCEs’ advice instead. However, PCEs have no deep medical knowledge, which can have negative patient outcomes, according to Krisna Hospital physicians. Disrupted communication is a serious reason that makes physicians resistant to the program. These practitioners and PCEs do not communicate properly, which creates two lines of communication instead of one single approach developed by the healthcare team. , the lack of communication skills in doctors can also be an issue to be addressed. They can be too concerned with the medical aspect and forget about such domains as empathy and patient psychological and emotional needs (Kee, Khoo, Lim, and Koh, 2018; Pascual-Ramos et al., 2021). The hospital administration should consider launching a training program aimed at improving communication skills for physicians. Team-building incentives (following the creation of teams of physicians and PCEs) should also
in communities or clubs cultivates a public attitude to multiple events, forms a lifestyle, and influences politics. For this reason, the changes in civic life are significant for states. Putnam, in his essay “Bowling Alone,” also emphasizes this idea, saying that the social life of the USA collapses, and it is difficult to predict the results of this process. Active engagement in social processes has always been one of the major features peculiar to the country, but the situation has changed. Putnam says that “tens of millions of Americans had forsaken their parents’ habitual readiness to engage in the simplest act of citizenship” (67). It means that people have started to alter their lifestyles, shifting towards isolation and detachment, which is not typical for U.S. society.Furthermore, traditional organizations, such as clubs, are replaced by new mass membership organizations. Putnam says they have more political importance and might impact the country; however, they do not promote civic engagement. “For the vast majority of their members, the only act of membership consists in writing a check for dues or perhaps occasionally reading a newsletter” (Putnam 70). This line shows that Putnam is worried about the continuous process of disconnecting community members, who become divided and disengaged. From a long-term perspective, it might result in the collapse of civic life. The results cannot be predicted as the USA has always been a state with strong community relations. That is why Putnam says that if nothing changes, we will bowl alone, isolated from others.
Spend types are important for an organization when deciding on data-driven choices. Spend needs a perfect understanding of spend classes which comprise of direct, indirect, maverick, and tail spend. Another name for direct spend is direct procurement and it revolves around obtaining raw materials and goods required for production. Indirect spending is also referred to as indirect procurement which, can be categorized as operating costs and above costs that cannot be straightly linked with the entire cost of the end product. Maverick spend or maverick buying occurs when acquisitions are made outside of the institution’s attaining plans (S. Sheth et al., 2020). When procurement is not involved in purchasing decisions, chances are lost for price evaluations and deductions while accumulating the risk of acquiescence matters.An intuition can improve its method of identifying a spending type in purchasing using the following strategies; by working in tandem with investors, obtaining can help reduce maverick spend and discover other opportunities that can help save on the costs. Examining direct and indirect spending is a sourcing approach that can pinpoint areas for cost-savings, expose probable supply dangers or predetermined gaps, and upsurge competencies. Scrutinizing spend analytics of acquisition orders will aid in identifying drifts and zones where enhancements can be applied to influence the buying power.A supplier is an individual or a business that offers products or services to another institution. An organization can use the following strategies to ensure that they improve their methods of identifying suppliers, the institution should ensure that the suppliers they meet for negotiation are
and putting them in one position, where it can be analyzed and improved for better understanding. For a corporation to improve its tactic on identifying the strategy of integrated supply approach with distributors. The following policies should be applied, by generating a more linked logistics fetter in this way, you can even develop “ordinal doubles” of your manufacture movements and your stock chain. That would give you the authority to observe the action from all trace points on the worth chain, technologically, in actual time. The IT environment of the integrated distributors should be free from silos (Mody et al., 2018). The organization should ensure that the integrated supply approach with distributors has specific aims selected and KPIs because they are vital for incorporating other data streams in their workflow.
For a healthcare organization, maintaining continuous success in a highly competitive and, most importantly, increasingly challenging and strenuous economic setting is a tremendous challenge. Although the Asian Health Services (AHS) has managed to find a niche that has been allowing it to maintain dominance in the market for a while, the current approach has become quite outdated, calling for a change in the strategy. Specifically, what the company called its “Blue Ocean,” namely, a pool of opportunities for strategic marketing and active development, has largely depleted. By focusing on the management of its turnover rates and investing in the professional growth of employees and the expansion of the services, AHS will be able to find a new “Blue Ocean.”The current policy utilized by Ahs seems to be geared toward sustainability and patient-oriented care. To its credit, the company has managed to introduce an effective strategy for handling financial risks, which is especially notable given the current economic circumstances and the challenges associated with maintaining effective financial performance. However, there are certain issues with the business strategy that AHS has been implementing; particularly, the lack of focus on the factors that shape employee retention and turnover rates should be seen as an important concern. Specifically, the observed trend may signal low levels of content among employees, which may entail a significant drop in performance and, therefore, a drastic loss of service quality. Due to the high levels of competition in the healthcare sector, the failure to maintain its competitive advantage is likely to cause the organization to
ultimately dissipate. Therefore, AHS must revisit its corporate policies, particularly, those aimed at managing AHS’s human resources.In order to develop the much-needed flexibility in risk management and ensure an increase in employee retention rates, AHS will need to shape its approach toward talent management. Specifically, AHS will have to prioritize the needs of its employees, providing additional benefits to staff members. These could include not only financial incentives but also training opportunities, which align with the idea of constant innovation that AHS should pursue to remain relevant. Indeed, studies show that the increase in the range of opportunities provided for staff members, particularly, in regard to the provision of professional development opportunities, affects retention rates positively, reducing the extent of staff turnover (Harris et al., 2020). The observed change can be explained by the rise in employee loyalty and engagement, as well as the rate of motivation among staff members (Harris et al., 2020). Therefore, the focus on professional development in the target population should eb seen as one of the highlights of the future change within the organization.Furthermore, AHS will have to involve customers into the process of organizational decision-making to increase their sense of importance within the company. Namely, employees should participate actively in shaping the company’s policies and its organizational setting (Azizi et al., 2021). By providing staff members with a strong voice within the corporate context and cementing their impact on the organizational culture, AHS will be able to promote diversity and acceptance in the workplace environment, therefore, making it more acceptable
Ever since the 17th century, the colonies in North America have been home to various ethnicities, including the Hispanic immigrants, who contributed to forming the unique American identity. If to talk about the Hispanic population in the United States, now it concludes more than 60 million people, after the rates of immigration in America skyrocketed during the 20th century. In many cases, immigrants form or join the closed communities, and the people, who live there, are often not adjusted to the environment of the main population. The musical In the Heights , written by Quiara Hudes and Lin-Manuel Miranda, depicts various social problems within the Hispanic community on the example of multiple characters. The authors raise the topics such as homesickness, poverty, which results in a lack of possibilities, cultural conflicts, and depression among the immigrant youth. Nina Rosario is the daughter of two hard-working immigrants and the first person in her family to go to college.Her story is an excellent example of how a person faces an alien environment and gets depressed because of it. Another good example is Usnavi de la Vega – the story’s narrator. He is experiencing homesickness and feels like an unnatural element of the country’s environment. One of the most discouraging issues for immigrants in the United States is that a person may feel like an alien in a new aggressive and sometimes xenophobic surrounding. Thus, the musical shows that the immigrants remain secluded within their communities, lacking the possibilities and education, and measures must be taken by the government
to give these people a better future.First of all, it is essential to note that the environment, which became home for many Hispanic immigrants, makes them feel rejected. In Nina’s case, she encounters a severe gap between herself and her college mates during her first schooling year. For instance, when she talks with Benny about differences in various Spanish dialects, she proclaims that “they spoke different language at Stanford” (Miranda and Hudes 63). This means that even though she is a good scholar and tries to integrate into American society, she cannot be the natural part of the surrounding environment. As for Usnavi, New York has never been a welcoming place for him compared to his home country – the Dominican Republic (Miranda and Hudes 106). After finding his bodega looted, Usnavi expresses his sickness towards his home country and decides to travel there (Miranda and Hudes 100). As Peter Debruge says, “In scene after scene, “In the Heights” acknowledges how hard immigrants must work for their place in this country” (69). Thus the newcomers, who want to take their place in the country, almost constantly feel rejected and have to work harder than the average American.In addition, bicultural people conduct a big fraction of the Hispanic population; unfortunately, many of them cannot relate to any culture, thus feeling distressed. The term “bicultural” in this case means that second-generation immigrants represent two ethnic identities – their native culture and the American one (Mancenido et al. 1269). Usnavi and Nina are second-generation immigrants, referred to as bicultural
people (Ragavan and Cowden 243). Therefore, the fact that they are a part of different, and in some cases, opposing cultures serves as a severe stressing factor (Mancenido et al. 1269). The main reason for it is that the individual’s personal perspective may be distorted due to the conflict of opposing values. As a result, these individuals are highly exposed to distress and anxiety since they cannot relate to any of the mentioned communities, most likely feeling foreign and alien.Another critical aspect of the immigrant experience in the United States is the lack of opportunities, connections, and proper education, which leads to ever-increasing crime and poverty rates. For instance, the parents of Nina, neither of whom has any educational degree, praise their daughter for going to college, stressing how important education is. Not surprisingly, when Nina fails to complete her first schooling year and returns home, her father says that the girl is “useless, like my father before me” (Miranda and Hudes 36). This way, the author shows that the perspectives both in Latin countries and among Latin immigrants in America appear to be quite unpromising. Given the fact that the environment in the United States has tended to be anti-immigrant for more than ten years, migrant communities encounter low social mobility and high poverty rates (Roche et al. 2328). Thus, the whole community is facing a problem of the inability to climb a social ladder to gain a better job or a proper education.Finally, the problem resulting from previously mentioned factors is second-generation immigrants’ skepticism
towards their prospects in society. After losing her scholarship, Nina is unsure about her being able to gain a proper education to find a suitable job and ensure a bright future. She proclaims that “maybe she should have just stayed home” (Miranda and Hudes 19). This is the author’s way of showing that immigrants’ youth sometimes display incertitude about their future due to the surrounding poverty and xenophobic society. The studies show that higher social optimism has been connected with the economic status of the young person’s family (Roche et al. 2329). Therefore, the rates of optimism are relatively low among Hispanic immigrants in the United States (Roche et al. 2329). Thus, second-generation immigrants often lack the optimism needed to cope with various difficulties and barriers.There is a clear need to improve the current living conditions of immigrants and the representatives of ethnic minorities; it is important to make the surrounding environment less aggressive, offering more working and education opportunities. Many people, who came to the United States from developing countries to find a better job (Klasen et al. 265). Although they sought opportunities, they did not gain any of them. The country operates as a closed environment. Therefore, any newcomer will be pushed away from education or even citizenship due to the lack of money or connections. Thus, it is important to focus on raising the number of community colleges. Community college is an alternative to standard higher educational facilities (Leo et al. 2). In addition, it is possible to expand the system of scholarship
grants to provide capable students with proper education. Giving a first-generation immigrant a feasible opportunity to obtain citizenship is another way of addressing the mentioned issues (Roche et al. 2336). This will provide the communities with a confident outlook on their future in the country, as well as give them the possibility to find an adequately paid job.Integration of the immigrants in the society is one of the essential needs of the government, especially that of the bilingual and bicultural people. The representative of the minority rarely associates himself and his culture with the country he lives in (Mancenido et al. 1269). In this case, the government must undertake several actions to improve the situation. For example, it is possible to promote biliteracy on a state level. This way, the student will have an opportunity to achieve proficiency in two or more languages, including English and his native language. As a result, the bicultural people will understand that they represent two unique cultures and that they are accepted in both environments. Citizenship is another factor of a person’s integration into society. It allows an individual to take part in the country’s political life and offers him a possibility to invite his family members to live in the United States. More importantly, a citizen cannot be deported; the individual understands that the country cannot be hostile towards him. Thus, an immigrant, integrated into society no longer considers himself a foreigner; he feels a commitment towards his new country.Finally, there is a need to address the issue of
characters in In the Heights musical is the author’s way to show an immigrant or an individual of immigrant origin struggles with the hard conditions, caused by an aggressive environment. In the case of Usnavi de la Vega, his lack of integration into society and difficult childhood made him doubt his belonging to the place he lives in. Nina Rosario, a promising student, who wanted to overcome the financial difficulties to gain an education, was faced with an alien culture of wealthy American students. Because of her inability to work two jobs and receive an education at the same time, she could not continue with her studies. However, at the end of the story, each character overcomes their inner and outer troubles. Nina understands that she must go on with her life and do anything possible to prosper in the future (Miranda and Hudes 133). As for Usnavi, he understands that he belongs to the place where he lives (Miranda and Hudes 153). This story gives a reader an understanding of how important it is to give possibilities and hope for a better future to any individual, who came to the United States to seek opportunities.
The word “inclusion” comes from the verb “include” (of French origin and means “to contain, to include, to embrace, to have in its composition.” Nowadays, this word is becoming a term that reflects essentially a new view not only of education but also of a person’s place in society. Inclusion is the central idea of the development of modern education, affecting profound social and value changes in our society. Inclusion is based on the idea of an inclusive society. It means that any person (of a different race, religion, culture, or person with disabilities) can include in public relations. Inclusion should promote the interests of all members of society, despite their limited physical capabilities, to ensure equality of their rights in all types of activities.The idea of inclusion arose within the framework of large-scale changes in understanding human rights, dignity, and identity. The change in attitudes towards people with disabilities has become just one of the manifestations of these changes. The ideology of inclusion (inclusive society) forms because of awareness of the value of human diversity and differences between people. The introduction of inclusion is possible only based on the principles of democratization and in the absence of discrimination on any basis.Inclusivity is the process of meeting the diverse needs of all students and responding to them by increasing participation in learning and communities and reducing the number of cases of rejection and exclusion from schools. There are several essential stages and significant events in the evolution of inclusive education. Until about 1965, the “medical model”
operated mainly. In the education process, children with disabilities were placed in special schools and boarding schools (Ramel, 2020). In response to the isolation of children with severe health conditions, voices began to be heard in countries focused on the democratic foundations of society, calling for reforming the entire system and making it more humane.The search for ways of joint education begins, conducted in parallel in European countries (Scandinavian countries), the USA, and Japan. If integration begins to be carried out in Scandinavia mainly in a normative and practical way, then in the USA, its implementation is preceded by pedagogical searches and experiments. The concept of normalization, adopted in the USA and Canada, emphasized education in the spirit of cultural norms accepted in the society in which a person lives. It was the beginning of the civil rights movement for those previously excluded from society, including people with disabilities. The economic, technological, and information capabilities of Europe, the USA, and Japan have made it possible to create a parallel educational environment. The mass education system for the implementation of inclusive education, along with the existing particular education system.In addition, the urban infrastructure was made as accessible as possible for people with disabilities, information, and other barriers that limited the opportunities for this category of population to participate in social life remove. This period is associated with integrating children with developmental disabilities into the environment of ordinary peers (Ramel, 2020). Gradually, the concept of normalization began to appear not perfect; integration began to be defined as “positive
When doctors in the United States first discovered patients with an unknown disease affecting internal organs in 1981, they did not yet know that a virus caused it. Healthy young males suddenly began to develop illnesses that had previously been found in premature newborn infants and or due to the birth of sick children. Doctors determined that these young men’s reduced immunity was not congenital but was acquired in adulthood. That is why the disease was called AIDS – acquired immune deficiency syndrome – for the first few years after it was discovered. Only years later, it was discovered that AIDS was only a late stage of HIV infection when those infected with HIV develop serious, potentially fatal lesions.In the 1980s, no one knew for sure that HIV could cause AIDS in 10 years or even 20 years after infection. To be sure of this, doctors had to observe patients with HIV infection for the whole 20 years. Therefore, some impatient scientists in the 1980s denied the role of HIV in the development of AIDS (Cisneros, 2021). As time has shown, their theories about the origin of AIDS were wrong. Since the beginning of the epidemic, scientists’ main goal has been to develop effective methods of preventing and treating HIV infection. However, despite the obviousness of the HIV problem, there are people who question its existence. The HIV denialism movement, which emerged almost immediately after the discovery of the disease and its identification as the cause of AIDS, actively promotes anti-scientific hypotheses about the absence of
both the virus itself and the connection between HIV and AIDS.Such misinformation can be detrimental both to the organization of prevention efforts in general and to the direct health of individuals who, given false reports, may refuse treatment. It is known that the South African government has used AIDS denialism to justify its inaction in the HIV response, which has resulted in South Africa now having the highest HIV prevalence in the world.As a result of adhering to the position of denial, patients refuse to start the antiretroviral therapy they need, stop the treatment they are already on, do not undergo the necessary examinations. The HIV infection progresses, secondary diseases develop, which in most cases end in the patient’s death. In addition, people who adopt a position of denial ignore the need to comply with measures to prevent HIV transmission, which leads to the spread of the epidemic. During treatment, a health care practitioner may be guided by stereotypes and fail to take into account the individual course of a patient’s illness, thereby failing to provide appropriate therapy.In the 1980s, HIV infection was commonly associated with injecting drug use and promiscuity. It was more convenient for the public to say that this infection was spread only among disadvantaged populations than to acknowledge the magnitude of the problem. Certainly, this prejudice could not help but affect how effective the measures to spread the disease have been. Family members of those infected told of ruined relationships with loved ones and acquaintances. Stigmatizing patients will only worsen their recovery
analyzed scenario, this may mean that people can get rid of stereotypes by getting closer to HIV-infected. Distorted perceptions, irrational beliefs about HIV infection, and infrequent testing lead to late diagnosis of the disease. This significantly worsens the clinical picture of HIV infection and increases mortality among HIV-positive people.No one currently doubts that along with the purely medical aspects of the epidemiology and treatment of HIV infection, the development of effective programs to prevent the spread of the disease is a pressing issue. Social stereotypes and attitudes regarding one’s own behavior and the behavior of others related to sexuality and drug addiction have a great influence on attitudes toward this disease. Therefore, increasing public awareness of HIV infection and implementing timely and effective preventive measures in all population groups is necessary. This is all the more important given the rate of growth of the disease in many less developed countries.
In 2020, the pandemic forced the government to pass the Families First Coronavirus Response Act (the FFCRA) and the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security Act (CARES). The policies affected the private health coverage use in the national attempt to maximize the accessibility of COVID-19 diagnostic testing and treatment. The Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) and the Departments of Labor and the Treasury developed a set of regulations to make Americans benefit from their insurance and receive essential coronavirus-related services at no cost (The 116th Congress, 2020). The policy can be viewed as beneficial for the collective good; however, tensions between the public impact and individual rights occurred. Indeed Saleh et al. (2021) claim that “to ensure a more efficient implementation of the policies produced, all of these aspects should involve the participation of different stockholders, undertaking transparency, and taking cultural differences into account” (p. 649918). This paper aims to explain how COVID-19 healthcare policies caused tensions between individual rights and the collective good and discuss their legal and ethical considerations.The FFCRA and the CARES Acts became the earliest response of the US government to the COVID-19 outbreak as the urge to enforce the healthcare system occurred with the rapidly growing incidence. The most prominent update addressed the taxpayers’ money and private insurance revision to retrieve additional funding for hospitals and make supporting payouts for citizens (Khullar et al., 2020). Furthermore, such populations as the impoverished and the elderly were at a higher risk of facing severe consequences, enabling the legislators to create effective
(Bodenheimer & Grumbach, 2020). Then, the concept of justice requires equally fair treatment (Bodenheimer & Grumbach, 2020). The inability of a person with severe chronic conditions to receive timely assistance during the pandemic disrupts the three ethical principles described above, making the recent public health actions non-applicable for individual rights (Saleh et al., 2021). Moreover, legal considerations of the FFCRA and the CARES Acts were developed to make the regulations applicable to all states with diverse administrations and laws. Thus, the policymakers were forced to view the nation as diverse populations and groups of citizens rather than individuals with specific conditions, income levels, and insurance capabilities.The FFCRA and the CARES Acts passed by the government in 2020 to make healthcare organizations generate additional funding to address the COVID-19 pandemic were beneficial for the collective good. Indeed, they included the conditions to serve the nation’s need for receiving urgent coronavirus testing, diagnosis, and treatment to decrease the infection spread. However, individual rights were not considered and caused tensions as people with chronic diseases, or specific conditions could not get priority healthcare.
Introduction: Drug SentencingThe crack cocaine epidemic has influenced modern sentencing for drug possession or selling due to the severity of the situation at the time. However, the current conditions portray the inefficiency of the system when it comes to combating drug-related problems on a national scale. Instead, the same disparities related to over-policing still affect certain ethnicities and races, the LGBT minority, and people with a record of mental illnesses. The over-policing of vulnerable demographics leads to a dispersed system in which certain communities are more prone to being legislatively punished for the same offense. Needless to say, the crack cocaine epidemic in the 80s and 90s led to the militarization of the police since there were many counter-drug operations that needed more severe approaches.Factors Creating Inequality in the Legal SystemThere are several factors that create such inequality in the legislative system. The inequity is evident since the people incarcerated for drugs are primarily represented by minorities such as African Americans, LGBT representatives, people with mental illnesses, and other vulnerable populations. In order for the problem to be mitigated, it is essential to consider all the aspects that lead to such outcomes. First, the legislative system itself was and still is centered around punishing drug offenses instead of preventing them. Moreover, certain groups are being marginalized from how they are being judged to how they are treated in prison. Police officers are often biased when detaining suspects, and corrections officers ignore the injustice that affects these individuals, which is why the rate of incarcerations and remissions
is so high.Marginalized GroupsIt is certain that specific demographics were targeted as primary offenders during the war on drugs. However, as the crack cocaine epidemic has mutated into an opioid epidemic, the same minorities remained the most often incarcerated for drug possession. According to researchers, communities of color are disproportionally represented in the category of people sentenced for drug offenses, which is one of the outcomes of the crack epidemic (Charity, 2017). Moreover, research examining the topic has concluded that the LGBT community is also disproportionately affected by drug use and, thus, sentences related to such offenses (Haeder et al., 2021). Last but not least, a study has shown that around 50% of all incarcerated people deal with mental illnesses (Frankham, 2018). Based on this evidence, it is inevitable that drug-related charges have been primarily represented through the imprisonment of minorities, a factor that has not been mitigated since.Sharanda JonesA case that has been circulating in the media due to the illustration of unfair policing is Sharanda Jones’ incarceration. Jones was sentenced to life in prison in the late 90s for a non-violent first drug offense (Rosen, 2021). The situation is direct evidence of the biased policing field decision-making since Sharanda Jones, an African American woman, has not been involved in any illegal activity prior to the one in question. The life sentence is evidently an overly strict punishment for a non-violent offense. However, the racial bias may have been why Jones was incarcerated and then sentenced so harshly. It is essential to point out that
the discrimination has not been illustrated by the police officers but rather by the court system overall in this particular situation. Thus, it is vital to examine the multi-layered system, which starts with field decisions.Field DecisionsThe legislation itself primarily impacts field decisions. Thus, police officers investigate cases based on the guidelines implemented on a state and federal level. However, there is a level of bias when it comes to how the situations are dealt with. There are multiple reasons why this may be the case. One of them is the lack of diversity among law enforcement officers. A lack of diversity can lead to disproportionate incarcerations of particular groups that are not represented among police officers. Moreover, another essential factor is targeting specific populations without looking at the broader picture. Thus, communities that are statistically less likely to have high incomes or access to high-level education are vulnerable to being involved in illegal activities. Instead of implementing prevention measures and confronting the core of the problem, the field decisions are based on the outcomes.Courts DecisionsLaw enforcement is a multi-layered entity, which is why it is crucial to address the multitude of actors within the system. Courts are the tools used to decide whether one deserves punishment and how harsh it should be. Based on Sharanda Jones’ case, it is certain that a life sentence was not only facilitated by the system itself but also the bias that has led to such results. First, it has to be mentioned that there are discrepancies when it comes to
the individual’s socioeconomic status. Jones’ financial situation did not allow her to hire a good lawyer that would perhaps be able to minimize the sentence and successfully represent the client in court. Moreover, researchers illustrate that even death sentences are predominately given to black inmates (Shestak & Goncharova, 2020). Also, courts are more likely to sentence people with mental illnesses and LGBT representatives, as mentioned prior, which also refers to the bias of the system.CorrectionsPolice officers, judges, and attorneys are not the only people affecting vulnerable populations. It is also vital to point out some of the factors that directly influence the individuals sentenced to prison times. In terms of female prisons, oftentimes, male corrections officers engage in unethical behavior (Stern, 2018). Moreover, transgender women often have to serve their sentences in male prisons, which puts them at high risk of sexual assault (Jenness et al., 2019). Currently, prisons cannot provide the necessary care for pregnant women, disabled people, and those with mental illnesses. Moreover, since drugs are a major part of why people are being incarcerated, inmates are unable to self-medicate and cannot access adequate resources to combat phycological disorders. Such circumstances are often a result of oversight and the lack of intentions to change the situation for the better.What If?If Sharanda Jones were a white, wealthy woman without the need to provide care for a paralyzed mother, the situation would have been different. As Jones’ offense was a no-violent one, and the individual in question had no prior problems with the police, the police
officers, judges, and attorneys would undoubtedly be keen to facilitate a much less harsh sentence. The argument is not that a person willing to engage in drug use cannot impose any danger on society. However, the measures with which such people are dealt with only create a dispersed environment with a lack of equal opportunities for all. Jones’ vulnerable societal position facilitated by racial ethnicity, income, and family situation led to negative outcomes. If Sharanda was a part of the majority and the law enforcement would not have reasons for bias, it is certain that Sharanda would not have received the same punishment.DiversityWhile diversity is not evidently linked to the inequality which is suggested by the rate of people incarcerated for drug-related offenses, it has a major role. Law enforcement is not proportionally diverse compared to society as a whole, which has several adverse outcomes. First, it may create a hostile environment in which bias is not considered a negative factor but rather an undisputed reality. Moreover, a diverse workforce may lead to an improved culture of the entity. Thus, law enforcement officers who are not operating in a diverse environment cannot achieve the same cultural will to maintain a reputation of a safe, lawful, and fair organization. Furthermore, a lack of diversity may facilitate the lack of insight when it comes to how different communities operate and the factors that have to be confronted to create equal opportunities.StatisticsStatistics show the disparities when it comes to the employees operating in the legal system. White men are
The article discusses infection of the periprosthetic joint as one of the most devastating complications resulting from total knee arthroplasty. Prevention of PJI aims to reduce the number of complications, which is 1% of 42 cases. In this regard, the effect of the combination of vancomycin powder and dilute povidone-iodine lavage on reducing PJI in patients at high risk of arthroplasty was examined. Thus, this combination increased the success rates of successful irrigation, debridement, and liner replacement in treating wounded PJI.Although the US has a low incidence of PJI, it accounts for about half of the readmissions for all total joint arthroplasties. Moreover, the article notes that PJI significantly reduces satisfaction and life expectancy. With the further spread of the infection, significant resources must be devoted to preventing, detecting, and treating PJI. Thus, endoprosthetic infections are an important area in which there can be no over-budgeting and new avenues of treatment.The article suggests that a study and protocol that includes topical vancomycin powder and diluted povidone-iodine lavage can significantly reduce the incidence of early PJI. Thus, the risk of early infection following a primary TKA may be reduced regardless of the identified preoperative risk. This protocol confirmed a statistically significant risk reduction when using the powder. Therefore, a clinically relevant study of relatively reduced risk in PJI should be considered when widely used, especially in centers with high infection rates.In addition, the reduced rates are economically significant for centers involved in value care. However, the data are still uncertain; the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention
(CDC) recommends applying antimicrobial powder to surgical incisions due to a lack of definitive clinical data. However, the World Health Organization (WHO) has suggested using the powder before wound closure. Thus, the study described in the article proves that the combination of vancomycin and povidone-iodine lavage may be a more effective system. This conclusion is based on the fact that the mixture is a relatively readily available antiseptic material for areas of surgical incisions. Therefore, although the powder’s effectiveness is not yet proven, the study shows a reduced risk of orthopedic arthroplasty infections.Total joint replacement can be called one of the most frequently performed procedures in the field of orthopedic surgery. Over time, the need for expected replacement increases, leading to more associated complications. The article describes the need to reduce postoperative complications by preventing infections by involving patients in understanding and targeted action on actual and potential risk factors. Thus, there is an increased need for risk reduction for a more successful postoperative recovery.The most common modifiable risk factors are obesity, anemia, and malnutrition. These factors account for approximately 80% of patients at risk, including diabetes. To prevent these factors and prevent their impact on postoperative recovery, it is necessary to conduct preoperative screening. Other factors requiring these measures include Staphylococcus aureus, tobacco or alcohol dependence, depression, recent medication, and possibly cardiovascular disease. Moreover, elderly patients should be especially carefully examined. This is because some risk factors occur in people over 64 years of age, whose stay in the hospital is a more extended period.
A prolonged hospital stay may be an independent factor in PJI, resulting in a mortality rate five times higher than in younger patients.A prolonged hospital stay may be an independent factor in PJI, resulting in a mortality rate five times higher than in younger patients. In this case, obesity and diabetes require a more protracted intervention in the preoperative screening of the patient. To be medically effective, screenings should be performed 2-6 weeks before surgery to allow sufficient time for intervention and treatment, including antibiotics. Patients with more than one risk factor are most susceptible to the onset and development of PJI. Thus, the article considers the definition of risk factors that can be modified and eliminated before surgery.All patients who have undergone TRA are prone to complications and are at risk; however, the article suggests predisposing factors. In-depth training and timely intervention play an essential role in optimizing patients before surgery. Moreover, patients requiring reoperation also require critical follow-up regardless of screening results before the first operation. Thus, the article confirms the importance of preoperative screening to identify risk factors before TRA. Additionally, awareness can help improve infection prevention among patients with risk factors.Joint replacement is a last resort but proven effective intervention to help people with severe osteoarthritis. The intervention restores the physical function of the joints, and people feel full. However, the risk of infections is one of the most severe complications in joint replacement. Prevention of SSI consists of multifactorial interventions that may include risks associated with the environment, the surgeon, and
Two Uses of ICT at HomeICT has a variety of utilities, and it has proved relevant in the home environment. In the home environment, it is used for social media access. Currently, people can communicate and interact with others in the comfort of their homes. Another good use of social media is when it is used for business. ICT now enables people to order goods via e-commerce platforms, and these products are delivered to their home addresses. Similarly, people can also run their online businesses from their homes while paying their bills.Key Skills needed to use ICTThe main E-Mail management skills relevant to ICT include word processing, e-mail management, electronic media presentation, website design, database management, web navigation, spreadsheets, and camera usage skills.Three differences between a smartphone and a tabletThe first difference is that tablets have relatively larger screens than smartphones. Secondly, smartphones are more portable than tablets because of their smaller size, which makes them easier to carry. Thirdly, the tablet is designed to offer more entertainment perks. For instance, they have larger screens to provide better capabilities for watching movies and playing mobile games.Five ways to improve the format of word-processed academic reports/essaysThe first consideration is choosing the word processor that one is most comfortable using to ensure that the written content will be presented is of superior quality. The second thing is to clearly understand what to write after a session of brainstorming relevant ideas. All ideas should be presented formally, as it is a requirement in academic writing. Thirdly, it is imperative
to understand how to utilize the preferred word processor effectively to present work that follows all the instructions of academic writing, including good grammar, punctuation, font size, and line and paragraph spacing, among others. The fourth way to improve the format of word-processed academic reports is to use the correct vocabulary and to ensure all words are used correctly.There are useful features that are availed by word processors, such as the synonym option, which can help people to use numerous variations of words. The translate feature is also relevant to help users understand the proper meaning of words. The fifth way to improve the format of academic content on word processors is to use online tools to make requisite corrections on writing and ensure that all written content is grammatically correct.Three health problems caused by computers and how to avoid themOne of the prevalent health issues caused by computers is eye intricacies. Computers tend to emit light that tends to affect their users. Therefore, computer users should control the amount of light their computer screens emit to ensure it does not affect their optical health. Extended usage of computers has caused headaches among a significant number of computer users. The only way to prevent consistent headaches associated with computer usage is to limit the time people use computers. The third health problem caused by computer use is a pain in the back, shoulders, and neck. The remedy for this issue is for people to own proper furniture that will help to maintain the right posture when
working on their computers (Barnat, 2018).Characters that passwords should have to make them more secureOne of the fundamental things to be assertive about when creating passwords is to avoid predictable alphanumeric strings that people can easily guess. For example, some prevalent passwords are date of birth and digits like 1234 or 1111. Therefore, it is important to make sure that passwords have many characters as they tend to reduce the probability for malicious people to hack passwords and gain unauthorized access (Jančis, 2022). On that note, the optimal solution is combining uppercase letters with lowercase letters and using numbers and punctuation characters. For instance, a password such as “abyss” would be made more secure by adding extra characters to make it “The_Abyss001!”Someone in your class says they have forgotten their password to access their university account. Why should you not let them use your credentials?It would be irrational to give such individual personal credentials because computer systems are strategically designed with security systems that enable users to change their passwords if they forget them. Therefore, this should be the solution for people who lose their passwords as opposed to borrowing these credentials. Secondly, it is a common rule of thumb in cyber security to ensure access credentials are only limited to the account user. Shared accounts are perilous because it makes it difficult to know who the responsible party is when malicious people access the account.Four sectors of society where computers are highly usedOne of the sectors in that computers have proved most useful is the
Injury prevention is believed to be a strategy for avoiding or reducing the severity of bodily injuries caused by external factors such as collisions. Injury prevention is a part of safety and public health procedures, with the objective of improving population health by diminishing injuries and thereby enhancing the quality of life. Injury prevention tactics encompass a wide range of measures, several of which are categorized as components of injury prevention, including education, engineering improvements, and policy regulation and enactment. One of the dangerous types of general injuries that can have significant negative consequences on human health is falls. Under normal conditions, falls of varying severity are dangerous accidents that cause damage to physical health. However, the risks of complications and fatal outcomes increase in proportion to the age of the person. This occurs since older adults, in this case, aged from 65, due to numerous health chronic diseases, have weakened immunity and body resistance. In order to resolve the relevant problem of falls in older adults, it is necessary to create educational programs for training specialists and collaborative networks for improving the effectiveness of service provision.The health results of a set of people, including the dispersion of those consequences within the group, are referred to as population health. It is considered to be a method of health care that attempts to enhance the health of a significant number of individuals (Lantz, 2019). It is possible to state that population health is compiled of three separate parts, including health outcomes, variations of health protective factors, and
policies and treatments. The population health idea shifts the focus away from the individual paradigm, which is typical of much conventional medicine. Population health attempts to supplement traditional public health initiatives by addressing a larger variety of issues that have been found to affect the health of various groups.In this situation, it is impossible to deny the existence of danger from falls among the elderly, as well as to ignore their negative consequences since statistics demonstrate the relevance of the problem. Unintentional injuries are the sixth largest cause of mortality in the elderly, with falls accounting for the majority of these deaths (Burns & Kakara, 2018). Each year, approximately one in every four United States of America citizens over the age of 65, older people, falls, and fall-related emergency hospital appointments are reported to be over three million per year (Burns & Kakara, 2018). Therefore, it is feasible to emphasize the importance of discussing the issue of falls from the perspective of population health and governmental healthcare authorities since the effects are believed to be numerous.What concerns the state or city level, it is obligatory to depict the conditions and the statistical data in terms of the state of New Jersey. Utilizing the partially attributable proportion technique, the state of New Jersey has one of the highest projected all-payer medical cost for older adult falls (Haddad et al., 2019). Analyzing the reports from various American states, New Jersey is considered to be the state having the greatest number of older adult fall hospitalizations and subsequent complications,
losing exclusively to Florida and New York (Haddad et al., 2019). Consequently, it can be concluded that the city of New Jersey, as part of the state, is located in the risk group among the other American regions. Thus, compared to different parts of the country, people, especially older adults, possess increased chances of obtaining health-related issues due to the problem of falls. The statistics and cases from the state of New Jersey require additional examinations and decision-making procedures since the region depicts leading positions among the negative consequences of fall injuries.Evaluating the danger of falls and discussing the issue, it is essential to highlight the presence of mortality rates which illustrate the demographic situation and demonstrate the number of deadly accidents. Considering the state level of the issue, from 2007 to 2016, the total rate of older adult fatalities due to falls increased by 31% nationwide (Burns & Kakara, 2018). Referring to the average annual percentage change, a substantial increase in mortality rates from falls in older adults was determined in the state of New Jersey (Burns & Kakara, 2018). As reported in the statistical data researchers, the mortality rates, also concerning the state of New Jersey, remain high and underline certain risks for the age group. At the same time, it is important to note that in terms of trends, both national and state data sets depict negative development due to the increasing numbers of fatal falls among the elderly.Healthy People 2020 is a declaration of public healthcare objectives aimed at identifying the most
One of the most critical factors of breast cancer development is heredity since it causes a genetically inherent disease. If the patient’s closest relatives have been diagnosed with breast cancer, a tumor’s likelihood is high even at a young age (Coleman & Tsongalis, 2016). Since one of the patient’s close relatives had this disease, this diagnosis is indeed possible for her as well. Another significant factor in developing cancer is various diseases of the mammary glands, for example, “cystic” breasts. In the presence of such conditions, the formation of atypical cells is possible in the mammary gland (Tkaczuk et al., 2016). This can lead to their overgrowth and increase the risk of more severe diseases.The hormonal factor also has a critical influence on health. In the described case, this aspect is the most significant since it includes various details of the patient’s life. These include the first pregnancy after 30 years, not breastfeeding, and many years of taking hormonal contraceptives. This leads to the fact that the patient’s hormonal background can be disrupted (Tkaczuk et al., 2016). Therefore, with age, it becomes more difficult for the body to deal with abnormal processes.If there is an initial stage of cancer, there can be no metastasis in the patient’s organs. However, early active metastasis is characteristic of aggressive forms of cancer. There are multiple ways to determine them, and it is necessary to use some of them in any case to avoid future health problems. Histological analysis of tissue can determine the aggressiveness of the cancer type at an early stage. Breast cancer metastases detected by CT or scintigraphy indicate secondary foci in the lungs, liver, bones, and brain. It must be remembered that in breast cancer, metastases are capable of long-term existence in a latent state, even five to ten years after removal of the primary tumor.
process has increased drastically. A prime example of such an innovative healthcare model is the introduction of the perioperative surgical home (PSH) system. The model itself is introduced by the American Society of Anesthesiologists (ACA), and it stands for “patient-centric, team-based model of care created … to help meet the demands of a rapidly approaching health care paradigm that will emphasize value, patient satisfaction, and reduced costs” (Elhassan et al., 2019). Essentially, the model was outlined by the professional medical community as a means of reducing costs for operative interventions.According to the American Hospital Association (2019), the PSH model accounts for the process of close reconsideration of the patient’s pre-operational assessment, surgery preparation, and post-operational follow-up of the patient. The interdisciplinary team of professionals involved in the model includes surgeons, anesthesiologists, nurses, preoperative staff, pharmacists, information technology specialists, laboratory staff, and social services (Elhassan et al., 2019). Such an extensive collaboration of professionals accounts for quality patient outcomes for a number of reasons. These benefits include better pain management, a significantly lower risk of readmission, and a shorter length of stay (Bergman, 2019). On the other hand, such a model is beneficial for the providers, as timely and efficient collaboration accounts for saving treatment costs, providing better care, and securing more hospital beds due to reduced length of patient stay. For this reason, it may be concluded that the introduction of PSH is a promising approach to the renovation of health care and presenting more quality services to the community.
The Second World War (1939-1945) was a major economic disaster. However, the integration of countries and their desire to regain economic potential was strong. As a result, some countries like the USA, Japan, and Western Europe have managed to restore their economies, which significantly contributed to global economic development (Frieden, 2020). In this answer, the USA, Japan, England, and France will be discussed to revive their financial power.The USA is the only country whose economy emerged from the Second World War much stronger. Moreover, during the war years, the country’s national income doubled. After the war, the United States accounted for 60% of industrial production, two-thirds of the gold reserves, and one-third of the exports of the capitalist world (Frieden, 2020). Gross National Product (GNP) index The US has increased, while technological superiority, the highest labor productivity, and many profits have made it possible to finance new investments both at home and abroad.Other countries occupy a special place in the post-war foreign economic policy of the United States. In its relations with this region, the United States moved from patronage to a relationship of relative equality in the post-war period. In the first post-war decades, the leading position of the United States in the global capitalist economy was indisputable (Frieden, 2020). But the economic rise of Western Europe and the industrial breakthrough of Japan have significantly changed this situation.The new challenges facing the state were reflected in the program “New Frontiers” by J. Kennedy in the early 60s. A group of neoliberal economists developed the program.
It provided a consistent course to balance the supply of goods and services and aggregate demand to ensure continuous balanced economic growth. In January 1981, Reagan became President of the United States (Frieden, 2020). His monetary policy, dubbed “Reaganomics,” was a variant of the neoconservative policy in all developed capitalist countries throughout the 80s and 90s. At the end of the 80s, the US economy entered a period of a sharp slowdown in growth. American experts have no consensus on the decline in labor productivity growth and the lag in this indicator from Japan and Western European countries. The United States is inferior to Japan and almost all Western European countries regarding GNP per capita.After the end of the war, the Japanese economy was almost destroyed. Losses amounted to up to 20 percent of the country’s pre-war wealth. The government, however, took steps that allowed the economy to get back on track in a reasonably short time and even lay the foundation for a future Japanese miracle. Nevertheless, industrial and financial associations held significant economic and political resources in their hands. The GDP growth rate in the 50s reached 14.9%, the economy developed rapidly, and high growth rates were maintained due to a high rate of accumulation (Frieden, 2020). Hence, its GDP was better than ever before, and it was a salvation for the country.Immediately after the end of the war, agrarian reform was carried out, which eliminated large landholdings and gave impetus to developing capitalist relations in the Japanese hinterland. In addition, consumer demand has
resources.As a result, managers must thoroughly evaluate the firm’s strong and weak points in order to develop competencies that provide potential. Managers should have a comprehensive grasp of their own strengths and shortcomings in order to ensure they have the correct resources rather than just a vast amount of resources. Subsequently, if the given resources are deemed appropriate, they might be shaped into core competencies.A firm’s internal organization is its overall structure that is used to perform its core operations. The organization must be decided by the firm’s general strategy as well as the network infrastructure that must be established both internally and externally. By analyzing the internal organization, firms identify what they can do to improve the given circumstances or avoid failures. For example, they can identify unique resources that the firm possesses or the unique resources they can acquire. Moreover, the firms can develop their capabilities or intensify the already existing capabilities and profit from them greatly. Lastly, the strengthened capabilities can become the competencies of a firm that are required for a long-term competitive advantage.
The process of commercialization of media, such as radio and television, as well as national broadcasting in general, began with the template derived from the United States. It should be noted that American influence around the globe is massive when it comes to communications and media. Therefore, the emergent states’ eagerness to seek separateness needs to be supported, which is not being done at the moment.In Chapter 7, Schiller on how the international commercialization of broadcasting unfolded and impacted a wide range of international communities. For example, the author states, “in Western Europe, the most stable non-commercial broadcasting structures of sovereign states are unable to resist the forces that are arrayed against them” (Schiller 145). In other words, the force of such commercialization cannot be overlooked. For instance, Schiller also states that “the quest in the emergent nations for separateness is not, as some may believe, a reflection of immaturity” (Schiller 163). The primary reason is the fact that they need such isolation in order to achieve global solidarity, where global equalization is beneficial for everyone. Therefore, one can agree that the author describes a modern version of imperialism, where one powerful nation imposes its ideals, values, and interests on other ones. In the past, it was done by the brute force of superior military, but modern technology enabled a more intricate form of imperialism through media.In conclusion, the process of commercialization of international broadcasting began with America, and the latter was the prime beneficiary of such change.
Stock market volatility and the danger of nations experiencing economic spillovers are increasing as the global financial industry grows more internationally interconnected. However, the opening of trade with emerging nations signaled the start of a new era of low-cost manufacturing based on these countries’ low wages (Samiee, 2019). They also assisted small merchants in importing overseas food and retail items into local grocery shops, and she introduced numerous Asian and Latin American products to U.S. customers. The cheap costs of items available through chains such as Walmart, which imports the majority of its inventory, are driving down the earnings of smaller retailers seeking to compete, according to the owner of a small U.S. retail store (Samiee, 2019). At the same time, international discrepancies can stimulate local markets and producers. This is especially relevant in the domain of economic sanctions when local producers are emulating the items that are prohibited to import because of the sanctions. If local factories manage to grow a substantial level of production, they can expand, thus benefiting the local economy.Exotic items such as saffron, tamarind, and five spices are now available in our local supermarkets, owing to global trade. Due to market volatility, the internal political climate in the nation of origin, and the influence of sanctions policies, the availability and price of these items continue to fluctuate significantly (Samiee, 2019). Due to Iranian sanctions, the best saffron produced in the country is virtually inaccessible or excessively costly in the U.S. Natural calamities like floods and earthquakes may also impair goods supply chains like the earthquakes in Chile in 2010 and Japan in 2011, when numerous items were unavailable for months, had an impact on not just local markets but on worldwide trade.
SummaryType 2 diabetes mellitus is defined as one of the most dangerous chronic diseases in contemporary societies. It poses a significant challenge to manage for individuals, not because of a lack of treatment options but rather a population issue. Because families and patients typically accomplish managing diabetes, self-management is chosen as the best method to perform diabetes care. Nonetheless, a large number of individuals have a problem self-managing their care, necessitating new intervention measures to address the issue (Carpenter et al., 2019). Therefore, it is crucial to discern how interventions influence self-management actions for individuals with Type 2 diabetes. It is essential to consider that diabetes mellitus poses a problem for self-management because of the expenses involved in acquiring medication. These expenses pose a problem for the patient’s well-being as they have to work longer and experience illnesses such as fatigue, anxiety, and depression.Self-management is the practice of dynamically conducting self-care actions while intending to boost an individual’s well-being and behavior. It includes measures such as planned physical activity, taking diabetes medication, meal planning, managing illness episodes, monitoring blood glucose, and determining high or low blood glucose (Carpenter et al., 2019). Treatment plans involving self-management are continually advanced in tandem with the consultation of various healthcare professionals such as pharmacists, dieticians, nurses, and doctors.An individual should maintain a regulated glycemic control using the tenets of self-management to reduce the possibility of complications related to diabetes. Nonetheless, diabetic self-management and strict glycemic controls are distinct and could be confounded by concerns connected to treatment plan adherence (Carpenter
The primary principle which serves as the basis of crime scene investigation is undoubtedly the Locard’s Exchange Principle. According to the principle, whenever a person or rather a living subject enters or leaves any particular environment, something of physical form is either added or taken away from the scene. The principle is summarized by the statement “Every contact leaves a trace.” (Crime Scene Investigation, n.d) This principle enables crime investigators to link suspected persons to scenes of crime, victims, and to physical objects.Objects or materials in any form that could be relevant in crime are referred to as physical evidence. However, not all types of materials qualify as evidence but only objects or materials that could provide significant probative clues related to a crime such as associative evidence. Associative evidence refers to any physical evidence that links a suspect to the scene of a crime. According to Girard (2017) associative evidence serves two functions: it can either associate a person to a particular crime or rule them out as persons of interest in the crime. Although the main intention of associative evidence is to implicate suspects, it does the opposite; it mostly exonerates individuals from a suspicion that implicates them. Examples of associative evidence include “blood and other body fluids, fingerprints, hairs, bullets, firearms, and imprint evidence” (Girard, 2017). The aforementioned materials are assumed to be of unknown origin and are only ascertained after making a specialized analysis and comparison to a known sample that is often provided by the suspects, witnesses, or victims.The two types of associative evidence are identified as evidence with class characteristics and that with individual characteristics. When evidence is analyzed and put under a class, numerous sources remain linked to the crime. On the other hand, when material evidence is individualized, the possible source is only one (Girard, 2017). In summary; associative evidence is used to determine the perpetrators of crime.
In the modern world, despite the development of various technologies and medicine, people are still at risk of contracting many different dangerous diseases. One of these was salmonella, which is caused by a bacterium and can be quite dangerous for the population. The study of scientific literature on this topic is of particular value as it can help prevent the occurrence of cases of the disease. In this case study, two articles were analyzed for usefulness for further research.Typhoid fever becomes the most common ailment when faced with salmonella bacteria. However, at the moment, it has been replaced by other diseases, such as salmonella typhimurium and salmonella enteritidis. One of the characteristics of a dangerous cell is a high degree of stability and viable when treated with average temperatures. Moreover, the risk is also that multiplying on products, salmonella bacteria do not affect their appearance and taste in any way.Two articles “Multistate outbreak of salmonella infections linked to raw Turkey Products” and “Salmonella outbreak linked to onions” were chosen because they can become helpful resources for conducting scientific work on the study of salmonella cases in the Caribbean. This is due to the fact that in the last few years there has been an outbreak of diseases associated with the salmonella bacterium, which affects not only the population, but also tourists.The aspect that interested me was the consideration of the issue of the occurrence of pathogenic cells in a product such as onions. Moreover, this source briefly and clearly describes possible symptoms using words from a
In the rapidly changing world, the significance of investing is well-known. Such finance managements enable individuals to protect their assets from inflation and enable their further growth. With respect to the recent COVID-19 pandemic, the situation in the already volatile market became even less stable. For our group, it implies the necessity of the in-detailed investment analysis to facilitate further portfolio management and evaluate its past performance.S&P 500 ETF TRUST ETF (SPY) was added to it with the purpose of diversification to complement the portfolio. Thus, the further calculations consider daily returns from SPY from October 01, 2021, to November 30, 2021. This work will present an economic analysis of the portfolio beta, mean, and Sharpe ratio based on the performance of the stock during the specified period. The analysis of SPY will also be provided to complement understanding of the stock, discuss current values of its essential indicators, and evaluate its potential.Calculation of Key Economic IndicatorsDetermination of Portfolio BetaBefore processing to calculate portfolio beta, the overview of portfolio performance for the period taken for further analysis is due. It is possible to see in Figure 1 that there is a strong tendency for the stock (SPY) to grow. The axis Y shows the percentages indicating changes in the value of stock that occurred on a certain day. The axis X shows the exact date. The revealed pattern is similar to the one reflecting a change in prices of the stock for the period.Figure 1. Overview of Portfolio for the Period October-November.Portfolio beta or security beta
is a measure of volatility that is often referred to as systematic risk. Considering that the portfolio consists of only one stock, the change of a security’s price in percentage equals the change in the portfolio in percentage, and the mentioned two concepts are one and the same for this particular case. Beta is widely used for the determination of the relationship between systematic risk and expected return for assets.The portfolio beta was calculated using the provided Excel spreadsheet that takes into consideration stock prices and respective index levels for this security for the same period. A number of data periods equal 41, which is explained by the absence of information for price and index level for some days, which does not significantly affect the calculations. Split factor also was considered, but because SPY wasn’t split even once during the period, all the values equal 1, as shown in Table 1. The index level is the one for S&P 500 Index (roughly 10 times more than the SPY price, as they are correlated in a certain manner).Table 1.

In this case, only one security composes a portfolio (SPY), which means that there is no necessity to consider the weight of each comprising security. However, the portfolio mean can be determined only for the portion of the year (End of September-November) as the stock was held only for this period. It is known that on September 30, 2021, the portfolio was equal to 1000000, while on November 30, 2021, the portfolio was equal to 1011296.3. Following the formula: Mean return = (End of the period – Beginning of the period) / Beginning of the period; Mean return = (1011296.3 – 1000000) / 1000000 = 0.0112963 or toughly 1.13%. Therefore, the risk premium for stocks for the portfolio for the given period of time equals 1.13%.Determination of Sharpe RatioIt is possible to provide calculations of the Sharpe ratio for the portfolio to determine the value of the stock price based on current values of determinants. Those indicators are risk premium for stocks (portfolio mean return), risk-free rate during 2 months period (roughly 0,06%), current monthly risk-free rate (0,11%) based on the Daily Treasury Yield Curve Rates and standard deviation. Using
for investing. Such corporations as Microsoft, Apple, Amazon, Nvidia, Tesla, and others contribute to the value of the stock. The representation of SPY performance is presented in Figure 2 . The estimated yield equals 1.30% (which is close to the one calculated above), and the historical 52 week-range (the lowest and the heist price for the past year were $362.03 and $473.54, respectively.Figure 2. SPY Stock Performance for the Past 1 Year.10 years yield from this security equals 14.71%, and the growth is rather steady and slow than volatile and rapid, and it is shown in Figure 3.Figure 3. SPY Stock Performance for the Past 10 Years.SPY is spread across 11 sectors, ensuring that the stock does not depend on only one of them. 11 sectors are Information Technology, Health Care, Consumer Discretionary, Communication Services, Financials, Industrials, Consumer Staples, Utilities, Real Estate, Materials, and Energy.With respect to the outlined summary of SPY performance, it is possible to list several key points:  * SPY has shown steady growth for the past 2 years  * SPY volume is high and tends to rise over time  * SPY capitalization is over $40.3 trillion  * SPY consists of 500 companies and is spread across 11 sectorsIt is possible to conclude that despite the performance of the portfolio consisting of SPY shares being worse than it could have been, it is possible to recommend further long-term holding of the security. Its growth potential is high because the economy is reviving after the COVID-19 pandemic.
The expansion of cities and the creation of new jobs is a successful urbanistic development strategy, but such decisions require careful preparation in terms of the health function of the municipality. In particular, situations in which a city’s population grows significantly in a short period, while the number of beds in local hospitals remains unchanged, must be avoided not to stimulate the development of epidemics and regional quarantines. Consequently, hospital capacity must then be expanded, which raises questions about funding, sources of funding, and long-term goals. This essay attempts to answer these questions through a case study of the administrative team’s decision to expand the local hospital by an additional 150 beds while the city’s population grows.It is clear that one of the administrative team’s first questions is to determine the type of funding that should be resorted to for the purposes of the hospital organization. The primary difference between the two types of financing, debt and equity financing, is determined by the way the company takes money from. In debt financing, for example, the hospital obtains funds by borrowing money that will need to be paid back over time. In contrast, equity financing is provided by selling a portion of the company’s equity to private investors, who, in turn, receive a stake in the company (Maverick, 2021). It is clear that in this case, the company loses part of its business by selling it to an outside entrepreneur, which creates a burden in terms of making critical decisions. Thus, it is important to understand the
advantages and disadvantages of both types of financing in order not to make a critical mistake.Based on the above, debt financing is more relevant for a municipal hospital because budget capital is extremely sensitive to third-party financing. The hospital is an important strategic facility for the city, which means losing even partial control over key decisions if part of the management is transferred to an outside investor would be the wrong decision. In addition, a 150-bed expansion and additional expansion of acute care and intensive care would ultimately require a specific amount that would be easier to borrow than to calculate in terms of selling equity. Of course, the hospital would then have to make regular debt payments with interest on the terms of the loan, but this is not expected to be a particularly severe problem in the face of such a dramatic expansion of the city and the resulting increase in the client base. Once the type of financing has been chosen, it is necessary to determine the sources of funds that will provide the financing.Banks are the traditional providers of interest-bearing money, but it is essential to understand that they are not the only ones who can provide debt financing for a hospital. For example, bank loans do provide full use of the money during the reporting period. At that time, the hospital is indebted to the bank to pay a minimum repayment amount with interest, so the bank ends up with the upper hand for providing the hospital with the money to
expand. Private investors or sponsors who lend personal money to the hospital at interest can also use such a scheme. In addition, if the hospital is the only city hospital in the municipality, the state must provide grant funding upon request. However, if the hospital in question is of the for-profit type, an SBA loan from the U.S. government, which acts as an intermediary between lending partners and the hospital, covering risk and facilitating access to capital (SBA, 2021), can be obtained. It is this diversity of sources that should be used by the hospital’s administrative team to minimize risk.There are four fundamental principles of investment management practice that also help reduce possible risks. These concern not only how exactly to get money — in small portions from a number of sources — but also how to spend that money wisely afterward. The first goal is to allocate assets so that the hospital will not incur severe losses (IAG, n.d.) if one area is lost. For example, this can be accomplished through the use of multiple suppliers of clinical equipment instead of a single distributor. The second goal of investment management is to structure the economic context of the company so that in the event of any errors or mistakes, it is possible to address the source of that error. Structuring allows for consistency and adherence to the original plan, which is critical in financial management. The other goals of investment management, however, cannot be ignored, which are aimed at the long term.The third goal is
applies to repairs to equipment that has failed and needs to be replaced immediately. Cash reserves may also be needed for financial assistance to employees who have lost loved ones or compensation for anniversaries and holidays. Finally, it is not uncommon for a hospital to experience an economic crisis, and assets cannot be used to cover debt obligations, or any other costs associated with making the hospital functional. It is clear, however, that the administrative team cannot be fully assured of continued economic growth, which means that even after expansion, debt obligations may be required.Long-term credit commitments help a company have cash reserves and financial protection, as long as it has a well-thought-out financing strategy. In particular, if the amount of the monthly interest payment is not a severe burden on the hospital, this type of long-term financial relationship with creditors benefits the hospital. Private investors, sponsors, or governments continue to be such sources, but the situation is more difficult for banks, which are not inclined to lend for long periods at low-interest rates (Tuovila, 2020). Nevertheless, with proper investment management, the hospital receives a regular inflow of cash that can be spent and then returned to the issuer for further expansion.
Burke’s pentad presents a simple tool for analyzing dramatic situations that can be used to examine texts and other narratives. This framework describes such elements as act, agent, scene, agency, and purpose, as well as their relations. Burke’s pentad can be used to identify an actor’s motivation in a given dramatic scene. On the example of one of Jeff Wall’s photographs, it is illustrated how the motivation of an actor in this paradigm can be described in different ways in terms of the viewer’s focus.Kenneth Burke’s life stance is based on several leading points, and their analysis contributes to an awareness of the meaning of human behavior. He drew the most significant attention to language as the basis that leads to conscious action rather than involuntary movement. Rhetor holds that acts are related to the neurological aspect of human existence, defined as the body’s ability to master the sign system (Bonanno, 2018).Since the rhetorician models his description on the principle of drama, it consists of five elements: act, agent, scene, agency, and purpose (Hawhee & Poole, 2019). These are the basic parameters of rhetorical analysis and the foundation of the pentad, which examines human action from five interacting motivational perspectives. In this fivefold approach, the individual is an actor who acts purposefully through specific means, and he serves as the backdrop of a historical place of motion. Jensen (2018) explains that Burke was guided by the fact that every individual can influence his life by his actions, but possibilities always depend on five means. The pentad
Social networks have significantly changed the lives of all humanity. Nowadays, people can send a message that they have bought a new chandelier on WhatsApp, share a photo of it on Instagram, and do not forget to throw off a couple of memes on Facebook. Moreover, all this without seeing their interlocutors in real life. Social networks have many advantages, such as instant communication, the ability to contact people from anywhere in the world, showing their position on a particular issue with likes and comments (Rubin and Beuk 2). However, many do not even think that several negative factors exist behind the beautiful facade of accessible communication.Social media plays a huge role in many Americans lives day to day. Many use it to keep in touch with old friends and family that’s away, and some use it just to keep up with things that are going on in the world. It gives an insight on what is going on around the world, but in a way, people could only get if they are on social media. With Facebook being one of the most popular social media outlets where people can create profiles to interact with others, comes with problems behind it. Many people are faced with the harsh reality of criticism from users around the world, some of which they may not know.During the work of the services, tools that affect a person more than others were discovered — likes and a news feed. The article’s author defines these features of social networks as adversely affecting
users. The Like button allows users to show interest and belonging to a particular idea quickly. Nevertheless, at the same time, a universal metric is being introduced by which a person can judge the influence, the value of information within the platform, and about themselves (Rubin and Beuk 5). A button created as a simple equivalent of a minimal social action has become a digital currency.With the creation of likes, the value of the information and personality expressed can now be accurately measured. Thus, the metric of our life that has always been hidden from other people has become publicly available. A new level of frankness could not affect people’s minds; the number of insecurities, anxiety, depression, neuroses among people who could not integrate into the platform increased dramatically (Rubin and Beuk 7). Teenagers trying their best to fit into life receive feedback in the form of likes with which they judge their importance and value. At the same time, the understanding of a person as someone suffers because such complex views that require prolonged reflection are lost in rapidly changing, stimulating information. It is worth noting that “the lower response on social network may make a person feel more dejected and it may validate his/her poor self-esteem” (Srivastava 156). Thus, such information does not receive a proper response in social media and is interpreted as unclaimed, complex, and unnecessary by the end-user.Social networks have a powerfully negative effect on the subjective well-being of people, their state of self-satisfaction, and their own life. There is another
The article Is Globalization Reducing Poverty and Inequality by Robert Hunter Wade explores the phenomenon of globalization and its influence on the poverty and inequality ratios all over the world. The author discusses the data provided by the neoliberal economies on the decreasing poverty ratios of the past two decades. The globalization-related evidence confirms the neoliberal theory on the fact that the more liberal economies are more prosperous and develop faster than those who do not share the liberal values.However, despite the fact that poverty ratios have been decreasing during the past two decades, it is yet impossible to say whether its scale is decreased as well. It happens so due to the ratio’s previous growth that lasted for a long time. Hence, though the numbers have decreased, the issue still remains relevant as the poverty-related figures and statistics are rather unstable and may change unpredictably. In addition, the poverty numbers provided by the World’s Bank may be imprecise, so it is hard to establish the real state of things when it comes to the poverty ratio. As for the income inequality ratio, it is hard to say whether it increased or decreased because it is highly influenced by the Indian and Chinese ratios on income inequality. If these numbers are taken out from the formula, the numbers for the rest of the world change drastically. At the same time, income gaps in particular countries continue to grow as well, so it is hard to find out the real numbers of the income inequality for the
‘philanthropy’ (in other words, charity) is becoming increasingly popular (Sellen, 2019). Therefore, happiness can be perceived as a concept that plays a bigger role in an individual’s life.There are two important aspects that prove that happiness has a more defining role in a modern person’s well-being – the neglecting attitude towards wealth and the increasing popularity of philanthropy. Even though the conclusion that these two concepts are related and one impacts another seems obvious, various studies provide the researchers with the information that the situation seems more complex than it seems. First of all, although “wealth seems desirable at the individual level, its attractiveness seems to be less clear at a more global level” (Brule & Suter, 2019, p. 1). Secondly, philanthropy directly affects a wealthy person’s level of happiness; in other words, the ‘giving’ has been put over ‘receiving’ (Sellen, 2019). Thus, it can be said that in the modern era, an individual’s happiness has a tangible impact on an individual’s well-being.Modern society has shifted its outlook in favor of social equality and struggle against the unhealthy oppressing environment. Although wealth is still perceived as a desirable aspect, an individual’s virtue and, what is most importantly, well-being and happiness are valued much higher. As a result, the ethics’ shift towards the common good and total equality led to a prevalence of an individual’s mental state (e.g., happiness) over his welfare.
IntroductionFake news is information disseminated through traditional news outlets or online social media and consists of purposeful deception or hoaxes. Fake news has resurfaced and grown in popularity because of digital news. As a result, stories and opinions may spread at an unprecedented rate, allowing people all over the world to participate in a near-real-time debate about both serious and inconsequential topics.Fake News ExperienceIn early 2020, after the COVID-19 outbreak, there circulated news that the consumption of garlic would cure the illness. I found the recipe on Facebook, which recommended that one eats the garlic and drinks the water to witness improvement and healing overnight. I shared the news with friends as it claimed to have been proven effective by many patients and an old Chinese doctor. However, WHO knocked down the information on the stand that garlic had not been proven to protect individuals from COVID-19.Combating Fake NewsThe scourge of disinformation and fake news can be combated through media companies. Through algorithms and crowdsourcing, tech companies could invest in technologies to uncover fake information and identify it for users. In addition, algorithms can help social media businesses automatically detect fake news and hoaxes. Furthermore, Companies should reduce cash benefits for bad content, mainly false information and disinformation, because the fabrication of fake news is frequently motivated by financial gain.Moreover, educating the public about fake news could help combat it. The government should allocate money to facilitate partnerships between journalists, corporations, educational institutions, businesses, and nonprofit organizations in enhancing news literacy. Educating the public about the fact that not everything they read is accurate and that many digital sites specialize in spreading misleading information aids people in learning how to evaluate news sites and protect themselves against false information.Counteracting the fake news and disinformation scourge requires that everyone plays a role by promoting strong professional journalistic norms, encouraging investigative journalism, lowering financial incentives for fake news, and enhancing public digital literacy. These initiatives, when taken together, will promote quality conversation while weakening the environment and enhancing disinformation around the world.
use embarrassment as a disciplinary, the costs can be mainly damaging. Kids who have been embarrassed with their mothers may agonize from habitually low self-confidence and a mass of psychological health difficulties. Besides, embarrassment may also contribute to adverse mental effects and distressing consequences, irrespective of the sentence is reasonable or else not. Hence, it might also cause suicidal feelings to a person.In conclusion, communal embarrassment is neither ethically nor informally acceptable. Outstandingly, this is because it hurts one subject, cowardice, and a lasting act breaks the theme and occasionally the challenger. However, public shaming has developed the new usual in today’s society. The vital abilities of correct and incorrect are certainly no longer being established. Public embarrassment is no longer being utilized as a scholarship took. Instead, it has developed to the figure one resolution in discharging anger and negativity through the sphere.
The energy industry is among the sectors that are performing effectively. However, it is not immune to challenges that threaten its existence. The increasing demand for sustainable energy is one of the issues affecting the sector (Sovacool, 2019). In addition, consumers in the market are creating pressure on the industry to adopt environmentally friendly energy sources. Apart from this, the energy sector is facing the issue of price volatility. The prices of energy products constantly change, which affects their performance. Although there exist issues that affect the energy industry’s performance, there are solutions that they can use to solve the problems.Price volatility is one of the most significant concerns in the energy industry. Because of price fluctuations, forecasting oil prices has been a big concern in this industry (Sovacool, 2019). Over the last five years, the situation has deteriorated even further. The fluctuation is caused by several factors influencing supply and demand. On the supply side, the sector has transitioned from models that rely on large-scale developments to short-term investments. On the side of demand, aspects such as the deceleration of economic growth in emerging economies and the gradual substitution of oil. Another demand factor is the increase in more effective and economically friendly buildings and public transportation.A solution to the above challenge is to promote well-regulated but broadened hedging through financial markets. The demand for oil-consuming and producing corporations to transfer price risk to those willing to bear it will increase (Sovacool, 2019). Based on this, it is important to implement reasonable changes and enforce
solving the issue of climate change.The third issue that enterprises in the energy industry face are increased uncertainty, hindering conventional and deep-sea oil and gas projects (Sovacool, 2019). These challenges originate from the supply-side consequences of tight oil and shale gas production and variables affecting demand for oil and gas in major importing countries. In addition, the rise of economic protectionism, increasing antagonism to the continued reliance on hydrocarbons for energy, the rapid decline in the price of renewable energy, and the shift toward electric vehicles are among the challenges (Sovacool, 2019). As a result, it has become extremely difficult to forecast future energy demand and considerably more difficult for hydrocarbon-derived energy.One of the possible solutions to uncertainty is to encourage the use of distributed energy resources. These resources are small energy generation and storage technologies that provide electric capacity where it is needed (Sovacool, 2019). Increasing the use of these resources creates a more decentralized energy system and changes the conventional way of an energy transmission system. In addition, it creates a need to understand the effect of the transmission distribution system interface. For example, waste heat can be captured and used to meet increasing energy demands in buildings (Sovacool, 2019). Therefore, distributing energy resources is integral in solving the issue of uncertainty in the use of energy.
Formative AssessmentBackgroundThe rail industry in the U.K. has a long history and established system for changing the national rail timetable every six months, in May and December every year, with the changes varying in scale. Normally, the changes are minor and do not affect rail operations. In addition, when they are executed according to plans, passengers are unaffected and they get the benefit of accessing additional services (“British Parliament Report,” 2018). Timetable changes are important for the rail industry because they help in delivering extra capacity to meet customers’ demands. The changes also enable train companies to improve their revenue returns. However, the May 2018 changes were unprecedented in terms of the investment size and its implementation complexity. It had effects on very many sections of the British national railway network and was four times the scale of a normal six-monthly timetable change. This led to an array of issues leading to poor operational performance and as a consequence, industry, users, and wider stakeholder dissatisfaction. The following factors were the causes of the poor performance of the Thameslink route as a result of the new timetable in May 2018. 1. Poor Planning for the changes 2. Delayed Infrastructure upgrade 3. The incompetence of Network Rail department 4. Lack of trained drivers 5. Timbale was drawn late 6. Lack of coordination 7. Poor communication of the changes to passengersLinkages between Causes of Poor PerformancesPrior to changes in the timetable in May 2018, there was engineering work of upgrading the rail network in the United Kingdom. This was
meant to greatly improve the services, but it failed to a large extent. Immediately after the new Thameslink timetable was introduced, the huge scale of cancellations, delays, confusion, and misinformation that graced the new timetable was a big shock to the commuters and the public. Firstly, the rebuilding of the London Bridge station, adding modern signaling and buying new trains and Tube-style frequency delays did not go as were planned (Topham, 2018). Fundamentally, Govia Thameslink Railway (GTR) did not have enough drivers, which affected the implementation of their plans (Topham, 2018). Despite claims by GTR that they employed more than enough drivers to run the expanded services the May timetable was due to provide, that was not the case (Topham, 2018). They lacked drivers who were trained on the exact model of trains that were introduced and the full route they were to operate.Clearly, this pointed to shoddy planning done by GTR. Further, normally changing the timetable takes 16 months before its implementation but planning and execution of the May 2018 timetable changes took place in a matter of weeks. The lack of proper planning on the side of GTR was compounded by so many issues to do with strikes by its guards and drivers, which caused commuter despair for months. Other interrelated problems, on track and trains, were also well documented by GTR, and there was a warning for them to implement phased timetable changes. However, approval for this new plan came four months late from the Network Rail, putting pressure on planners (Topham, 2018).
Additionally, GTR’s planning team, clipped of numerous experienced staff, requested many changes months later. The net effect was poor communication with passengers on timings, cancellations, and rescheduling of routes. There was poor coordination and a lack of clarity on responsibilities among GTR, the department of Transport, and Network Rail (“Office of Rail and Road,” 2018). The industry structure as it was arranged then, did not support clarity in decision-making.Lessons LearntThe scale of work at hand and the complexity of changes in timetables were unprecedented. This placed a timetabling team together with passenger and freight operators who were under intense pressure to deliver. Under the circumstances, the teams tried to complete the work without options to mitigate the tasks later. There was a lack of coordination and cooperation among stakeholders, which affected decision-making (“Office of Rail and Road,” 2018). GTR’s initial planning and training of drivers was inadequate in relation to the scale of the changes to the timetable. Further, GTR failed to conduct test runs for their plans before implementing the changes (“Office of Rail and Road,” 2018). Lastly, there was no sufficient contingency in place to address any challenges during the implementation of the changes. In the future, stakeholders must plan properly taking into consideration the scale of the work they intend to roll out. The plans should be drawn and piloted before actual implementation is carried out to detect and address weaknesses. All the stakeholders involved in the rail timetable changes should in the future have a well-coordinated approach with clarity on responsibilities for
teams.Summative AssessmentBackgroundSouth Western Railway’s (SWR) franchise that commenced in August ’17 included two major timetable change commitments to increased service frequencies, earlier and later trains, and extended formations. In the changes, a refurbished Class 442 EMU fleet will be introduced, enabling additional long-distance peak trains to operate and lengthening the existing services. In addition, there will be improved long-distance journey times enabled by reduced dwells, amended calling patterns, and portion working with trains splitting en-route. These proposed changes also include the introduction of newly manufactured suburban area Class 701 EMU trains using accelerated timings. Further, there will be a new method of working like train despatch providing reduced dwells; and increased passenger capacity with many 8-car suburban trains replaced by 10 car Class 701s.These changes were proposed after witnessing a sustained period of poor performance on the intensively operated and highly infrastructure-constrained Wessex Route. There was also an assessment done on the capability of the network being undertaken by Network Rail. The report of that evaluation concluded that significant elements of these two timetable change packages could not be undertaken due to constraints within the railway system. South Western Railways (SWR) appointed a joint Train Operating Company/Infrastructure team to identify and assess the issues which are liable to block the implementation of these timetable changes. The team will then determine the optimum industry way forward for submission to the Department of Transport for approval. The task will include assessing mechanisms for evaluating risks, the parties to be involved, the interventions for issues identified, costs, limitations, dated
program of activities, deliverables, and benefits of an optimum business case.The existing Rail Network operationSeveral factors combined are making it difficult to implement the timetable changes. There is the increase in the number of passengers, the poor management of train crew, the operation of longer trains, increasing numbers of speed restrictions, and aging infrastructure are some of the issues which pose challenges to the introduction of the new changes. This assessment report will analyze and each issue, the parties required to offer solutions, and how best they can be solved.The Obsolete Timetable StructureThe existing timetable structure which SWR is using was updated last in May 2004. The number of trains running has been static since 2004 to date. Further, the public performance measure (PPM) of the trains has been on the decline and by the 2017/18 financial year, it declined to 84.3%, s drop of 9.1% since the 2010/11 financial year (Holden et al., 2018). Service groups in which SWR operates had dropped in performance by 7% for the best performance and by 15% for the worst performance in the financial year 2017/18 (Holden et al., 2018). It means the proposed timetable changes could most likely fail to have trains can run their entire planned journey, calling at all scheduled stations and arriving at their terminating station on time.Right Time Arrival (RTA) breakdownThere has been a huge decrease in TRA performance at the franchise level from April 2011 to 2017. This goes further to give more evidence of why the new major timetable changes in the
South Western route can perform at the optimum level (Holden et al., 2018). Over the years, the fall in performance has been due to low-level delays like time loss in the running. The effect of this is the fact that many trains interact have been interacting with each other in the past, and more trains suffer delays which could generate congestion in peak periods and reactionary delay enough to bring down the trains’ PPM.Incident Count (Incidents causing attributable delay)The incident count is a measure of the input of service-impacting on events that result in poor performance. It is, therefore, a useful measure of the underlying asset and system performance and reliability. A well-maintained, efficient, and effectively operated railway should see incident count gradually improving over time. This should be the case because of the application of continuous improvement techniques designed to eliminate repeat failures. At a bare minimum, the incident count should remain relatively static. The current state of the incident cannot support the proposed two major timetable changes by SWR, it will most likely account for the main delay if the systems are not upgraded. Along with the incident, the count is the Delay per Incident (DPI) which assesses the relative impact of every causation group in the train service at a high level. The available data points to static DPI from 2009/10 to 2015/16 (Holden et al., 2018). Pointing to what ails or has been a contributing factor to the decline in SWR performance will clearly derail the new changes.Misalignment of incentivesThe railway network
is a very complex system, and so all the elements should work together effectively and efficiently for the delivery of good results in terms of operability. Even though the organizational structure of the railway industry is split between train operations and infrastructure provision, both should align their incentives together to deliver the desired services (Holden et al., 2018). Unfortunately, this is not the case for the South Western route; the Network Rail’s (NR) objectives are set and controlled by ORR, whereas SWR is set through its franchise agreement. The two objectives do not dovetail completely, especially in the performance area and the targets RN have set for its strategic business plan and those of SWR through its financial agreement are different. This has created a serious misalignment of functions and operations between them which affects the delivery of rail services.Performance management processThe performance process which SWR inherited that is supposed to work for the franchise and jointly with NR has weaknesses. Further, both teams are not applying it effectively as of now, which has created room for poor or insufficient information to be passed to top managers and directors by the junior staff. In addition, there are no links between the Performance Delivery Group (PGD) level and the Right Time Running Hubs (RTH), which are the places where performance analysis and reviews are conducted (Holden et al., 2018). RTH is very ineffective and is not capable of making even small changes meant to improve performance. Given the variability in performance levels by PGD and RTH, it
is not conducive to introducing major changes in the timetable. Basically, most of the performance data prepared for top managers and directors is backward and out of date.Core resilience of the timetableThe decline in core time resilience of the timetable is one of the reasons why the proposed changes will not perform optimally. This has been a big issue for the franchise since 2011, way before WST took over the management of the route (Holden et al., 2018). This Wessex railway network is big and complex, so the factors critical for its functions must be integrated for it to work efficiently. The timetable must be constructed with great care, especially on junction margins, reoccupation times, terminal turnaround times, dwell and running times, and that every train can run accurately in its allocated path. Right Time Arrivals (RTA) have been showing for some time now the existence of problems with timetable resilience (Holden et al., 2018). A combination of factors has contributed to reduced timetable resilience which in turn affects the PPM performance. For example, trains running a couple of minutes late due to minor hitches are affected by a bigger attributed delay that pushes them over the five minutes late threshold and hence becomes a PPM failure.Increasing passenger loadings over timePassenger numbers have increased steadily over the last ten years. This has put dwell times under pressure, more so in the suburban areas and at key interchange stations such as Wimbledon, Clapham Junction, and Vauxhall. It makes the implementation of the two major timetable changes difficult
(Holden et al., 2018). Proper mechanisms of expansion of the operations in terms of the station, increasing carrying capacity and improving train dispatch routes to improve passenger access and egress.Lack of Properly Enough Trained DriversThe current WSR professional driving policy was introduced in 2012. It came along with a philosophy of progressive increase in the impact of defensive driving behavior to reduce the risk of SPADs, and TPWS interventions. Through this, drivers are trained not to exceed the intervention speed when passing over any Train Protection and Warning System (TPWS) (Holden et al., 2018). Drivers are also advised during training not to exceed 10mph over the TPWS positioned along with the platforms when approaching buffer stops. These mechanisms are meant to reduce the risks of operational safety. They are part of drivers’ mandatory training and are also reinforced on drivers’ six months of off-track briefing days, and biennial assessments (Holden et al., 2018). Over the years, the number of drivers in the system who are properly trained and with the right experience before this policy was introduced has reduced. However, the exact proportion of drivers who follow the right method of driving has increased. While the impact on trains of this policy could be small, its collective impact could be big enough to cause time in the schedule to be lost.Operational complexity of train crew diagramsThe complexity of train crew diagrams leads to a lack of resourcing resilience and heavy dependence on a free day of working. There is a considerable variation between the required extent
of the route and traction knowledge to be compliant with the base diagrams and the actual position. This gap would require about 1400 days for the crew to be up to date with the route (Holden et al., 2018). If not solved, it could put pressure on the day-to-day diagramming and rostering activities needed to post drivers on the daily timetable. This could be a huge source of operational failure when major timetable changes are implemented. Fundamentally, in cases of disruptions, much more effort would be required in place to keep track of the resources in these circumstances. The implementation of a consistent service recovery plan during and after would be impossible.Outdated Contingency PlanA contingency plan is very crucial for the control of train movements, and the plans in place now have not been updated since 2011. This could lead to sub-optimal decisions when responding to incidents (“Office of Rail and Road,” 2018). For instance, Raynes Park is being used to terminate trains despite the fact that it is narrower and this could lead to overcrowding when new major timetable changes are introduced. This must be reviewed in the context of the intended changes in the operations. For SWR to introduce the two major changes in the timetable, the contingency plan must be enhanced.Intervention for the issuesNR should urgently review its attribution policies, including those linked with small minutes and unexplained delays. This will enable quick investigation and fixing of problems when they arise. On their part, SWR must undertake timetable performance simulations 2 at least
two months prior to the commencement of the new timetable changes. This will create room for validation of the timetable and help them identify and learn any vital information which can be useful in the implementation of the new changes. SWR must introduce the provision of CCTV monitors to help guards with the task of dispatching trains.Both SWR and NR must, as a matter of urgency, review their combined capability and capacity for performance analysis and management and further strengthen it before introducing new changes. To help the two align their operations and functions, the Department of Transport (DfT) must create a better alignment of performance incentives between SWR and NR (“South Western Railway,” 2018). This two being under the direct control of DfT should have their operational objectives aligned so they can deliver excellent services to the passengers. SWR should, as a priority, amend the professional driving policy for its drivers to understand the need to draw up appropriately. They must also recruit more drivers who understand the routes and are up to date with the intended changes to avoid disruptions.NR must urgently increase the permanent speed restriction on the Main Suburban lines into and out of the station; and into and out of platforms 20 to 24, from 15mph to 20mph. They should order a new and switch rail to reduce the risk of one infrastructure failure in Waterloo (“South Western Railway,” 2018). NR and SWR should carry out minor enhancements of the infrastructure as part of business-as-usual processes in the South Western route.
In the long term, NR, SWR, and DfT must cooperate to produce longer no-trains periods to facilitate improved infrastructure maintenance access.Identifying the Optimum Business SolutionThe new changes were meant to maximize the use of huge investments to improve the capacity of the South-Western Rail system. SWR should incorporate the expertise and experience of MTR, which run the busy Hong Kong metro, to deliver excellent rail transport on this network (“Department of Transport,” 2017). This will be delivered through a consistent fleet without disruptions and delays and provide more space for passengers. SWR must also deliver new car spaces, refurbished waiting rooms, and more seats for the increasing number of passengers. Further, the SWR franchise must introduce a new delay repay connection, along with delays for 15 minutes or more. The communication within NR and SWR teams must improve so that passengers can make informed decisions about their travel arrangements (“Department of Transport,” 2017). The information must be real-time on screens, trains, stations, websites, and other applications. Station staff must be updated all the time through the use of smart devices to help passengers, mostly during disruptions. In addition, SWR must make available information about seating availability and crowd levels for passengers to know the best places to board trains.Objectives of Developing the Optimum Business CaseThe changes to the timetable are aimed more successfully in eliminating the delays and disruptions and giving reliable services to the passengers. It is also expected that the proposed changes will ease the overcrowding of passengers at the stations (“BBC,” 2019). These
changes will enable SWR to offer more peak services in and out of London. Changes will also come with more choices for passengers, speed up their journeys and offer increased travel frequencies. SWR and NR envision a situation where rail network performance in the southwestern route will improve (“BBC,” 2019). Thereby giving passengers value for money and satisfaction. The overall objective for the SWR franchise is the maximum revenue the new changes will generate due to increased passenger traffic on the southwestern network.Costs of Developing the Optimum Business CaseThe cost to develop the optimum business cost will involve the procurement of a new fleet of trains to meet the very growing number of passengers. The Network Rail will also need to install new signals, expand waiting rooms, install new communication gadgets, and expenses for updating the entire timetable structure. SWR franchise has among the busiest routes, operating almost 1700 services per week. There are over 230 million passengers traveling to and from London Waterloo each year (“South Western Railway,” n.d.). This network route should be upgraded to increase capacity, services, and facilities. It should take about £800 million investment to create 30% increase in space for passengers during peak hours each day (“South Western Railway,” n.d.). The work should be completed in the shortest time possible but not later than December 2018 to allow for the introduction of the timetable changes after every six months easily.Limitations of Developing the Optimum Business CaseThe investments which SWR and DfT through NR in infrastructure and specific and intensive; if
this does not translate to big passenger traffic, then it will be a waste. Timetable changes cannot cure the inflexibility of train routes and timings to adjust to individual passenger needs. Even with sophistication in timetable changes, SWR will still not be able to solve the fact that trains are uneconomical for small distances and have small traffic of goods. Further, major timetable changes in the South Western route will not cure delays attributed and contributed to by natural occurrences like bad weather.The benefit of Developing Optimum Business CaseThis route is one of the busiest as it facilitates commuter, inter-urban, regional, and long-distance services in South West London and southern counties of England. It also provides linkages to the ports and airports in the United Kingdom. Its upgrading will facilitate the transportation of tourists across the region to many tourists and heritage sites (“South Western Railway,” n.d.). It will also increase access to many sporting and social events which occur along the route. Further, so many business ventures rely on this route to facilitate the movement of people’s goods and services. An efficient and excellent network with less or no disruption will generate more revenue for the British government, franchise operators, and individual private businesses. Furthermore, effective and efficient movement of passengers, goods, and services without delays will save time which is a key factor of production.Introduction of the Class 701 Train FleetSouth Western Railway (SWR) will introduce its brand new Class 701 suburban EMUs after the issues hindering the implementation of major timetable changes are
addressed in 4 months’ time. This Bombardier-built fleet will carry passengers ‘along the arteries of the suburban network to its beating heart, London Waterloo’. SWR has ordered 60×10-car and 30×5-car of class 701 and it is planning for the whole fleet to be delivered within a period of12 months (“Modern Railways,” 2020). Initially, SWR will focus on introducing 10 – car units, followed by the delivery of the majority of five-car sets later (“Modern Railways,” 2020). However, a good number of them will arrive earlier for multiple working and coupling/uncoupling training.Infrastructure Function-Related ActivitiesSWR and conjunction with DfT through NR, will have to overhaul the South Western route into the digital age before the introduction of the class 701 EMU trains. These trains are very complex because they have several new features which come with the integration of new signaling technology as well. Class 701 EMU comes with the benefits of onboard Wi-Fi, at-seat charging points, real-time information screens, air-conditioning, and wide gangways. Firstly, NR will need to construct more parking spaces at all stations along the route (Mellors, 2017). There is need also to construct about 60 electric car charging points along at stations along the route.NR and SWR will need to increase and stabilize the electricity supply along the South Western route to boost internet connectivity. This will be key in supporting real-time onscreen information to passengers and faster, more flexible, and more convenient online communication (Mellors, 2017). SWR should also overhaul its ticketing system to go digital before the new class 701 EMU is
Health care reform passage is a significant aspect of the political work of states’ governors because their decisions build the voters’ trust and influence the population’s prosperity. New Jersey’s Governor Phil Murphy established programs for local clinics and enhanced the efficiency of the Affordable Care Act (ACA) use for expanding the access to medical services for diverse categories of citizens (Phil Murphy, n. d.). Programs such as allowing the clinics to get the Accountable Care Organization status help the state’s facilities to accelerate the quality of treatment; however, many of the novelties are unaffordable for the population.My experience as an AGNP revealed that many patients suffer from severe and chronic conditions that could be prevented if they could pay for advanced health care on time. Improving the affordability of services through reforms is essential in New Jersey, and Murphy’s attention to addressing the issue would significantly impact the state’s health-related rates (Terrizi et al., 2021). One such legislative update is the state-based health exchange for the year 2021, announced by the governor in 2019 to protect the ACA’s power in insurance operations (State of New Jersey, 2020). Murphy’s campaigns addressed the demand for expanding the affordability of health care services by optimizing the industry’s taxpayers’ expenses. This paper aims to summarize and analyze the interview with New Jersey governor about the State-Based Health Exchange reform under the ACA.Health policy issues must be addressed from the organization’s and government’s perspectives, and the ACA’s update for the State-Based Health Exchange is the regulation to which Murphy paid significant
attention. The industries are being funded both publicly and privately, and although it allows the organizations to improve their services, it severely impacts treatment costs. Furthermore, New Jersey’s governor pointed out that private insurance providers develop fraud schemes that make basic healthcare expensive for the average citizen. The number of such cases increased during Trump’s administration as the ACA regulations received less support from the national Department of Health and Human Services (State of New Jersey, 2020). The threat of insurance-based fraud in the health care services providence enabled Murphy to eliminate the issue by establishing the state-based health exchange regulation. The reform redirected the assessment of premiums to localize the exchange rather than maintain it federally facilitated, making the funds more efficient for the residents (Managed Care Executive Staff, 2021). The governor also mentioned that the reform’s beneficiaries were mainly the Medicaid program participants.Affordability of health care is a significant challenge for most American states because of the diverse populations’ socioeconomic statuses and financial options. New Jersey’s citizens’ survey conducted in 2020 revealed that “more than three-fourths (77%) adults reported being “worried” or “very worried” about affording some aspect of healthcare in the future” (Altarum, 2020). The ACA was developed and passed by Barack Obama to increase access to medical services, and the state’s governor’s mission was to help the regulations consolidate. Consequently, passing the state-based health exchange regulation became an evidence-based solution supported by the local administration (Managed Care Executive Staff, 2021). Murphy had to discuss the issues of changing the fees’ exchange with
the federal facilities; however, the governor received positive feedback because the health care industry’s problems are of high priority (Phil Murphy, n. d.). The policy update was passed in 2019, and now it helps New Jersey address the COVID-19 pandemic, which became a massive burden on the state’s health care institutions.Establishing the State-Based Health Exchange results in additional autonomy in decision-making related to expenses for insurance coverage, making it affordable for more New Jersey residents. Murphy explained that when the state was involved in the federally-facilitated programs, the individualized health insurance market was unstable, and the bureaucratic procedures made it complicated to timely address the issues (State of New Jersey, 2020). Indeed, the federal-based health exchange programs provide the states with fewer options to operate within their insurance opportunities and make costs inappropriate for the residents of specific populations. Furthermore, Terrizi et al. (2021) claim that “states with state-based marketplaces have seen higher Medicaid enrollment when compared to states relying on the federal marketplace.” Murphy’s opinion regarding the need for the state-based health exchange in New Jersey proved itself once the COVID-19 pandemic began and forced the administration to fund the health care sector.Conversation with the governor included a discussion of the outcomes and trade-offs associated with the health care reforms passed during Murphy’s administration. Murphy noted that more than 250 thousand New Jersey residents enrolled to receive the insurance since the reform’s policies passage, making health care affordable for a broader scope of the population statewide (State of New Jersey, 2020). The administration’s trade-offs for
Jazz musicians were not only talented people who presented humanity with a rich cultural heritage. For musicians, the blues has become an opportunity for self-expression, a way to convey their problems and thoughts through music. For some, it also helped to express their identity, their real inner world. Moreover, like many in those days, jazz musicians faced difficulties related to gender and race issues. In some cases, the musical life was accompanied by global life changes: a person lived a life that was not one’s own, being a different personality. The purpose of this work is to reflect on the topic of another identity, namely, what would be one’s own another persona.In times of the development of the blues, there was a problem related to the sexual issue. A talented woman who wanted to connect her life with a musical career could not do it as a woman. In those times, only a man had the possibility to build a professional jazz career. Thus, there were cases when women lived the life of a man for these purposes, and this secret was revealed only after death. Thus, Joss Moody, the main character of Jackie Kay’s Trumpet, anatomically born female, lives his entire life as a man (Amideo, 2018). The book is interesting in the context of reflections on identity, gender, and race. Moreover, the writer expressed these questions against the backdrop of musical art, using an unusual narrative. In this regard, it would be interesting to reflect on the topic of another identity in the context
of one’s own life.However, the book is not as straightforward as it might seem at first glance. In fact, this is a reflection on many things in life, such as family and loved persons, private and public life, fame, and its consequences. Every public person has two worlds, one that is visible to everyone, for the press and fans, and the other is a private personal one. Sometimes these two worlds differ dramatically: a person can seem happy and careless, but in fact, be desolate. For creative people, especially jazz musicians, the differences can be even more dramatic since music usually contributes to better self-expression.Talking about what one’s other personality could be, it will be based on the life experiences. Now, I am a student, and I spend a lot of time studying. However, I used to play sports and could probably build a career related to sports. Thus, the other person might be a famous athlete, aged 30, in the twilight of his career. Usually, I give myself entirely to the activity that I like and spend a lot of energy on becoming a professional in the chosen field. However, at the moment, my life is related to studies, and my goal is to get an education.Thereby, based on my passion for sports, my another personality could be a famous sportsman. The life associated with sports involves many challenges and difficulties, including competitions, motivation, injuries, and the end of a career. Being a 30-year-old athlete, namely a professional football player, the career is followed by
The article Jihad vs. McWorld, written by Benjamin R. Barber, explores the two possible political models that may emerge in the future. Both of them are non-democratic but promote slightly different values and approaches towards the distribution of power among the countries. They are called the McWorld model and the Jihad model. They may exist separately in different societies and, at the same time, coexist in one country.McWorld is empowered by the four imperatives: a market imperative, a resource imperative, an information-technology imperative, and an ecological imperative. These four constituents of the system will enable the countries to create a universal rational society but in a homogenized, depoliticized, commercialized, and bureaucratized manner. The Jihad model regards war not as a political instrument but as an emblem of identity and a way to express the community’s will. Though both systems have natural politics, each of them appears to have traits that are typical of antipolitics. McWorld prioritizes laissez-faire market principles as a guiding force for society. The Jihad model, however, appears to vote for the dictatorship, military government, or theocratic fundamentalism. Both models deny democracy and do not consider its guiding principles and forces appealing or beneficial for society.That is why neither of these two systems is beneficial for the democratic world of today, but there are slightly noticeable tendencies towards the transition to these models in some countries. However, if the democratic powers still have the opportunities to prevent such a dark future for the whole system and the world in general. It is possible because
