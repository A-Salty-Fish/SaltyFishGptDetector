Italso allows for finer-grained comparison of GEC systems, in terms of precisionin general, and error type-specific figures for recall and precision.Unfortunately, the description of the system remains highly superficial. Thecore of the system consists of a set of (manually?) created rules but the paperdoes not provide any details about these rules. The authors should, e.g., showsome examples of such rules,", "specify the number of rules, tell us how complexthey are, how they are ordered (could some early rule block the application ofa later rule?), etc. -- Instead of presenting relevant details of the system,several pages of the paper are devoted to an evaluation of the systems thatparticipated in CoNLL-2014. Table 6 (which takes one entire page) list resultsfor all systems, and the text repeats many facts and figures that can be readoff the table. The evaluation of the proposed system is not satisfying in several aspects. First, the annotators should have independently annotated a gold standard forthe 200 test sentences instead of simply rating the output of the system. Givena fixed set of tags, it should be possible to produce a gold standard for therather small set of", "test sentences. It is highly probable that the approachtaken in the paper yields considerably better ratings for the annotations thancomparison with a real gold standard (see, e.g., Marcus et al. (1993) for acomparison of agreement when reviewing pre-annotated data vs. annotating fromscratch). Second, it is said that \"all 5 raters individually considered at least 95% ofour rule-based error types to be either \u201cGood\u201d or \u201cAcceptable\u201d\".Multiple rates should not be considered individually and their ratings averagedthis way, this is not common practice. If each of the \"bad\" scores wereassigned to different edits (we don't learn about their distribution from thepaper), 18.5% of the edits were considered \"bad\" by some annotator -- thissounds much worse than the average 3.7%, as calculated in the paper.Third, no information about the test data", "is provided, e.g. how many errorcategories they contain, or which error categories are covered (according tothe cateogories rated as \"good\" by the annotators).Forth, what does it mean that \"edit boundaries might be unusual\"? A moreprecise description plus examples are at need here. Could this be problematicfor the application of the system?The authors state that their system is less domain dependent as compared tosystems that need training data. I'm not sure that this is true. E.g., Isuppose that Hunspell's vocabulary probably doesn't cover all domains in thesame detail, and manually-created rules can be domain-dependent as well -- andare completely language dependent, a clear drawback as compared to machinelearning approaches. Moreover, the test data used here (FCE-test, CoNLL-2014)are from one domain only: student essays.It remains unclear why a new set", "tagset? Then the CoNLL gold standard could have been used forevaluation.To sum up, the main motivation of the paper remains somewhat unclear. Is itabout a new system?

Two words canof course be composed and produce a vector that is a) far away from both; b)does not correspond to any other concept in the space; c) still has meaning(productivity wouldn't exist otherwise!) Compositionality in linguistic termssimply refers to the process of combining linguistic constituents to producehigher-level constructs. It does not assume any further constraint, apart fromsome vague (and debatable) notion of semantic transparency. The paper'simplication (l254) that composition takes place over sets is also wrong:ordering matters hugely (e.g. 'sugar cane' is not 'cane sugar'). This is awell-known shortcoming of additive composition. Another important aspect is that there are pragmatic factors that make humansprefer certain phrases to single words in particular contexts (and theopposite), naturally changing the underlying distribution of words in a largecorpus.", "For instance, talking of a 'male royalty' rather than a 'king' or'prince' usually has implications with regard to the intent of the speaker(here, perhaps highlighting a gender difference).

The part about Sufficient Dimensionality Reduction seems a little disconnectedfrom the previous argument as it stands. I'm afraid I wasn't able to", "fullyfollow the argument, and I would be grateful for some clarification in theauthors' response. If I understand it well, the argument is that skip-gramproduces a model where a word's neighbours follow some exponentialparametrisation of a categorical distribution, but it is unclear whether thisactually reflects the distribution of the corpus (as opposed to what happensin, say, a pure count-based model). The fact that skip-gram performs welldespite not reflecting the data is that it implements some form of SDR, whichdoes not need to make any assumption about the underlying form of the data.

As it stands, such models tend to suffer from lack ofdiversity, specificity and local coherence in the kinds of response they tendto produce when trained over large dialogue datasets containing many topics(e.g. Cornell, Opensubtitles, Ubuntu, etc.). Rather than attempting to producediverse responses using the decoder, e.g. through word-by-word beam search(which has been shown not to work very well, even lose crucial informationabout grammar and valid sequences), or via a different objective function (suchas in Li et. al.\u2019s", "work) the authors introduce a latent variable, z, overwhich a probability distribution is induced as part of the network. Atprediction time, after encoding utterances 1 to k, a context z is sampled, andthe decoder is greedily used to generate a response from this. The evaluationshows small improvements in BLEU scores over a vanilla seq2seq model that doesnot involve learning a probability distribution over contexts and sampling fromthis.The paper is certainly impressive from a technical point of view, i.e. in theapplication of deep learning methods, specifically conditioned variational autoencoders, to the problem of response generation, and its attendant difficultiesin training such models.

The authors seem not fully aware of the long history of this field, and itsvarious facets, whether from a theoretical perspective, or from an applied one.1. \u201c[the dialogue manager] typically takes a new utterance and the dialoguecontext as input, and generates discourse level decisions.\u201d         This is not accurate. Traditionally at least, the job of the dialoguemanager is to select actions (dialogue acts) in a particular dialogue context.The                    action chosen is then passed to a separate generationmoduleforrealisation. Dialogue management is usually done in the", "context of task-basedsystems which are goal driven. The dialogue manager is to choose actions whichare optimal in some sense, e.g. reach a goal (e.g. book a restaurant) in as fewsteps as possible. See publications from Lemon & Pietquin, 2012, Rieser, Keizerand colleagues, and various publications from Steve Young, Milica Gasic andcolleagues for an overview of the large literature on Reinforcement Learningand MDP models for task-based dialogue systems.2. The authors need to make a clear distinction between task-based,goal-oriented dialogue, and chatbots/social bots, the latter being usually nomore than a language model, albeit a sophisticated one (though see Wen et. al.2016). What is required from these two types of system is usually distinct.Whereas the former is required to complete a task, the latter is, perhaps onlyrequired to keep the user", "engaged. Indeed the data-driven methods that havebeen used to build such systems are usually very different. 3. The authors refer to \u2018open-domain\u2019 conversation. I would suggest thatthere is no such thing as open-domain conversation - conversation is always inthe context of some activity and for doing/achieving something specific in theworld. And it is this overarching goal, the overarching activity, thisoverarching genre, which determines the outward shape of dialogues anddetermines what sorts of dialogue structure are coherent. Coherence itself isactivity/context-specific. Indeed a human is not capable of open-domaindialogue: if they are faced with a conversational topic or genre that they havenever participated in, they would embarrass themselves with utterances thatwould look incoherent and out of place to others already familiar with it.(think of a random person on the street", "trying to follow the conversations atsome coffee break at ACL). This is the fundamental problem I see with systemsthat attempt to use data from an EXTREMELY DIVERSE, open-ended set ofconversational genres (e.g. movie subtitles) in order to train one model,mushing everything together so that what emerges at the other end is just verygood grammatical structure. Or very generic responses. Comments on the model architecture:Rather than generate from a single encoded context, the authors induce adistribution over possible contexts, sample from this, and generate greedilywith the decoder. It seems to me that this general model is counter intuitive,and goes against evidence from the Linguistic/Psycholinguistic literature ondialogue: this literature shows that people tend to resolve potential problemsin understanding and acceptance very locally - i.e. make sure they agree onwhat the", "context of the conversation is - and only then move on with the restof the conversation, so that at any given point, there is little uncertaintyabout the current context of the conversation. The massive diversity one seesresults from the diversity in what the conversation is actually trying toachieve (see above), diversity in topics and contexts etc, so that in a given,fixed context, there is a multitude of possible next actions, all coherent, butleading the conversation down a different path.It therefore seems strange to me at least to shift the burden of explainingdiversity and coherence in follow-up actions to that of thelinguistic/verbal/surface contexts in which they are uttered, though of course,uncertainty here can also arise as a result of mismatches in vocabulary,grammars, concepts, people\u2019s backgrounds etc. But this probably", "wouldn\u2019texplain much of the variation in follow-up response. In fact, at least as far as task-based Dialogue systems are concerned, thechallenge is to capture synonymy of contexts, i.e. dialogues that are distincton the surface, but lead to the same or similar context, either in virtue ofinteractional and syntactic equivalence relations, or synonymy relations thatmight hold in a particular domain between words or sequences of words (e.g.\u201cwhat is your destination?\u201d = \u201cwhere would you like to go?\u201d in a flightbooking domain). See e.g. Bordes & Weston, 2016; and Kalatzis, Eshghi & Lemon,2016 - the latter use a grammar to cluster semantically similar dialogues.Comments on the evaluation:The authors seek to show that their model can generate more coherent, and morediverse responses.

From your description ofthe post-analysis of coherence, only pairs of stories written by the sameperson in which one was judged as \"coherent\" and the other one as \"neutral\" arechosen.

The authors combine the following in their complexmodel:                          (1) a set of traditional classifiers for detectingeventmentions,factuality sources, and source introducing predicates (SIPs), (2) Abidirectional attention-based LSTM model that learns latent representations forelements", "on different dependency paths used as input, (2) A CNN that usesrepresentations from the LSTM and performs two output predictions (one todetect specific from underspecified cases and another to predict the actualfactuality class). From the methodological point of view, the authors are combining a reasonablyfamiliar methods (att-BiLSTM and CNN) into a fairly complex model. However,this model does not take raw text (sequence of word embeddings) as input, butrather hand-crafted features (e.g., different dependency paths combiningfactuality concepts, e.g., sources, SIPs, and clues). The usage of hand-craftedfeatures is somewhat surprising if coupled with complex deep model.

Finally, the results are not too convincing -- considering thecomplexity", "of the model and the amount of preprocessing required (extraction ofevent mentions, SIPs, and clues), a 2% macro-average gain over the rule-basedbaseline and overall 44% performance seems modest, at best (looking atMicro-average, the proposed model doesn't outperform simple MaxEnt classifier).The paper is generally well-written and fairly easy to understand. Altogether,I find this paper to be informative to an extent, but in it's current form nota great read for a top-tier conference.   Remarks:1. You keep mentioning that the LSTM and CNN in your model are combined\"properly\" -- what does that actually mean? How does this \"properness\"manifest? What would be the improper way to combine the models?2.

You first motivate the usage of your complex DL architecture with learninglatent representations and avoiding manual design and feature computation.  Andthen you define a set of manually designed features (several dependency pathsand lexical features) as input for the model. Do you notice the discrepancy? 4. The LSTMs (bidirectional, and also with attention) have by now alreadybecome a standard model for various NLP tasks.

What, then, do we learn aboutthe usefulness of the other views? There is one empirical example of how thedifferent views help in clustering paraphrases of the word 'slip', but there isno further analysis", "about how the different clustering techniques differ,except on the task directly.

In reality, OmegaWiki is distinguished from theother two resources by using a formal structure (a relational database) basedon word senses rather than orthographic forms.              Translations,", "synonyms,andother semantic annotations in OmegaWiki are therefore unambiguous.The second, and more serious, misunderstanding comes in the three paragraphsbeginning on lines 092, 108, and 120.  Here the paper claims that both BabelNetand UBY \"rely on English WordNet as a pivot for mapping of existing resources\"and criticizes this mapping as being \"error-prone\".  Though it is true thatBabelNet uses WordNet as a pivot, UBY does not.  UBY is basically ageneral-purpose specification for the representation of lexical-semanticresources and of links between them.  It exists independently of any givenlexical-semantic resource (including WordNet) and of any given alignmentbetween resources (including ones based on \"similarity of dictionarydefinitions\" or \"cross-lingual links\").  Its maintainers have made availablevarious databases adhering to the UBY spec; these contain a variety oflexical-semantic resources which have been", "aligned with a variety of differentmethods.  A given UBY database can be *queried* for synsets, but UBY itselfdoes not *generate* those synsets.  Users are free to produce their owndatabases by importing whatever lexical-semantic resources and alignmentsthereof are best suited to their purposes.  The three criticisms of UBY onlines 120 to 125 are therefore entirely misplaced.In fact, I think at least one of the criticisms is not appropriate even withrespect to BabelNet.  The authors claim that Watset may be superior to BabelNetbecause BabelNet's mapping and use of machine translation are error-prone.  Theimplication here is that Watset's method is error-free, or at leastsignificantly less error-prone.  This is a very grandiose claim that I do notbelieve is supported by what the authors ought to have", "known in advance abouttheir similarity-based sense linking algorithms and graph clusteringalgorithms, let alone by the results of their study.  I think this criticismought to be moderated.              Also, I think the third criticism (BabelNet'srelianceon WordNet as a pivot) somewhat misses the point -- surely the most importantissue to highlight isn't the fact that the pivot is English, but rather thatits synsets are already manually sense-annotated.I think the last paragraph of \u00a71 and the first two paragraphs of \u00a72 should beextensively revised. They should focus on the *general* problem of generatingsynsets by sense-level alignment/translation of LSRs (see Gurevych et al., 2016for a survey), rather than particularly on BabelNet (which uses certainparticular methods) and UBY (which doesn't", "use any particular methods, but canaggregate the results of existing ones).  It may be helpful to point outsomewhere that although alignment/translation methods *can* be used to producesynsets or to enrich existing ones, that's not always an explicit goal of theprocess.  Sometimes it's just a serendipitous (if noisy) side-effect ofaligning/translating resources with differing granularities.Finally, at several points in the paper (lines 153, 433), the \"synsets\" of TWSIof JoBimText are criticized for including too many words that are hypernyms,co-hypnomyms, etc. instead of synonyms.  But is this problem really unique toTWSI and JoBimText?  That is, how often do hypernyms, co-hypernyms, etc. appearin the output of Watset?  (We can get only a very vague idea of this fromcomparing Tables 3 and 5, which analyze only synonym relations.)", " If Watsetreally is better at filtering out words with other semantic relations, then itwould be nice to see some quantitative evidence of this.Some further relatively minor points that should nonetheless be fixed:* Lines 047 to 049: The sentence about Kiselev et al.

Why bother mentioning their analysis if you're not going to tell uswhat they found?* Line 091: It took me a long time to figure out how \"wat\" has any relation to\"discover the correct word sense\".

I agree with the comment wrt cross-modal mapping. What I don'tshare is the kind of equation \"visual = referential\" that you seem to assume. Areferent can be visually presented, but visual information can be usefullyadded to a word's representation in aggregate form to encode perceptual aspectsof the words' meaning, the same way that it is done for textual information;for instance, the fact that bananas are yellowwill not frequently be mentioned in text, and adding visual informationextracted from images will account for this aspect of the semanticrepresentation of the word. This is kind of technical and specific to how webuild distributional models, but it's also relevant if you think of humancognition (probably our representation for \"banana\"", "has some aggregateinformation about all the bananas we've seen --and touched, tasted, etc.). It would be useful if you could discuss this issue explicitly, differentiatingbetween multi-modal distributional semantics in general and the use ofcross-modal mapping in particular.Also, wrt the \"all models perform similarly\" comment: I reallyurge you, if the paper is accepted, to state it in this form, even if itdoesn't completely align with your hypotheses/goals (you have enough resultsthat do). It is a better description of the results, and more useful for thecommunity, than clinging to then-th digit difference (and this is to a large extent independent of whether thedifferenceis actually statistical significant or not: If one bridge has 49% chances ofcollapsing and another one 50%, the difference may be statisticallysignificant, but that doesn't really make the", "first bridge a better bridge towalk on).Btw, small quibble, could you find a kind of more compact and to the pointtitle? (More geared towards either generally what you explore or to what youfind?)----------The paper tackles an extremely interesting issue, that the authors label\"referential word meaning\", namely, the connection between a word's meaning andthe referents (objects in the external world) it is applied to. If I understoodit correctly, they argue thatthis is different from a typical word meaning representation as obtained e.g.with distributionalmethods, because one thing is the abstract \"lexical meaning\" of a word and theother which label is appropriate for a given referent with specific properties(in a specific context, although context is something they explicitly leaveaside in this paper). This hypothesis has been previously explored in work bySchlangen", "and colleagues (cited in the paper). The paper explores referentialword meaning empirically on a specific version of the task of ReferentialExpression Generation (REG), namely, generating the appropriate noun for agiven visually represented object.- Strengths:1) The problem they tackle I find extremely interesting; as they argue, REG isa problem that had previously been addressed mainly using symbolic methods,that did not easily allow for an exploration of how speakers choose the namesof the objects. The scope of the research goes beyond REG as such, as itaddresses the link between semantic representations and reference more broadly.2) I also like how they use current techniques and datasets (cross-modalmapping and word classifiers, the ReferIt dataset containing large amounts ofimages with human-generated referring expressions) to address the problem athand. 3) There are a substantial", "number of experiments as well as analysis into theresults. - Weaknesses:1) The main weakness for me is the statement of the specific hypothesis, withinthe general research line, that the paper is probing: I found it veryconfusing.  As a result, it is also hard to make sense of the kind of feedbackthat the results give to the initial hypothesis, especially because there are alot of them and they don't all point in the same direction.The paper says:\"This paper pursues the hypothesis that an accuratemodel of referential word meaning does notneed to fully integrate visual and lexical knowledge(e.g. as expressed in a distributional vectorspace), but at the same time, has to go beyondtreating words as independent labels.\"The first part of the hypothesis I don't understand: What is it to", "fullyintegrate (or not to fully integrate) visual and lexical knowledge? Is the goalsimply to show that using generic distributional representation yields worseresults than using specific, word-adapted classifiers trained on the dataset?If so, then the authors should explicitly discuss the bounds of what they areshowing: Specifically, word classifiers must be trained on the dataset itselfand only word classifiers with a sufficient amount of items in the dataset canbe obtained, whereas word vectors are available for many other words and areobtained from an independent source (even if the cross-modal mapping itself istrained on the dataset); moreover, they use the simplest Ridge Regression,instead of the best method from Lazaridou et al. 2014, so any conclusion as towhich method is better should be taken with a grain of salt. However, I'mhoping that", "the research goal is both more constructive and broader. Pleaseclarify. 2) The paper uses three previously developed methods on a previously availabledataset. The problem itself has been defined before (in Schlangen et al.). Inthis sense, the originality of the paper is not high. 3) As the paper itself also points out, the authors select a very limitedsubset of the ReferIt dataset, with quite a small vocabulary (159 words). I'mnot even sure why they limited it this way (see detailed comments below).4) Some aspects could have been clearer (see detailed comments).5) The paper contains many empirical results and analyses, and it makes aconcerted effort to put them together; but I still found it difficult to getthe whole picture: What is it exactly that the experiments in the paper tell", "usabout the underlying research question in general, and the specific hypothesistested in particular?

It can't just be the temporalconstraint mentioned on page 3!* I don't understand the comments regarding the example on line 256. Theauthors seem to be saying that they regard the sentence as false. If it's true,then there should be some causal link between the argument and the breakage.There are remaining issues about how to divide events into sub-events, andthese impact causal theories, but those are not being discussed here, leavingme confused.* The caption for Figure 1 is misleading, since the diagram is supposed todepict", "only the \"Pair_LSTM\" variant of the model.

However, in this case, the actual task itself is quite motivating to meand rather than the authors fishing for a new domain to run things in, itreally does feel like \"hey, wait, these standard systems perform poorly in asetting that's actually pretty important.\"THE TASK: Main concept resolution is an intriguing task from an IE perspective. I can imagine many times where documents revolve primarily around a particularentity (biographical documents, dossiers or briefings about a person or event,clinical records, etc.) and where the information we care about extracting isspecific to that entity. The standard coreference task has always had the issueof large numbers of", "mentions that would seemingly be pretty irrelevant for mostIE problems (like generic mentions), and this task is unquestionably composedof mentions that actually do matter.From a methodology standpoint, the notion of a \"main concept\" provides a bit ofa discourse anchor that is useful for coreference, but there appears to stillbe substantial overhead to improve beyond the baselines, particularly onnon-pronominal mentions. Doing coreference directly on Wikipedia also opens thedoors for more interesting use of knowledge, which the authors illustrate here.So I think this domain is likely to be an interesting testbed for ideas whichwould improve coreference overall, but which in the general setting would bemore difficult to get robust improvements with and which would be dwarfed bythe amount of work dealing with other aspects of the problem.Moreover, unlike past work", "which has carved off a slice of coreference (e.g.the Winograd schema work), this paper makes a big impact on the metrics of the*overall* coreference problem on a domain (Wikipedia) that many in the ACLcommunity are pretty interested in.THE TECHNIQUES: Overall, the techniques are not the strong point of this paper,though they do seem to be effective.

The authors formulate few-shot learning as a sequential meta-learning problem: each \"example\" includes a sequence of batches of \"training\" pairs, followed by a final \"test\" batch. The inputs at each \"step\" include the outputs of a \"base learner\" (e.g., training loss and gradients), as well as the base learner's current state (parameters).

It is also somewhat related to the two-stream networks of Simonyan & Zisserman, which are very effective for real-world action recognition.+ The qualitative results are numerous, insightful, and very convincing (including quantitatively)", "on KTH & Weizmann, showing the benefits of decoupling content and motion for simple scenes with periodic motions, as well as the need for residual connections.3) Suggestions for improvementStatic dataset bias:In response to the pre-review concerns about the observed static nature of the qualitative results, the authors added a simple baseline consisting in copying the pixels of the last observed frame. On the one hand, the updated experiments on KTH confirm the good results of the method in these conditions. On the other hand, the fact that this baseline is better than all other methods (not just the authors's) on UCF101 casts some doubts on whether reporting average statistics on UCF101 is insightful enough. Although the authors provide some qualitative analysis pertaining to the quantity of motion, further", "quantitative analysis seems necessary to validate the performance of this and other methods on future frame prediction. At least, the results on UCF101 should be disambiguated with respect to the type of scene, for instance by measuring the overall quantity of motion (e.g., l2 norm of time differences) and reporting PSNR and SSIM per quartile / decile. Ideally, other realistic datasets than UCF101 should be considered in complement. For instance, the Hollywood 2 dataset of Marszalek et al would be a good candidate, as it focuses on movies and often contains complex actor, camera, and background motions that would make the \"pixel-copying\" baseline very poor. Experiments on video datasets beyond actions, like the KITTI tracking benchmark, would also greatly improve the paper.Additional recognition experiments:As mentioned in pre-review questions,"], "model": "cohere", "source": "PeerRead/iclr_2017/", "source_ID": "357"}

I agree with the authors thatthese results provide additional useful insight into the performance of themodel in the 2016 paper (henceforth W16).WEAKNESSES: This is essentially an appendix to the earlier paper. There is nonew machine learning content.

In particular, no comparisons arepresented to the to the experiments with a static exploration", "policy presentedin W16, when the two training can & should be evaluated side-by-side.The only meaningful changes between this work and W16 involve simple(and already well-studied) changes to the form of this exploration policy.My primary concern remains about novelty: the extra data introduced here iswelcome enough, but probably belongs in a *ACL short paper or a technicalreport. This work does not stand on its own, and an ICLR submission is not anappropriate vehicle for presenting it.\"REINFORCEMENT LEARNING\"[Update: concerns in this section have been addressed by the authors.]This paper attempts to make a hard distinction between the reinforcementlearning condition considered here and the (\"non-RL\") condition considered inW16.

As already noted in Weston 2016, the RBI objective", "is a special case of vanillapolicy gradient with a zero baseline and off-policy samples. In this sense theversion of RBI considered in this paper is the same as in W16, but with adifferent exploration policy; REINFORCE is the same objective with a nontrivialbaseline. Similarly, the change in FP is only a change to the sampling policy.The fixed dataset / online learning distinction is not especially meaningfulwhen the fixed dataset consists of endless synthetic data.It should be noted that some variants of the exploration policy in W16 provide astronger training signal than is available in the RL \"from scratch\" settinghere: in particular, when $\\pi_acc = 0.5$ the training samples will feature muchdenser reward. However, if I correctly understand Figures 3 and 4 in this paper,the completely random initial policy", "achieves an average reward of ~0.3 on bAbIand ~0.1 on movies---as good or better than the other exploration policies inW16!I think this paper would be a lot clearer if the delta from W16 were expresseddirectly in terms of their different exploration policies, rather than trying tocast all of the previous work as \"not RL\" when it can be straightforwardlyaccommodated in the RL framework.I was quite confused by the fact that no direct comparisons are made to thetraining conditions in the earlier work.

ALI is trained on multiple datasets, and it seems to have a good reconstruction even though it does not have an explicit reconstruction term in the cost function.

There is also the infoGAN approach (not cited) which trains the inference network at the same time with the generative path. I think this paper should have an extensive comparison with these other methods and have a discussion for why ALI's inference network is superior to previous works.Since ALI's inference network is stochastic, it would be great if different reconstructions of a same image is included.

Unfortunately, the ATP and HOL aspect of this work is not my area of expertise. I can't comment on the quality of this aspect.It would be great to see future work scale up the baselines and integrate the networks into state of the art ATPs. The capacity of deep learning methods to scale and take advantage of larger datasets means there's a possibility of an iterative approach to improving ATPs: as the ATPs get stronger they may generate more data in the form of new theorems. This may be a long way off, but the possibility is exciting."], "model": "cohere", "source": "PeerRead/iclr_2017/", "source_ID": "494"}

In that case you should compare with alternative strategies, e.g. model compression (Caruana et al 2006, aka Dark Knowledge, Hinton et al 2014) or hashed networks (Chen et al 2015). For RNN, you seem to target better perplexity/BLEU and model compactness is not a priority. Instead of making the weights have a simpler structure, you make them richer, i.e. dependent over time. It seems in that case models might be bigger and take longer to train.

Second, GAM relies on the scores given by the discriminators, which can be ill-posed (focus on artifacts). Since there is There is nothing wrong with mode collapsing when this happens under control.

A small experiment with sampling is interesting, but does not change the overall focus of the paper. This inconsistency in not acceptable.

To clarify, the authors train encoder-decoders as generative models (VAE or VAE-GAN), but then remove all stochasticity (sampling) and prior on the latent variables: that is, they treat the models as deterministic encoders-decoders.

I find the experiments a bit unconvincing (see below) but appreciate the attention to model capacity (via number of parameter) when comparing the 2D and 3D model variants.I am concerned that the evaluation may be insufficient to assess the effectiveness of this method. An IoU threshold of 0.1", "allows for many rather poor detections to count as true positives. If the goal of this work is to count the number of such instances this is defensible, but for localization this seems overly loose.Furthermore, the 3D CNN architecture (which is one of the the core novelties of this work compared to past efforts) does not seem capable of producing variable sized boxes (as noted in the last paragraph of page 7), which I imagine results in poorer performance at higher IoU thresholds (as many of the weather events appear small). The experiments also feel inconclusive about the effect of temporal modeling and semi-supervision. The temporal component does not seem to matter in the supervised settings (2D 51.45 mAP - 3D 51.00 mAP) but improves somewhat in the", "semi-supervised case (2D 51.11 mAP - 3D 52.92 mAP). Whereas the additional unlabeled data seems to hurt in the 2D case but improve results for the 3D model. Could the authors provide confidence intervals for these numbers? I would like to see further discussion of these trends especially with respect to the effect of the loss weights (alpha, beta, and gamma). I also note that it is not clear if both the 2D and 3D models were trained for equivalent time periods (seems like no from last paragraph of page 7). Could a plot of training and validation accuracy for each model be presented for comparison? Finally, is there any baseline approach the authors could report or compare too? Without one, it is difficult to evaluate the performance"], "model": "cohere", "source": "PeerRead/iclr_2017/", "source_ID": "588"}

This is a nice result to know about--yet another example of a really nice result that one can get the first time one applies such methods to an old task--and all of the work that went into getting it looks solid (and likely involved some significant engineering effort).

The paper should be revised to discuss the prior work on this task (even though much of it used data that is not public).

The CNN evaluated in this paperperforms perfectly at the task and the paper's goal is to inspect how theCNN works.The fundamental mechanism for this inspection is Class ActivationMapping (CAM) (Zhou et. al. 2016), which identifies regions of implicit attentionin the CNN. These implicit attention maps (localization heat maps) are used toderive actions (which square each player should move). The attention maps  (1) attend to squares in the tic-tac-toe board rather than arbitraryblobs,", "despite the fact that one square in a board has uniform color, and(2) they can be used to pick correct (winning) actions.This experiment are used to support assertions that the network understands(1) chess (tic-tac-toe) boards(2) a rule for winning tic-tac-toe(3) that there are two players.Some follow up experiments indicate similar results under various renderingsof the tic-tac-toe boards and an incomplete training regime.More Clarifying Questions===* I am not quite sure precisely how CAM is implemented here. In the original CAMone must identify a class of interest to visualize (e.g., cat or dog). I don'tthink this paper identifies such a choice. How is one of the 18 possible classeschosen for creating the CAM visualization and through that visualizationchoosing an action?* How was the test set for this dataset for the", "table 1 results created?How many of the final 1029 states were used for test and was thedistribution of labels the same in train and test?* How is RCO computed? Is rank correlation or Pearson correlation used?If Pearson correlation is used then it may be good to consider rank correlation,as argued in \"Human Attention in Visual Question Answering: Do Humans andDeep Networks Look at the Same Regions?\" by Das et. al. in EMNLP 2016.In table 1, what does the 10^3 next to RCO mean?Pros===* The proposed method, deriving an action to take from the result of avisualization technique, is very novel.* This paper provides an experiment that clearly shows a CNN relying on contextto make accurate predictions.* The use of a toy tic-tac-toe domain to study attention in CNNs(implicit", "or otherwise) is a potentially fruitful setting that maylead to better understanding of implicit and maybe explicit attention mechanisms.Cons===* This work distinguishes between predictions about \"what will happen\"(will the white player win?) and \"what to do\" (where should the whiteplayer move to win?). The central idea is generalization from \"what will happen\"to \"what to do\" indicates concept learning (sec. 2.1). Why should an ability toact be any more indicative of a learned concept than an ability to predictfuture states. I see a further issue with the presentation of this approach anda potential correctness problem:1. (correctness)In the specific setting proposed I see no difference between \"what to do\"and \"what will happen.\"Suppose one created labels dictating \"what to do\" for each example in theproposed dataset. How would these differ from", "the labels of \"what will happen\"in the proposed dataset? In this case \"what will happen\" labels includeboth player identity (who wins) and board position (which position they moveto win). Wouldn't the \"what to do\" labels need to indicate board position?They could also chosen to indicate player identity, which would make themidentical to the \"what will happen\" labels (both 18-way softmaxes).2. (presentation)I think this distinction would usually be handled by the Reinforcement Learningframework, but the proposed method is not presented in that framework orrelated to an RL based approach. In RL \"what will happen\" is the reward anagent will receive for making a particular action and \"what to do\" is theaction an agent should take. From this point of view, generalization from\"what will happen\" to \"what to do\" is", "not a novel thing to study.Alternate models include:    * A deep Q network (Mnih. et. al. 2015) could predict the value of      every possible action where an action is a (player, board position) tuple.    * The argmax of the current model's softmax could be used as an action      prediction.The deep Q network approach need not be implemented, but differences betweenmethods should be explained because of the uniqueness of the proposed approach.* Comparison to work that uses visualization to investigate deep RL networksis missing.

COMMENTS- The paper is a bit long (especially the appendix) and seems to have been written a bit in a rush. Overall the main points are presented clearly, but the results and conclusions could be clearer about the assumptions / experimental vs theoretical nature. The connection to previous works could also be clearer. - On page 2 one finds the statement ``Furthermore, architectures are often compared via \u2018hardcoded\u2019 weight values -- a specific function that can be represented efficiently by one architecture is shown to only be inefficiently approximated by another.'' This is partially true, but it neglects important parts of the discussion conducted in the cited papers. In particular, the paper", "[Montufar, Pascanu, Cho, Bengio 2014] discusses not one hard coded function, but classes of functions with a given number of linear regions. That paper shows that deep networks generically* produce functions with at least a given number of linear regions, while shallow networks never do. * Generically meaning that, after fixing the number of parameters, any function represented by the network, for parameter values form an open, positive -measure, neighbourhood, belongs to the class of functions which have at least a certain number of linear regions. In particular, such statements can be directly interpreted in terms of networks with random weights. - One of the measures for expressivity discussed in the present paper is the number of Dichotomies. In statistical learning theory, this notion is used to define", "the VC-dimension. In that context, a high value is associated with a high statistical complexity, meaning that picking a good hypothesis requires more data. - On page 2 one finds the statement ``We discover and prove the underlying reason for this \u2013 all three measures are directly proportional to a fourth quantity, trajectory length.'' The expected trajectory length increasing exponentially with depth can be interpreted as the increase (or decrease) in the scale by a composition of the form a*...*a x, which scales the inputs by a^d. Such a scaling by itself certainly is not an underlying cause for an increase in the number of dichotomies or activation patterns or transitions. Here it seems that at least the assumptions on the considered types of trajectories also play an", "the bias is comparatively too large... then we no longer see exponential growth.''OTHER SPECIFIC COMMENTS In Theorem 1 - Here it would be good to be more specific about ``random neural network'', i.e., fixed connectivity structure with random weights, and also about the kind of one-dimensional trajectory, i.e., finite in length, closed, differentiable almost everywhere, etc. - The notation ``g \\geq O(f)'' used in the theorem reads literally as |g| \\geq \\leq k |f| for some k>0, for large enough arguments. It could also be read as g being not smaller than some function that is bounded above by f, which holds for instance whenever g\\geq 0.

The paper describes the implementation of these three collectives (broadcast, reduce, and allreduce) using a linear pipelining (LP) scheme on a (logical) ring topology.  The paper compares the LP", "collectives to two alternatives:  collectives based on a minimal spanning tree (MST) topology and collectives based on bidirectional exchange (BE).  First, a theoretical comparison is made using a standard cost model used in the high performance computing community.  When assumptions based on multi-GPU system architecture (very low latency for messages) and on the communication characteristics of synchronous SGD training (very large messages) are integrated into the model, the paper finds that the LP collectives should be less costly than BE collectives by a factor of 2 and less costly than MST collectives by a factor of log(p), where p is the number of GPUs being used.  Second, an empirical comparison is performed in which (1) the time required to perform each of the different", "collectives on a 4-device (k40m) system is measured as a function of message size and (2) the time required to perform each of the different collectives with a 200 MB message length is measured as a function of the number of devices in the system.  These measurements show that the LP-based collectives are consistently the fastest.  Third, DNN training experiments with AlexNet and GoogLeNet are performed on a 4-device system using three different synchronous SGD algorithms with the different implementations of the collectives (a total of 6 different algorithms in all).  Measurements of the communication and computation costs show that the LP collectives reduce communication costs without affecting computation costs (as expected).  Measurements of the convergence of the training loss as a function of", "time for the two DNN architectures show that use of the LP collectives leads to faster training.While the theory says that the costs of LP collectives should be invariant to the number of devices in a multi-GPU system, the empirical work shows that in practice this does not hold going from 4 to 5 devices (in the tested configuration) because in a 5-device system messages must traverse the QPI.

If this will not be added, then please justify the choice of architecture used, and/or clarify what can be generalized about the observed learning performance.Another caveat is that the reported epsilons are not", "those that can be privately released; the authors note that their technique for doing so would change the resulting epsilon. However this would need to be resolved in order to have a meaningful comparison to the epsilon-delta values reported in related work.Finally, as has been acknowledged in the paper, the present approach may not work on other natural data types. Experiments on other data sets is strongly encouraged. Also, please cite the data sets used.Other comments:Discussion of certain parts of the related work are thorough. However, please add some survey/discussion of the related work on differentially-private semi-supervised learning. For example, in the context of random forests, the following paper also proposed differentially-private semi-supervised learning via a teacher-learner approach (although not denoted as \u201cteacher-learner\u201d). The only time the private", "labeled data is used is when learning the \u201cprimary ensemble.\u201d  A \"secondary ensemble\" is then learned only from the unlabeled (non-private) data, with pseudo-labels generated by the primary ensemble.G.

Importantly, the authors investigate whether it is possible to build an adversarial detector which is resilient to adversarial examples built against *both* the classifier and the detector. Their results suggest that training a detector in this more difficult setting still yields gains but does not entirely resolve the problem of detecting adversarial examples.Major comments:The authors describe a novel approach for dealing with adversarial examples from a security standpoint -- namely, build an independent system to detect the adversary so a human might", "intervene in those cases. A potential confound of this approach is that an adversary might respond by constructing adversarial examples to fool *both* the original classifier and the new detector. If that were possible, then this approach is moot since an attacker could always outwit the original system. To their credit, the authors show that building a 'dynamic' detector to detect adversarial examples but also be resilient to an adversary mitigates this potential escalation (worse case from 55% to 70% detection rate). Even though the 'dynamic' detector  demonstrates positive gains, I am concerned about overall scores. Detecting adversarial examples at this rate would not be a reliable security procedure.My second comment is about 'model transferability'. My definition of 'model transferability' is different then the one used in", "the paper. My definition means that one constructs an adversarial example on one network and measures how well the adversarial examples attack a second trained model -- where the second model has been trained with different initial conditions. (The author's definition of 'transferability' is based on seeing how well the detector generalizes across training methods). 'Model transferability' (per my definition) is quite important because it measures how general an adversarial example is across all models -- and not specific to a given trained model.

So exponential network sizes are caused by this rank needing to grow exponentially, as required by the partition.- In the deep case, one also uses the case that the upper bound is linear in the size of the network (as measured by the last hidden layer), however,", "this situation is caused by the selection of a partition (I^low, J^high), and the maximal rank induced by this partition is only linear anyway, hence the network size can remain linear.If tried my best to summarize the key point of this paper and still probably failed at it, which shows how complex is this notion of partition rank, and that its linear growth with network size can either be a good or bad thing depending on the setting.

Taking the idea of this work, can we develop a stable dynamic system, but which does not only have one attractor?It is also interesting to see that the layers of CFNs are updated in different timescales in a sense that the decaying speed decreases when the layer gets higher.

The approach is based on a CNN that, in contrast to most related papers, work in the space of affine transformations (instead of pixels or flow). Said another way, the network takes as input a set of affine transforms that describe the motion of patches in the past frames, and likewise, outputs a set of affine transforms that predict future patch motion.To that aim, the authors make a few simplifying hypotheses, namely, that a sequence of frames can be modeled accurately enough in their patch-affine framework. This is not unreasonable. A lot of papers in the optical flow community are based on similar hypotheses, i.e. model the flow", "as a smoothly varying affine field (for instance see \"Locally affine sparse-to-dense matching for motion and occlusion estimation\" by Leordeanu et al., \"EpicFlow: Edge-Preserving Interpolation of Correspondences for Optical Flow\" by Revaud et al., \"Optical Flow With Semantic Segmentation and Localized Layers\" by Sevilla-Lara et al.). These methods are state of the art, which gives a hint about the validity of this kind of approach. In addition, it also seems very reasonable to reformulate the prediction task as predicting motion rather than predicting raw pixels. Indeed, the (patch-affine) motion space is considerably smaller than the image space, making the problem much more tractable and amenable to high-resolution videos.While I agree with the authors on these points, I also find that the paper suffer from important flaws. Specifically: ", "- the choice of not comparing with previous approaches in term of pixel prediction error seems very \"convenient\", to say the least. While it is clear that the evaluation metric is imperfect, it is not a reason to completely dismiss all quantitative comparisons with previous work. The frames output by the network on, e.g. the moving digits datasets (Figure 4), looks ok and can definitely be compared with other papers. Yet, the authors chose not to, which is suspicious.    - The newly proposed metric poses several problems. First, action classification is evaluated with C3D, which is not a state-of-the-art approach at all for this task. Second, this metric actually *does not* evaluate what the network is claimed to do, that is, next frame prediction. Instead,", "it evaluates if another network, which was never trained to distinguish between real or synthetic frames by the way, can accurately classify an action from the predicted frames. I find that this proxy metric is only weakly related to what is supposed to be measured. In adition, it does not really make sense to train a network for something else that the final task it is evaluated for.    - how is the affine motion of patches estimated? It is only explained that the problem is solved globally (not treating each patch independently) in a pretty vague manner. Estimating the motion of all patches is akin to solving the optical flow, which is still an active subject of research. Therefore, an important flaw of the paper", "lies in the potentially erroneous etimation of the motion input to the network. In the videos made available, it is clear that the motion is wrongly estimated sometimes. Since the entire approach depends on this input, I find it important to discuss this aspect. How do motion estimation failures impact the network? Also, the patch-affine hypothesis does not hold when patches are large enough that they cover several objects with contradictory motion. Which appears to be the case on UCF101 videos.    - Even ignoring the weird proxy-evaluation part, the network is still not trained end-to-end. That is, the network is trained to minimize the difference between (noisy) ground-truth and output affine transforms, instead of minimizing a loss in the actual output space (frame pixels) for", "years old.
