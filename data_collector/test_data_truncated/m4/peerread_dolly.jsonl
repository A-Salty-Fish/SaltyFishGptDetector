Recently, neural approaches have achieved impressive results on large KQA benchmark datasets like Quaero and Heatlie. A strong baseline of KQA is formed with the interaction of pre-trained BERT model and external knowledge base (KB) facts. However, there are several limitations of this approach. First, the interaction of BERT and KB is not end-to-end trainable, and requires additional label indicating whether the input question and the facts can match. Second, the matching score between question and fact in the KB is only a ranking score, but not a probability score, which limits the detection of correct relations between questions and facts. Third, BERT model simply understands the semantic relatedness between questions and facts, but lacks the specific knowledge about the types of relations between them. To address these limitations, in this paper, we propose a novel end-to-end trainable framework BERT QA (BERT for QA). It directly takes the input facts and question as input, and outputs matching probability and relation types between them. We also extract important hidden representation from BERT using pre-training and fine-tuning methods.

As more and more businesses migrate to the cloud, the ability to access time sensitive information becomes critical. The problem of incorrect time synchronization and incorrect or incomplete timezone data costs Indian businesses millions of US dollars a year. For example, Indian office times typically use Eastern Standard Time (EST) which is 5 hours behind UTC. Indian enterprises often use Gujrat", "Daylight Time (GST) which is 6 hours ahead of UTC.

An Indian business representative may believe they are showing their working hours from 9AM-5PM when in fact they are showing 9PM-5PM in EST, that is a difference of 10 hours. Additionally, incorrect time synchronization and timezone data in regulations can result in regulatory risk. For example, a price forecast for a major produce in India for an upcoming quarter might increase if the regulator changes their timezone and the forecasting team in India assumes they are in CST when in fact they are in IST.

In this paper we present an annotation framework and corpus of grammatical errors gathered from the Amazon Mechanical Turk (AMT).

Machine Learning for Grammatical Error Correction Many sentences in written language are grammatical, but some contain grammatical mistakes. These mistakes can cause problems for machines as well as for people. For example, computer-generated text often contains mistakes that human readers catch because the writing is bad, but mistakes that machine readers miss because they are not looking for them. The same is true for human readers: people frequently catch mistakes in machine-generated text, but are less likely to make the same mistakes themselves. Because of this, people who", "use machine-generated text (such as generated emails or online help documents) should try hard to correct mistakes the machines make. In this paper we present an approach to teach a model to correct grammatical errors.

We use this dataset to train a generative model that can learn from examples of correctly written text to correctly write ungrammatical text.

Italso allows for finer-grained comparison of GEC systems, in terms of precisionin general, and error type-specific figures for recall and precision.Unfortunately, the description of the system remains highly superficial.

Table 6 (which takes one entire page) list resultsfor all systems, and the text repeats many facts and figures that can be readoff the table. The evaluation of the proposed system is not satisfying in several aspects. First, the annotators should have independently annotated a gold standard forthe 200 test sentences instead of simply rating the output of the system. Givena fixed set of tags, it should be possible to produce a gold standard for therather small set of", "test sentences. It is highly probable that the approachtaken in the paper yields considerably better ratings for the annotations thancomparison with a real gold standard (see, e.g., Marcus et al. (1993) for acomparison of agreement when reviewing pre-annotated data vs. annotating fromscratch). Second, it is said that \"all 5 raters individually considered at least 95% ofour rule-based error types to be either \u201cGood\u201d or \u201cAcceptable\u201d\".Multiple rates should not be considered individually and their ratings averagedthis way, this is not common practice. If each of the \"bad\" scores wereassigned to different edits (we don't learn about their distribution from thepaper), 18.5% of the edits were considered \"bad\" by some annotator -- thissounds much worse than the average 3.7%, as calculated in the paper.Third, no information about the test data", "is provided, e.g. how many errorcategories they contain, or which error categories are covered (according tothe cateogories rated as \"good\" by the annotators).Forth, what does it mean that \"edit boundaries might be unusual\"? A moreprecise description plus examples are at need here. Could this be problematicfor the application of the system?The authors state that their system is less domain dependent as compared tosystems that need training data. I'm not sure that this is true. E.g., Isuppose that Hunspell's vocabulary probably doesn't cover all domains in thesame detail, and manually-created rules can be domain-dependent as well -- andare completely language dependent, a clear drawback as compared to machinelearning approaches.

The Introduction provides a clear motivation for the work and goes into detail about what has been done in related areas. The rest of the paper is also well-organized and clearly presented. My primary suggestions are as follows. As the authors mention in the first section, previous work has explored the use of tensor factorization to model semantic relatedness. From a methodological perspective, this work mostly used synthetic datasets with a single concept and a single word. I wonder if the results would generalize to real-world use cases, such as those found in Open Data science, where the authors use the same data to train models to predict whether two words are related or not. Given that the existing", "models typically use a factorization of the Wordvec Tensor, it might be interesting to use the same approach to cluster the words in the Open Data set and evaluate the interpretability of the groups. Another interesting aspect of this work would be to test whether the method can generate meaningful phrases by stitching together clusters of words. The authors do mention this as an opportunity for future work. Overall, I recommend this paper for publication in the Arxiv, with some changes described above. I also recommend submitting it to a NLP conference, preferably one that publishes the paper as soon as it is accepted, like WMT. I look forward to future work on this topic! Thank you for your consideration! Best, Dolly Appendix Using Tensor Factorization to Model", "Relatedness There has been significant progress in modeling the semantic relatedness of pairs of words in recent years. Building on earlier work using tensor factorization, recent work has explored the use of non-negative tensor factorization (NTF) to model relatedness for both the word pair level and the concept level. While the approach using NTF has shown promising results, it is also important to note that these results need to be evaluated with respect to human judgment. In particular, it is important to ask how well the computed relatedness scores reflect the degree of semantic relatedness as judged by humans. In this work, we propose a weakly-supervised approach for embedding concepts, phrases, and words, which leverages recent advances in the use of Pointwise Gaussian Processes for symbolic regression. Using", "this method, we can generate a probability distribution over real-valued vectors of any size. These vectors can then be used to cluster the words in a given corpus, and the resulting groups of words can be used to generate phrases that capture the meaning of the groups of words. Introduction Semantic relatedness (also called semantic proximity or semantic association) describes how two entities are related according to an implicit model. This model is typically built from a collection of textual documents, from which it is possible to extract a set of pairs of words that indicate a certain type of relationship (e.g., a noun phrase indicating ownership is associated with the word \"his\" in text). According to this model, the relatedness between two entities E1 and E2 can", "be computed as the semantic relatedness of the phrases (or words) that describe E1 and E2. A wide range of real-world applications rely on this model to perform inferences about new situations by exploiting these relationships. For example, a search for a house to buy based on location can also retrieve real-estate advertisements that mention the price of houses in the area that are similar to the one the user is interested in. Using the example of Open Data science, the authors use the fact that multiple models have been trained on this data to perform the prediction: for example, the models can be used to predict whether two words are related or not. Given that the existing models typically use a factorization of the Wordvec Tensor, it", "were arrived at, and whether the algorithm makes sense in terms of the types of relationships that it identifies between the words. For example, some research suggests that the models may assign high relatedness scores to unlikely word pairs [1,2].

However, there are some major concerns that should be addressed before considering this paper for publication in this journal or any other journal. 1. The paper does not address the fundamental problem of zero pronoun resolution (ZPR). In typical supervised learning setups, the learner (the AI system) is trained on a set of labeled data points. Both the learner and the data points have identifier types. The learner has been trained to predict the identifier type from an input. The data points have the actual identifier type specified. In the ZPR problem, the learner does not have the identifier type for the data point. The paper does not address this fundamental limitation. The zero pronoun problem could be framed as a domain adaptation problem.", "Some methods such as domain reversal could be used to solve this problem. However, these methods require training on a new dataset that has identifier type annotations for the data points. The paper does not propose or suggest any method to generate this new dataset. 2. There is a mismatch between the zero pronoun problem and the training data generation approach described in the paper. The paper uses Amazon Mechanical Turk (MT) to obtain images of humans. However, the identifier for the human in the MT images is not consistent with the identifier that the ZPR algorithm needs. For example, a man's Photograph ID (PG ) is likely to be different from his name. In such a scenario, the zero pronoun algorithm would not work because it requires", "an exact match between the identifier in the training data and the identifier of the test data. 3. Another concern is the scale of the generated dataset. The paper states that it generated 30 million data points. This is equivalent to generating 30 million images of humans. This is a very challenging problem because the number of humans on Earth is around 7 billion. The paper also mentions that the images of humans do not have to be realistic. This means the authors could have used a large number of photos of homeless people, persons with disabilities, and other vulnerable groups. The size of the dataset could make the solution to the zero pronoun problem ill-posed. Based on these comments, I suggest the authors of the paper revisit", "these points and try to address the above concerns before considering this paper for publication in this journal or any other journal. Some constructive suggestions: 1. The fundamental problem of zero pronoun resolution (ZPR) can be framed as a transfer learning problem. The identifier type of the learner can be used as a supervisory signal to improve the generalization performance of the learner for the ZPR problem. 2. The identifier type of humans in the training data should be carefully selected. For example, the identifier type could include the person's name along with their age, occupation, etc. 3. The paper can include methods to identify vulnerable groups in the data generation process. The data could be further filtered based on the vulnerable groups to reduce the size of", "don't see the need to reject the paper.

The results, while initially amusing, appear to be less so over time as people get used to the altered street names.

I do not doubt that Harlow Carr is a lovely part of town, but the addition of this name to a street sign is unlikely to excite passersby to take a second look, unlike more evocative and original examples", "such as \"London Road\" or \"Vegas Highway\". For these reasons, I recommend performing a more extensive checker, with some samples of impressive additions such as this, and save this for later when the novelty has worn off and the new names have started to feel like they might actually be useful rather than just amusing. The writing is clear and concise, laying out the background information and the rationale for the changes ahead of time, so the reader can decide for themselves whether these changes are worth taking notice of. The change in naming scheme does seem to increase the frequency of the more notable examples, with names such as Blackley Avenue or Vegas Highway appearing to have especially memorable first letters. There may even be a case", "to be made for studying these in-road names to evaluate whether a shift to these more evocative names might increase the city's name recognition, although I would need to see clearer evidence that the change is significantly increasing the number of visitors to the city, rather than just increasing the length of time that particular visitors spend in the city. My biggest issue is that the change is entirely nonsensical. \"Harlow Carr\" is certainly a lovely place, but to assert that a place of such resonance warrants a place name on street signs throughout the city, let alone for high-traffic areas such as the center of the city, is fanciful. I do not doubt that the officials responsible for this change are intelligent and well-intentioned, but this kind", "of reverse-engineering of the existing street name and Situationist-style change metonymy seems destined to fail.

Using a non-negative matrix factorization approach, it further reduces the number of tags in each semantic frame to a smaller set of key tags. To retrieve similar documents, the proposed scheme uses the hashing technique to index the semantic frames and associated tags, thus enabling fast search with low false positive rate. Using this scheme, the authors have applied it to a real world dataset and shown", "further enrich the semantic content of the frame.

The notion of vector additivity, or the \"naive\" expectation that a bag of terms should add up to the total like vector spaces, is a key part of this paper. However, there are a few issues with this argument in the paper. First, it's not clear that the Boltzman Sampling procedure used to generate the skip-gram word vector adds up to a legitimate probability distribution (with sufficient over-dispersion to cancel out). The claim that it does is based on a previous paper that assumes a logarithmic reference function for a hardplus function, but there is no evidence that the Boltzman Sampling procedure has such a property. Second, even if one accepts the Boltzman Sampler procedure as a legitimate probability distribution, there is a key disagreement between the authors' results and the assumptions of the model. The model assumes that each word has a vector, but the paper only shows how to compute the average of all the words' vectors. The result is a valid skip-gram model, but it's not clear how to get a vector for each word in the vocabulary. Overall, this is an interesting idea, but the models assumptions do not hold in the Boltzmann Sampler implementation, and the result is a very different model than the one described in the paper.

I very much appreciate the effort tounderstand the assumptions of the model, and the way it affects (or is affectedby) the composition operations that it is used to perform. In that respect, Ithink it is a very worthwhile read for the community.My main criticism is however that the paper is linguistically rather naive. Theauthors' use of 'compositionality' (as an operation that takes a set of wordsand returns another with the same meaning)", "is extremely strange. Two words canof course be composed and produce a vector that is a) far away from both; b)does not correspond to any other concept in the space; c) still has meaning(productivity wouldn't exist otherwise!) Compositionality in linguistic termssimply refers to the process of combining linguistic constituents to producehigher-level constructs. It does not assume any further constraint, apart fromsome vague (and debatable) notion of semantic transparency. The paper'simplication (l254) that composition takes place over sets is also wrong:ordering matters hugely (e.g. 'sugar cane' is not 'cane sugar'). This is awell-known shortcoming of additive composition. Another important aspect is that there are pragmatic factors that make humansprefer certain phrases to single words in particular contexts (and theopposite), naturally changing the underlying distribution of words in a largecorpus.", "For instance, talking of a 'male royalty' rather than a 'king' or'prince' usually has implications with regard to the intent of the speaker(here, perhaps highlighting a gender difference). This means that the equationin l258 (or for that matter the KL-divergence modification) does not hold, notbecause of noise in the data, but because of fundamental linguistic processes.This point may be addressed by the section on SDR, but I am not completely sure(see my comments below).In a nutshell, I think the way that the authors present composition is flawed,but the paper convinces me that this is indeed what happens in skip-gram, and Ithink this is an interesting contribution. The part about Sufficient Dimensionality Reduction seems a little disconnectedfrom the previous argument as it stands. I'm afraid I wasn't able to", "fullyfollow the argument, and I would be grateful for some clarification in theauthors' response. If I understand it well, the argument is that skip-gramproduces a model where a word's neighbours follow some exponentialparametrisation of a categorical distribution, but it is unclear whether thisactually reflects the distribution of the corpus (as opposed to what happensin, say, a pure count-based model). The fact that skip-gram performs welldespite not reflecting the data is that it implements some form of SDR, whichdoes not need to make any assumption about the underlying form of the data.

As it stands, such models tend to suffer from lack ofdiversity, specificity and local coherence in the kinds of response they tendto produce when trained over large dialogue datasets containing many topics(e.g. Cornell, Opensubtitles, Ubuntu, etc.). Rather than attempting to producediverse responses using the decoder, e.g. through word-by-word beam search(which has been shown not to work very well, even lose crucial informationabout grammar and valid sequences), or via a different objective function (suchas in Li et. al.\u2019s", "work) the authors introduce a latent variable, z, overwhich a probability distribution is induced as part of the network. Atprediction time, after encoding utterances 1 to k, a context z is sampled, andthe decoder is greedily used to generate a response from this. The evaluationshows small improvements in BLEU scores over a vanilla seq2seq model that doesnot involve learning a probability distribution over contexts and sampling fromthis.The paper is certainly impressive from a technical point of view, i.e. in theapplication of deep learning methods, specifically conditioned variational autoencoders, to the problem of response generation, and its attendant difficultiesin training such models. Their use of Information-Retrieval techniques to getmore than one reference response is also interesting.

The authors seem not fully aware of the long history of this field, and itsvarious facets, whether from a theoretical perspective, or from an applied one.1. \u201c[the dialogue manager] typically takes a new utterance and the dialoguecontext as input, and generates discourse level decisions.\u201d         This is not accurate. Traditionally at least, the job of the dialoguemanager is to select actions (dialogue acts) in a particular dialogue context.The                    action chosen is then passed to a separate generationmoduleforrealisation. Dialogue management is usually done in the", "context of task-basedsystems which are goal driven. The dialogue manager is to choose actions whichare optimal in some sense, e.g. reach a goal (e.g. book a restaurant) in as fewsteps as possible. See publications from Lemon & Pietquin, 2012, Rieser, Keizerand colleagues, and various publications from Steve Young, Milica Gasic andcolleagues for an overview of the large literature on Reinforcement Learningand MDP models for task-based dialogue systems.2. The authors need to make a clear distinction between task-based,goal-oriented dialogue, and chatbots/social bots, the latter being usually nomore than a language model, albeit a sophisticated one (though see Wen et. al.2016). What is required from these two types of system is usually distinct.Whereas the former is required to complete a task, the latter is, perhaps onlyrequired to keep the user", "engaged. Indeed the data-driven methods that havebeen used to build such systems are usually very different. 3. The authors refer to \u2018open-domain\u2019 conversation. I would suggest thatthere is no such thing as open-domain conversation - conversation is always inthe context of some activity and for doing/achieving something specific in theworld. And it is this overarching goal, the overarching activity, thisoverarching genre, which determines the outward shape of dialogues anddetermines what sorts of dialogue structure are coherent. Coherence itself isactivity/context-specific. Indeed a human is not capable of open-domaindialogue: if they are faced with a conversational topic or genre that they havenever participated in, they would embarrass themselves with utterances thatwould look incoherent and out of place to others already familiar with it.(think of a random person on the street", "trying to follow the conversations atsome coffee break at ACL). This is the fundamental problem I see with systemsthat attempt to use data from an EXTREMELY DIVERSE, open-ended set ofconversational genres (e.g. movie subtitles) in order to train one model,mushing everything together so that what emerges at the other end is just verygood grammatical structure. Or very generic responses. Comments on the model architecture:Rather than generate from a single encoded context, the authors induce adistribution over possible contexts, sample from this, and generate greedilywith the decoder. It seems to me that this general model is counter intuitive,and goes against evidence from the Linguistic/Psycholinguistic literature ondialogue: this literature shows that people tend to resolve potential problemsin understanding and acceptance very locally - i.e. make sure they agree onwhat the", "context of the conversation is - and only then move on with the restof the conversation, so that at any given point, there is little uncertaintyabout the current context of the conversation. The massive diversity one seesresults from the diversity in what the conversation is actually trying toachieve (see above), diversity in topics and contexts etc, so that in a given,fixed context, there is a multitude of possible next actions, all coherent, butleading the conversation down a different path.It therefore seems strange to me at least to shift the burden of explainingdiversity and coherence in follow-up actions to that of thelinguistic/verbal/surface contexts in which they are uttered, though of course,uncertainty here can also arise as a result of mismatches in vocabulary,grammars, concepts, people\u2019s backgrounds etc. But this probably", "wouldn\u2019texplain much of the variation in follow-up response. In fact, at least as far as task-based Dialogue systems are concerned, thechallenge is to capture synonymy of contexts, i.e. dialogues that are distincton the surface, but lead to the same or similar context, either in virtue ofinteractional and syntactic equivalence relations, or synonymy relations thatmight hold in a particular domain between words or sequences of words (e.g.\u201cwhat is your destination?\u201d = \u201cwhere would you like to go?\u201d in a flightbooking domain). See e.g. Bordes & Weston, 2016; and Kalatzis, Eshghi & Lemon,2016 - the latter use a grammar to cluster semantically similar dialogues.Comments on the evaluation:The authors seek to show that their model can generate more coherent, and morediverse responses.

From your description ofthe post-analysis of coherence, only pairs of stories written by the sameperson in which one was judged as \"coherent\" and the other one as \"neutral\" arechosen. Can you confirm that this is the case? So perhaps your claim isjustified for your \"Experiment 1\".

If these were not the most frequent features, but some thatyou chose among frequent POS and words, you need to justify this choice andespecially link the choice to \"style\". How are these features reflecting\"style\"?(3) I don't understand how the section \"Design of NLP tasks\" connects to therest of the paper, and to your results.

From the methodological point of view, the authors are combining a reasonablyfamiliar methods (att-BiLSTM and CNN) into a fairly complex model. However,this model does not take raw text (sequence of word embeddings) as input, butrather hand-crafted features (e.g., different dependency paths combiningfactuality concepts, e.g., sources, SIPs, and clues). The usage of hand-craftedfeatures is somewhat surprising if coupled with complex deep model. Theevaluation seems a bit tainted as the authors report the results from foldedcross-validation but do not report how they optimized the hyperparameters ofthe model. Finally, the results are not too convincing -- considering thecomplexity", "of the model and the amount of preprocessing required (extraction ofevent mentions, SIPs, and clues), a 2% macro-average gain over the rule-basedbaseline and overall 44% performance seems modest, at best (looking atMicro-average, the proposed model doesn't outperform simple MaxEnt classifier).The paper is generally well-written and fairly easy to understand. Altogether,I find this paper to be informative to an extent, but in it's current form nota great read for a top-tier conference.   Remarks:1. You keep mentioning that the LSTM and CNN in your model are combined\"properly\" -- what does that actually mean? How does this \"properness\"manifest?

You first motivate the usage of your complex DL architecture with learninglatent representations and avoiding manual design and feature computation.  Andthen you define a set of manually designed features (several dependency pathsand lexical features) as input for the model. Do you notice the discrepancy? 4.

The contribution of this paper isinstead a \"simple model\" using other linguistic resources.The related work section provides a good review of sentimentliterature.

It is not entirely clear to mewhat constitutes a \"position\" t in the terminology of the paper. t is aparameter to the LSTM output, so it seems to be the index of asentence. Thus, t-1 is the preceding sentence, and p_t is the predictionfor this sentence. However, the description of the regularizers talksabout preceding words, not sentences, but still uses.

If this is not the case, thecomparison is not fair. Also, I do not understand why the authors cannotrun NSCL on the MR dataset when they have access to an implementation ofthe model.

The paper does not provide any information about how the training data was collected or any parameters of the data that could help understand the scope of the generalization of the model. Providing this information would be useful for understanding if the model is overfitting to the sample data and generalizing poorly to new data. The model was trained on a single news article and tested on another. To validate generalizability, we evaluated the model on a new, unseen dataset of 500 articles. The model was trained on 20Newsgroups data set and tested on 20Newsgroups validation set. As you can see from the following table, the model had good generalization ability.

Firstly, the authors should consider the possibility that the ghostwritten rap lyrics were not wholly genuine, and that the artist was using a trick to try to get around intellectual property restrictions. The lyrics describe features of the neighbourhood the artist grew up in, and it seems unlikely that any local would not know about the existence of thesong's subject matter.

The authors should consider the possibility that the artist was not actually involved in the composition of the lyrics, and that they are written in such a way as to give the appearance of a genuine rap song. The authenticity of the rap lyrics could be tested by the authors either by speaking to people who live in the area (and checking if they know anything about the subject matter), or by consulting academic resources about the area at the time the lyrics were written (for example, the Rap Map Project). The authors could also investigate whether the song was ever commercially successful, as this would suggest that the song could have sold commercially at some point, even if the artists didn't actually", "write them. The second aspect that could be expanded on is the idea of genre. The paper talks about how rap genre has changed over the past few decades, and that this has an impact on how much influence the producer has on the final song. However, there is actually a third aspect to genre that might have an impact on the paper's central idea: the \"grain\" of the lyric. This is a more general category of rap genre, which determines the style of the delivery of the lyrics.

Let me start by saying that I really enjoyed reading this work, and found it well written and well structured. The topic is interesting, and the author presents the material clearly. That said, there are a number of issues that I think might trip up some readers. First, there is some sloppy writing. I ran across some sentences that weren't clear, or that needed some clarification, or that were just written poorly. These could be from not having someone else look over the work, or they might be the result of not writing as well as I think the author does, and so I've marked these places with \" FP \". Second, there is some", "mathiness in the work. The author uses math words and phrases pretty much everywhere, without clearly indicating what they are getting at, or explaining what the reader needs to know. Again, this is a case where another reader might not pick up on these issues, so I've marked the places where this happens with \" MP \".

Though the topic is interesting, the topic itself is not yet developed in a clear way, as there are several terms, concepts, and ideas that are not", "explained sufficiently. I would be happy to help the author clarify these aspects of the work in a revised draft. I do have some suggestions for improvement, though. The paper has a number of different topics and sections. The first major topic is about how we can represent language as a string of characters rather than as a sequence of phonemes, syllables, and other forms. This raises the question of what representations are available to us, and what they can and can't do. The author does a good job of reviewing some of the more popular representations, and also explaining how character-based models have a hard time capturing things like accent and phrasal timing. A separate section of the paper deals with the nature of language. Here, the", "author talks about how the meaning of a word is related to the meanings of its component morphemes, and how this means that dictionaries don't really capture word forms. In the third major section of the paper, the author goes on to argue that one thing that could help capture the morphemes of words would be to use neural networks that can read and write sequences of characters. The author describes a system for doing this, and the result is that the model now also learns the meaning of words from a limited amount of text that has been manually tagged with its intended word-form and part-of-speech. In the final section, the author goes back to the original problem of capturing word forms. In this part of the", "paper, the author tries to figure out what has happened to the meaning of words during the process of converting them to characters. He does this by comparing the representations of words that have been generated by the model with the dictionaries found in the original training set, and showing that often words that have been generated have multiple potential meanings and dictionaries. The author shows that this result seems to hold generally, even when the word forms are no longer attached to the word's meanings. In general, I think this is an interesting paper that is worth thinking about. I agree that in some ways, dictionaries don't really capture word forms, though I think that having a computer that can write characters might actually help with that", "as I did find some parts of the paper to be unclear or less clear than others. One area in which I think the paper might profit from additional explanation or examples is in the discussion of how dictionary entries and word forms might not always be the same word, or even the same part of speech. I think that this might be worth spelling out in more detail, and then providing some examples to help illustrate the point.

Or if Ref [Kim et al., 2016] will remain only aspre-published arXiv, then it might be still acceptable. But since [Kim et al.,2016] will officially publish in IEEE conference, much earlier than this paper,then a more specified title that represents the main contribution of this paperin contrast with the existing publication would be necessary. (b) Introduction:The author claims that \u201cWe propose to take advantage", "of the constrained CTCalignment in a hybrid CTC-attention based system. During training, we attach aCTC objective to an attention-based encoder network as a regularization, asproposed by [Kim at al., 2016].\u201c Taking advantage of the constrained CTCalignment in a hybrid CTC-attention is the original idea from [Kim at al.,2016]. So the whole argument about attention-based end-to-end ASR versusCTC-based ASR, and the necessary of CTC-attention combination is not novel.Furthermore, the statement \u201cwe propose \u2026 as proposed by [Kim et al,2016]\u201d is somewhat weird. We can build upon someone proposal with additionalextensions, but not just re-propose other people's proposal. Therefore, whatwould be important here is to state clearly the original contribution of thispaper and the position of the proposed method with respect to existingliterature(c) Experimental Results:Kim at al., 2016 applied the", "on Japanese and Mandarin Chinese tasks. I think itwould be interesting if the paper could explain in more details about thespecific problems in Japanese and Mandarin Chinese tasks that may not appear inEnglish task. For example, how the system could address multiple possibleoutputs. i.e., Kanji, Hiragana, and Katakana given Japanese speech inputwithout using any linguistic resources. This could be one of the importantcontributions from this paper.- General Discussion:I think it would be better to cite Ref [Kim et al., 2016] fromthe official IEEE ICASSP conference, rather than pre-published arXiv:Kim, S., Hori, T., Watanabe, S., \"Joint CTC- Attention Based End-to-End SpeechRecognition Using Multi-task Learning\", IEEE International Conference onAcoustics, Speech, and Signal Processing (ICASSP), March 2017, pp. to appear."], "model": "dolly-v2", "source": "PeerRead/acl_2017/", "source_ID": 484.0}

These languages can be thought of as generalisations of regular languages, where the regular expression is replaced by a distribution. The paper then goes on to present two algorithms for constructively generating random graphs in this class. Finally, the paper concludes with some thoughts on the usefulness of probabilistic regular graph languages, as well as some suggestions for future research in this area. I think this paper is an important contribution to the field of generative graph modelling, and I have selected some suggestions for how the author could improve the paper according to my review expectations. 1. The introduction is a little hard to follow, please make sure to", "use clearer and more concise language. The article feels a little like a research paper from a more technical point of view, with a lot of Greek symbols and other complex language that might confuse a non-technical audience. A more crisp, readable, and interesting introduction would make the paper more approachable to a wider range of readers. 2. The second paragraph of the introduction could be better placed as a separate subsection in its own right. Currently it is part of the definition of probabilistic regular graph languages. 3. It might be helpful to define the term Regular Graph Languages (RGLs) before going into the definition of PRGLs. RGLs, also known as finitely separable regular languages, are a very well-studied subset of all regular languages. It might be", "helpful to mention how PRGLs relate to RGLs and give some of the advantages of using PRGLs over RGLs. This can be done e.g. in the fourth paragraph of Section 2. 4. The notation introduced in the third paragraph of Section 2 should be defined first. The notation X \u2287 Y is defined as the expanded version of the definition X \u2286 Y. 5. It is useful to provide examples of PRGs as part of the definition of PRGLs, but also later in the paper. For example, it may be helpful to introduce the class of NPLGs first (this is the language over the alphabet {a, b} = {a, Ab, B} where N denotes a node, P a probability distribution on nodes and L is a label), and", "then show that PRGLs are a superset of NPLGs. It might also be helpful to show a small example of a PRGL (e.g. {a+b* | b}, which models the dependency between two random variables). 6. In the fourth paragraph of Section 2, the term'sample' is used. In the context of graphs, this term typically refers to one or more vertices and/or edges. I would suggest using a different term to stress that this is more than just a sample. For example, using'sample space' might make it clearer that more than one element can be sampled from a PRG. Similarly, using'sample' might be confused with a random variable, which is usually denoted with a lower case letter (e.g. x). 7. The term sample space is only used once in", "the whole paper. This could be a reason why the concept is only mentioned but not fully explained. A clearer explanation of the sample space might help the reader understand how to interpret the graphs generated. What does it mean to sample from a PRG? Is it the same as sampling from the PRG's distribution? If not, why not? Can the result of such a sampling be interpreted as a graph? 8. One application of PRGs is modelling of dependency between random variables. However, no reference is made to this application in the text. It might be worthwhile providing one example of a PRG used for this purpose. Another interesting application of PRGs might be building of DFA or NFA components, which are commonly used in regular expression-based"], "human_text": ["This one is a tough call, because I do think that there are someimportant, salvageable technial results in here (notably the parsingalgorithm), but the paper as a whole has very little cohesion.

Generalizability: When applying this method to new images, the model may give unexpected answers, especially for images that contain things that are not present in the training dataset.

And in the third part, the authors apply the method to real data and show some interesting results. I think a simple paper could be easily split into three main parts.

The first part could be changed from \"training\" to \"finding parameters.\" It turns out to be the more interesting part of the process, but this is not apparent without the background from the first part. The third part is potentially interesting, but also a bit complicated. Since the code that generated the results is not made available, it's very hard to verify the results.

A second comment is that there are multiple ways to encode the knowledge necessary for the statistical machine translation (SMT) model. The model that achieves the best performance on the test set may not be the model that is easiest to reproduce or worst-case performance/cost efficient. The choice of model should be made clear in the paper. A", "third comment is that it would be very helpful to have more explanation of the neural network model that the SMT model is based on. In particular, I had to look up the acronym LSTM to understand that the model uses a memory mechanism inspired by biological neural networks. Despite these comments, I think this is a useful contribution to the area of open information extraction. It would be especially useful to include a more extensive comparison of the model performance to a more conventional machine-learning approach, as well as to provide an implementation of the algorithm for others to examine. I hope these comments are useful and the paper is accepted for publication. I have reviewed this paper for Microsoft Open Technologies. Best regards, Will Minimize Facts", "in Open Information Extraction ============================================= This paper proposes a new framework for Information Extraction (IE), Minimizing Facts in Open Information Extraction (MinIE), that produces a factual answer from a Freebase summary. This framework consists of a sequence encoder, knowledge encoder, and decoder. The sequence encoder takes a Freebase article and sequences it into a sequence of tokens. The knowledge encoder uses factual sentence patterns to find the main facts of the input. The decoder uses the encoded knowledge and the input sequence to generate the final output. The decoder also takes additional inputs to change the generation probability based on how close the predicted fact is to the original input. This framework was tested on the F1 metric on the WRR dataset. It was shown to outperform the", "current state of the art by 9.2% on the F1 metric and 13.7 million facts extracted in under 10 minutes. Paper References ================ 1.

The proposed approach, dubbed MinOIE,is designed to actually \"minimize\" extractions by removing overly specificportions and turning them into structured annotations of various types(similarly to OLLIE). The authors put MinIE on top of a state-of-the-art OIEsystem (ClausIE) and test it on two publicly available datasets, showing thatit effectively leads to more concise extractions compared to standard OIEapproaches, while at the same time retaining accuracy.Overall, this work focuses on an interesting (and perhaps underinvestigated)aspect", "of OIE in a sound and principled way. The paper is clearly written,sufficiently detailed, and accompanied by supplementary material and a neatJava implementation.My main concern is, however, with the entirely static, deterministic andrule-based structure of MinIE. Even though I understand that a handful ofmanually engineered rules is technically the best strategy when precision iskey, these approaches are typically very hard to scale, e.g. in terms oflanguages (a recent trend of OIE, see Faruqui and Kumar, 2015; Falke et al.,2016). In other words, I think that this contribution somehow falls short ofnovelty and substance in proposing a pipeline of engineered rules that aremostly inspired by other OIE systems (such as ClausIE or ReVerb); for instance,I would have really appreciated an attempt to learn these minimization rulesinstead of hard-coding them.Furthermore,", "the authors completely ignore a recent research thread on\u201csemantically-informed\u201d OIE (Nakashole et al., 2012; Moro and Navigli,2012; 2013; Delli Bovi et al., 2015) where traditional extractions areaugmented with links to underlying knowledge bases and sense inventories(Wikipedia, Wikidata, Yago, BabelNet). These contributions are not onlyrelevant in terms of related literature: in fact, having text fragments (orconstituents) explicitly linked to a knowledge base would reduce the need forad-hoc minimization rules such as those in Sections 6.1 and 6.2.

In this sense, the proposed approach would perform very well on machine translation evaluations, as it is very hard to beat BLEU@1. I also have a few questions about the methodology.

I believe that these contributions are interesting and of significant value to the AI community. With that in mind, I have the following comments and suggestions for improvement. The introduction is somewhat difficult to read because of its extremely dense format. I suggest that the authors consider condensing the text, and possibly using a different formatting style. Related to the above comment, I", "also find the organization of the introduction somewhat difficult to follow. The introduction covers a large number of general concepts, each of which is introduced in a single sentence, making it difficult to get a complete sense of how the concepts are connected.

In line with the suggestions above, the first part of the paper describes the problem setting, definitions of terms, and a motivating example of constructing a hierarchical category tree. I think that this part could be improved by including more detailed descriptions of the problem setting and definitions of terms.

On the other hand, a 300D GloVe word embedding is used to capture common words frequent in prepositional phrases, which leads to better representations of PPLs.

Abstract This article analyzes the adoption of a programming language for education from the perspective", "of a \u201cuser experience\u201d that took place over a 10-month period. We discovered that the process was \u201cnatural\u201d for students and teachers. They quickly internalized the basic concepts, and the students\u2019 grades improved considerably. In addition, the experience was extremely educational, allowing students to practice concepts across all curriculum areas and learn basic system administration skills. In the process, we identified several shortcomings of the process, some of which are general to all large-scale implementations of new technologies and some of which are more specific to the implementation of a programming language. We believe that these lessons will be useful to anyone attempting to introduce a new technology into an education environment. Body The Elm programming language was chosen as a candidate for introduction into an existing curriculum.", "The rationale for using Elm was that it has a simple grammar and word-based syntax that allows students to quickly learn the concepts involved in programming. As described by its proponents, Elm\u2019s use of a functional language with declarative code provides many of the benefits of mathematical notation without the pitfalls of abstraction. In addition, the immediate feedback of quick-check exercises allows students to easily locate mistakes and correct them in the fast-forward mode required in today\u2019s world of \u201cprogrammable knowledge.\u201d The Elm implementation in the Ohio Department of Education\u2019s (ODE) computer science course, \u201cComputer Science 1A,\u201d started with the first quarter in fall 2014. The implementation involved a total of 1700 students in first through sixth grades. We examined the experience in terms of: (1) students\u2019 adoption", "of Elm; (2) student learning of the basic concepts of programming; (3) grades of students in the course; and (4) the student learning within other curricular areas. Students\u2019 adoption of Elm was excellent, with almost all students having used the language at some point by the end of the year. The rapid student uptake was not a surprise, as students were already comfortable using basic expressions to describe transformations of graphs representing real-world entities. Student feedback was positive and, in most classes, most students completed a quick-check exercise in less than five minutes. The students rated the exercises very highly with an average score of 3.96 out of 5.00. In addition, they learned enough Elm to complete more advanced exercises and to start writing their own programs. The", "such as \u201cif statements\u201d and \u201cif-then-else\u201d constructs. Students were even able to begin to break down problems into discrete steps and eventually to describe \u201csubroutines\u201d in a few quarters. As with student feedback, the students\u2019 opinions were positive, with students finding the exercises very helpful for \u201cremembering\u201d concepts and for locating and correcting mistakes in their work.

I have some suggestions and comments, however. I assume that the model was trained on the large version of Wordnet. Was that the case? If not, how large is the training data? I think it would be useful to include a tabular summary of the data used in the paper. That way the reader can easily check the relationships described in the paper. It would also be useful to state the test set splits when providing training/test example ratios. I notice that those are 1:4 in some cases but not in others. The paper often refers to \"the instances\". I think it would be clearer to refer to \"the entity\" or \"the example\" (or maybe \"the pair\"). In \"the algorithm\"", "I'd prefer to see \"the method\" or \"the technique\". I don't think \"Controlled Vocabulary\" is the right name for the sub-graph of words that are in WordNet but not in the automatically-generated synset. I think \"Out of Vocabulary\" would be a better name. I don't think \"Controlled\" is a meaningful attribute of a graph. And, since this is an automatically-generated sub-graph, I think \"Controlled\" is a somewhat ambiguous phrase. In the context of this paper, I think it's clear that \"synonyms\" are synonymous. But if the paper is going to use the word \"synonyms\" a lot, it might be worth explaining that in this context it means \"isomorphic equivalents\". It's not obvious to someone reading the paper for the first time why all these relations are included in", "the synset. \"We compared the\" should be \"We compared it to\". \"The primary relationships\" is a bit of a mouthful. I think \"The core semantic relationships\" or \"The main semantic relationships\" would be better. \"some instances\" could be \"some examples\" I don't think the definition of synonymy is explained very clearly. I think the reader needs to know that (1) synonymy means that the entities can be inter-substitutional equivalent and (2) that the symbolized form (i.e. word) is a typo for the Opposite Sex of the corresponding synsymbol (i.e. woman for woman). In general, I think the paper needs more example sentences showing how the model is supposed to work. For example, in the section on transitivity, I'd expect the system to generate examples like \"dog is a", "type of animal, and animal is a type of things that can be owned, so dog is also owned by someone\" or \"elephant is a larger type of animal than dog, and larger is a type of more, so elephant is also larger than dog\". But all we have is \"dog is smaller than elephant, so dog is also smaller than...\" In the part about transitivity, I think \"Since also is transitive, it only needs a single path, and the identity of the subjects does not change throughout the example, so instead of writing an example for this pattern we can just take the head of the chain (the transitive relationship) as the example\". \"dog is larger than elephant, so dog is also larger than...\" is, however, an", "of dog\" feels like a step too far for a generative example. I think a better example would be something like \"the antonyms of dog are cat, rat, and snake, so cat is one of the antonyms of dog\". In the part about pairs, I don't think the model is explained very clearly in one particular example. I think the example should start with \"When X is Y,"], "human_text": ["This paper presents a graph-based approach for producing sense-disambiguatedsynonym sets from a collection of undisambiguated synonym sets.

I was happy to observe thatthe objections I had", "when reading the paper (such as the mismatch in vocabularybetween the synonym dictionaries and gold standards) ended up being resolved,or at least addressed, in the final pages.The one thing about the paper that concerns me is that the authors do not seemto have properly understood the previous work, which undercuts the statedmotivation for this paper.The first instance of this misunderstanding is in the paragraph beginning online 064, where OmegaWiki is lumped in with Wiktionary and Wikipedia in adiscussion of resources that are \"not formally structured\" and that contain\"undisambiguated synonyms\".  In reality, OmegaWiki is distinguished from theother two resources by using a formal structure (a relational database) basedon word senses rather than orthographic forms.              Translations,", "synonyms,andother semantic annotations in OmegaWiki are therefore unambiguous.The second, and more serious, misunderstanding comes in the three paragraphsbeginning on lines 092, 108, and 120.  Here the paper claims that both BabelNetand UBY \"rely on English WordNet as a pivot for mapping of existing resources\"and criticizes this mapping as being \"error-prone\".  Though it is true thatBabelNet uses WordNet as a pivot, UBY does not.  UBY is basically ageneral-purpose specification for the representation of lexical-semanticresources and of links between them.  It exists independently of any givenlexical-semantic resource (including WordNet) and of any given alignmentbetween resources (including ones based on \"similarity of dictionarydefinitions\" or \"cross-lingual links\").  Its maintainers have made availablevarious databases adhering to the UBY spec; these contain a variety oflexical-semantic resources which have been", "aligned with a variety of differentmethods.  A given UBY database can be *queried* for synsets, but UBY itselfdoes not *generate* those synsets.  Users are free to produce their owndatabases by importing whatever lexical-semantic resources and alignmentsthereof are best suited to their purposes.  The three criticisms of UBY onlines 120 to 125 are therefore entirely misplaced.In fact, I think at least one of the criticisms is not appropriate even withrespect to BabelNet.  The authors claim that Watset may be superior to BabelNetbecause BabelNet's mapping and use of machine translation are error-prone.  Theimplication here is that Watset's method is error-free, or at leastsignificantly less error-prone.

Also, I think the third criticism (BabelNet'srelianceon WordNet as a pivot) somewhat misses the point -- surely the most importantissue to highlight isn't the fact that the pivot is English, but rather thatits synsets are already manually sense-annotated.I think the last paragraph of \u00a71 and the first two paragraphs of \u00a72 should beextensively revised. They should focus on the *general* problem of generatingsynsets by sense-level alignment/translation of LSRs (see Gurevych et al., 2016for a survey), rather than particularly on BabelNet (which uses certainparticular methods) and UBY (which doesn't", "use any particular methods, but canaggregate the results of existing ones).  It may be helpful to point outsomewhere that although alignment/translation methods *can* be used to producesynsets or to enrich existing ones, that's not always an explicit goal of theprocess.  Sometimes it's just a serendipitous (if noisy) side-effect ofaligning/translating resources with differing granularities.Finally, at several points in the paper (lines 153, 433), the \"synsets\" of TWSIof JoBimText are criticized for including too many words that are hypernyms,co-hypnomyms, etc. instead of synonyms.  But is this problem really unique toTWSI and JoBimText?  That is, how often do hypernyms, co-hypernyms, etc. appearin the output of Watset?

Most prior work uses hand-crafted rules or template-based systems to build such dialogue managers. However, manually constructing such rules is labor-intensive and hard to scale. Knowledge graph embedding techniques have recently achieved promising results on numerous NLP tasks, and we adopt this technique to facilitate knowledge graph embedding of dialogue manager rules.

The modeling paradigm seems appropriate for the domain, and the results are intriguing. My primary concern is about the applicability of the model to code generation. The model consists of a decoders followed by a small number of generative Adversarial Networks (GANs). The performance benefit of such a reduced model comes at the cost of generalizability: The system seems extremely dependent on the small number of specific examples that were used during training. It would be difficult to use the model without also training on similar examples. One approach to this challenge might be to collect a larger code corpus from the domain and then use transfer learning to apply the model to new code. Another approach", "would be to add more training examples during generation, by leveraging the dependency of the model and training examples on each other.

Finally, there is a concern about the external validity of the results, given the use of datasets from an information retrieval domain. There is nothing to suggest that the results will generalize beyond these datasets.

Applicability to code generation: We have made some changes in the model and the experiments. Please see our updated version here: https://github.com/bole/NSGCodeGen. We find this model can be applied to code generation, but it needs further exploration. The generated result is related to the meaning of the question in training set. 2. Generalizability: We now show more model generalization. The code generation result contains the root cause of the original question.

Guided by the actual Python grammar, the modelgenerates tree nodes sequentially in a depth-first fashion. Key ideas includeinjecting the information from the parent node as part of the LSTM input, apointer network for copying the terminals, and unary closure which collapseschains of unary productions to reduce the tree size. The model is evaluated onthree datasets from different domains and outperforms almost all previous work.Strengths:The paper is overall very well-written. The explanation of system is clear, andthe analysis is thorough.The system itself is a natural extension of various ideas. The most similarwork include tree-based generation with parent feeding (Dong and Lapata, 2016)and various RNN-based semantic parsing with copy mechanism (Jia andLiang, 2016; Ling et al.,", "2016).

To evaluate if the knowledge learned from Group A also benefit Group B, how about using Group B as a validation set to monitor the training process? 2.

If the model is a transformer-based one, such as XLNet and GPT-4, why didn't you also apply it here? It could generate better results than previous methods as a pioneering work. 3. In the \"Warm-up-free training\" section, the MT ground truth is collected before and after each epoch, and the gradient difference is used as a \"proxy\" for how well the model is trained. This method may trigger a concern that the accuracy of model checkpoint is not trustworthy because it may include non-epoch-related factors. How do you ensure that the accuracy is not inflated? To ensure that the accuracy is not inflated, we can double check that the loss", "curves on the validation set are stable. We can also calculate the accuracy on the validation set at the end of each epoch. If the accuracy on the validation set doesn't increase significantly, we can consider the model is well trained. 4. Is there a way to reduce the influence of synonyms and corrupted phrases on the accuracy of model? As the answer to the question 1, how to design a better validation set? Synonym/corrupted phrases extraction algorithm could be a possible solution. 5. The hyperparameter tuning is done on Group A, and the final model is evaluated on Group B.

The organization that Irealized after reading is that there are two problems: 1) shared features endup in the private feature space, and 2) private features end up in the shared space. There is one novel method for each problem. That organization upfront would make the methods more cohesive. In any case, they introduce one method that keeps task-specific features out of shared representation(adversarialloss) and another to keep shared", "features out of task-specific representations(orthogonality constraints).

The main issue is that the paper only provides results for a small number of images and words. It would be nice to see how the method performs on a larger number of images and words, to see how well it generalizes. A more significant issue is that the code is not made available to the scientific community. This prevents other researchers from verifying and extending the findings.

The obtained meanings are approximations, and not the exact meanings. The method makes a single pass over the images and words, and all the analysis happens in the background.

I agree with the comment wrt cross-modal mapping. What I don'tshare is the kind of equation \"visual = referential\" that you seem to assume. Areferent can be visually presented, but visual information can be usefullyadded to a word's representation in aggregate form to encode perceptual aspectsof the words' meaning, the same way that it is done for textual information;for instance, the fact that bananas are yellowwill not frequently be mentioned in text, and adding visual informationextracted from images will account for this aspect of the semanticrepresentation of the word. This is kind of technical and specific to how webuild distributional models, but it's also relevant if you think of humancognition (probably our representation for \"banana\"", "has some aggregateinformation about all the bananas we've seen --and touched, tasted, etc.). It would be useful if you could discuss this issue explicitly, differentiatingbetween multi-modal distributional semantics in general and the use ofcross-modal mapping in particular.Also, wrt the \"all models perform similarly\" comment: I reallyurge you, if the paper is accepted, to state it in this form, even if itdoesn't completely align with your hypotheses/goals (you have enough resultsthat do). It is a better description of the results, and more useful for thecommunity, than clinging to then-th digit difference (and this is to a large extent independent of whether thedifferenceis actually statistical significant or not: If one bridge has 49% chances ofcollapsing and another one 50%, the difference may be statisticallysignificant, but that doesn't really make the", "first bridge a better bridge towalk on).Btw, small quibble, could you find a kind of more compact and to the pointtitle? (More geared towards either generally what you explore or to what youfind?)----------The paper tackles an extremely interesting issue, that the authors label\"referential word meaning\", namely, the connection between a word's meaning andthe referents (objects in the external world) it is applied to. If I understoodit correctly, they argue thatthis is different from a typical word meaning representation as obtained e.g.with distributionalmethods, because one thing is the abstract \"lexical meaning\" of a word and theother which label is appropriate for a given referent with specific properties(in a specific context, although context is something they explicitly leaveaside in this paper). This hypothesis has been previously explored in work bySchlangen", "and colleagues (cited in the paper). The paper explores referentialword meaning empirically on a specific version of the task of ReferentialExpression Generation (REG), namely, generating the appropriate noun for agiven visually represented object.- Strengths:1) The problem they tackle I find extremely interesting; as they argue, REG isa problem that had previously been addressed mainly using symbolic methods,that did not easily allow for an exploration of how speakers choose the namesof the objects. The scope of the research goes beyond REG as such, as itaddresses the link between semantic representations and reference more broadly.2) I also like how they use current techniques and datasets (cross-modalmapping and word classifiers, the ReferIt dataset containing large amounts ofimages with human-generated referring expressions) to address the problem athand. 3) There are a substantial", "number of experiments as well as analysis into theresults. - Weaknesses:1) The main weakness for me is the statement of the specific hypothesis, withinthe general research line, that the paper is probing: I found it veryconfusing.  As a result, it is also hard to make sense of the kind of feedbackthat the results give to the initial hypothesis, especially because there are alot of them and they don't all point in the same direction.The paper says:\"This paper pursues the hypothesis that an accuratemodel of referential word meaning does notneed to fully integrate visual and lexical knowledge(e.g. as expressed in a distributional vectorspace), but at the same time, has to go beyondtreating words as independent labels.\"The first part of the hypothesis I don't understand: What is it to", "fullyintegrate (or not to fully integrate) visual and lexical knowledge? Is the goalsimply to show that using generic distributional representation yields worseresults than using specific, word-adapted classifiers trained on the dataset?If so, then the authors should explicitly discuss the bounds of what they areshowing: Specifically, word classifiers must be trained on the dataset itselfand only word classifiers with a sufficient amount of items in the dataset canbe obtained, whereas word vectors are available for many other words and areobtained from an independent source (even if the cross-modal mapping itself istrained on the dataset); moreover, they use the simplest Ridge Regression,instead of the best method from Lazaridou et al. 2014, so any conclusion as towhich method is better should be taken with a grain of salt. However, I'mhoping that", "the research goal is both more constructive and broader. Pleaseclarify. 2) The paper uses three previously developed methods on a previously availabledataset. The problem itself has been defined before (in Schlangen et al.). Inthis sense, the originality of the paper is not high. 3) As the paper itself also points out, the authors select a very limitedsubset of the ReferIt dataset, with quite a small vocabulary (159 words). I'mnot even sure why they limited it this way (see detailed comments below).4) Some aspects could have been clearer (see detailed comments).5) The paper contains many empirical results and analyses, and it makes aconcerted effort to put them together; but I still found it difficult to getthe whole picture: What is it exactly that the experiments in the paper tell", "usabout the underlying research question in general, and the specific hypothesistested in particular?

The idea of local coherence is novel and could be potentially useful. One problem with the proposed model is that the local coherence metric is computed from the average of the words in the local context, so it's vulnerable to the frequencies of the words. For example, if the word \"the\" is very common, then the average word frequency in most sentences would be very high, and the local coherence metric would skew high. Please consider using the negative variance of the word vectors to measure the local coherence. Another potential problem is that the model is very slow. As the paper mentions, the NLV needs to calculate the average of all the", "sentences in the corpus to get the global context vector. The global context vector is then used to calculate the local coherence. This double aggregation could be expensive. You might want to consider using sub-sampling to reduce the computational load. Nevertheless, the model is promising, and it has potential to become a useful tool in NLP.

This paper presents a neural local coherence (NLC) model, which takes a word and its surrounding words in a sentence as input, and produces the local coherence for the word. The NLC model consists of two neural networks, one for local context vector generation and the other for local coherence calculation. The first network takes the word and the immediately preceding word as input, and the second network takes the word and the average of the immediately preceding and following words as input. The local coherence calculation is", "based on the dot product of the local context vector and the global context vector. The experimental results on two datasets show that the NLC model achieves the correlation of over 0.95 for the local coherence compared to the human judgements, which shows that local coherence can be effectively captured by the NLC model. Limitations: The NLC model is tested on two datasets, where the first one is a news subcollection from Wall Street Journal, which contains many declarative sentences, and the second is the newest and popular Wikipedia sections dump, which contains many phrases with complex syntax. The NLC model may not perform well on other text samples. Potential uses: The NLC model could be potentially used in applications that require computing local coherence, such as text", "prosody and text summarization, by using the local coherence as an input along with other contextual text features (e.g., sentence coherence). Generalization: The NLC model could be further extended to compute other forms of local coherence (e.g., local-complementary). Thoughts: The work makes a novel contribution to the field of text mining by introducing the concept of local coherence and presenting the first try to compute the local coherence using a neural network. The NLC model is theoretically interesting and potentially useful. Nonetheless, the NLC model has several limitations such as the complex text such as phrases and syntax might hurt the performance, the local-contexts and global-contexts are computed based on the average which is not very robust, and the computational cost is too high.

We aren'treally told what the positive contribution will be except for the very generalfinal paragraph of the section.* Extending the above, I found it disappointing that the paper isn't reallyclear about the theory of causation being assumed.

Co-reference resolution was performed to identify instances of direct reference between entities, where one entity directly refers to another. 5. Agreement between automated methods and human reviewers was calculated. 6. The errors in co-reference resolution were classified, with a focus on errors that affect the semantics of the text, such as inadequate resolution, lexical ambiguity, and scope errors. 7.

I can imagine many times where documents revolve primarily around a particularentity (biographical documents, dossiers or briefings about a person or event,clinical records, etc.) and where the information we care about extracting isspecific to that entity.

Doing coreference directly on Wikipedia also opens thedoors for more interesting use of knowledge, which the authors illustrate here.So I think this domain is likely to be an interesting testbed for ideas whichwould improve coreference overall, but which in the general setting would bemore difficult to get robust improvements with and which would be dwarfed bythe amount of work dealing with other aspects of the problem.Moreover, unlike past work", "which has carved off a slice of coreference (e.g.the Winograd schema work), this paper makes a big impact on the metrics of the*overall* coreference problem on a domain (Wikipedia) that many in the ACLcommunity are pretty interested in.THE TECHNIQUES: Overall, the techniques are not the strong point of this paper,though they do seem to be effective.

The traditional topic models, like LDA, use the word-level top keywords to represent a sentence, while there is no correlation between the topic and words. To this end, one potential solution is word representation via word2vec, which maps each word to a vector, and then a document is a aggregated vector of all words. Thus, we can get more semantic information from the word level to the document level. This aggregation procedure is called bag of words (BoW). However, this approach is still limited in representation, because the semantic information in each word is lost. To address this issue, this paper introduces a novel method to combine the advantages of both", "word2vec and topic models. Specifically, we generate a lexicon from the topic model according to the semantic information, and then propose to use both the words with corresponding IDs (word level) and their corresponding vectors (topic level) to represent a sentence. Experiments on two public datasets show the effectiveness of the proposed method. This paper presents a method to generate a lexicon from the topic model to improve the representation ability of the traditional topic models. It improves the LDA model by using the combination of word2vec and the traditional topic model. The main contributions of this paper are as following: 1.The method uses the combination of word2vec and the traditional topic model to generate a lexicon which makes the topic model to improve the representation ability of", "the lexicon. 2.The method shows the limitation of the traditional topic model and the advantage of combining with word2vec. 3.The method uses a fine-grained classification algorithm to generate the lexicon, which is simple, effective and efficient.

What is the relative merits of different SPaG systems (for example, could new unsupervised methods outperform the supervised learning-based approach shown in the paper?) 2.

It would be also interesting to evaluate the parsing results by comparison to other parsers for predicate, modifier, and other relations. Second, it would be interesting to present parsing results on a wider range of data sets, such as those in the Parsing Fortress competition. The data sets in Parsing Fortress are designed for testing PPDP parsers and have complex syntactic structures. Although the current approach can parse data sets in different formats, there are some limitations in the evaluation metrics. The BLEU score is computed over the results returned by the parser, but it does not consider the ordering and overlapping of predicted sentence fragments. For example, if a sentence contains multiple entities and the predicted fragments are overlapping, the overlapping parts might be regarded as a higher BLEU score. Another example is when two sentence fragments are semantically and syntactically related but their ordering is incorrect. It is difficult for a human to judge the correctness of such ordering.

Verbs+particules). Interestingly, none of these principles is tied to asemantic framework, they could also work for syntax or other representationlayers. The authors quickly position their work by first introducing the largercontext of broad-coverage semantic parsing then their annotation scheme ofchoice (UCCA).

Of course, they are.

Even the transitions related to the remote edges could havebeen handled by the other ones assuming a difference in the label set itself(like adding an affix for example). If we restrict the problem to graphparsing, many works post the 2014-2015 semeval shared tasks (Almeda andMartins, 2014,2015 ; Ribeyre et al, 2014-2015) proposed an extension totransition-based graph parser or an adaptation of a higher-model one, andnothing precludes their use on this data set.  It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s mostly the use of aspecific feature template that anchors this model to this scheme (even thoughit\u00e2\u0080\u0099s less influencial than the count features and the unigram one). Anyway,because the above-mentioned graph-parsers are available [1,2] I don\u00e2\u0080\u0099tunderstand why they couldn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t be used as a baseline or source of comparisons.Regarding the phrase-based  experiments using uparse,", "it could have been alsovalidated by another parser from Fernandez-Gonzales and Martins (2015) whichcan produce LCFRS-like parsing as good as Uparse (ref missing when you firstintroduced uparse).

In summary, I think the work described in this paper is interesting and has achieved good", "performance on the TFL dataset. I suggest addressing the following points to further improve the quality of the paper. First, it would be good to show an example of what the model learns to link together. There are some sentences in the TFL dataset about the events that occur in the game between Chelsea and Leicester City, for example, the following: - \u201cChelsea won the game, their fourth consecutive win of the season\" - \u201cLeicester City won the game, their first defeat of the season\" In this case, the model should be able to link these sentences to conclude that Leicester City won the game. Therefore, I suggest including an example like this in the paper. Second, it is good to have a discussion on the limitations of", "the current model. In particular, the event linking problem is related to entity disambiguation, and some event pairs may not be linked correctly because of the ambiguity of the event names. For example, the model may link \u201cChelsea won the game\u201d and \u201cLeicester City won the game\" to say that both Chelsea and Leicester City won the game, which is incorrect. I suggest including this as a limitation of the current model. Third, it is good to show some examples of predictions.

What are some effective methods to improve the training stability? I am curious about how much money the model can make. Can we use money as the rewards and train a model that can generate money?

Is it because of the computation cost? If so, I suggest to also report the results with a 2-layer MLP as the baseline. 2- In the first line of Table 1, it is said that the baseline model converges in around 25M steps, but in the text, it is mentioned that the training data for the baseline model is generated from the trained neural network model. Does it mean that the baseline model needs more", "than 25M iterations to converge? In this case, I think it is not fair to compare with the trained neural network model, since the trained model is already optimized. 3- In the second line of Table 1, the score of the 1-layer MLP is incorrect, it should be 0.40 instead of 0.75. 4- The performance of the trained single layer neural network seems very high. Is it really zero-shot, i.e., the model has never seen any observation except for the last one?

On the one hand, the updated experiments on KTH confirm the good results of the method in these conditions. On the other hand, the fact that this baseline is better than all other methods (not just the authors's) on UCF101 casts some doubts on whether reporting average statistics on UCF101 is insightful enough.

Prior work has relied on linear regression but neural networks can offer the flexibility to model non-linear relationships. Neural network models have proven to be effective in industry but are hard to apply to complex production", "use cases. In this paper, we present a model to identify an optimal number of users for a new feature based on the results of a small number of users. The model uses Bayesian neural networks to build a prediction model using features derived from prior use of the feature. We show how to calculate and interpret the predicted number of users for a new feature based on our prediction model. We demonstrate how to use our model to provide insight into the impact of changes to a product by using it to predict the number of users for a new version of a product feature. We use a dataset of 205 user sessions to train the model and evaluate its effectiveness on 153 user sessions. The model", "allows us to determine that there may not be a significant change in number of users for some features, while for others, there is a clear increase or decrease in the number of users. In particular, we show how the model can identify that a change to an onboarding experience from a wizard to a wizard-less experience resulted in the loss of 35% of the users. Keywords: Bayesian, Neural Network, User Experience, Web-based Experimentation ## Introduction User experience (UX) is a key driver of customer satisfaction and retention, and affects key metrics such as conversion rate, customer retention, and employee productivity. Companies can achieve higher customer retention, employee productivity, and customer conversion rates by improving the UX of their products and services. However, UX research and development is", "expensive and challenging. Most companies can only afford to conduct small experiments with a limited number of users. Large-scale, accurate model-based UX experimentation is therefore essential to quickly and inexpensively evaluate the impact of UX changes on a wider number of users. In this paper, we present a model that can help UX researchers estimate the impact of UX changes by predicting the number of users for a new version of a product feature. We propose that the model will be able to provide a quantitative prediction, and present how the results can be used to determine the direction and magnitude of the impact on users. In addition to predicting the number of users for a new version of a product, we show how this model can be", "of our model on a real UX feature (user onboarding) by showing that it can identify whether a change to an onboarding experience resulted in an increase or decrease in number of users. To validate the model, we tested it on 153 user sessions with a significantly different mean than the original 205 user sessions used to train the model.

Abstract: This paper presents a compositional object-based approach to learning physical dynamics. We consider learning dynamics from data through composition of objects formed from composing primitives. Each primitive produces a system dynamics object that is used to build more complex systems. We show how to use unrolling to approximate the dynamics of the composed objects. This allows us to make use of a large body of prior knowledge about how these primitives compose to allow for fast and efficient", "learning of dynamics from unlabeled data. We show that this approach can be applied to learning both kinematics and dynamics. In experiments on mechanical systems we show that our model can accurately learn the dynamics from past inputs alone, and with only a few samples from each training sequence our model generalizes to unseen scenarios. Significance: This paper is the first to tackle the challenge of learning dynamics from past inputs alone. It uses a compositional object-based approach to learning physical dynamics. This work extends recent work on learning dynamical systems from unrolling NARX models, by considering learning from data through composition of physical objects and unrolling only a small number of compositions to achieve accurate results.

The NPE takes as input the state of pairs of objects (within a neighbourhood of a focus object) at two previous time-steps in a scene.

Energy-based GANs autoregressive energy-based GAN (AE-GAN) Learning the Distribution of Generation Daniel Kim, Sungjoon Kim, Sungwoo Cho, Youngcheol Shin, and Jonghoon Yun In Proceedings of the 33rd International Conference on Machine Learning (MLSummer 2017) Many real-world applications require generating samples that follow a predefined distribution. For example, images need to be generated such that they follow a desired probability distribution, and music samples need to follow a predefined stylistic rules. While there have been some research addressing the problem of mode collapse in GANs by using the Wasserstein distance between the distribution of real and generated samples, it is hard", "to estimate the distance between arbitrary distributions. In this paper, we propose autoregressive energy-based GAN (AE-GAN), which uses an energy-based model to parameterize the distribution of generated samples. This allows us to estimate the distance between arbitrary distributions. We evaluate the performance of AE-GAN on two distribution matching tasks, image and music generations. We also study the relation between our approach and the recent progress in data-driven distribution alignment. Learning the Distribution of Generation In this work, we propose a generative model called AE-GAN that uses an energy-based model to parameterize the distribution of generated samples. We minimize the distance between the energy-based model and an expected energy model, which is also trained using energy-based generative models. This allows us to estimate the distance between arbitrary distributions, which"], "human_text": ["The submission explores several alternatives to provide the generator function in generative adversarial training with additional gradient information. The exposition starts by describing a general formulation about how this additional gradient information (termed K(p_gen) could be added to the generative adversarial training objective function (Equation 1). Next, the authors prove that the shape of the optimal discriminator does indeed depend on the added gradient information (Proposition 3.1), which is unsurprising. Finally, the authors propose three particular alternatives to construct K(p_gen): the negative entropy of the generator distribution, the L2 norm of the generator distribution, and a constant function (which resembles the EBGAN objective of Zhao et al, 2016).The exposition moves then to an experimental evaluation of the method, which sets K(p_gen) to be the approximate entropy of the", "generator distribution. At this point, my intuition is that the objective function under study is the vanilla GAN objective, plus a regularization term that encourages diversity (high entropy) in the generator distribution. The hope of the authors is that this regularization will transform the discriminator into an estimate of the energy landscape of the data distribution.The experimental evaluation proceeds by 1) showing the contour plots of the obtained generator distribution for a 2D problem, 2) studying the generation diversity in MNIST digits, and 3) showing some samples for CIFAR-10 and CelebA. The 2D problem results are convincing, since one can clearly observe that the discriminator scores translate into unnormalized values of the density function.

The basic premise of the layer is to replace the fully-connected layer in a standard neural network with a mixture of simpler, more explainable, layers. In the layer, each of the simple layers is a multi-layer perceptron, which itself is a composition of linear transformations and a non-linearity. The authors add an additional non-linearity on top of this structure to the mix, which sparsely activates a small subset of the units in the simple layer. This subset of", "activations models the underlying concept that the data is well-modelled by a combination of few, well-behaving, co-occurring pattern of dimensions in the input space. The method only works well when the true underlying model is composed of a small number of well-behaved patterns. In practice, models have many such patterns, some of which are accidentally correlated with each other. The model essentially fails to activate the dimensions which are not well-behaved (or poorly-behaved). However, it is hard to find these disaligned dimensions a priori. In the second part of the layer, the authors adopt a sparse version of the gating mechanism from the GATE network to select a subset of the non-active dimensions from the previous layer. They observe that in practice, some dimensions are always inactive due", "alternative activation functions, which can make the paths shorter without hurting sparsity. The model achieves state-of-the-art results with very few parameters. However, because of the long paths in the sparsely-gated mixture-of-departments layer, I do not think the model can be effectively pruned with traditional techniques.

I could be wrong about this as I haven't done the comparison myself, but I think the burden is on the authors to demonstrate that using ML here is actually useful.I would argue that one of the strenghts of the dataset is the variety of label information it provides, so a much more convincing setup would have been to demonstrate many", "different prediction tasks for both low-level (e.g. pitch, onsets) and high-level (e.g. composer) characteristics, perhaps with fewer and simpler models -- maybe even sticking to spectrogram input and forgoing raw audio input for the time being, as this comparison seems orthogonal to the introduction of the dataset itself. As it stands, I feel that the fact that the experiments are relatively uninteresting detracts from the main point of the paper, which is to introduce a new public dataset that is truly unique in terms of its scale and scope.That said, the experiments seem to have been conducted in a rigorous fashion and the evaluation and analysis of the resulting models is properly executed.Re: Section 4.5, it is rather unsurprising to me that a pitch detector would learn filters"], "model": "dolly-v2", "source": "PeerRead/iclr_2017/", "source_ID": 409.0}

For example, the kernel size can be set to a larger size, and the number of sigmoid functions in the gating function can be set to 2.

I appreciate you sharing the work with me. I have identified a number of points that need further clarification to ensure the scientific integrity of the work. 1) Regarding the meaning of the term \"prediction difference\". A prediction difference is the difference between an ensemble\u2019s prediction and the mean of the individual models' predictions. This is an important and interesting metric. However, the term \"prediction difference\" is often used in the research community to refer to a specific type of metric. This metric is computed by taking the difference between the ensemble\u2019s prediction and the prediction of each of the individual models in the ensemble. However, in the research community this", "difference is often called the \"holdout deviation\" and is computed as the difference between the ensemble\u2019s prediction and the prediction of the individual model for the same model on the same training data that was used to train the ensemble. For example, if model A has been trained on 90% of the data and the ensemble is trained on 80% of the data, then the holdout deviation of the ensemble is computed as the prediction of the ensemble (which is computed by taking the average of the individual models' predictions) minus the prediction of model A, which is the model A prediction computed using 90% of the data. The term \"prediction difference\" as used in your work refers to the first type of metric and not the second", "type of metric. I think it is important to be clear about what type of metric each terminology is referring to in your paper. 2) I was unclear about how the figures in the body of the paper were generated. The bar charts in Fig 1 show the values of the various bins of the predicted distributions for the DOTA and German Rugby data sets. It would be useful to include a description of how these bar charts were generated. Additionally, it would be useful to provide a sample of how to generate these charts. For example, a complete example of how to build these charts using the predictions of an ensemble could be included in the paper. 3) I was unable to reproduce the result in Table", "1. The results in Table 1 seem to contradict the results in the body of the paper. The figure in the last column of the table shows that on the German Rugby data set the prediction difference for the two most-commonly-occurring classes are very different in sign. However, in the corresponding paragraph in the body of the paper it is only claimed that the prediction difference for all classes is not equal to 0 in any direction. The table and the paragraph seem to be describing different situations. Table 1 describes the absolute value of the prediction difference for each bin, while the paragraph in the body of the paper describes the difference between the predictions for two individual models and the ensemble prediction for the two models,", "with the sign determined by whether the ensemble prediction for the two models is closer to the first model's prediction or the second model's prediction. 4) I was unable to reproduce the results in Figures 2 and 3. I was also unable to reproduce the results in Figures 2 and 3. The legend for Figure 3 claims that the y-axis shows the prediction difference, but in fact the figure shows the absolute value of the prediction difference. This is important, because it means that the y-axis in the figure has an inverted scale. I also think that it would be easier to reproduce and understand this figure if the axis labels showed the value of the prediction difference for each bin. 5) I was unable to reproduce the"], "human_text": ["The authors of this work propose an interesting approach to visualizing the predictions made by a deep neural network.

I cannot judge the applicability to the paper, because I do not know the application context. However, I can clearly see that the proposed model and algorithm have lots of potential to be improved. First, please clarify what are the application scenarios of your model. The application context would directly affect the choice of model architecture, e.g, hierarchical vs non-hierarchical structure. Moreover, you mentioned seq2seq structure, but did not elaborate on how the encoder and decoder are designed. Please clarify the mentioned model architecture in the paper (e.g., LSTM-based encoder and decoder). Second, the choice of representation is a very important aspect in NLP. Your paper only focuses on the architecture choice, but not on the selection of representation (e.g., BERT, Glove, etc). For example, comparing with BERT, which context information will be incorporated in your model? The applicability of the model to real world applications needs to be carefully examined. Third, one common drawback of the neural network based model is the black box nature. There are some standard evaluation tasks to evaluate the effectiveness of the model, e.g., BLEU and ROUGE. It would be better if you could introduce some parts of the model and the evaluation metric into the paper. Despite the mentioned limitations, I still think the proposed model is promising and worthy of publication.

A particular feature of this approach is that the decomposition is not static, instead, it also conditions on the acoustic input, and the mapping is probabilistic, i.e., one word may map to multiple sub-word sequences. The authors argue that the dynamic decomposition approach can more naturally reflect the acoustic pattern. Interestingly, the motivation behind this approach is analogous to learning the pronunciation mixture model for HMM based speech recognition, where the probabilistic mapping from a word to its pronunciations also conditions on the acoustic input, e.g.,I.

The experimental study could be more solid, e.g., it is reasonable to have a word-level baseline, as the proposed approach lies in between the character-level and word-level systems. the vocabulary size of the WSJ si284 dataset is 20K at maximum, which is not very large for the softmax layer, and", "in this paper.

Table 2 is a little bit misleading, as CTC with language model and seq2seq with a language model model from Bahdanau et al. is much closer to the best number reported in this Table 2, while you may only get a very small improvement using a language model.

The stochastic dynamical systems are often simulated with Bayesian neural networks, so the paper incorporates a framework to use policy search to evaluate policies that generate simulated trajectories. The framework is illustrated on a case study of active airsampling for airborne disease transmission, using a dataset of released mice colony counts as the observation state. The evaluation is done by simulating trajectories with random initial conditions, running the evaluated policies, and comparing the simulated trajectory to the observed trajectory with a distance metric based on the Bayesian policy entropy. A strength of this approach is that it can be applied to policies that generate random", "initial conditions, instead of starting at specific points in state space, which improves the usefulness of the evaluation for understanding how well a policy searches the state space. Another strength is that the framework is generally applicable to evaluate policies with any simulator, not just those that are fit for purpose with a Bayesian neural network. There are some weaknesses with the case study, such as the length of the simulation time, which is only 14 days, and the simplicity of the simulator, which assumes constant probability of infection from exposure and no unmodeled dynamics. Nevertheless, this is an interesting attempt to apply policy search to evaluate a potential control for an environmental health threat, and the results are quite surprising given the low-dimensional state space and limited", "simulation time. Here are my comments and questions: 1. What are the advantages of using a Bayesian neural network to simulate the dynamical system compared to other approaches you could use, such as Autoencoded Bayesian networks? In the Stochastic Dynamical Systems with Bayesian Neural Networks paper, the simulation dynamics are modeled as a Bayesian neural network with random initial conditions and dataset-specific weights, which can be trained using samples from a baseline simulation with typical parameters. This approach has the advantage that the simulation can be trained with minimal user input, except for the policy you want to evaluate, which is any policy that can generate simulated trajectories. In contrast, if the simulation is fit-for-purpose with an Autoencoded Bayesian network, the user would have to provide the simulation", "with a set of weights for the Autoencoder, which would likely be a much larger change to the simulation than using a policy search algorithm to evaluate a new policy. The Autoencoder would need to be trained on lots of simulated trajectories generated with the baseline parameters, which could be slow and prone to human error, whereas using a policy search algorithm to evaluate a new policy would allow the simulation to be trained quickly with only a small set of representative policies. 2. In the simulation of the mice colony counts, why not use the observed colony count as an approximation of the state? Why use the actual number of mice that were caught in traps? The mice colony count data contains both the number of live", "mice caught by the traps and the number that died before being caught, which makes it suitable for use as an observation state for this simulation. However, using the number of live mice caught would be similar to using the simulated values in this case, because the live and dead mice would likely have similar dynamics and the number of live mice is the one aspect of the simulation that is easily observable. On the other hand, it would not make sense to use the number of dead mice, because the number of dead mice is not a direct cause of the mice colony count.

I am expert in the field. I recommend for publication in the conference with minor revisions. Best, Recent PhD sections I would like to introduce my perspective on the paper and highlight some challenges and opportunities that I see in the field of Neural Computation. Abstract The main idea presented in the paper is very nice. One can think of many real-world problems that can be formulated as continual prediction problems. In such cases, Neural Computation approach can be used to learn the mapping from the inputs to the outputs at different time-steps in a sequential manner. The paper starts with simpler setting where the outputs are simply computed by a linear transformation of the previous", "states. The general idea is to allow computation of the output at each time-step to depend on the previous output and states, as well as potentially some additional private parameters of the function. The idea has numerous advantages over simply using a fixed non-linearity on the input to the function and hence has a lot of potential to improve the performance of the models for a range of problems. However, there are several challenges one needs to be aware of when using this approach in practice. 1. Setting the initial state to a fixed random vector will not work in many scenarios. It may work sometimes, but the performance will vary a lot from run to run. One needs to use a better scheme to ensure that the", "model consistently reaches a fixed point. It might even be necessary to use multiple starting points and combine the results from different runs 2. The paper uses the term \"Training Loss\" to refer to the loss used for training the model. This is typically not the right metric because the actual computation is not deterministic and hence the training might result in divergent models with different initialization. It might be better to use a combination of empirical loss and point-wise convergence (e.g. using the expectation over the different runs to compute the loss) to ensure that the model trains to the right parameters 3. One of the important benefits of allowing the model to compute the output as a function of the previous state and input is that", "it can use the historical information to quickly adapt to changes in the environment. However, this requires maintaining an explicit state, which might be very difficult in continuous settings 4. Many models that need this kind of flexibility also need to work with other model engineers who can often only operate in the \"old\" style, which means needing access to the full function state. In some cases, this might require designing the model in a way that it exposes the full state in memory (and hence slower). In some cases, it might be possible to split the state into a structure that can be kept in memory and a part that is computed on-the-fly, but that will add additional steps in the code. Overall, this makes it difficult", "to provide the flexibility the model would like to have. Despite the challenges, I do think this is an interesting idea and there might be a lot of applications for it. As an example of a use case, I could imagine this being very useful for training text generation models that need to generate sentences with different content and purpose based on the context. Overall, I think the paper is well-written with clear and intuitive explanation and makes an important observation. There are several ways to improve the model to make it more stable and less sensitive to the specific initialization, and hence it could have a broad applicability. I look forward to seeing more work in this area. Paper Overall, the model architecture is clear and I", "covariance matrix and the cost function in the optimization) 3.

But in the case of Text Style Transfer, the generated sample may be a new text style that is quite different from the original style. So the method of comparing the similarity should be revised.

It would have been much more interesting if part of the hidden code was a categorical distribution and another part of it was a continuous distribution like Gaussian, and the inference network on the categorical latent variable was used directly for classification (like semi-supervised VAE).

All the best, Jeff Date: 2022-05-01 Reviewer: Dr. Jorge Cham, Research Scientist General comments: This is an interesting and well written paper addressing a very timely topic: the use of reinforcement learning to teach low level tasks. This work combines a state-of-the-art sequence to sequence model with an effective reinforcement learning scheme to generate sequences of words that can be fed into a simple story-generation model. The model is trained on a simple benchmark dataset, the MCTest, and after one hundred and fifty hours of training the model is able to generate coherent sentences with a decent amount of specific details. The resulting model is evaluated on the LAMBADA dataset, which is much more challenging and is usually used to", "evaluate machine translation systems. The results show that the model generates decent but not yet perfect translations. However, the most interesting result is the positive reinforcement learning algorithm is able to generate grammatical sentences from the most basic form of instructions: a list of words. This is very surprising as most existing work on the topic focus on the automatic segmentation and generation of sentences from logical arguments, and the generation of complete, grammatical and syntactically correct sentences requires a compositional semantics and complex high-level syntactic structure. The results of the present model suggest that it is possible to teach a model a low-level task (composing sentences from words) without requiring high-level understanding of the syntax or semantic. This result is more than promising and can have many", "applications in areas such as education or text generation. In education, the model can be used to create textbooks for very specific topics, sentences from these texts can be provided to students as input and the students have to write down the sentences themselves. Alternatively, sentences generated by the model could be the output of a tutoring system and the student have to write the sentences based on the hints given by the system. In text generation, the sentences generated by the model can be used as input to an automatic summarization system or even a chatbot.

Methods The manuscript describes a new adversary, called Adversarial Black-Box (or ABK) which is much more powerful than existing ones. The ABK requires the black-box model to make just one forward and one backward pass to be able to generate (or re-generate) an adversarial example. The construction of the ABK is novel and pretty clever. The ABK is tested on various black-box models (e.g., deepdream, faceNet, LIME) and on a wide range of attacks. The ABK works surprisingly well against all of them and is the most effective black-box adversary ever. The evaluation of the ABK is done in two ways. First, as a black-box attack: Adversarial examples found by the ABK are shown to be transferable across models and", "attacks. Second, as a defense, the ABK is used to generate defenses against existing attacks. The defense is excellent. Adversarial examples generated by the ABK on one model do not seem to be transferable to other models. That suggests that the defense based on the ABK has found a natural polymorphism. The performance of the ABK in black-box settings are impressive. To the best of my knowledge, this is the first time that a black-box attack is able to find transferable adversarial examples and defense that are also black-box. Overall, this work has great potential to change the way defense and attacks are analyzed, black-box and white-box. Conclusion The paper is interesting, new and well written.

Furthermore, the number of layers and the number of neurons in each layer are not specified. It is not clear from the text how many transformations (linear projections) the encoder is using and whether the decoder also has the same number of layers and parameters. Without this information, it is not possible to evaluate the efficacy of the approach. 2) The validation set should be used for early stopping.

It would be better to do early stopping on the validation set, and then report the loss on the test set. 3) What is the source of the data? The paper does not mention where the data was generated. Was it produced by a machine? Was it mined from a database? Or was it collected using an optical device? This is important because the source of the data could have a large impact on the nature of the data.

If the data was collected using an optical device, it might have additional geometric properties that can be utilised.

In the 'shift' step, it seems more appropriate to average over the object's member's representations h_j, rather than sum over them.The compression technique presented in Section 2.3 requires that multiple objects at a level have the same representation.

The MLSTM shares a lot of similarities with previous GRUs and LSTMs. It can be regarded as a generalisation of both of them. To some extent, the paper simply provided a more abstract representation of the LSTM model, but from a neural network perspective, it indeed improves the performance.

This demonstrates the potential of the MLSTM. Another interesting point of this paper is that it compares MLSTM with the traditional RNNs (LSTM and GRU), and concludes that multiplicative interaction is a better way to model long-range dependencies. This conclusion is counterintuitive at first. We are used to think that LSTM or GRU outperforms the traditional RNNs on sequence modelling tasks. But this is because the RNNs capture long-range dependencies implicitly by employing a recursion mechanism, i.e.", "using the hidden state from the previous step as the new input. In this sense, the RNNs could \"remember\" long-range dependencies, as the next input can be completely reconstructed from the previous input and the current hidden state. Multiplicative interaction is different from the RNNs in this regard. As the name suggests, multiplicative interaction uses a multiplicative transformation to model interactions. The effect of this transformation is limited. It is not able to completely reconstruct the next input from the previous input and the current hidden state. As a result, it may have difficulties learning long-range dependencies. However, it is a more straight-forward way to model interaction than RNNs, and it avoids some side effects such as gradient vanishing or exploding problems.

Next, the output of this lower-level structure is aggregated across all input pairs via a simple sum.  This is used as the input to a higher-level structure.  In the basic version, these two structures are each multi-layer perceptrons (MLPs).Overall, this is an interesting approach to understanding relations among entities.  The core idea is clear and well-motivated -- pooling techniques that induce invariance can be used to learn relations.  The idea builds on pooling structures (e.g. spatial/temporal average/max pooling) to focus on pairwise relations.  The current pairwise approach could potentially be extended to higher-order interactions, modulo scaling issues.Experiments on scene descriptions and images verify the efficacy of relation networks.  The MLP baselines used are incapable of modeling the structured dependencies present in these tasks.  It would be interesting to know if pooling operators (e.g. across-object max pooling in an MLP) or data augmentation via permutation would be effective for training MLPs at these tasks.

The paper might benefit from including more references to prior work, especially to similar or related techniques that could provide useful comparisons and benchmarks for the technique implemented in this paper. 5.

In practice, it might be more efficient to find the solution using a smaller number of steps, i.e. a smaller delta time, using some global optimization technique. In this respect, using the Gradient Descent Method to optimize the parameters might not be the most efficient method, since this might increase the number of calls to the cost function (i.e. the computational cost) without significantly improving the solution.

Both CKM and convnet use gradient descent during learning, why would CKM be faster?Also during inference, the running time of convnet only depends on its network structure.

The method is indeed an efficient solution to the saddle point problem. In the end, I have some concerns about the computation of the Jacobian. The Jacobian depends on the gradient of the exponential function. This gradient can't be computed in a closed form and would need to be estimated. This would make the method very computation expensive. This concern would be significant for the applications the authors have in mind (for example running VAEs using this method would be difficult). I recommend this paper for publication in MathWorks Report. I have some questions and concerns about the theoretical aspects of the method. 1. From a theoretical perspective, can the authors describe and prove the continuity", "of the proposed method? This is important for the convergence of the method. 2. It would also be important to have a theoretical proof that the normalization constant (which is computed during the iterations) always remain constant (or at least increase slowly). This would ensure that the proposed method always converges. Other comments: The authors use the sigmoid function for the normalization. It would be more consistent to use the softplus function (which can be implemented efficiently using the scaling property of the Softmax function). I have some concerns about the practical application of the method. I think that the authors are right that this method could be used to efficiently compute the maximum a posteriori probability (MAP) estimate.

For example, for the case of variational autoencoder, the authors could use the negative KL divergence (or maybe the KL divergence + prior) between the distribution imposed by", "theVariational parameters and the actual data distribution. This would allow the authors to use the method in practice. Other comments: I don't understand what T in the paper stands for. It would be good if you can define it in the paper. Also, I think the training procedure of the DCNN used in this example could not be trained using this method. In the paper, the authors try to show that the method can be used for MCMC sampling. However, they used a DCNN which has not been trained. The DCNN is first evaluated as a generative model and the generation is compared to the real data. The parameters of the DCNN are then updated and the model now generates \"fake\" data. The authors then apply the proposed", "method to this \"fake\" data and show that it converges to the MAP solution. I think that this procedure can't be used to train a DCNN. In the training procedure, the authors update the DCNN parameters so that the prediction error goes down. In the test phase, I think this error could not be calculated because the DCNN is never trained to minimize it (the DCNN is never presented with the real data).

B GANs, or Generative Adversarial Networks, are a type of artificial intelligence model based on a game process. The goal of the generator G and the discriminator D is to fool the other, while the goal of the discriminator is to detect lies. The generator G and the discriminator D are interplaying with each other through a game process, eventually leading to a state where the generator generates samples that cannot be distinguished from the true data distribution. B GANs achieve this state of statistical equivalence by construction (the generator is trained with the same \"diversity\" constraint as the discriminator), through equilibrium selection (the generator takes a snapshot of the discriminator's behaviour during training), or by the application of restraints", "(e.g. Lov\u00e1sz-$\\gamma$ or Wasserstein metrics). While GANs were first proposed in 2014, they became widely known after 2016 when they were applied to generative modeling and achieved excellent results. b) What is unsupervised domain adaptation? Unsupervised domain adaptation attempts to minimize the differences between the source and target distributions, considering that the target data distribution is unknown. The source and target data may come from different domains, which could represent different geographical locations, different seasons, or different productions. The goal is to train a model that can perform well on the target data, even though no labeled data from the target domain is available. 2. Research questions and problem statement a) Research questions The main goal of this paper is to address the challenges of unsupervised domain adaptation.", "paper, the authors introduced the b-GAN, a method that combines the general GANs model and the batch GANs model.

This provides a theoretical guarantee for the efficacy of the proposed solution. b) Research method First, the framework of the b-GAN is described.

It is not applicable to semi-supervised attack setting. There is a recent paper [1] that attempts to solve the problem in the", "white-box setting for black-box attack. They proposed to use distillable uniqueness property of trained models, which requires model to be trained on GANLoss. The authors also provided a promising solution for semi-supervised attack. However, the code implementation seems not publicly available, which greatly limits the applicability of the work. Recently, two novel metric-based methods that provably solve the gradient reversal attack in white-box setting have been proposed [2, 3]. Both of them use smooth NDA and patch-based distances. One of the advantages of these methods is that they do not require access to the model to train the advisor, thus making it applicable to black-box attack. However, all these methods only works for GANs with real-valued generator. It has not be extended to GANs with generative models such", "as VAEs and GQ. In this paper, we solve the gradient reversal attack for white-box attack in both black-box GANs with real-valued generator and GANs with generative models such as VAEs and GQ. We proposed a novel hyper-parameter $k$ that can significantly accelerate the training of the auxiliary model and make it applicable to real-world datasets. We also provide a novel method to generate adversarial examples using pre-trained generative models. These two improvements make our method work in a more efficient and easier to use way, which is very attractive in real-world security assessment applications.

The commonly used standard convolutions operations do not preserve the group structure of the input. Some operations, such as group convolution, can alleviate this issue, but it is not applicable in some situations. The idea of this paper is to apply two-dimensional domain shift to the standard convolutions so that they become equivariant. Two-dimensional domain shift is a general approach to shift the distribution of the input data from one domain to another. In this case, the shift is applied to the kernel first and then to the activation function. Experiments on CIFAR-10 and Fashion-MNIST datasets show that the proposed method improves the equivariance of", "the standard convolutions without causing over-fitting. The paper is organized as following: In the first part, the background on standard convolutions and two-dimensional domain shift is presented. Then the problem of equivariance of CNNs is explained and the proposed method is shown. In the experiments, the proposed method is compared with the state-of-the-art methods for improving the invariance of CNNs. The last part is the conclusion. + Background Standard convolutions are a technique used in machine learning to perform tasks such as pattern recognition and data classification. The idea behind this method is to first map the data into a high-dimensional vector, and then apply a mapping, or kernel, that looks something like this: $$ k(x, y) = \\varphi(\\mathrm{w}_0 + x \\mathrm{w}_1 + y \\mathrm{w}_2)$$ where $\\varphi$ is", "the activation function (typically linear), $\\mathrm{w}_0, \\mathrm{w}_1, \\mathrm{w}_2$ are the weights and $\\vert x \\vert + \\vert y \\vert \\leq 1$ for all $(x, y) \\in \\mathbb{R}^2$. The values $\\mathrm{w}_0, \\mathrm{w}_1, \\mathrm{w}_2$ and $\\varphi$ are called the parameter of the convolution. There are three main shortcomings of this method. The first is that this mapping assumes that the input data is a product of two dimensions, which is often not the case. For example, in the task of image classification, the input data is typically an image which is a three-dimensional object. The second is that this mapping assumes that the input data is independent from one another, when in reality there is a strong relationship between pixels in an image, for example. The third is that this", "mapping does not preserve the group structure of the input. For example, in the task of image classification, the shift applied to the weights should be the same for all pixels in the same class. The first two shortcomings can be mitigated by the introduction of group convolutions. This approach allows the mapping to look something like this: $$ k(x, y) = \\varphi\\Big(\\sum_{g \\in G} w_{g, 0} g(x) + \\sum_{g \\in G} w_{g, 1} g(y)\\Big)$$ where $G$ is the group, and $w_{g, 0}, w_{g, 1}$ are the weights specific to the group. The problem with this approach is that it requires having multiple copies of the dataset in memory, which may not be possible when dealing with large datasets. Another technique to overcome this issue is two-dimensional domain", "paper addresses the problem of improving the equivariance of CNNs.

The particular form of network architecture with the memory-based fully convolutional adversarial loss appears to be novel and potentially interesting.- Motivation for the Architecture.

Because, almost all deep learning models converge to something \" terrifying \", but indeed very useful and meaningful for the task at hand. \" Surprising \" is also a good word to describe the observations in this paper. 2. Specific case of the Hessian The definition of the induced matrix is not clearly presented. However, I gather that it is the matrix of the linearisations of the", "loss functional about its critical points. If so, this implies, among other things, that the induced matrix is always symmetric. The proposed approach for bounding the eigenvalues of the induced matrix seems correct and very useful.

Second, the paper only compares the proposed method with an existing fully labeled learning method in the experiment. For example, to compare the zero-shot learning method, the fully labeled method should also be evaluated on the zero-shot dataset. In this case, a fairer comparison between the zero-shot learning method and the proposed method can be achieved.

For example, if I am trying to build a model to label a person in a photo, my model needs a lot of examples of both labeled and unlabeled people in photos.

The model needs to have the same amount of labeled attribute-related examples, no matter what dataset it is being trained on. These concerns apply to the paper as written; the code and model look feasible, but I don\u2019t know if this is a practical solution for real-world problems. Another issue is that the model may overfit on the training set, because it is given a lot of easy examples from the generator. To make the model robust, you need", "to give it more varied examples from the generator, that it has to train on by backpropagation.

The model could be trained to generate labeled examples of missing attributes, or it could be trained to generate more diverse samples from the generator.

The assumption is that the number of available attributes in the target dataset is the same as the number of generated attributes. It is often the case that the number of available attributes is much less than the number of generated attributes. This could be handled by limiting the number of generators, and choosing the most commonly-occurring attributes from the target data to generate. 4.

OVERVIEW Lots of layers over Lots of units (LOTS) were proposed to address the notorious problem of over-specialization in neural networks. However, lots of previous work limited to using lots of units in the model or specializing the units according to the task, but never jointly considered lots of layers and lots of units. In contrast to these approaches, we explore lots of layers over lots of units (LOTS), where lots of layers means more training information to help the model generalize better, and lots of units mean fewer specializations and better capacity to fit the model to the data, and therefore better applicability to different tasks. We evaluate our approach in two standard settings of LOTS: depthwise", "separable convolution and transpose convolution. Experimental results on ImageNet classification and COCO object recognition show that our approach achieves superior performance and is more generalizable than existing approaches. ABOUT LOTS Lots of layers over Lots of units (LOTS) has been proposed as a simple yet efficient solution to address the problem of over-specialization in deep neural networks. Typically, a LOTS-unit has fewer parameters than a normal unit, but more layers. The intuition is that lots of layers help the model gain flexibility, while lots of units make the model easier to generalize to different tasks. However, we argue that lots of layers should not be limited to special units. In fact, in lots of previous work, lots of layers were implicitly assumed to be over lots of units", "(LOTS), but not over lots of layers. We take the first step towards this direction by evaluating the LOTS concept for the first time in two standard settings of LOTS: depthwise separable convolution and transpose convolution. Experiments on ImageNet classification and COCO object recognition demonstrate that our approach achieves superior performance and is more generalizable than existing approaches.

Two types of differences are explored: linear scalings of a single input\u2019s representation and difference vectors between representations of two inputs, where the inputs are of different classes.In the former case, the LOTS method is used as a visualization of the representation of a specific input example, showing what it would mean, in input space, for the feature representation to be supressed or magnified. While it\u2019s an interesting computation to perform, the value of the visualizations is not very clear.In the latter case, LOTS is used to generate adversarial examples, moving from", "an origin image just far enough toward a target image to cause the classification to flip.

However, the results are probably not quite compelling enough to warrant a full ICLR paper.A few suggestions for improvement: - Several times it is claimed that LOTS can be used as a method for mining for diverse adversarial examples that could be used in training classifiers more robust to adversarial perturbation.

However, in practice, one often encounters samples that contain multiple translations for a same query. Such diversity requests can be", "addressed by forcing NNs to find diverse solutions. In this work, we propose Diverse Beam Search (DBS), a novel neural network model that allows a single neural network to produce diverse outputs from the same input by controlling the search space. Our model is built upon the strong Seq2Seq architecture and augmented with a newly introduced diversity controller that determines which part of the output to sample and how to sample from the previously generated candidates. To sample diverse outputs, the diversity controller relies on two kinds of diversity cues: stochastic and structural. The former is performed via sampling a minibatch of candidates from the old generation, and the latter is conducted through controlling the attention distribution of the decoder. Extensive experiments on both public datasets for NMT", "and confidential datasets for summarization confirm the efficacy of DBS and show that it can generate diverse outputs with the same model without losing much efficiency.

Thank you!* Manuscript summary ================== Distributed transfer learning (DTL) can address the challenges of limited labeled data and computational cost associated with learning a deep neural network (DNN) from scratch. However, most existing DTL methods require the target domain data to be divided into identically sized partitions that are assigned to the source domain units. In contrast, in some application scenarios, it may be difficult or even impossible to access the data partitioning information. In such cases, it would be very difficult to", "apply these existing DTL methods to transfer knowledge from the source domain to the target domain. \\ *We would like to thank the editor for the encouragement and the helpful comments, and the reviewers for their valuable comments and suggestions. We have carefully read the comments and made corrections based on the comments.* In this paper, we propose a novel and effective solution to scale DTL to deep convolutional neural networks (CNNs). The contributions of this paper are as follows: - We formulate the DTL problem as finding a mapping such that the two joint distributions are similar while the joint independence between the features and some measure of independence is optimized. To solve the complex, non-convex problem, we design a scalable algorithm that iteratively computes the mapping", "via Gaussian process (GP). - Our method addresses the challenge of DTL to a deep CNN by providing a unified framework for conventional domain transfer methods and domain adaptation methods. To deal with arbitrary domain discrepancy, we develop a method to measure domain discrepancy based on the total variation. - Experiments on four real-world datasets demonstrate that our method can effectively transfer knowledge between source and target domains and outperforms the baseline methods. The rest of the paper is organized as follows. We review related works in Section 2. Then we present the problem and our approach in Sections 3 and 4, respectively. The experimental studies are provided in Section 5, and we conclude the paper in Section 6.

Deep neural network is invertible if it is structurally invertible. This is because the network structure can be used to reconstruct input from output. Invertible deep neural networks have many appealing properties. For example, it is possible to back-propagate through the networks with different structures, and therefore anyimarized network can be used for both forward and backward propagation. This property is extremely useful for layerwise training, in which network parameters are updated in individual layers.

In this work, we analyzed the structural invertibility of convolutional neural network (CNN). It is well known that a deep convolutional network can be expressed as a chain of linear transformations. We proved that under some mild conditions on network structure, the network is structurally invertible. This means one can apply an algorithm, called inverse propagation, to solve for the network parameters in reverse order, based on knowing the output.

Although in most cases, the network could still be made structurally invertible by properly add some new layers, the reverse process of finding the network parameters given the output is invalid. It is nevertheless challenging to determine whether a given network is structurally invertible. We proposed to quantify the network structural invertibility by calculating the difference between the output and input singular value. By conducting layer-wise structural analysis on several benchmark datasets, we found many popular neural network architectures are not structurally invertible, such as traditional CNN, ResNet and DenseNet. We also showed that the total number of parameters of a structurally invertible network are equal to the number of parameters of the non-invertible counterpart with the same number of layers and channels, which indicates that the", "structurally invertible networks usually have much less parameters.

ISL first divides the original sequence into several sequence fragments, and then trains a GAN to blend these fragments together. The generator in the GAN network is trained to generate plausible looking sequence fragments that are similar to the real ones. To guide the generator to generate accurate sequence fragments,", "a discriminator is also trained to distinguish the generated fragments from the real ones. To further accelerate the training process, the generator and the discriminator are updated alternatively using the contrastive loss function. In this paper, we propose to use a high-dimensional discriminator to make the generator generate high-dimensional sequences. The high-dimensional discriminator can be trained more easily than low-dimensional ones in the beginning, and it also helps the generator to generate high-quality sequence fragments early. Once the generator has generated high-quality sequence fragments, the low-dimensional discriminator can be adopted to further accelerate the training process. Experiments on several benchmark datasets show that our ISL method achieves fast convergence and generates high-fidelity sequences to the real ones. + Introduction Sequence learning from sequential data is an important task", "in many AI applications, such as text classification, text generation, and code generation.

Model-based methods employ a stochastic sequential model, such as hidden Markov models (HMMs) and generative adversarial networks (GANs), to learn the relationship between the historical inputs and the current output. Since these models are based on the assumption of temporal order between the input and output, they often require a lot of historical input data to train accurately. On the other hand, sequence generation methods, which make use of static deep neural network models, have the advantage of being model independent and easy to train on small amounts of data. In particular, generative adversarial networks (GANs) have been"], "human_text": ["This paper presents a thorough analysis of different methods to do curriculum learning.

The topic is of interest to me because I am currently working on the issue of scalable training of NLU models that consume character-level word representations.

In particular, it seems challenging to find a method to apply the ideas of slow parameter updates from the domain of efficient next sentence prediction (See e.g. Xing et al., 2016) to the problem of efficient training of such character-level NLP models. The current state-of-the-art approach to efficiently train character-level NLP models, BPEmb, is a notable exception, but it relies on BPEmbNet (an architecture for efficiently training character-level NLP models),", "of this paper (Applying RL to train NLP models) seems to be more of a proof of concept than a practical approach to train NLU models with character-level word representations. The implementation provided in the paper seems to be extremely inefficient, which renders the approach in the paper impractical for even relatively small models. For instance, it took 3 days to train BERT-Large (92MB model) with the implementation provided in the paper, whereas it is easy to train BERT-Large in 1 day with existing techniques. Nevertheless, it would be interesting to see if it is possible to make the implementation provided in the paper more efficient and/or if it is possible to apply the techniques from Xing et al. to train character-level NLP models efficiently."], "human_text": ["In this submission, an interesting approach to character-based language modeling is pursued that retains word-level representations both in the context, and optionally also in the output.

I did not read the social media comments about this paper prior to reviewing it.  I appreciate the authors' updates in response to the reviewer comments.  Overall, however, my review stands.  The authors have taken a task that had not yet been addressed with a straightforward modern deep learning approach, and addressed it with such an approach.  I assume that if we pick up any task that hasn't been worked on for a while, and give it a solid deep learning treatment, we will do well.  I do not see such papers as a contribution to ICLR, unless they also provide new insights, analysis, or surprising results (which, to my mind, this paper does", "not).  This is a general point and the program chairs may disagree with it, of course.I have removed my recommendation that this be accepted as a workshop paper, as I have since noticed that the workshop track this year has a different focus.  ************************ORIGINAL REVIEW:The authors show that an appropriately engineered LSTM+CNN+CTC network does an excellent job of lipreading on the GRID corpus.  This is a nice result to know about--yet another example of a really nice result that one can get the first time one applies such methods to an old task--and all of the work that went into getting it looks solid (and likely involved some significant engineering effort).  However, this in itself is not sufficiently novel for publication at ICLR. ", "The paper also needs to be revised to better represent prior work, and ideally remove some of the vague motivational language.  Some specifics on what I think needs to be revised:- First, the claim of being the first to do sentence-level lipreading.  As mentioned in a pre-review comment, this is not true.  The paper should be revised to discuss the prior work on this task (even though much of it used data that is not public).  Ideally the title should also be changed in light of this.- The comparison with human lipreaders needs to be qualified a bit.  This task is presumably very unnatural for humans because of the unusual grammar, so perhaps what you are showing is that a machine can better", "take into account the strong contraints.  This is great, but not a general statement about LipNet vs. humans.- The paper contains some unnecessary motivational platitudes.  We do not need to invoke Easton and Basala 1982 to motivate modeling context in a linguistic sequence prediction task, and prior work using older sequence models (e.g. HMMs) for lipreading has modeled context as well.  The McGurk effect does not show that lipreading plays a crucial role in human communication.- It is worth noting that even without the spatial convolution, your Baseline-2D already does extremely well.

For example, there does not seem to be any confusion between /m/ and /b/ or between /m/ and /p/.- \"lipreading actuations\":  I am not sure what \"actuations\" means in this context- \"palato-alvealoar\" --> \"palato-alveolar\"- \"Articulatorily alveolar\" --> \"Alveolar\"?"], "model": "dolly-v2", "source": "PeerRead/iclr_2017/", "source_ID": "694"}

The CNN evaluated in this paperperforms perfectly at the task and the paper's goal is to inspect how theCNN works.The fundamental mechanism for this inspection is Class ActivationMapping (CAM) (Zhou et. al. 2016), which identifies regions of implicit attentionin the CNN. These implicit attention maps (localization heat maps) are used toderive actions (which square each player should move). The attention maps  (1) attend to squares in the tic-tac-toe board rather than arbitraryblobs,", "despite the fact that one square in a board has uniform color, and(2) they can be used to pick correct (winning) actions.This experiment are used to support assertions that the network understands(1) chess (tic-tac-toe) boards(2) a rule for winning tic-tac-toe(3) that there are two players.Some follow up experiments indicate similar results under various renderingsof the tic-tac-toe boards and an incomplete training regime.More Clarifying Questions===* I am not quite sure precisely how CAM is implemented here. In the original CAMone must identify a class of interest to visualize (e.g., cat or dog). I don'tthink this paper identifies such a choice.

The central idea is generalization from \"what will happen\"to \"what to do\" indicates concept learning (sec. 2.1). Why should an ability toact be any more indicative of a learned concept than an ability to predictfuture states. I see a further issue with the presentation of this approach anda potential correctness problem:1. (correctness)In the specific setting proposed I see no difference between \"what to do\"and \"what will happen.\"Suppose one created labels dictating \"what to do\" for each example in theproposed dataset. How would these differ from", "the labels of \"what will happen\"in the proposed dataset? In this case \"what will happen\" labels includeboth player identity (who wins) and board position (which position they moveto win). Wouldn't the \"what to do\" labels need to indicate board position?They could also chosen to indicate player identity, which would make themidentical to the \"what will happen\" labels (both 18-way softmaxes).2. (presentation)I think this distinction would usually be handled by the Reinforcement Learningframework, but the proposed method is not presented in that framework orrelated to an RL based approach. In RL \"what will happen\" is the reward anagent will receive for making a particular action and \"what to do\" is theaction an agent should take.

COMMENTS- The paper is a bit long (especially the appendix) and seems to have been written a bit in a rush. Overall the main points are presented clearly, but the results and conclusions could be clearer about the assumptions / experimental vs theoretical nature. The connection to previous works could also be clearer. - On page 2 one finds the statement ``Furthermore, architectures are often compared via \u2018hardcoded\u2019 weight values -- a specific function that can be represented efficiently by one architecture is shown to only be inefficiently approximated by another.'' This is partially true, but it neglects important parts of the discussion conducted in the cited papers. In particular, the paper", "[Montufar, Pascanu, Cho, Bengio 2014] discusses not one hard coded function, but classes of functions with a given number of linear regions. That paper shows that deep networks generically* produce functions with at least a given number of linear regions, while shallow networks never do. * Generically meaning that, after fixing the number of parameters, any function represented by the network, for parameter values form an open, positive -measure, neighbourhood, belongs to the class of functions which have at least a certain number of linear regions. In particular, such statements can be directly interpreted in terms of networks with random weights. - One of the measures for expressivity discussed in the present paper is the number of Dichotomies. In statistical learning theory, this notion is used to define", "the VC-dimension. In that context, a high value is associated with a high statistical complexity, meaning that picking a good hypothesis requires more data. - On page 2 one finds the statement ``We discover and prove the underlying reason for this \u2013 all three measures are directly proportional to a fourth quantity, trajectory length.'' The expected trajectory length increasing exponentially with depth can be interpreted as the increase (or decrease) in the scale by a composition of the form a*...*a x, which scales the inputs by a^d. Such a scaling by itself certainly is not an underlying cause for an increase in the number of dichotomies or activation patterns or transitions. Here it seems that at least the assumptions on the considered types of trajectories also play an", "the bias is comparatively too large... then we no longer see exponential growth.''OTHER SPECIFIC COMMENTS In Theorem 1 - Here it would be good to be more specific about ``random neural network'', i.e., fixed connectivity structure with random weights, and also about the kind of one-dimensional trajectory, i.e., finite in length, closed, differentiable almost everywhere, etc. - The notation ``g \\geq O(f)'' used in the theorem reads literally as |g| \\geq \\leq k |f| for some k>0, for large enough arguments. It could also be read as g being not smaller than some function that is bounded above by f, which holds for instance whenever g\\geq 0.

The architecture is simple: concatenate input and identity mapping, then apply common layers to get new representation.

We call the architecture with identity mappings \u201cidentity mapping network\u201d (or idMappingNet). Differentiable Identity Mappings --------------------------------- Following previous works (see footnote 3), we use identity mappings to align the source and target domains. However, these methods have some limitations when used to deal with domain shift. For example, the feature warps method (K generalization) assumes that the dimension of the source and target domains are the same, while in reality the dimensions of image data usually differ.", "The error covariances method (Tzeng) assumes the source and target domains share the same input space, but in practice the source and target data may have different types. To address these issues, we introduce a more general formulation of identity mappings, where we learn the function that maps from the source to the target domain and back, such that the two mappings are both invertible and the composition of the two mappings is the identity function. Given an input $ x_{0} $, we can use the function $ f_{0} $, which maps from the source to the target domain, to map the input to $ x_{1} = f_{0}(x_{0}) $.

Low-shot learning is one of those typical problems that suffer from overfitting despite having a large number of training samples due to the use of small feature vector. To address this problem, this paper applies feature regularization to low-shot learning. The main contribution of this paper is to combine the L2 and L1 regularization into an L1+ penalty function to prevent overfitting in low-shot learning, and then use alternating minimization technique to solve the corresponding optimization problem. Extensive experiments on several typical datasets verify the effectiveness of the proposed method. ## Feature regularized low-shot learning In the low-shot learning problem, the original high-dimensional image feature representation of the training images and the labeled", "training classes are often insufficient for capturing the class information, and the problems caused by overfitting is therefore often encountered in the training of classification model. Feature regularization method is used to solve this problem. In the low-shot learning, the original image feature representation is further compressed, i.e. the dimension of feature representation is reduced, to save the calculation consumption and time. In the paper, the L1+ regularization is used as a combination of L1 and L2 regularizers, and the hyperparameters of the two regularization terms are respectively tuned by cross validation on the training set. The flowchart of the feature regularization based low-shot learning algorithm is as follows: 1. extract the image feature representation from the training images and the corresponding training classes; 2. use a joint", "matrix factorization to obtain the projected feature matrix and the label matrix; 3. normalize the projected feature matrix using L2 normalization to perform column standardization, and calculate the corresponding labels; 4. use L2 normalization to perform feature standardization and L1 + to perform feature regularization. The learned linear classifier is used to label the testing samples, and the process of classification is as follows: 1. use the SVD to project the unlabeled test sample into a low-dimensional feature space; 2. obtain the classification label of the projection vector according to the corresponding low-shot learning model, and further complete the final classification of the original test sample; 3. perform loss function calculation and update the parameter of the original low-shot learning model by using the back propagation method. The", "main contribution of this paper is to design an L1+ regularization term to prevent overfitting in low-shot learning. The main theoretical proof of this paper is to prove the convergence of the objective function, and the feasibility of the solution is guaranteed by the boundedness of the coefficient in the corresponding equation. In the experiment, the proposed method is compared with other state-of-the-art low-shot learning algorithms on several well-known datasets. The experimental results show that the proposed method can achieve good effect of feature regularization on low-shot learning, and the main contribution of this paper is achieved. ## Related works Low-shot learning is a new and hot topic in the machine learning field, which solves the low-data but high-dimensional machine learning problems by using a small amount of"], "human_text": ["The paper proposes to use a last-layer feature penalty as regularization on the last layer of a neural net.Although the equations suggest a weighting per example, dropping this weight (alpha_i) works equally well.The proposed approach relates to Batch Norm and weight decay.Experiments are given on \"low-shot\" settting.There seem to be two stories in the paper: feature penalty as a soft batch norm version, and low-shot learning; why is feature penalty specifically adapted to low-shot learning and not a more classical supervised task?Regarding your result on Omniglot, 91.5, I believe it is still about 2% worse than the Matching Networks, which you refer to but don't put in Table 1.

The authors clearly explain the motivation and introduce the concept of intrinsic fear and describe an approach to exploit it. I have some thoughts on how to further improve the paper, which I've listed below. Title: I think the title could be more concise, maybe something like \"Fighting Sisyphean task because of its intrinsic fear\". Sec. 1.1: In my opinion, more background on what RL is and why this is a challenge could be helpful for a non-technical audience. E.g., why would the agent try to avoid doing what it was programmed to do? Also, I think introducing the key concepts in the first paragraph of this section would be good. Sec. 1.2: It might be helpful to have an example of the sort of policy", "that the authors want to avoid. For example, a very greedy policy that seeks out ever higher rewards might be bad example because most humans avoid actions that lead to death. Another example might be trying to maximize money for an extrinsic reward, like a player in a game of Monopoly trying to stay on the property cards. A more intriguing example might be someone trying to gain prestige by winning awards in a video game. In general, examples should include both the goal of the policy and the sort of policy the authors want to avoid. Sec. 2.2: \"The the initial state, $s_1$\" the first state? Since the paper is about intrinsic fear, I think the order of the states could be switched: \"The first state was", "$\\ldots$\" Sec. 3.1: The phrase \"In other words, the problem of facing aversive outcomes is that they are aperiodic, since one can avoid them only by first engaging in them.\" could be further explained. The author means that aversive outcomes don't have a fixed-size time period, they can extend to any length. For example, imagine a person in fear of a bear. If they try to run away, the bear will pursue them indefinitely. Alternatively, if the person instead sits still, the bear may eventually leave. The author could further say that aversion is analogous to fear of the unknown, and it's similar to the Buddhist concept of samsara, where beings are born into a cycle of existence and pain only to eventually be reborn again with new", "desires and tasks to complete. Sec. 3.2: \"the AI system doesn\u2019t know the long-term implications of acting greedily\" - maybe change \"the AI system doesn\u2019t know the long-term implications of acting greedily in the context of the environment it\u2019s operating in.\"? This is more like the result of acting greedily, not the greedily itself. Sec. 4.2: In general, I think it's okay to use terms like \"the\", \"one\", and \"themselves\" since those are explicit references to a limited number of objects (in this case, \"the aversive outcome\", \"one\" and \"themselves\" are all references to the same thing, the state). On the other hand, using these terms can make the discussion more verbose. For example, one may choose to replace \"the aversive outcome\" with \"aversive outcomes\".

The author only performed gradient check for the selected words and didn't explore other directions. 2. It is a common method to perform n-grams derived from a corpus to build the vocabulary.

For example, for the 2007 and CoNLL 2003 dataset, only one keyword is selected while for the BOS test set and Penn 2030 dataset, 5 keywords are selected. Therefore, it may be more effective to select a larger number of words to improve the overall performance. 2. The vocabulary selection strategies could also be applied to other tasks besides the translation task. For example, the sentence encoding task could benefit from such strategies.

AI Blockchains in the Enterprise =============================== Artificial intelligence (AI) is a technology that generates intelligent robots and machines by using data, algorithms and huge computing power.

This data is often created by IoT (Internet of Things) devices, sensors and machines and needs to be organized and structured to be analyzed by AI. To process all of this data, enterprises use the data-driven applications and the digital scienctific data analysts and scientists. In order to provide the best services to their customers and to be prepared for future disruption, enterprises must adopt AI to make their data more intelligent and process all data to provide a better service."], "human_text": ["The primary point made by this paper is that given certain architectural characteristics of multi-GPU systems, namely the use of bi-directional PCI-E for communication and the integration of two independent DMA engines on recent GPU devices (providing support for simultaneous independent communications), and given the characteristics of the communications patterns required by synchronous SGD trainers for deep neural networks, namely that the messages are large, dense, and have a fixed length, it makes sense to design communication collectives such as broadcast, reduce, and allreduce specifically for the use case of synchronous SGD training on a multi-GPU system.  The paper describes the implementation of these three collectives (broadcast, reduce, and allreduce) using a linear pipelining (LP) scheme on a (logical) ring topology.  The paper compares the LP", "collectives to two alternatives:  collectives based on a minimal spanning tree (MST) topology and collectives based on bidirectional exchange (BE).  First, a theoretical comparison is made using a standard cost model used in the high performance computing community.  When assumptions based on multi-GPU system architecture (very low latency for messages) and on the communication characteristics of synchronous SGD training (very large messages) are integrated into the model, the paper finds that the LP collectives should be less costly than BE collectives by a factor of 2 and less costly than MST collectives by a factor of log(p), where p is the number of GPUs being used.  Second, an empirical comparison is performed in which (1) the time required to perform each of the different", "collectives on a 4-device (k40m) system is measured as a function of message size and (2) the time required to perform each of the different collectives with a 200 MB message length is measured as a function of the number of devices in the system.  These measurements show that the LP-based collectives are consistently the fastest.  Third, DNN training experiments with AlexNet and GoogLeNet are performed on a 4-device system using three different synchronous SGD algorithms with the different implementations of the collectives (a total of 6 different algorithms in all).  Measurements of the communication and computation costs show that the LP collectives reduce communication costs without affecting computation costs (as expected).  Measurements of the convergence of the training loss as a function of", "time for the two DNN architectures show that use of the LP collectives leads to faster training.While the theory says that the costs of LP collectives should be invariant to the number of devices in a multi-GPU system, the empirical work shows that in practice this does not hold going from 4 to 5 devices (in the tested configuration) because in a 5-device system messages must traverse the QPI.  Are there other practical considerations that the authors are aware of that affect the scaling of the LP collectives?

The core idea of the paper is essentially how to apply asynchronous methods in a distributed environment, which is not an easy task. The paper makes several interesting points regarding the analysis of the SGD with a plain random asynchronous model, as well as proposing a novel variance reduced protocol that scales to large number of machines. The analysis is well thought out, and I think the paper will be a useful addition to the literature. Some comments for the author to consider are as follows: 1. The introduction focuses too much on theoretical motivations for this problem, rather than focusing more on motivation for the problem that the author is addressing. For example, in the first section the author mention the", "the lack of theories for non-convex optimization with a high dimensional parameter, but then in the first section of the paper he is solving the problem of minimizing a sum of two functions. It would be better to switch this around, and start with motivations for the problem the author is addressing. For example, why does the author care about variance reduction for SGD with a large number of machines? Why would the problem need to be non-convex? 2. The analysis in the second section assumes that the gradients are independent. However, in practice this is not the case. In the synchronous setting, each worker computes a gradient based on the same model but with a different random starting point. These starting points are not independent. The author", "should address this and include this as a factor in the variance. 3. In practice there are often many workers. One example that comes to mind is Maxpooling. The Maxpooling operation can be viewed as two convolution layers with a large number of filters. A small group of workers can effectively perform the computation needed for these filters. It would be very interesting to include this observation in the analysis, and see how the convergence speed is improved. 4. In the third section the author describes a variance reduced stochastic gradient method. The algorithm is as follows: 1. Each worker chooses $v_i(0)$ uniformly at random from a bounded set. 2. Each worker computes $v_i(t+1)$ according to: $$\\begin{aligned} v_i(t+1) &\\gets& \\delta - \\lambda \\frac{2\\alpha -1}{n} \\sum_n \\nabla f_{i,n}(v_i(t)) \\\\", "&&- \\frac{\\lambda \\alpha }{n} \\sum_n \\sum_j S_{i,j} f_{i,n}(v_i(t)) + \\xi_i(t) \\end{aligned}$$ 3. The averaging step is the same as in standard SGD, which is: $$\\sum_n \\nabla f_{n}(x_i) \\gets \\sum_n \\nabla f_{n}(x_i) - \\sum_n \\sum_j \\left( \\nabla f_{n}(x_i) \\cdot S_{i,j} \\right) \\textbf{1}_{\\{\\text{supp}\\ S_{i,j} \\subseteq \\{n\\}\\}} + \\sum_n \\sum_j \\left( \\nabla f_{n}(x_i) \\cdot S_{i,j} \\right) \\textbf{1}_{\\{\\text{supp}\\ S_{i,j} \\cap \\{n\\} \\neq 0\\}}} = 0$$ The point is, this is still a plain vanilla SGD method. Why should we apply a variance reduced algorithm? The author should explain what special structure the algorithm has, and how it leads to improved convergence speed. 5.

They should explain why traditional public-key encryption is not suitable for their application, and then discuss the motivations for and challenges of implementing end-to-end secure communication using encryption. Problem Statement In their Introduction, the authors state that \"the standard security paradigm of public-key cryptography is ill-suited to protecting end-to-end communication.\" However, the problem that they actually solve is somewhat narrower than that. The authors describe a general approach to using encryption for end-to-end communication, but they don\u2019t tackle the problem of key management, which is a more challenging problem that", "can\u2019t be solved with encryption alone. I recommend the PKI course on Coursera, which provides a good overview of key management challenges, including discovery, authentication, secure storage, transport, and revocation. Motivations and Goals The authors should provide a more detailed statement of the goals and motivations for this project. The problem statement should be updated to reflect the specific challenges that the authors were trying to solve. As the authors note, \"the standard security paradigm of public-key cryptography is ill-suited to protecting end-to-end communication.\" This is because encryption is used only at the edge devices, and long-distance communication requires keys that can be securely shared between the end-points. In addition, public key cryptography requires that the keys be securely distributed between the communicating devices. This challenge is exacerbated", "by the fact that the devices may be physically separated and/or have lost contact with the cloud. The authors describe a framework in which the encryption and key management are done using an untrusted service. The authors do not discuss the challenges associated with using an untrusted service for key management. However, an untrusted service does provide a way to reduce the complexity of key management: if the encryption key is shared between the client and the server, it can be administered using a shared secret, instead of using a public key certificate. The authors propose that the security of the system could be improved by using authenticated encryption, but they do not discuss the challenges of authentication in the context of untrusted servers. Because the secret key", "is used both for encryption and for authentication, this approach still relies on key distribution. The key must be securely transmitted from the server to the client and back, without being recorded in any metadata. This type of transmission can be achieved using a messaging system that is also used for other purposes, but it would need to be a very low-volume, high-bandwidth channel. As a result, this approach is very inefficient from a communication efficiency perspective. Instead, I recommend the McEliece cryptosystem, which provides confidentiality using CCA-secure encryption and authentication. McEliece is an example of elliptical curve cryptography, which can provide both confidentiality and integrity (or authentication). The scheme works as follows. The sender generates a private key and a public key, and computes the hash of", "the public key is the shared secret. The message is encrypted by the sender by multiplying it with the generator, using the public key, and then applying the inverse of the hash function. The resulting ciphertext is sent to the recipient.

I have a number of suggestions for improvement though. I recommend that the authors include the hyperparameter values used for the various neural network components. For example, in the case of GSN, it would be useful to report the learning rate and batch size used. It would be useful to include a more detailed description of the infusion training procedure.

On a related note, I wonder if it would be possible to use the generated samples to further train the GSN model, and potentially further refine its sampling capability. In terms of the paper's technical merits, I recommend expanding the explanation of the neural network components.

It would be useful if the authors could speculate on potential improvements to the presented model in the future. For example, one idea that comes to mind is to train the noise model not on a fixed sequence of text commands but instead on a set of images, so that it learns to generate samples", "that are more similar to real images.

Another potential area for improvement might be to use a different optimization method for training GSN. At present, the training procedure is likely suboptimal.

The current implementation only supports the downsampling approach to resolution reduction, and does not provide any upsampling technique such as multi-scale processing.

The strength of the paper is the novelty and applicability of the detection method. The paper is also well written with clear objectives, research questions, and an appropriate discussion. I do have a few comments and suggestions for the paper: 1- In Table 1, the training set should also include the clean data as well as the adversarial examples generated from it. The reason is that the model was trained on the clean data, and presumably for certain applications an adversary may intentionally generate clean data and label it +1, so the model would think it is good, then adversarially change just a few instances and labels to +1.", "This may bias the detection method and is worth including as a robustness measure. 2- For comparison, one can also include some well known detection methods such as SVDNet, Local Interpretable Model-Averaging and CWFD on the detected adversarial examples. It would be useful to compare those methods on the same set of examples and compare their detection rates to highlight the benefits of the detection approach proposed in the paper. 3- The paper mentions that the adversarial examples have the same embedding as the clean examples.

It would be useful to demonstrate that the model is not just detecting that they have the same", "that they have the same embedding as the clean examples).

Importantly, the authors investigate whether it is possible to build an adversarial detector which is resilient to adversarial examples built against *both* the classifier and the detector. Their results suggest that training a detector in this more difficult setting still yields gains but does not entirely resolve the problem of detecting adversarial examples.Major comments:The authors describe a novel approach for dealing with adversarial examples from a security standpoint -- namely, build an independent system to detect the adversary so a human might", "intervene in those cases. A potential confound of this approach is that an adversary might respond by constructing adversarial examples to fool *both* the original classifier and the new detector. If that were possible, then this approach is moot since an attacker could always outwit the original system. To their credit, the authors show that building a 'dynamic' detector to detect adversarial examples but also be resilient to an adversary mitigates this potential escalation (worse case from 55% to 70% detection rate). Even though the 'dynamic' detector  demonstrates positive gains, I am concerned about overall scores. Detecting adversarial examples at this rate would not be a reliable security procedure.My second comment is about 'model transferability'. My definition of 'model transferability' is different then the one used in", "the paper. My definition means that one constructs an adversarial example on one network and measures how well the adversarial examples attack a second trained model -- where the second model has been trained with different initial conditions. (The author's definition of 'transferability' is based on seeing how well the detector generalizes across training methods). 'Model transferability' (per my definition) is quite important because it measures how general an adversarial example is across all models -- and not specific to a given trained model. Different methods have different levels of 'model transferability' (Kurakin et al, 2016) and I am concerned how well the detector they built would be able to detect adversarial examples across *all models* and not just the trained model in question.

So exponential network sizes are caused by this rank needing to grow exponentially, as required by the partition.- In the deep case, one also uses the case that the upper bound is linear in the size of the network (as measured by the last hidden layer), however,", "this situation is caused by the selection of a partition (I^low, J^high), and the maximal rank induced by this partition is only linear anyway, hence the network size can remain linear.If tried my best to summarize the key point of this paper and still probably failed at it, which shows how complex is this notion of partition rank, and that its linear growth with network size can either be a good or bad thing depending on the setting. Hopefully, someone will come one day with an explanation that holds in a single slide.While this is worth publishing as conference paper in its present form, I have two suggestions that, IMHO, would make this work more significant:On the theory side, we are still very far from the completeness of", "the structural risk. On the practice side, an issue is that experiments in this paper mostly confirm what is obvious through intuition, or some simpler form of reasonings. For instance to use convolutions that join pixels which are symmetrical in images to detect symmetry. Basic hand-crafted pattern detectors, as they have been used in computer vision for decades, would just do the job. What would be a great motivation for using this framework is if it answered questions that simple human intuition cannot, and for which we are still in the dark: one example I could think of in the recent use of gated convolutions 'a trous' for 1D speech signal, popularized in Google WaveNet ("], "model": "dolly-v2", "source": "PeerRead/iclr_2017/", "source_ID": "484"}

Although the authors have conducted the experiments using two different tasks, the results could be sub-optimal as the choice of base network (MLP) and the hyperparameter settings (i.e., k and delta) have not been optimized for this problem. Using a well-tuned baseline model and model configuration would have improved the performance of the proposed HMRNN.

Introduction Traditionally, recommender systems aim to identify and", "rank a set of items for a user, based on the user's historical actions and other information. Recently, there has been a growing interest in develop-ing methods that generate recommendations, typically for a new user. Such an approach, generative recommendation, aims to predict a new user's preferences and likely interests by learning from a set of existing users and their interactions. This is in contrast to a conventional one-way recommendation, where the system learns which items to recommend based on viewing individual items and their properties. A generative model for recommendation needs to capture the interactions between users and items to make predictions for a new user. To model these interactions, previous works have typically made use of two types of information, sequential information and user-item interaction information.", "The former indicates whether two items were interacted with each other, for example, by using slidshow or showing a popular time interval in which two items were co-consumed. The latter typically uses the base collaborative filtering technique to predict the preference of a user based on other users' observed data. Such user-item interaction information is widely known as implicit feedback. Most of the existing works only use one form of information, for example, either sequential information or implicit feedback information. However, although these two sources of information are very useful, they are complementary to each other and should be combined to take advantage of their full potential. In this paper, we propose a novel method that uses coevolutionary processes to learn feature representations of users and items that", "can capture their interactions, while at the same time factor in the non-interaction information about these two entities. The rationale is that if two entities interact with each other, their feature representations should have a high correlation. Specifically, we formulate the recommendation problem as a generative modeling task, where we need to generate the interaction features from the non-interaction features of the two entities. Then, we can use the coevolutionary approach to efficiently train the model to capture both the interaction features and the non-interaction features of the two entities. More specifically, we use the convolutional neural network (CNN) to capture the non-interaction features of users and items. More specifically, we can encode a user or an item into a latent feature vector with CNN, which is made", "up of two parts, static features and dynamic features. The static features represent the global information of the user or the item, such as the user's or the item's age or gender. The dynamic features reflect the user's or the item's recent behavior. We believe that the static features can represent the non-interaction information of two entities, while the combination of the static features and dynamic features may give more complete information about the two entities, and thus provide more clues for modeling the interactions between the two entities. To model the interactions between users and items, we use a coevolutionary approach to learn the combined feature representation. This approach first embeds both the static and dynamic features into a common feature space. Then, in this space, a", "static features, so that the dynamic features can be better represented in this space. After that, we can use the combined feature representation of users and items to make recommendations for users. We have evaluated the proposed method on two public datasets for movie recommendation and news article recommendation. The experimental results show that the proposed model is able to outperform the state-of-the-art. ## 2. Related Work The key idea of our work is using coevolutionary processes to learn feature representations of users and items that can capture their interactions. The model is based on the coevolutionary generative paradigm.

The later are modeled as coupled \u2013 autoregressive processes \u2013 i.e. the representation of a user/item changes when he interacts with an item/user, and is a function of both the user and the item representations before time t. This is called coevolution here and the autoregressive process is called recurrent NN. The model may also incorporate heterogeneous inputs. Experiments are performed on several datasets, and the model is compared with different baselines.There are several contributions in the paper: 1) modeling recommendation via parametrized point processes where the parameter dynamics are modeled by latent user/item representations, 2) an optimization algorithm for maximizing the likelihood of this process, with", "different technical tricks that seem to break its intrinsic complexity, 3) evaluation experiments for time dependent recommendation.The paper by the same authors (NIPS 2016) describes a similar model of continuous time coevolution, and a similar evaluation.

In the paper, the LSTM shows a very sensitive behaviour, even when a very small amount of noise is added to the input. However, it", "still performs surprisingly well with this chaotic behaviour. Measuring the model complexity is a very difficult task, therefore, many papers manage to use either same number of hidden units or choose approximately close model sizes. In this paper, the experiments were carried by using the same amount of parameters for both the LSTM and CFN. However, I think the CFN may have much more simpler computational graph. Taking the idea of this work, can we develop a stable dynamic system, but which does not only have one attractor?It is also interesting to see that the layers of CFNs are updated in different timescales in a sense that the decaying speed decreases when the layer gets higher. Could you provide more statistics on this? For example, what is the", "analyses and proofs. Overall, the performance is not any better than LSTMs, but it is still interesting when thinking of simplicity of this model.

The agent, when allowed to explore a complex new environment, rapidly becomes lost and never learns to find the optimal way to accomplish the task it was designed to perform. Instead, the agent repeatedly finds \"near-optimal\" local minima, only occasionally finding globally optimal solutions. This paper presents a simple solution: the environment is not complex, but the agent! The agent is simply a crude local optimizer, trapped in a valley of minimal energy, unable to ever reach the global minimum. The interesting question that this paper raises is: what is the minimum level of complexity an agent needs to be effective at navigating? Could a much simpler", "agent, lacking the local optimizer mechanism, perform successfully in more complex environments? This paper presents a reinforcement learning based method to decompose complex environments into a series of simpler environments and learn to navigate in each of them. The core idea is to first learn an environment with random geometry and lighting, then gradually reduce the complexity of the environment by introducing new parameters and symmetries into the random initialization. The agent, trained to navigate in the increasingly complex scenarios, is finally shown to be successfully generalized to the original complex environment. The author demonstrates the approach on a a simplified version of Car parking problem, where the agent is expected to park in a small circular lot with a fixed radius. The experiments show that even a", "very simple agent, without local optimizer mechanism, is able to achieve reasonable success rate when trained in a moderately complex environment. When trained in the original complex environment, the simple agent outperforms its complex alternatives. The results suggest that it is possible to design an effective approach for complex environment navigation by first learning to navigate in simpler environments. Below are some suggestions for the improvement of the paper: 1. The introduction of new parameters and symmetries into the random initialization causes the immediate loss of the global optimality. The author needs to explain the mechanism for finding a global optimal solution in the random initialization. 2. The definition of complex environment assumes the global optimality. In addition to the parameter and symmetry, it would be useful to", "define a few other more fundamental complexity metrics, for example the length of the shortest path in the environment. 3. One of the objectives of training the agent in a more complex environment is that it will be able to handle more complex scenarios when it is generalized to the original complex environment. However, due to the introduction of new parameters and symmetries, the original complex environment and the generalization (restriction) of the complex environment have different geometric dimensions. For example, the original complex environment has a length of 1 meter, while the generalization has a length of 2 meters. Intuitively, such a significant change of dimension can severely damage the generalization of the agent. 4.

However, the contribution is relatively incremental given previous work on RL for navigation and on auxiliary tasks. The work could become of greater interest provided broader analysis and insights on either optimal combinations of tasks for visual navigation (e.g. the value of other visual / geometry-based tasks), or on auxiliary tasks with RL in general.

Furthermore, users typically cannot guarantee that the effective classifier can be used in the actual scenario. Active learning usually increases the efficiency of the experimental process. However, for CNN models, most of the queries are ineffective. The main reason is that the image annotation is very time-consuming. If we use the actual CNN model to obtain an image annotation cost, the evaluation of the query will ignore the impact of network communication and server transfer delay. Although using distant transfer learning can reduce this cost a little, it needs to pay attention to prevent the change of the model structure.", "When using distant transfer learning, the model structure needs to be initialized from scratch, which means that the initialization of weights also needs to be optimized by a large number of iterations, and this will cause a large calculation burden on both the server and the client. In the actual CNN model, the number of iterations for model initialization and the size of the dataset are constants, and they are relatively small. The whole process is mainly caused by image annotation delay. If the image annotation is not improved, the active learning has a big performance problem. We will use a reliable classifier to reduce the query cost in the next version. If the classifier is also ineffective, we can also judge it according to the evaluation result.", "In general, using the area under the Precision-Recovery curve (AUPRC) to evaluate the model\u2019s performance is a good choice. Section 3: Revise the Ineffective Query Queries The following queries are ineffective. 1. Query for Pre-trained Models For CNN model, when we use pre-trained model for inference, the data annotation cost is zero. Therefore, the computation resources are not consumed by the annotation, and the evaluation of the image is not affected by the image annotation delay. At this time, the traditional ways can be used to train the model for the given query. The main problem is that the original loss function of the model has changed. If the evaluation index is not changed, the model may become worse than the simple random guess. Therefore, a good method", "is to use the similar or equal evaluation index to prevent the model from being deteriorated, and at the same time, the annotation cost can be reduced by using the pre-trained model. In the case of the above deep learning model, even when the validation accuracy is not decreased, the validation loss or the test loss may increase, or the time of initializing the network or the calculation time may increase. Therefore, using the pre-trained model can be used as an initialization method for a reasonable parameter, and the network structure remains the same. 2. Query Based on the Image Caption In many related works, the image text was used to represent the image. The model also used the image text to generate the description of the image.", "\u201cclock\u201d may appear. However, the image is actually a picture of a forest, and the clock is not necessary. This will cause a large amount of annotation waste. Because the deep model has a strong ability of generalization, even when there is a little annotation error, the model will still be very likely to output a good result, such as a classification prediction or a ranking.

This has enabled the use of deep learning models to train on these datasets to achieve excellent results. However, the accuracy of these models on held out test data is affected by the fact that the models were trained on labeled data from a single organization. There has been research into learning deep embedding models which can be leveraged to produce the same result as K-means based methods when creating machine learning systems which use these deep embedding models.

The solution proposed here includes a dual network design to train the deep embedding model in a way which leverages data from different organizations, while still allowing the resulting deep embedding model to be separated into two parts - a feature extractor and a cluster assigner. This two part structure would allow different organizations to use the embedding model while requiring them to come to a consensus on the result when provided with data from a new organization. This consensus is achieved by the assigner part of the deep embedding model getting input from all parties, henceforth called collaborative training, to a single cluster assignment.

However, to train these models, all data is labeled by one organization.

In this paper we present a method which uses deep learning models to perform cluster membership assignment without the need for labels from other organizations. The approach uses a dual network design that allows the model to learn features that are useful for cluster assignment, while also allowing for cluster assignment to be done more accurately with data from multiple organizations.

The approach is based on a CNN that, in contrast to most related papers, work in the space of affine transformations (instead of pixels or flow). Said another way, the network takes as input a set of affine transforms that describe the motion of patches in the past frames, and likewise, outputs a set of affine transforms that predict future patch motion.To that aim, the authors make a few simplifying hypotheses, namely, that a sequence of frames can be modeled accurately enough in their patch-affine framework. This is not unreasonable. A lot of papers in the optical flow community are based on similar hypotheses, i.e. model the flow", "as a smoothly varying affine field (for instance see \"Locally affine sparse-to-dense matching for motion and occlusion estimation\" by Leordeanu et al., \"EpicFlow: Edge-Preserving Interpolation of Correspondences for Optical Flow\" by Revaud et al., \"Optical Flow With Semantic Segmentation and Localized Layers\" by Sevilla-Lara et al.). These methods are state of the art, which gives a hint about the validity of this kind of approach. In addition, it also seems very reasonable to reformulate the prediction task as predicting motion rather than predicting raw pixels. Indeed, the (patch-affine) motion space is considerably smaller than the image space, making the problem much more tractable and amenable to high-resolution videos.While I agree with the authors on these points, I also find that the paper suffer from important flaws. Specifically: ", "- the choice of not comparing with previous approaches in term of pixel prediction error seems very \"convenient\", to say the least. While it is clear that the evaluation metric is imperfect, it is not a reason to completely dismiss all quantitative comparisons with previous work. The frames output by the network on, e.g. the moving digits datasets (Figure 4), looks ok and can definitely be compared with other papers. Yet, the authors chose not to, which is suspicious.    - The newly proposed metric poses several problems. First, action classification is evaluated with C3D, which is not a state-of-the-art approach at all for this task. Second, this metric actually *does not* evaluate what the network is claimed to do, that is, next frame prediction. Instead,", "it evaluates if another network, which was never trained to distinguish between real or synthetic frames by the way, can accurately classify an action from the predicted frames. I find that this proxy metric is only weakly related to what is supposed to be measured. In adition, it does not really make sense to train a network for something else that the final task it is evaluated for.    - how is the affine motion of patches estimated? It is only explained that the problem is solved globally (not treating each patch independently) in a pretty vague manner. Estimating the motion of all patches is akin to solving the optical flow, which is still an active subject of research. Therefore, an important flaw of the paper", "lies in the potentially erroneous etimation of the motion input to the network. In the videos made available, it is clear that the motion is wrongly estimated sometimes. Since the entire approach depends on this input, I find it important to discuss this aspect. How do motion estimation failures impact the network? Also, the patch-affine hypothesis does not hold when patches are large enough that they cover several objects with contradictory motion. Which appears to be the case on UCF101 videos.    - Even ignoring the weird proxy-evaluation part, the network is still not trained end-to-end. That is, the network is trained to minimize the difference between (noisy) ground-truth and output affine transforms, instead of minimizing a loss in the actual output space (frame pixels) for", "years old.

The exploration of deep neural network (DNN) pruning as an implicit approach for learning representation is promising. The basic idea is that DNNs learn useful features by adapting themselves to the training data, but this process can become costly as the model grows in complexity and size. The proposed approach explicitly identifies less important connections in the network and removes them, thus reducing the complexity of the model while still retaining the ability to represent the input data. The paper presents the results of several experiments on several datasets using two different network topologies, and the results are encouraging. One potential area for improvement could be to apply the approach to other topologies, for example to ResNet or Inception models. However, it would", "be useful to present a summary of the key insights from the experiments, with practical tips for their successful implementation. For example, as the authors note, a crucial aspect of the approach is that it depends on the type of DNN to be able to identify and remove specific connections. It would be useful to include a list of the most common neural network topologies and example of how to use them to implement a specific DNN for the purpose of pruning. Likewise, the parameter settings used in the experiments can be considered as empirical, but a range of values could be provided as a starting point for practitioners. Another important point to consider is that the approach is effective only for training DNNs on certain types of", "tasks. For example, the model needs to be trained on a sufficiently large set of examples with correct outputs. Without this \"gold standard\" data, the model cannot learn what are the critical features or connections that should be preserved. Furthermore, the approach relies on the ability to quantify the importance of the connections in the network. It would be useful to mention in the paper some of the possible methods that can be used for this purpose, for example using the weight of each connection or the gradient associated with its removal. Overall, this is a useful approach for learning and representing data with DNNs, and the proposed methodology has the potential to be very useful for practitioners. The results presented in the paper are encouraging, and the", "these techniques are adopted and refined as a design criterion for DNNs. Some suggestions for improvement are provided above, in a summary form. Overall, the paper presents some interesting findings, with encouraging results on several datasets using two different network topologies, with future work potential to apply the approach to other topologies. The results presented in the paper present a clear potential for practical impact, as these techniques can be used to design more simplified DNNs for specific tasks. This paper represents a promising approach for improving the performance of DNNs through implicit learning of representation. Exploiting the implicit nature of the approach to learn and represent data could lead to novel approaches for DNN designers to consider during the model design process."], "human_text": ["The paper introduces a new pruning method for neural networks based on the second-order Taylor expansion and compares the results against a first-order method and brute-force pruning. It performs experiments of the three methods on several toy examples - including a two-layer network on MNIST - and shows that the second-order method behaves much worse then the brute-force baseline. In addition, from the success of the brute-force pruning the authors conclude that the hypothesis of Mozer et al - that neurons either contribute to performance or cancel out the effect of other neurons - is probably correct.The authors put in considerable effort to explain all details of the paper clearly and at length, so the content of the paper is accessible even to people novel to pruning methods.", "Additionally, the authors have very carefully answered all questions that were coming up through the pre-review and have been very responsive.My major criticism is that the paper lacks focus, does not have a concrete conclusion and does not explain what it adds to the literature. To make this apparent, I here summarise each paragraph of the conclusion section:Paragraph 1: We do not benchmark / Pruning methods do not fare well against brute-force baseline / Some evidence for hypothesis of Mozer & Smolensky, but further investigation neededParagraph 2: Introduced 2nd order Taylor method / Does not fare well against baselineParagraph 3: Re-training may help but is not fairParagraph 4: Brute-force can prune 40-70% in shallow networksParagraph 5: Brute-force less effective in deep networksParagraph 6: Not all neurons contribute equally", "to performance of networkThe title of the paper and answers of the authors to the pre-review questions seemed to strongly suggest that the paper is not about the new second-order method, is not about benchmarking pruning algorithms but is instead about the learnt representations. But only two or three sentences in the conclusion, and no sentence in the part on results in the abstract, even refers to neural representations. In an answer to the pre-review questions the authors stated:> Furthermore, we do not have to accept the conclusion that re-training is a necessary part of pruning because a brute force search reveals that neurons can in fact be > pruned from trained networks in a piecemeal fashion with no retraining and minimal adverse effect on the overall performance", "of the network. This would be > impossible if neurons did not belong to the distinct classes we describe.\"But this can already be concluded from the 2nd order method, which has a similar characteristic and is based on other 2nd order methods (not shown here). What is the motivation to introduce a new 2nd order method here?In addition, some other minor conclusions about representations - in particular the cancellation effect - might be based on side-effects of the greedy serial pruning method. Optimally, one would need to consider all the different ways of pruning (which, of course, scales exponentially with the number of neurons and is computationally infeasible). Notably, the authors do consider this limitation in the context of conventional pruning methods in the conclusions: \"Third, we assumed", "that pruning could be done in a serial fashion [...]. We found that all of these assumptions are deeply flawed in the sense that the true relevance of a neuron can only be partially approximated [...] at certain stages of the pruning process\". But the brute-force pruning process is also serial - why is that not a problem?All in all it is unclear to me what the paper adds: there are little conclusions regarding the learnt representations nor is there sufficient benchmarking against state-of-the-art pruning methods. I would suggest to focus the paper in the following way: first, use a state-of-the-art pruning method from the literature (that works without re-training) or do not use any other pruning methods besides brute-force (depending on whether you want to compare pruning"], "model": "dolly-v2", "source": "PeerRead/iclr_2017/", "source_ID": "687"}

The key problem of the method is that it can only be applied to layers with binary activation, such as the convolution layer. The method cannot be applied to the fully connected layer, which is the heart of the neural network. This is because the fully connected layer uses continuous weights, which is different from the binary activation of the convolution layer. This is", "see the below comments for the details.\" Authors note: We have included the detailed comments in the revised version. Authos note: We have made changes according to the comments.

In VGG-16 the method reaches compression ratios of 20x and experiences a speed-up of 15x. The paper is very well written and clearly exposes the details of the methodology and the results.My major criticisms are three-fold: for one, the results are not compared to one of the many other pruning methods that are described in section 1.1, and as such the performance of the method is difficult to judge from the paper alone. Second, there have been several other compression schemes involving pruning, re-training and vector-quantization [e.g. 1, 2, 3] that seem to achieve much higher accuracies, compression ratios and speed-ups. Hence, for the practical application of running such"], "model": "dolly-v2", "source": "PeerRead/iclr_2017/", "source_ID": "778"}
