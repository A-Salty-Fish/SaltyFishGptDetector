Italso allows for finer-grained comparison of GEC systems, in terms of precisionin general, and error type-specific figures for recall and precision.Unfortunately, the description of the system remains highly superficial.

Table 6 (which takes one entire page) list resultsfor all systems, and the text repeats many facts and figures that can be readoff the table. The evaluation of the proposed system is not satisfying in several aspects. First, the annotators should have independently annotated a gold standard forthe 200 test sentences instead of simply rating the output of the system. Givena fixed set of tags, it should be possible to produce a gold standard for therather small set of", "test sentences. It is highly probable that the approachtaken in the paper yields considerably better ratings for the annotations thancomparison with a real gold standard (see, e.g., Marcus et al. (1993) for acomparison of agreement when reviewing pre-annotated data vs. annotating fromscratch). Second, it is said that \"all 5 raters individually considered at least 95% ofour rule-based error types to be either \u201cGood\u201d or \u201cAcceptable\u201d\".Multiple rates should not be considered individually and their ratings averagedthis way, this is not common practice. If each of the \"bad\" scores wereassigned to different edits (we don't learn about their distribution from thepaper), 18.5% of the edits were considered \"bad\" by some annotator -- thissounds much worse than the average 3.7%, as calculated in the paper.Third, no information about the test data", "is provided, e.g. how many errorcategories they contain, or which error categories are covered (according tothe cateogories rated as \"good\" by the annotators).Forth, what does it mean that \"edit boundaries might be unusual\"? A moreprecise description plus examples are at need here. Could this be problematicfor the application of the system?The authors state that their system is less domain dependent as compared tosystems that need training data. I'm not sure that this is true. E.g., Isuppose that Hunspell's vocabulary probably doesn't cover all domains in thesame detail, and manually-created rules can be domain-dependent as well -- andare completely language dependent, a clear drawback as compared to machinelearning approaches. Moreover, the test data used here (FCE-test, CoNLL-2014)are from one domain only: student essays.It remains unclear why a new set", "tagset?

The ignorance of syntax for word embeddings which  arelearned by bound representation becomes beneficial.    These two sentences are contradictory, if a sequence labeling task   classified words with \"same syntax\" to same category then syntx becomes   a ver valuable feature.

It does not assume any further constraint, apart fromsome vague (and debatable) notion of semantic transparency. The paper'simplication (l254) that composition takes place over sets is also wrong:ordering matters hugely (e.g. 'sugar cane' is not 'cane sugar'). This is awell-known shortcoming of additive composition.

As it stands, such models tend to suffer from lack ofdiversity, specificity and local coherence in the kinds of response they tendto produce when trained over large dialogue datasets containing many topics(e.g. Cornell, Opensubtitles, Ubuntu, etc.). Rather than attempting to producediverse responses using the decoder, e.g. through word-by-word beam search(which has been shown not to work very well, even lose crucial informationabout grammar and valid sequences), or via a different objective function (suchas in Li et. al.\u2019s", "work) the authors introduce a latent variable, z, overwhich a probability distribution is induced as part of the network.

The authors seem not fully aware of the long history of this field, and itsvarious facets, whether from a theoretical perspective, or from an applied one.1. \u201c[the dialogue manager] typically takes a new utterance and the dialoguecontext as input, and generates discourse level decisions.\u201d         This is not accurate. Traditionally at least, the job of the dialoguemanager is to select actions (dialogue acts) in a particular dialogue context.The                    action chosen is then passed to a separate generationmoduleforrealisation. Dialogue management is usually done in the", "context of task-basedsystems which are goal driven. The dialogue manager is to choose actions whichare optimal in some sense, e.g. reach a goal (e.g. book a restaurant) in as fewsteps as possible. See publications from Lemon & Pietquin, 2012, Rieser, Keizerand colleagues, and various publications from Steve Young, Milica Gasic andcolleagues for an overview of the large literature on Reinforcement Learningand MDP models for task-based dialogue systems.2. The authors need to make a clear distinction between task-based,goal-oriented dialogue, and chatbots/social bots, the latter being usually nomore than a language model, albeit a sophisticated one (though see Wen et. al.2016). What is required from these two types of system is usually distinct.Whereas the former is required to complete a task, the latter is, perhaps onlyrequired to keep the user", "engaged. Indeed the data-driven methods that havebeen used to build such systems are usually very different. 3. The authors refer to \u2018open-domain\u2019 conversation. I would suggest thatthere is no such thing as open-domain conversation - conversation is always inthe context of some activity and for doing/achieving something specific in theworld. And it is this overarching goal, the overarching activity, thisoverarching genre, which determines the outward shape of dialogues anddetermines what sorts of dialogue structure are coherent. Coherence itself isactivity/context-specific. Indeed a human is not capable of open-domaindialogue: if they are faced with a conversational topic or genre that they havenever participated in, they would embarrass themselves with utterances thatwould look incoherent and out of place to others already familiar with it.(think of a random person on the street", "trying to follow the conversations atsome coffee break at ACL). This is the fundamental problem I see with systemsthat attempt to use data from an EXTREMELY DIVERSE, open-ended set ofconversational genres (e.g. movie subtitles) in order to train one model,mushing everything together so that what emerges at the other end is just verygood grammatical structure. Or very generic responses. Comments on the model architecture:Rather than generate from a single encoded context, the authors induce adistribution over possible contexts, sample from this, and generate greedilywith the decoder. It seems to me that this general model is counter intuitive,and goes against evidence from the Linguistic/Psycholinguistic literature ondialogue: this literature shows that people tend to resolve potential problemsin understanding and acceptance very locally - i.e. make sure they agree onwhat the", "context of the conversation is - and only then move on with the restof the conversation, so that at any given point, there is little uncertaintyabout the current context of the conversation. The massive diversity one seesresults from the diversity in what the conversation is actually trying toachieve (see above), diversity in topics and contexts etc, so that in a given,fixed context, there is a multitude of possible next actions, all coherent, butleading the conversation down a different path.It therefore seems strange to me at least to shift the burden of explainingdiversity and coherence in follow-up actions to that of thelinguistic/verbal/surface contexts in which they are uttered, though of course,uncertainty here can also arise as a result of mismatches in vocabulary,grammars, concepts, people\u2019s backgrounds etc. But this probably", "wouldn\u2019texplain much of the variation in follow-up response. In fact, at least as far as task-based Dialogue systems are concerned, thechallenge is to capture synonymy of contexts, i.e. dialogues that are distincton the surface, but lead to the same or similar context, either in virtue ofinteractional and syntactic equivalence relations, or synonymy relations thatmight hold in a particular domain between words or sequences of words (e.g.\u201cwhat is your destination?\u201d = \u201cwhere would you like to go?\u201d in a flightbooking domain). See e.g. Bordes & Weston, 2016; and Kalatzis, Eshghi & Lemon,2016 - the latter use a grammar to cluster semantically similar dialogues.Comments on the evaluation:The authors seek to show that their model can generate more coherent, and morediverse responses.

However,this model does not take raw text (sequence of word embeddings) as input, butrather hand-crafted features (e.g., different dependency paths combiningfactuality concepts, e.g., sources, SIPs, and clues). The usage of hand-craftedfeatures is somewhat surprising if coupled with complex deep model. Theevaluation seems a bit tainted as the authors report the results from foldedcross-validation but do not report how they optimized the hyperparameters ofthe model.

Altogether,I find this paper to be informative to an extent, but in it's current form nota great read for a top-tier conference.   Remarks:1. You keep mentioning that the LSTM and CNN in your model are combined\"properly\" -- what does that actually mean? How does this \"properness\"manifest?

You first motivate the usage of your complex DL architecture with learninglatent representations and avoiding manual design and feature computation.  Andthen you define a set of manually designed features (several dependency pathsand lexical features) as input for the model. Do you notice the discrepancy? 4.

Theintroduction presents the key claims of the paper: Previous CNNapproaches are bad when no phrase-level supervision is present.Phrase-level annotation is expensive. The contribution of this paper isinstead a \"simple model\" using other linguistic resources.The related work section provides a good review of sentimentliterature.

It is not entirely clear to mewhat constitutes a \"position\" t in the terminology of the paper. t is aparameter to the LSTM output, so it seems to be the index of asentence. Thus, t-1 is the preceding sentence, and p_t is the predictionfor this sentence. However, the description of the regularizers talksabout preceding words, not sentences, but still uses. My assumption hereis that p_t is actually overloaded and may either mean the sentiment ofa sentence or a word.

If this is not the case, thecomparison is not fair. Also, I do not understand why the authors cannotrun NSCL on the MR dataset when they have access to an implementation ofthe model.

The approach taken by theauthors is very different than many modern approaches based on BPE andcharacter-level models, and instead harkens back to approaches such as\"Factored Translation Models\" (Koehn and Hoang, 2007) and \"Translating intoMorphologically Rich Languages with Synthetic Phrases\" (Chahuneau et a. 2013),both of", "which are unfortunately uncited.I am also rather suspicious of the fact that the authors present only METEORresults and no BLEU or qualitative improvements.

Perhaps this is because first and second person pronouns andverbs rarely occur in news, but certainly this point at least merits briefdiscussion.

The comparisons are conducted by means of dot product afterprojecting the response into corresponding context and reference responsespaces. These projection matrices are learned by minimizing the squared errorbetween the model predictions and human annotations.I think this work gives a remarkable step forward towards the evaluation ofnon-task-oriented dialogue systems.

I was happy to observe thatthe objections I had", "when reading the paper (such as the mismatch in vocabularybetween the synonym dictionaries and gold standards) ended up being resolved,or at least addressed, in the final pages.The one thing about the paper that concerns me is that the authors do not seemto have properly understood the previous work, which undercuts the statedmotivation for this paper.The first instance of this misunderstanding is in the paragraph beginning online 064, where OmegaWiki is lumped in with Wiktionary and Wikipedia in adiscussion of resources that are \"not formally structured\" and that contain\"undisambiguated synonyms\".  In reality, OmegaWiki is distinguished from theother two resources by using a formal structure (a relational database) basedon word senses rather than orthographic forms.              Translations,", "synonyms,andother semantic annotations in OmegaWiki are therefore unambiguous.The second, and more serious, misunderstanding comes in the three paragraphsbeginning on lines 092, 108, and 120.  Here the paper claims that both BabelNetand UBY \"rely on English WordNet as a pivot for mapping of existing resources\"and criticizes this mapping as being \"error-prone\".  Though it is true thatBabelNet uses WordNet as a pivot, UBY does not.  UBY is basically ageneral-purpose specification for the representation of lexical-semanticresources and of links between them.  It exists independently of any givenlexical-semantic resource (including WordNet) and of any given alignmentbetween resources (including ones based on \"similarity of dictionarydefinitions\" or \"cross-lingual links\").  Its maintainers have made availablevarious databases adhering to the UBY spec; these contain a variety oflexical-semantic resources which have been", "aligned with a variety of differentmethods.  A given UBY database can be *queried* for synsets, but UBY itselfdoes not *generate* those synsets.  Users are free to produce their owndatabases by importing whatever lexical-semantic resources and alignmentsthereof are best suited to their purposes.  The three criticisms of UBY onlines 120 to 125 are therefore entirely misplaced.In fact, I think at least one of the criticisms is not appropriate even withrespect to BabelNet.  The authors claim that Watset may be superior to BabelNetbecause BabelNet's mapping and use of machine translation are error-prone.  Theimplication here is that Watset's method is error-free, or at leastsignificantly less error-prone.  This is a very grandiose claim that I do notbelieve is supported by what the authors ought to have", "known in advance abouttheir similarity-based sense linking algorithms and graph clusteringalgorithms, let alone by the results of their study.  I think this criticismought to be moderated.              Also, I think the third criticism (BabelNet'srelianceon WordNet as a pivot) somewhat misses the point -- surely the most importantissue to highlight isn't the fact that the pivot is English, but rather thatits synsets are already manually sense-annotated.I think the last paragraph of \u00a71 and the first two paragraphs of \u00a72 should beextensively revised. They should focus on the *general* problem of generatingsynsets by sense-level alignment/translation of LSRs (see Gurevych et al., 2016for a survey), rather than particularly on BabelNet (which uses certainparticular methods) and UBY (which doesn't", "use any particular methods, but canaggregate the results of existing ones).  It may be helpful to point outsomewhere that although alignment/translation methods *can* be used to producesynsets or to enrich existing ones, that's not always an explicit goal of theprocess.  Sometimes it's just a serendipitous (if noisy) side-effect ofaligning/translating resources with differing granularities.Finally, at several points in the paper (lines 153, 433), the \"synsets\" of TWSIof JoBimText are criticized for including too many words that are hypernyms,co-hypnomyms, etc. instead of synonyms.  But is this problem really unique toTWSI and JoBimText?  That is, how often do hypernyms, co-hypernyms, etc. appearin the output of Watset?  (We can get only a very vague idea of this fromcomparing Tables 3 and 5, which analyze only synonym relations.)", " If Watsetreally is better at filtering out words with other semantic relations, then itwould be nice to see some quantitative evidence of this.Some further relatively minor points that should nonetheless be fixed:* Lines 047 to 049: The sentence about Kiselev et al.

Why bother mentioning their analysis if you're not going to tell uswhat they found?* Line 091: It took me a long time to figure out how \"wat\" has any relation to\"discover the correct word sense\".

Secondly, the paper could be more accessible to the general reader by reducing the technical jargon.In conclusion, the study provides an excellent approach for the automatic induction of synsets from a graph of synonyms, and I recommend this study for publication after minor revisions.Sincerely,[Your Name]"], "model": "chatgpt", "source": "PeerRead/acl_2017/", "source_ID": "741"}

I agree with the comment wrt cross-modal mapping. What I don'tshare is the kind of equation \"visual = referential\" that you seem to assume. Areferent can be visually presented, but visual information can be usefullyadded to a word's representation in aggregate form to encode perceptual aspectsof the words' meaning, the same way that it is done for textual information;for instance, the fact that bananas are yellowwill not frequently be mentioned in text, and adding visual informationextracted from images will account for this aspect of the semanticrepresentation of the word. This is kind of technical and specific to how webuild distributional models, but it's also relevant if you think of humancognition (probably our representation for \"banana\"", "has some aggregateinformation about all the bananas we've seen --and touched, tasted, etc.). It would be useful if you could discuss this issue explicitly, differentiatingbetween multi-modal distributional semantics in general and the use ofcross-modal mapping in particular.Also, wrt the \"all models perform similarly\" comment: I reallyurge you, if the paper is accepted, to state it in this form, even if itdoesn't completely align with your hypotheses/goals (you have enough resultsthat do).

(More geared towards either generally what you explore or to what youfind?)----------The paper tackles an extremely interesting issue, that the authors label\"referential word meaning\", namely, the connection between a word's meaning andthe referents (objects in the external world) it is applied to. If I understoodit correctly, they argue thatthis is different from a typical word meaning representation as obtained e.g.with distributionalmethods, because one thing is the abstract \"lexical meaning\" of a word and theother which label is appropriate for a given referent with specific properties(in a specific context, although context is something they explicitly leaveaside in this paper).

The paper explores referentialword meaning empirically on a specific version of the task of ReferentialExpression Generation (REG), namely, generating the appropriate noun for agiven visually represented object.- Strengths:1) The problem they tackle I find extremely interesting; as they argue, REG isa problem that had previously been addressed mainly using symbolic methods,that did not easily allow for an exploration of how speakers choose the namesof the objects. The scope of the research goes beyond REG as such, as itaddresses the link between semantic representations and reference more broadly.2) I also like how they use current techniques and datasets (cross-modalmapping and word classifiers, the ReferIt dataset containing large amounts ofimages with human-generated referring expressions) to address the problem athand. 3) There are a substantial", "number of experiments as well as analysis into theresults. - Weaknesses:1) The main weakness for me is the statement of the specific hypothesis, withinthe general research line, that the paper is probing: I found it veryconfusing.  As a result, it is also hard to make sense of the kind of feedbackthat the results give to the initial hypothesis, especially because there are alot of them and they don't all point in the same direction.The paper says:\"This paper pursues the hypothesis that an accuratemodel of referential word meaning does notneed to fully integrate visual and lexical knowledge(e.g. as expressed in a distributional vectorspace), but at the same time, has to go beyondtreating words as independent labels.\"The first part of the hypothesis I don't understand: What is it to", "fullyintegrate (or not to fully integrate) visual and lexical knowledge? Is the goalsimply to show that using generic distributional representation yields worseresults than using specific, word-adapted classifiers trained on the dataset?If so, then the authors should explicitly discuss the bounds of what they areshowing: Specifically, word classifiers must be trained on the dataset itselfand only word classifiers with a sufficient amount of items in the dataset canbe obtained, whereas word vectors are available for many other words and areobtained from an independent source (even if the cross-modal mapping itself istrained on the dataset); moreover, they use the simplest Ridge Regression,instead of the best method from Lazaridou et al. 2014, so any conclusion as towhich method is better should be taken with a grain of salt. However, I'mhoping that", "the research goal is both more constructive and broader. Pleaseclarify. 2) The paper uses three previously developed methods on a previously availabledataset. The problem itself has been defined before (in Schlangen et al.). Inthis sense, the originality of the paper is not high. 3) As the paper itself also points out, the authors select a very limitedsubset of the ReferIt dataset, with quite a small vocabulary (159 words). I'mnot even sure why they limited it this way (see detailed comments below).4) Some aspects could have been clearer (see detailed comments).5) The paper contains many empirical results and analyses, and it makes aconcerted effort to put them together; but I still found it difficult to getthe whole picture: What is it exactly that the experiments in the paper tell", "usabout the underlying research question in general, and the specific hypothesistested in particular?

They argue that identifying these relationships is relevant for numerous NLP tasks, such as question answering and summarization.The authors then describe their proposed model, which uses pre-trained contextualized word representations and a multi-task learning approach to predict the entailment relationship between two given words in a sentence.

I can imagine many times where documents revolve primarily around a particularentity (biographical documents, dossiers or briefings about a person or event,clinical records, etc.) and where the information we care about extracting isspecific to that entity.

Doing coreference directly on Wikipedia also opens thedoors for more interesting use of knowledge, which the authors illustrate here.So I think this domain is likely to be an interesting testbed for ideas whichwould improve coreference overall, but which in the general setting would bemore difficult to get robust improvements with and which would be dwarfed bythe amount of work dealing with other aspects of the problem.Moreover, unlike past work", "which has carved off a slice of coreference (e.g.the Winograd schema work), this paper makes a big impact on the metrics of the*overall* coreference problem on a domain (Wikipedia) that many in the ACLcommunity are pretty interested in.THE TECHNIQUES: Overall, the techniques are not the strong point of this paper,though they do seem to be effective.

The authors start first by exposing what, according to them,should cover a semantic-based annotation scheme: (i) being graph-based(possibility for a token/node of having multiple governors) (2) havingnon-terminal nodes (representing complex structures \u00e2\u0080\u0093 syntactic -: coordinatephrases, lexical: multiword expression) and (3) allowing discontinuous elements(eg. Verbs+particules). Interestingly, none of these principles is tied to asemantic framework, they could also work for syntax or other representationlayers. The authors quickly position their work by first introducing the largercontext of broad-coverage semantic parsing then their annotation scheme ofchoice (UCCA).              They then present 3 sets of parsing experiments: (i)", "onedevoted to phrase-based parsing using the Stanford parser and an UCCA toconstituency conversion, (ii) one devoted to dependency parsing using an UCCAto dependency conversion and finally (iii) the core of their proposal, a  setof experiments showing that their transition-based graph parser is suitable fordirect parsing of UCCA graphs.I found this work interesting but before considering a publication, I haveseveral concerns with regards to the methodology and the empiricaljustifications:The authors claimed that there are the first to propose a parser for asemantically-oriented scheme such as theirs. Of course, they are. But with alldue respect to the work behind this scheme, it is made of graphs with a variouslevel of under-specified structural arguments and semantically oriented label(Process, state) and nothing in their transition sets treats the specificitiesof such a", "graph. Even the transitions related to the remote edges could havebeen handled by the other ones assuming a difference in the label set itself(like adding an affix for example). If we restrict the problem to graphparsing, many works post the 2014-2015 semeval shared tasks (Almeda andMartins, 2014,2015 ; Ribeyre et al, 2014-2015) proposed an extension totransition-based graph parser or an adaptation of a higher-model one, andnothing precludes their use on this data set.  It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s mostly the use of aspecific feature template that anchors this model to this scheme (even thoughit\u00e2\u0080\u0099s less influencial than the count features and the unigram one). Anyway,because the above-mentioned graph-parsers are available [1,2] I don\u00e2\u0080\u0099tunderstand why they couldn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t be used as a baseline or source of comparisons.Regarding the phrase-based  experiments using uparse,", "it could have been alsovalidated by another parser from Fernandez-Gonzales and Martins (2015) whichcan produce LCFRS-like parsing as good as Uparse (ref missing when you firstintroduced uparse).

At this point in the field,many systems, models and data set are competing and I think that the lack ofcomparison points with other models and parsers is detrimental to this work aswhole.

The authors formulate few-shot learning as a sequential meta-learning problem: each \"example\" includes a sequence of batches of \"training\" pairs, followed by a final \"test\" batch. The inputs at each \"step\" include the outputs of a \"base learner\" (e.g., training loss and gradients), as well as the base learner's current state (parameters). The paper applies an LSTM to this meta-learning problem, using the inner memory cells in the *second* layer to directly model the", "updated parameters of the base learner. In doing this, they note similarities between the respective update rules of LSTM memory cells and gradient descent. Updates to the LSTM meta-learner are computed based on the base learner's prediction loss for the final \"test\" batch. The authors make several simplifying assumptions, such as sharing weights across all second layer cells (analogous to using the same learning rate for all parameters). The paper recreates the Mini-ImageNet data set proposed in Vinyals et al 2016, and shows that the meta-learner LSTM is competitive with the current state-of-the-art (Matchin Networks, Vinyals 2016) on 1- and 5-shot learning.Strengths:- It is intriguing -- and in hindsight, natural -- to cast the few-shot learning problem as a sequential (meta-)learning problem.

ALI's objective is to match the joint distribution of hidden and visible units imposed by an encoder and decoder network. ALI is trained on multiple datasets, and it seems to have a good reconstruction even though it does not have an explicit reconstruction term in the cost function. This shows it is learning a decent inference network for GAN.There are currently many ways to learn an inference network for GANs: One can learn an inference network after training the GAN by sampling from the", "GAN and learning a separate network to map X to Z. There is also the infoGAN approach (not cited) which trains the inference network at the same time with the generative path. I think this paper should have an extensive comparison with these other methods and have a discussion for why ALI's inference network is superior to previous works.Since ALI's inference network is stochastic, it would be great if different reconstructions of a same image is included. I believe the inference network of the BiGAN paper is deterministic which is the main difference with this work. So maybe it is worth highlighting this difference.The quality of samples is very good, but there is no quantitative experiment to compare ALI's samples with other GAN variants. So I am not", "sure if learning an inference network has contributed to better generative samples. Maybe including an inception score for comparison can help.There are two sets of semi-supervised results: The first one concatenate the hidden layers of the inference network and uses an L2-SVM afterwards. Ideally, concatenating feature maps is not the best way for semi-supervised learning and one would want to train the semi-supervised path at the same time with the generative path. It would have been much more interesting if part of the hidden code was a categorical distribution and another part of it was a continuous distribution like Gaussian, and the inference network on the categorical latent variable was used directly for classification (like semi-supervised VAE).

The idea is to split the sample into two disjoint training and test sets, train a classifier on the training set, and use the accuracy on the test set as the test statistic.

A small experiment with sampling is interesting, but does not change the overall focus of the paper. This inconsistency in not acceptable. The whole issue could be resolved for example by simply replacing \"generative models\" by \"encoder-decoder networks\" in the title.

To clarify, the authors train encoder-decoders as generative models (VAE or VAE-GAN), but then remove all stochasticity (sampling) and prior on the latent variables: that is, they treat the models as deterministic encoders-decoders.

I do not see such papers as a contribution to ICLR, unless they also provide new insights, analysis, or surprising results (which, to my mind, this paper does", "not).

This is a nice result to know about--yet another example of a really nice result that one can get the first time one applies such methods to an old task--and all of the work that went into getting it looks solid (and likely involved some significant engineering effort).  However, this in itself is not sufficiently novel for publication at ICLR. ", "The paper also needs to be revised to better represent prior work, and ideally remove some of the vague motivational language.  Some specifics on what I think needs to be revised:- First, the claim of being the first to do sentence-level lipreading.  As mentioned in a pre-review comment, this is not true.  The paper should be revised to discuss the prior work on this task (even though much of it used data that is not public).  Ideally the title should also be changed in light of this.- The comparison with human lipreaders needs to be qualified a bit.  This task is presumably very unnatural for humans because of the unusual grammar, so perhaps what you are showing is that a machine can better", "take into account the strong contraints.  This is great, but not a general statement about LipNet vs. humans.- The paper contains some unnecessary motivational platitudes.  We do not need to invoke Easton and Basala 1982 to motivate modeling context in a linguistic sequence prediction task, and prior work using older sequence models (e.g. HMMs) for lipreading has modeled context as well.  The McGurk effect does not show that lipreading plays a crucial role in human communication.- It is worth noting that even without the spatial convolution, your Baseline-2D already does extremely well.

Audio-visual groundings are generated by measuring affinity between image patches and audio clips. This allows the model to relate specific visual regions to specific audio segments. Experiments cover image search (audio to image) and annotation (image to audio) tasks and acoustic word discovery.NOVELTY+SIGNIFICANCEAs correctly mentioned in Section 1.2, the computer vision and natural language communities have studied multimodal learning for use in image captioning and retrieval.

The CNN evaluated in this paperperforms perfectly at the task and the paper's goal is to inspect how theCNN works.The fundamental mechanism for this inspection is Class ActivationMapping (CAM) (Zhou et. al. 2016), which identifies regions of implicit attentionin the CNN. These implicit attention maps (localization heat maps) are used toderive actions (which square each player should move). The attention maps  (1) attend to squares in the tic-tac-toe board rather than arbitraryblobs,", "despite the fact that one square in a board has uniform color, and(2) they can be used to pick correct (winning) actions.This experiment are used to support assertions that the network understands(1) chess (tic-tac-toe) boards(2) a rule for winning tic-tac-toe(3) that there are two players.Some follow up experiments indicate similar results under various renderingsof the tic-tac-toe boards and an incomplete training regime.More Clarifying Questions===* I am not quite sure precisely how CAM is implemented here. In the original CAMone must identify a class of interest to visualize (e.g., cat or dog). I don'tthink this paper identifies such a choice.

Is rank correlation or Pearson correlation used?If Pearson correlation is used then it may be good to consider rank correlation,as argued in \"Human Attention in Visual Question Answering: Do Humans andDeep Networks Look at the Same Regions?\" by Das et. al. in EMNLP 2016.In table 1, what does the 10^3 next to RCO mean?Pros===* The proposed method, deriving an action to take from the result of avisualization technique, is very novel.* This paper provides an experiment that clearly shows a CNN relying on contextto make accurate predictions.* The use of a toy tic-tac-toe domain to study attention in CNNs(implicit", "or otherwise) is a potentially fruitful setting that maylead to better understanding of implicit and maybe explicit attention mechanisms.Cons===* This work distinguishes between predictions about \"what will happen\"(will the white player win?) and \"what to do\" (where should the whiteplayer move to win?). The central idea is generalization from \"what will happen\"to \"what to do\" indicates concept learning (sec. 2.1). Why should an ability toact be any more indicative of a learned concept than an ability to predictfuture states. I see a further issue with the presentation of this approach anda potential correctness problem:1. (correctness)In the specific setting proposed I see no difference between \"what to do\"and \"what will happen.\"Suppose one created labels dictating \"what to do\" for each example in theproposed dataset. How would these differ from", "the labels of \"what will happen\"in the proposed dataset? In this case \"what will happen\" labels includeboth player identity (who wins) and board position (which position they moveto win). Wouldn't the \"what to do\" labels need to indicate board position?They could also chosen to indicate player identity, which would make themidentical to the \"what will happen\" labels (both 18-way softmaxes).2. (presentation)I think this distinction would usually be handled by the Reinforcement Learningframework, but the proposed method is not presented in that framework orrelated to an RL based approach. In RL \"what will happen\" is the reward anagent will receive for making a particular action and \"what to do\" is theaction an agent should take. From this point of view, generalization from\"what will happen\" to \"what to do\" is", "not a novel thing to study.Alternate models include:    * A deep Q network (Mnih. et. al. 2015) could predict the value of      every possible action where an action is a (player, board position) tuple.    * The argmax of the current model's softmax could be used as an action      prediction.The deep Q network approach need not be implemented, but differences betweenmethods should be explained because of the uniqueness of the proposed approach.* Comparison to work that uses visualization to investigate deep RL networksis missing.

The connection to previous works could also be clearer. - On page 2 one finds the statement ``Furthermore, architectures are often compared via \u2018hardcoded\u2019 weight values -- a specific function that can be represented efficiently by one architecture is shown to only be inefficiently approximated by another.'' This is partially true, but it neglects important parts of the discussion conducted in the cited papers. In particular, the paper", "[Montufar, Pascanu, Cho, Bengio 2014] discusses not one hard coded function, but classes of functions with a given number of linear regions. That paper shows that deep networks generically* produce functions with at least a given number of linear regions, while shallow networks never do. * Generically meaning that, after fixing the number of parameters, any function represented by the network, for parameter values form an open, positive -measure, neighbourhood, belongs to the class of functions which have at least a certain number of linear regions. In particular, such statements can be directly interpreted in terms of networks with random weights. - One of the measures for expressivity discussed in the present paper is the number of Dichotomies. In statistical learning theory, this notion is used to define", "the VC-dimension. In that context, a high value is associated with a high statistical complexity, meaning that picking a good hypothesis requires more data. - On page 2 one finds the statement ``We discover and prove the underlying reason for this \u2013 all three measures are directly proportional to a fourth quantity, trajectory length.'' The expected trajectory length increasing exponentially with depth can be interpreted as the increase (or decrease) in the scale by a composition of the form a*...*a x, which scales the inputs by a^d. Such a scaling by itself certainly is not an underlying cause for an increase in the number of dichotomies or activation patterns or transitions.

The paper compares the LP", "collectives to two alternatives:  collectives based on a minimal spanning tree (MST) topology and collectives based on bidirectional exchange (BE).  First, a theoretical comparison is made using a standard cost model used in the high performance computing community.  When assumptions based on multi-GPU system architecture (very low latency for messages) and on the communication characteristics of synchronous SGD training (very large messages) are integrated into the model, the paper finds that the LP collectives should be less costly than BE collectives by a factor of 2 and less costly than MST collectives by a factor of log(p), where p is the number of GPUs being used.  Second, an empirical comparison is performed in which (1) the time required to perform each of the different", "collectives on a 4-device (k40m) system is measured as a function of message size and (2) the time required to perform each of the different collectives with a 200 MB message length is measured as a function of the number of devices in the system.  These measurements show that the LP-based collectives are consistently the fastest.  Third, DNN training experiments with AlexNet and GoogLeNet are performed on a 4-device system using three different synchronous SGD algorithms with the different implementations of the collectives (a total of 6 different algorithms in all).  Measurements of the communication and computation costs show that the LP collectives reduce communication costs without affecting computation costs (as expected).  Measurements of the convergence of the training loss as a function of", "time for the two DNN architectures show that use of the LP collectives leads to faster training.While the theory says that the costs of LP collectives should be invariant to the number of devices in a multi-GPU system, the empirical work shows that in practice this does not hold going from 4 to 5 devices (in the tested configuration) because in a 5-device system messages must traverse the QPI.

Importantly, the authors investigate whether it is possible to build an adversarial detector which is resilient to adversarial examples built against *both* the classifier and the detector. Their results suggest that training a detector in this more difficult setting still yields gains but does not entirely resolve the problem of detecting adversarial examples.Major comments:The authors describe a novel approach for dealing with adversarial examples from a security standpoint -- namely, build an independent system to detect the adversary so a human might", "intervene in those cases. A potential confound of this approach is that an adversary might respond by constructing adversarial examples to fool *both* the original classifier and the new detector. If that were possible, then this approach is moot since an attacker could always outwit the original system. To their credit, the authors show that building a 'dynamic' detector to detect adversarial examples but also be resilient to an adversary mitigates this potential escalation (worse case from 55% to 70% detection rate). Even though the 'dynamic' detector  demonstrates positive gains, I am concerned about overall scores. Detecting adversarial examples at this rate would not be a reliable security procedure.My second comment is about 'model transferability'. My definition of 'model transferability' is different then the one used in", "the paper. My definition means that one constructs an adversarial example on one network and measures how well the adversarial examples attack a second trained model -- where the second model has been trained with different initial conditions. (The author's definition of 'transferability' is based on seeing how well the detector generalizes across training methods). 'Model transferability' (per my definition) is quite important because it measures how general an adversarial example is across all models -- and not specific to a given trained model.

The approach is based on a CNN that, in contrast to most related papers, work in the space of affine transformations (instead of pixels or flow). Said another way, the network takes as input a set of affine transforms that describe the motion of patches in the past frames, and likewise, outputs a set of affine transforms that predict future patch motion.To that aim, the authors make a few simplifying hypotheses, namely, that a sequence of frames can be modeled accurately enough in their patch-affine framework. This is not unreasonable. A lot of papers in the optical flow community are based on similar hypotheses, i.e. model the flow", "as a smoothly varying affine field (for instance see \"Locally affine sparse-to-dense matching for motion and occlusion estimation\" by Leordeanu et al., \"EpicFlow: Edge-Preserving Interpolation of Correspondences for Optical Flow\" by Revaud et al., \"Optical Flow With Semantic Segmentation and Localized Layers\" by Sevilla-Lara et al.). These methods are state of the art, which gives a hint about the validity of this kind of approach. In addition, it also seems very reasonable to reformulate the prediction task as predicting motion rather than predicting raw pixels. Indeed, the (patch-affine) motion space is considerably smaller than the image space, making the problem much more tractable and amenable to high-resolution videos.While I agree with the authors on these points, I also find that the paper suffer from important flaws. Specifically: ", "- the choice of not comparing with previous approaches in term of pixel prediction error seems very \"convenient\", to say the least. While it is clear that the evaluation metric is imperfect, it is not a reason to completely dismiss all quantitative comparisons with previous work. The frames output by the network on, e.g. the moving digits datasets (Figure 4), looks ok and can definitely be compared with other papers. Yet, the authors chose not to, which is suspicious.    - The newly proposed metric poses several problems. First, action classification is evaluated with C3D, which is not a state-of-the-art approach at all for this task. Second, this metric actually *does not* evaluate what the network is claimed to do, that is, next frame prediction. Instead,", "it evaluates if another network, which was never trained to distinguish between real or synthetic frames by the way, can accurately classify an action from the predicted frames. I find that this proxy metric is only weakly related to what is supposed to be measured. In adition, it does not really make sense to train a network for something else that the final task it is evaluated for.    - how is the affine motion of patches estimated? It is only explained that the problem is solved globally (not treating each patch independently) in a pretty vague manner. Estimating the motion of all patches is akin to solving the optical flow, which is still an active subject of research. Therefore, an important flaw of the paper", "lies in the potentially erroneous etimation of the motion input to the network. In the videos made available, it is clear that the motion is wrongly estimated sometimes. Since the entire approach depends on this input, I find it important to discuss this aspect. How do motion estimation failures impact the network? Also, the patch-affine hypothesis does not hold when patches are large enough that they cover several objects with contradictory motion. Which appears to be the case on UCF101 videos.    - Even ignoring the weird proxy-evaluation part, the network is still not trained end-to-end. That is, the network is trained to minimize the difference between (noisy) ground-truth and output affine transforms, instead of minimizing a loss in the actual output space (frame pixels) for", "years old. Second, it is not really fair to assume a constant flow for all frames. At least some basic extrapolation could be done to take into account the flow of all pairs of input frames and not just the last one.

The proposed system is evaluated on various datasets, and the results demonstrate its effectiveness in classless association tasks.Overall, the paper presents an interesting approach for classless association using neural networks.

Polynomial features are widely used in machine learning algorithms for capturing higher-order interactions between features. However, the computation of polynomial features on large datasets can be computationally expensive, particularly when the features are sparse.Methodology:The authors propose an algorithm that exploits the sparsity of the input matrix to reduce the computational complexity of calculating polynomial features. The algorithm involves a two-step process. In the first step, the authors precompute all the possible polynomial terms up to a given degree. In the second step, the authors apply these terms to the input sparse matrix, exploiting its sparsity to reduce the number of", "computations required. They also propose a further optimization that enables them to avoid storing the precomputed polynomial terms entirely, which further reduces the memory requirements of the algorithm.Results:The authors demonstrate the effectiveness of their algorithm by comparing its runtime and memory requirements to two existing algorithms for calculating polynomial features on sparse matrices. The results show that the proposed algorithm outperforms the existing algorithms in terms of both runtime and memory usage.Critique:The authors have done an excellent job of proposing a novel algorithm for computing polynomial features on sparse matrices. The use of precomputing all the possible polynomial terms up to a given degree and exploiting the sparsity of the input matrix to reduce the computational complexity is a clever approach.
