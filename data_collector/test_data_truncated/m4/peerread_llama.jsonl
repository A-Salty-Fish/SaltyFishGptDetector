The architecture does not look entirely novel,but I kind of like the simple and practical approach compared to prior work.-----Weaknesses-----I'm not very convinced by the empirical results, mostly due to the lack ofdetails of the baselines. Comments below are ranked by decreasing importance.-  The proposed model has two main parts: sentence embedding and substructureembedding. In Table 1, the baseline models are TreeRNN and DCNN, they areoriginally used for sentence embedding but one can easily take thenode/substructure embedding from them too. It's not clear how they are used tocompute the two parts.- The model uses two RNNs: a chain-based one and a knowledge guided one. Theonly difference", "in the knowledge-guided RNN is the addition of a \"knowledge\"vector from the memory in the RNN input (Eqn 5 and 8). It seems completelyunnecessary to me to have separate weights for the two RNNs. The only advantageof using two is an increase of model capacity, i.e. more parameters.Furthermore, what are the hyper-parameters / size of the baseline neuralnetworks? They should have comparable numbers of parameters.- I also think it is reasonable to include a baseline that just inputadditional knowledge as features to the RNN, e.g. the head of each word, NERresults etc.- Any comments / results on the model's sensitivity to parser errors?Comments on the model:- After computing the substructure embeddings, it seems very natural to computean attention over them at each word. Is there any reason to", "use a staticattention for all words? I guess as it is, the \"knowledge\" is acting more likea filter to mark important words.

This is a very useful application because bothteachers and learners can benefit from this information (and many GEC systemsonly output a corrected version, without making the type of error explicit). Italso allows for finer-grained comparison of GEC systems, in terms of precisionin general, and error type-specific figures for recall and precision.Unfortunately, the description of the system remains highly superficial. Thecore of the system consists of a set of (manually?) created rules but the paperdoes not provide any details about these rules. The authors should, e.g., showsome examples of such rules,", "specify the number of rules, tell us how complexthey are, how they are ordered (could some early rule block the application ofa later rule?), etc. -- Instead of presenting relevant details of the system,several pages of the paper are devoted to an evaluation of the systems thatparticipated in CoNLL-2014. Table 6 (which takes one entire page) list resultsfor all systems, and the text repeats many facts and figures that can be readoff the table. The evaluation of the proposed system is not satisfying in several aspects. First, the annotators should have independently annotated a gold standard forthe 200 test sentences instead of simply rating the output of the system. Givena fixed set of tags, it should be possible to produce a gold standard for therather small set of", "test sentences. It is highly probable that the approachtaken in the paper yields considerably better ratings for the annotations thancomparison with a real gold standard (see, e.g., Marcus et al. (1993) for acomparison of agreement when reviewing pre-annotated data vs. annotating fromscratch). Second, it is said that \"all 5 raters individually considered at least 95% ofour rule-based error types to be either \u201cGood\u201d or \u201cAcceptable\u201d\".Multiple rates should not be considered individually and their ratings averagedthis way, this is not common practice. If each of the \"bad\" scores wereassigned to different edits (we don't learn about their distribution from thepaper), 18.5% of the edits were considered \"bad\" by some annotator -- thissounds much worse than the average 3.7%, as calculated in the paper.Third, no information about the test data", "is provided, e.g. how many errorcategories they contain, or which error categories are covered (according tothe cateogories rated as \"good\" by the annotators).Forth, what does it mean that \"edit boundaries might be unusual\"? A moreprecise description plus examples are at need here. Could this be problematicfor the application of the system?The authors state that their system is less domain dependent as compared tosystems that need training data. I'm not sure that this is true. E.g., Isuppose that Hunspell's vocabulary probably doesn't cover all domains in thesame detail, and manually-created rules can be domain-dependent as well -- andare completely language dependent, a clear drawback as compared to machinelearning approaches. Moreover, the test data used here (FCE-test, CoNLL-2014)are from one domain only: student essays.It remains unclear why a new set", "tagset? Then the CoNLL gold standard could have been used forevaluation.To sum up, the main motivation of the paper remains somewhat unclear. Is itabout a new system? But the most important details of it are left out. Is itabout a new set of error categories? But hardly any motivation or discussion ofit is provided. Is it about evaluating the CoNLL-2014 systems?

The goal of the study itselfis interesting for the ACL community and similar papers have appearedbefore as workshop papers and have been well cited, such as Nayak et al.'spaper mentioned below.- Weaknesses:Since this paper essentially presents the effect of systematically changing thecontext types and position sensitivity, I will focus on the execution of theinvestigation", "and the analysis of the results, which I am afraid is not satisfactory.A) The lack of hyper-parameter tuning is worrisome. E.g.   - 395 Unless otherwise notes, the number of word embedding dimension is setto 500.   - 232 It still enlarges the context vocabulary about 5 times in practice.   - 385 Most hyper-parameters are the same as Levy et al' best configuration.  This is worrisome because lack of hyperparameter tuning makes it difficult tomake statements like method A is better than method B. E.g. bound methods mayperform better with a lower dimensionality than unbound models, since theireffective context vocabulary size is larger.B) The paper sometimes presents strange explanations for its results. E.g.   - 115 \"Experimental results suggest that although it's", "hard to find any universal insight, the characteristics of different contexts on differentmodels are concluded according to specific tasks.\"   What does this sentence even mean?    - 580 Sequence labeling tasks tend to classify words with the same syntax to the same category. The ignorance of syntax for word embeddings which  arelearned by bound representation becomes beneficial.

Regarding the content, I have several concerns: 1 The logic of the paper is not clear and justifiable: 1) what are \"logical semantics\" and \"pragmatic function\"(line 115-116)? I'dprefer the authors to define them properly.2) macro discourse structure: there are some conflicts of the definitionbetween macro structure and micro structure. Figure 4 demonstrates thecombination of macro discourse structure", "and micro discourse structure. There,the micro discourse structure is presented *within paragraphs*. However, in thespecific example of micro discourse structure shown in Figure 6, themicro-level discourse structure is *beyond the paragraph boundary* and capturesthe discourse relations across paragraphs. This kind of micro-level discoursestructure is indeed similar to the macro structure proposed by the authors inFigure 5, and it's also genre independent. So, why can't we just use thestructure in Figure 6? What's the advantage of macro discourse structureproposed in Figure 5? For me, it's genre dependent and doesn't provide richerinformation compared to Figure 6.By the way, why sentence 6 and sentence 15 are missing in Figure 5? Is itbecause they are subtitles? But sentence 12 which is a subtitle is presentthere.2 Corpus construction (section 4) is not informative", "enough: without adetailed example, it's hard to know the meaning of \"discourse topic, lead,abstract, paragraph topics (line 627-629)\".

Should we report the agreementstudy for macro-level and micro-level separately? Second, it seems for me thatthe authors only take a subset of data to measure the agreement. This doesn'treflect the overall quality of the whole corpus, i.e., high agreement on theleaf nodes", "clear to me, you meanthe discourse relations between paragraphs?

The current experiment is not veryconvincing: a) no strong baselines; b) features are not clearly described andmotivated; c) I don't understand why only a sub set of discourse relations fromTable 6 is chosen to perform the experiment of discourse relation recognition.In general, I think the paper needs major improvement and currently it is notready for acceptance."], "machine_text": [" Please write a peer review for the paper of + Exploring Macro Discourse Structure with Macro-micro Unified Primary-secondary Relationship (MUPSR) by Zhang, Xiaofeng, and Xiaohong Liu.Please write a peer review for the paper of + Exploring Macro Discourse Structure with Macro-micro Unified Primary-secondary Relationship (MUPSR) by Zhang, Xiaofeng, and Xiaohong Liu.

It also establishes a link betweenskip-gram and Sufficient Dimensionality Reduction.I liked the focus of this paper on explaining the properties of skip-gram, andgenerally found it inspiring to read. I very much appreciate the effort tounderstand the assumptions of the model, and the way it affects (or is affectedby) the composition operations that it is used to perform. In that respect, Ithink it is a very worthwhile read for the community.My main criticism is however that the paper is linguistically rather naive. Theauthors' use of 'compositionality' (as an operation that takes a set of wordsand returns another with the same meaning)", "is extremely strange. Two words canof course be composed and produce a vector that is a) far away from both; b)does not correspond to any other concept in the space; c) still has meaning(productivity wouldn't exist otherwise!) Compositionality in linguistic termssimply refers to the process of combining linguistic constituents to producehigher-level constructs. It does not assume any further constraint, apart fromsome vague (and debatable) notion of semantic transparency. The paper'simplication (l254) that composition takes place over sets is also wrong:ordering matters hugely (e.g. 'sugar cane' is not 'cane sugar'). This is awell-known shortcoming of additive composition. Another important aspect is that there are pragmatic factors that make humansprefer certain phrases to single words in particular contexts (and theopposite), naturally changing the underlying distribution of words in a largecorpus.", "For instance, talking of a 'male royalty' rather than a 'king' or'prince' usually has implications with regard to the intent of the speaker(here, perhaps highlighting a gender difference). This means that the equationin l258 (or for that matter the KL-divergence modification) does not hold, notbecause of noise in the data, but because of fundamental linguistic processes.This point may be addressed by the section on SDR, but I am not completely sure(see my comments below).In a nutshell, I think the way that the authors present composition is flawed,but the paper convinces me that this is indeed what happens in skip-gram, and Ithink this is an interesting contribution. The part about Sufficient Dimensionality Reduction seems a little disconnectedfrom the previous argument as it stands. I'm afraid I wasn't able to", "fullyfollow the argument, and I would be grateful for some clarification in theauthors' response. If I understand it well, the argument is that skip-gramproduces a model where a word's neighbours follow some exponentialparametrisation of a categorical distribution, but it is unclear whether thisactually reflects the distribution of the corpus (as opposed to what happensin, say, a pure count-based model). The fact that skip-gram performs welldespite not reflecting the data is that it implements some form of SDR, whichdoes not need to make any assumption about the underlying form of the data. Butthen, is it fair to say that the resulting representations are optimised fortasks where geometrical regularities are important, regardless of the actualpattern of the data?

Atprediction time, after encoding utterances 1 to k, a context z is sampled, andthe decoder is greedily used to generate a response from this. The evaluationshows small improvements in BLEU scores over a vanilla seq2seq model that doesnot involve learning a probability distribution over contexts and sampling fromthis.The paper is certainly impressive from a technical point of view, i.e. in theapplication of deep learning methods, specifically conditioned variational autoencoders, to the problem of response generation, and its attendant difficultiesin training such models. Their use of Information-Retrieval techniques to getmore than one reference response is also interesting. I have some conceptual comments on the introduction and the motivations behindthe work,", "some on the model architecture, and the evaluation which I writebelow in turn:Comments on the introduction and motivations\u2026. The authors seem not fully aware of the long history of this field, and itsvarious facets, whether from a theoretical perspective, or from an applied one.1. \u201c[the dialogue manager] typically takes a new utterance and the dialoguecontext as input, and generates discourse level decisions.\u201d         This is not accurate. Traditionally at least, the job of the dialoguemanager is to select actions (dialogue acts) in a particular dialogue context.The                    action chosen is then passed to a separate generationmoduleforrealisation. Dialogue management is usually done in the", "context of task-basedsystems which are goal driven. The dialogue manager is to choose actions whichare optimal in some sense, e.g. reach a goal (e.g. book a restaurant) in as fewsteps as possible. See publications from Lemon & Pietquin, 2012, Rieser, Keizerand colleagues, and various publications from Steve Young, Milica Gasic andcolleagues for an overview of the large literature on Reinforcement Learningand MDP models for task-based dialogue systems.2. The authors need to make a clear distinction between task-based,goal-oriented dialogue, and chatbots/social bots, the latter being usually nomore than a language model, albeit a sophisticated one (though see Wen et. al.2016). What is required from these two types of system is usually distinct.Whereas the former is required to complete a task, the latter is, perhaps onlyrequired to keep the user", "engaged. Indeed the data-driven methods that havebeen used to build such systems are usually very different. 3. The authors refer to \u2018open-domain\u2019 conversation. I would suggest thatthere is no such thing as open-domain conversation - conversation is always inthe context of some activity and for doing/achieving something specific in theworld. And it is this overarching goal, the overarching activity, thisoverarching genre, which determines the outward shape of dialogues anddetermines what sorts of dialogue structure are coherent. Coherence itself isactivity/context-specific. Indeed a human is not capable of open-domaindialogue: if they are faced with a conversational topic or genre that they havenever participated in, they would embarrass themselves with utterances thatwould look incoherent and out of place to others already familiar with it.(think of a random person on the street", "trying to follow the conversations atsome coffee break at ACL). This is the fundamental problem I see with systemsthat attempt to use data from an EXTREMELY DIVERSE, open-ended set ofconversational genres (e.g. movie subtitles) in order to train one model,mushing everything together so that what emerges at the other end is just verygood grammatical structure. Or very generic responses. Comments on the model architecture:Rather than generate from a single encoded context, the authors induce adistribution over possible contexts, sample from this, and generate greedilywith the decoder. It seems to me that this general model is counter intuitive,and goes against evidence from the Linguistic/Psycholinguistic literature ondialogue: this literature shows that people tend to resolve potential problemsin understanding and acceptance very locally - i.e. make sure they agree onwhat the", "context of the conversation is - and only then move on with the restof the conversation, so that at any given point, there is little uncertaintyabout the current context of the conversation. The massive diversity one seesresults from the diversity in what the conversation is actually trying toachieve (see above), diversity in topics and contexts etc, so that in a given,fixed context, there is a multitude of possible next actions, all coherent, butleading the conversation down a different path.It therefore seems strange to me at least to shift the burden of explainingdiversity and coherence in follow-up actions to that of thelinguistic/verbal/surface contexts in which they are uttered, though of course,uncertainty here can also arise as a result of mismatches in vocabulary,grammars, concepts, people\u2019s backgrounds etc. But this probably", "wouldn\u2019texplain much of the variation in follow-up response. In fact, at least as far as task-based Dialogue systems are concerned, thechallenge is to capture synonymy of contexts, i.e. dialogues that are distincton the surface, but lead to the same or similar context, either in virtue ofinteractional and syntactic equivalence relations, or synonymy relations thatmight hold in a particular domain between words or sequences of words (e.g.\u201cwhat is your destination?\u201d = \u201cwhere would you like to go?\u201d in a flightbooking domain). See e.g. Bordes & Weston, 2016; and Kalatzis, Eshghi & Lemon,2016 - the latter use a grammar to cluster semantically similar dialogues.Comments on the evaluation:The authors seek to show that their model can generate more coherent, and morediverse responses.

The authors combine the following in their complexmodel:                          (1) a set of traditional classifiers for detectingeventmentions,factuality sources, and source introducing predicates (SIPs), (2) Abidirectional attention-based LSTM model that learns latent representations forelements", "on different dependency paths used as input, (2) A CNN that usesrepresentations from the LSTM and performs two output predictions (one todetect specific from underspecified cases and another to predict the actualfactuality class). From the methodological point of view, the authors are combining a reasonablyfamiliar methods (att-BiLSTM and CNN) into a fairly complex model. However,this model does not take raw text (sequence of word embeddings) as input, butrather hand-crafted features (e.g., different dependency paths combiningfactuality concepts, e.g., sources, SIPs, and clues). The usage of hand-craftedfeatures is somewhat surprising if coupled with complex deep model. Theevaluation seems a bit tainted as the authors report the results from foldedcross-validation but do not report how they optimized the hyperparameters ofthe model. Finally, the results are not too convincing -- considering thecomplexity", "of the model and the amount of preprocessing required (extraction ofevent mentions, SIPs, and clues), a 2% macro-average gain over the rule-basedbaseline and overall 44% performance seems modest, at best (looking atMicro-average, the proposed model doesn't outperform simple MaxEnt classifier).The paper is generally well-written and fairly easy to understand. Altogether,I find this paper to be informative to an extent, but in it's current form nota great read for a top-tier conference.   Remarks:1. You keep mentioning that the LSTM and CNN in your model are combined\"properly\" -- what does that actually mean? How does this \"properness\"manifest? What would be the improper way to combine the models?2. I find the motivation/justification for the two output design rather weak:     - the first argument that it", "allows for later addition of cues (i.emanually-designed features) kind of beats the \"learning representations\"advantage of using deep models.         - the second argument about this design tackling the imbalance in thetraining set is kind of hand-wavy as there is no experimental support for thisclaim. 3. You first motivate the usage of your complex DL architecture with learninglatent representations and avoiding manual design and feature computation.  Andthen you define a set of manually designed features (several dependency pathsand lexical features) as input for the model. Do you notice the discrepancy? 4. The LSTMs (bidirectional, and also with attention) have by now alreadybecome a standard model for various NLP tasks.

It is easy to assume that Chinese WordSegmentation is about as easy as tokenizing English text into strings delimitedby white space.

Theintroduction presents the key claims of the paper: Previous CNNapproaches are bad when no phrase-level supervision is present.Phrase-level annotation is expensive. The contribution of this paper isinstead a \"simple model\" using other linguistic resources.The related work section provides a good review of sentimentliterature. However, there is no mention of previous attempts atlinguistic regularization (e.g., [YOG14]).The explanation of the regularizers in section 4 is rather lengthy andrepetitive. The listing on p. 3 could very well be merged with therespective subsection", "4.1-4.4. Notation in this section is inconsistentand generally hard to follow. Most notably, p is sometimes used with asubscript and sometimes with a superscript.  The parameter \\beta isnever explicitly mentioned in the text. It is not entirely clear to mewhat constitutes a \"position\" t in the terminology of the paper. t is aparameter to the LSTM output, so it seems to be the index of asentence. Thus, t-1 is the preceding sentence, and p_t is the predictionfor this sentence. However, the description of the regularizers talksabout preceding words, not sentences, but still uses. My assumption hereis that p_t is actually overloaded and may either mean the sentiment ofa sentence or a word. However, this should be made clearer in the text.One dangerous issue in this paper is", "that the authors tread a fine linebetween regularization and distant supervision in their work. Theproblem here is that there are many other ways to integrate lexicalinformation from about polarity, negation information, etc. into a model(e.g., by putting the information into the features). The authorscompare against a re-run or re-implementation of Teng et al.'s NSCLmodel. Here, it would be important to know whether the authors used thesame lexicons as in their own work. If this is not the case, thecomparison is not fair. Also, I do not understand why the authors cannotrun NSCL on the MR dataset when they have access to an implementation ofthe model. Would this not just be a matter of swapping the datasets? Theremaining baselines do not appear to be using lexical information, whichmakes them", "rather poor. I would very much like to see a vanilla LSTM runwhere lexical information is simply appended to the word vectors.The authors end the paper with some helpful analysis of themodels. These experiments show that the model indeed learnsintensification and negation to some extent. In these experiments, itwould be interesting to know how the model behaves without-of-vocabulary words (with respect to the lexicons). Does the modellearn beyond memorization, and does generalization happen for words thatthe model has not seen in training? Minor remark here: the figures andtables are too small to be read in print.The paper is mostly well-written apart from the points noted above.  Itcould benefit from some proofreading as there are some grammaticalerrors and typos left. In particular, the beginning of the abstract ishard", "is fair.LSTM: Good to know that you did this.

The definition of summarization is to reserve the main concepts ofdocuments. Therefore, the importance of a concept highly depends on thedocuments. For example, in the given topic of coal mining accidents, assumethere are two concepts: A) an instance of coal mining accidents and B) a causeof coal mining accidents. Then, if the document describes a series of coalmining accidents, A is more important than B. In comparison, if the documentexplores why coal mining accidents happen, B is more significant than A.Therefore, just given the topic and two concepts A&B, it is impossible to judgetheir relative importance.I appreciate the great effort spent by authors to build this dataset.

The first is that weare given almost no explanation as to why the pronunciation task would somehowrequire an attention mechanism similar to that used for the normalization task.", "Why the two tasks (normalization and pronunciation) are related is mentionedin the paper: spelling variation often stems from variation in pronunciation.

The experiments do not cover the claim of this paper completely.- General Discussion:This paper issues a simple but fundamental question about word representation:what subunit of a word is suitable to represent morphologies and how to composethe units. To answer this question, this paper applied word representationswith various subunits (characters, character-trigram, and morphs) andcomposition functions (LSTM, CNN, and a simple addition) to the languagemodeling task to find the best combination. In addition, this paper evaluatedthe task for more than 10 languages. This is because languages", "aretypologically diverse and the results can be different according to the wordrepresentation and composition function. From their experimental results, thispaper concluded that character-level representations are more effective, butthey are still imperfective in comparing them with a model with explicitknowledge of morphology. Another conclusion is that character-trigrams showreliable perplexity in the majority of the languages. However, this paper leaves some issues behind.-         First of all, there could be some selection bias of the experimentallanguages. This paper chose ten languages in four categories (up to threelanguages per a category). But, one basic question with the languages is \u201chowcan it be claimed that the languages are representatives of each category?\u201dAll the languages in the same category have the same tendency of wordrepresentation and", "Furtherexplanation on this issue is needed.-         In Section 5.2, this paper evaluated the proposed method only forArabic. Is there any reason why the experiment is performed only for Arabic?There are plenty of languages with automatic morphological analyzers such asJapanese and Turkish.-         This paper considers only character-trigram among various n-grams. Isthere any good reason to choose only character-trigram? Is it always betterthan character-bigram or character-fourgram? In general, language modeling withn-grams is affected by corpus size and some other factors. Minor typos: - There is a missing reference in Introduction.

During training, we attach aCTC objective to an attention-based encoder network as a regularization, asproposed by [Kim at al., 2016].\u201c Taking advantage of the constrained CTCalignment in a hybrid CTC-attention is the original idea from [Kim at al.,2016]. So the whole argument about attention-based end-to-end ASR versusCTC-based ASR, and the necessary of CTC-attention combination is not novel.Furthermore, the statement \u201cwe propose \u2026 as proposed by [Kim et al,2016]\u201d is somewhat weird. We can build upon someone proposal with additionalextensions, but not just re-propose other people's proposal.

You should be more clear about how the baseline wasimplemented. If the baseline was not tuned in a task-specific way, but thevisual embeddings were, this is even", "more concerning since it makes theperformances substantially less comparable.- I don't entirely understand why you chose to evaluate on classifyingwikipedia page titles.

In other words, I think that this contribution somehow falls short ofnovelty and substance in proposing a pipeline of engineered rules that aremostly inspired by other OIE systems (such as ClausIE or ReVerb); for instance,I would have really appreciated an attempt to learn these minimization rulesinstead of hard-coding them.Furthermore,", "the authors completely ignore a recent research thread on\u201csemantically-informed\u201d OIE (Nakashole et al., 2012; Moro and Navigli,2012; 2013; Delli Bovi et al., 2015) where traditional extractions areaugmented with links to underlying knowledge bases and sense inventories(Wikipedia, Wikidata, Yago, BabelNet).

Next, they propose clustering differentparaphrases of a word from PPDB using a multi-view clustering approach, toautomatically generate a sense inventory instead of using the aforementionedinventories. Finally, they use these clusters with a naive (majority in top 5)WSD technique to filter existing ranked list of substitution candidates.- Strengths:* The key idea of marrying vector space model based approaches and senseinventories for the lexsub task is useful since these two techniques seem tohave complementary", "information, especially since the vector space models aretypically unaware of sense and polysemy.* The oracle evaluation is interesting as it gives a clear indication of howmuch gain can one expect in the best case, and while there is still a large gapbetween the oracle and actual scores, we can still argue for the usefulness ofthe proposed approach due to the large difference between the unfiltered GAPand the oracle GAP.- Weaknesses:* I don't understand effectiveness of the multi-view clustering approach.Almost all across the board, the paraphrase similarity view does significantlybetter than other views and their combination.

For starters, the statistics of the queries(as I mentioned earlier) is a readily available means to assess whether thishappens. Second, maybe there can be some objective held out test set?

For example, does past research rely on any specificcross-sentential features that do not apply to tweets? Consider adapting themethod of a frame classification work oncongressional speech (or a stance classification work on any text) to theextent possible due to its limitations on Twitter data, to compare with theresults of this work.It seems \u201cweakly supervised\u201d and \u201cunsupervised\u201d \u2013 these two termshave been interchangeably used in the paper (if this is", "not the case, pleaseclarify in author response). I believe \"weakly supervised\" isthemore technically correct terminology under the setup of this work that shouldbe used consistently throughout. The initial unlabeled data may not have beenlabeled by human annotators, but the classification does use weak or noisylabels of some sort, and the keywords do come from experts. The presentedmethod does not use completely unsupervised data as traditional unsupervisedmethods such as clustering, topic models or word embeddings would.  The calculated Kappa may not be a straightforward reflection of the difficultyofframe classification for tweets (lines: 252-253), viewing it as a proof is arather strong claim. The Kappa here merely represents theannotation difficulty/disagreement. Many factors can contribute to a low value such as poorly written annotationguidelines, selection of a biased annotator, lack", "annotated data from calculating statisticsused to select the top N bi/tri-grams (line: 397 mentions entire tweets dataset has been used), otherwise statistics from any test fold (or labeled data inthe weakly supervised setup) still leaks intothe selection process.

The authorsevaluate their approach by inducing these synonym sets from Wiktionary and froma collection of Russian dictionaries, and then comparing pairwise synonymyrelations (using precision, recall, and F1) against WordNet and BabelNet (forthe English synonym sets) or RuThes and Yet Another RussNet (for the Russiansynonym sets).The paper is very well written and structured.              The experiments andevaluations(or at least the prose parts) are very easy to follow.              The methodologyissensible and the analysis of the results cogent.  I was happy to observe thatthe objections I had", "when reading the paper (such as the mismatch in vocabularybetween the synonym dictionaries and gold standards) ended up being resolved,or at least addressed, in the final pages.The one thing about the paper that concerns me is that the authors do not seemto have properly understood the previous work, which undercuts the statedmotivation for this paper.The first instance of this misunderstanding is in the paragraph beginning online 064, where OmegaWiki is lumped in with Wiktionary and Wikipedia in adiscussion of resources that are \"not formally structured\" and that contain\"undisambiguated synonyms\".  In reality, OmegaWiki is distinguished from theother two resources by using a formal structure (a relational database) basedon word senses rather than orthographic forms.              Translations,", "synonyms,andother semantic annotations in OmegaWiki are therefore unambiguous.The second, and more serious, misunderstanding comes in the three paragraphsbeginning on lines 092, 108, and 120.  Here the paper claims that both BabelNetand UBY \"rely on English WordNet as a pivot for mapping of existing resources\"and criticizes this mapping as being \"error-prone\".  Though it is true thatBabelNet uses WordNet as a pivot, UBY does not.  UBY is basically ageneral-purpose specification for the representation of lexical-semanticresources and of links between them.  It exists independently of any givenlexical-semantic resource (including WordNet) and of any given alignmentbetween resources (including ones based on \"similarity of dictionarydefinitions\" or \"cross-lingual links\").  Its maintainers have made availablevarious databases adhering to the UBY spec; these contain a variety oflexical-semantic resources which have been", "aligned with a variety of differentmethods.  A given UBY database can be *queried* for synsets, but UBY itselfdoes not *generate* those synsets.  Users are free to produce their owndatabases by importing whatever lexical-semantic resources and alignmentsthereof are best suited to their purposes.  The three criticisms of UBY onlines 120 to 125 are therefore entirely misplaced.In fact, I think at least one of the criticisms is not appropriate even withrespect to BabelNet.  The authors claim that Watset may be superior to BabelNetbecause BabelNet's mapping and use of machine translation are error-prone.  Theimplication here is that Watset's method is error-free, or at leastsignificantly less error-prone.  This is a very grandiose claim that I do notbelieve is supported by what the authors ought to have", "known in advance abouttheir similarity-based sense linking algorithms and graph clusteringalgorithms, let alone by the results of their study.  I think this criticismought to be moderated.              Also, I think the third criticism (BabelNet'srelianceon WordNet as a pivot) somewhat misses the point -- surely the most importantissue to highlight isn't the fact that the pivot is English, but rather thatits synsets are already manually sense-annotated.I think the last paragraph of \u00a71 and the first two paragraphs of \u00a72 should beextensively revised. They should focus on the *general* problem of generatingsynsets by sense-level alignment/translation of LSRs (see Gurevych et al., 2016for a survey), rather than particularly on BabelNet (which uses certainparticular methods) and UBY (which doesn't", "use any particular methods, but canaggregate the results of existing ones).  It may be helpful to point outsomewhere that although alignment/translation methods *can* be used to producesynsets or to enrich existing ones, that's not always an explicit goal of theprocess.  Sometimes it's just a serendipitous (if noisy) side-effect ofaligning/translating resources with differing granularities.Finally, at several points in the paper (lines 153, 433), the \"synsets\" of TWSIof JoBimText are criticized for including too many words that are hypernyms,co-hypnomyms, etc. instead of synonyms.  But is this problem really unique toTWSI and JoBimText?  That is, how often do hypernyms, co-hypernyms, etc. appearin the output of Watset?  (We can get only a very vague idea of this fromcomparing Tables 3 and 5, which analyze only synonym relations.)", " If Watsetreally is better at filtering out words with other semantic relations, then itwould be nice to see some quantitative evidence of this.Some further relatively minor points that should nonetheless be fixed:* Lines 047 to 049: The sentence about Kiselev et al. (2015) seems ratheruseless.  Why bother mentioning their analysis if you're not going to tell uswhat they found?* Line 091: It took me a long time to figure out how \"wat\" has any relation to\"discover the correct word sense\".  I suppose this is supposed to be a pun on\"what\".  Maybe it would have been better to call the approach \"Whatset\"?

While parsing performance is worse than otherreported papers (e.g., Pust et al., 2015), those papers used additionalsemantic information. On the task of AMR realization, the paper demonstrates that utilizingadditional monolingual data (via back-translation) is effective relative to aseq2seq model that does not use such information.

When usingword-level relative entropy over samples from the teacher, this approach isshown to outperform previous variants on standard pivoting, as well as otherzero-resource strategies.This is a good contribution: a novel idea, clearly explained, and withconvincing empirical support.

First, it would beinteresting to see how robust this approach is to", "more dissimilar source andpivot languages, where intuitively the true p(target|source) andp(target|pivot) will be further apart.

Guided by the actual Python grammar, the modelgenerates tree nodes sequentially in a depth-first fashion.

The model is evaluated onthree datasets from different domains and outperforms almost all previous work.Strengths:The paper is overall very well-written. The explanation of system is clear, andthe analysis is thorough.The system itself is a natural extension of various ideas.

As the authors describe well, themulti-task setting is important because some tasks have shared informationand in some scenarios learning many tasks can improve overall performance.The methods section is relatively clear and logical, and I like where it endedup, though it could be slightly better organized. The organization that Irealized after reading is that there are two problems: 1) shared features endup in the private feature space, and 2) private features end up in the shared space. There is one novel method for each problem. That organization upfront would make the methods more cohesive. In any case, they introduce one method that keeps task-specific features out of shared representation(adversarialloss) and another to keep shared", "features out of task-specific representations(orthogonality constraints). My only point of confusion is the adversarialsystem.After LSTM output there is another layer, D(s^k_T, \\theta_D), relying onparametersU and b. This output is considered a probability distribution which is comparedagainst the actual. This means it is possible it will just learn U and b thateffectively mask task-specific information from  the LSTM outputs, and doesn't seem like it can guarantee task-specific information is removed.Before I read the evaluation section I wrote down what I hoped the experimentswould look like and it did most of it. This is an interesting idea and thereare a lot more experiments one can imagine but I think here they have the basicsto show the validity of their methods. It would be helpful to have best knownresults on", "these tasks.My primary concern with this paper is the lack of deeper motivation for the approach. I think it is easy to understand that in a totally shared modelthere will be problems due to conflicts in feature space. The extension to partially shared features seems like a reaction to that issue -- one would expect that the useful shared information is in the shared latent space and each task-specific space would learn features for that space. Maybe this worksand maybe it doesn't, but the logic is clear to me. In contrast, the authorsseem to start from the assumption that this \"shared-private\" model has thisissue.

I agree with the comment wrt cross-modal mapping. What I don'tshare is the kind of equation \"visual = referential\" that you seem to assume. Areferent can be visually presented, but visual information can be usefullyadded to a word's representation in aggregate form to encode perceptual aspectsof the words' meaning, the same way that it is done for textual information;for instance, the fact that bananas are yellowwill not frequently be mentioned in text, and adding visual informationextracted from images will account for this aspect of the semanticrepresentation of the word. This is kind of technical and specific to how webuild distributional models, but it's also relevant if you think of humancognition (probably our representation for \"banana\"", "has some aggregateinformation about all the bananas we've seen --and touched, tasted, etc.). It would be useful if you could discuss this issue explicitly, differentiatingbetween multi-modal distributional semantics in general and the use ofcross-modal mapping in particular.Also, wrt the \"all models perform similarly\" comment: I reallyurge you, if the paper is accepted, to state it in this form, even if itdoesn't completely align with your hypotheses/goals (you have enough resultsthat do). It is a better description of the results, and more useful for thecommunity, than clinging to then-th digit difference (and this is to a large extent independent of whether thedifferenceis actually statistical significant or not: If one bridge has 49% chances ofcollapsing and another one 50%, the difference may be statisticallysignificant, but that doesn't really make the", "first bridge a better bridge towalk on).Btw, small quibble, could you find a kind of more compact and to the pointtitle? (More geared towards either generally what you explore or to what youfind?)----------The paper tackles an extremely interesting issue, that the authors label\"referential word meaning\", namely, the connection between a word's meaning andthe referents (objects in the external world) it is applied to. If I understoodit correctly, they argue thatthis is different from a typical word meaning representation as obtained e.g.with distributionalmethods, because one thing is the abstract \"lexical meaning\" of a word and theother which label is appropriate for a given referent with specific properties(in a specific context, although context is something they explicitly leaveaside in this paper). This hypothesis has been previously explored in work bySchlangen", "and colleagues (cited in the paper). The paper explores referentialword meaning empirically on a specific version of the task of ReferentialExpression Generation (REG), namely, generating the appropriate noun for agiven visually represented object.- Strengths:1) The problem they tackle I find extremely interesting; as they argue, REG isa problem that had previously been addressed mainly using symbolic methods,that did not easily allow for an exploration of how speakers choose the namesof the objects. The scope of the research goes beyond REG as such, as itaddresses the link between semantic representations and reference more broadly.2) I also like how they use current techniques and datasets (cross-modalmapping and word classifiers, the ReferIt dataset containing large amounts ofimages with human-generated referring expressions) to address the problem athand. 3) There are a substantial", "number of experiments as well as analysis into theresults. - Weaknesses:1) The main weakness for me is the statement of the specific hypothesis, withinthe general research line, that the paper is probing: I found it veryconfusing.  As a result, it is also hard to make sense of the kind of feedbackthat the results give to the initial hypothesis, especially because there are alot of them and they don't all point in the same direction.The paper says:\"This paper pursues the hypothesis that an accuratemodel of referential word meaning does notneed to fully integrate visual and lexical knowledge(e.g. as expressed in a distributional vectorspace), but at the same time, has to go beyondtreating words as independent labels.\"The first part of the hypothesis I don't understand: What is it to", "fullyintegrate (or not to fully integrate) visual and lexical knowledge? Is the goalsimply to show that using generic distributional representation yields worseresults than using specific, word-adapted classifiers trained on the dataset?If so, then the authors should explicitly discuss the bounds of what they areshowing: Specifically, word classifiers must be trained on the dataset itselfand only word classifiers with a sufficient amount of items in the dataset canbe obtained, whereas word vectors are available for many other words and areobtained from an independent source (even if the cross-modal mapping itself istrained on the dataset); moreover, they use the simplest Ridge Regression,instead of the best method from Lazaridou et al. 2014, so any conclusion as towhich method is better should be taken with a grain of salt. However, I'mhoping that", "the research goal is both more constructive and broader. Pleaseclarify. 2) The paper uses three previously developed methods on a previously availabledataset. The problem itself has been defined before (in Schlangen et al.). Inthis sense, the originality of the paper is not high. 3) As the paper itself also points out, the authors select a very limitedsubset of the ReferIt dataset, with quite a small vocabulary (159 words). I'mnot even sure why they limited it this way (see detailed comments below).4) Some aspects could have been clearer (see detailed comments).5) The paper contains many empirical results and analyses, and it makes aconcerted effort to put them together; but I still found it difficult to getthe whole picture: What is it exactly that the experiments in the paper tell", "usabout the underlying research question in general, and the specific hypothesistested in particular? How do the different pieces of the puzzle that theypresent fit together?- General Discussion: [Added after author response]Despite the weaknesses, I find the topic of the paper very relevant and alsonovel enough, with an interesting use of current techniques to address an \"old\"problem, REG and reference more generally, in a way that allows aspects to beexplored that have not received enough attention. The experiments and analysesare a substantial contribution, even though, as mentioned above, I'd like thepaper to present a more coherent overall picture of how the many experimentsand analyses fit together and address the question pursued.- Detailed comments:Section 2 is missing the following work in computational semantic approaches toreference:Abhijeet  Gupta,  Gemma ", "Boleda,  Marco  Baroni,  and Sebastian  Pado. 2015.

Theresults offer modest but consistent support for the general idea, and theyprovide some initial insights into how best to translate this idea into amodel.

We aren'treally told what the positive contribution will be except for the very generalfinal paragraph of the section.* Extending the above, I found it disappointing that the paper isn't reallyclear about the theory of causation being assumed. The authors seem to defaultto a counterfactual view that is broadly like that of David Lewis, wherecausation is a modal sufficiency claim with some other counterfactualconditions added to it.

It can't just be the temporalconstraint mentioned on page 3!* I don't understand the comments regarding the example on line 256. Theauthors seem to be saying that they regard the sentence as false. If it's true,then there should be some causal link between the argument and the breakage.There are remaining issues about how to divide events into sub-events, andthese impact causal theories, but those are not being discussed here, leavingme confused.* The caption for Figure 1 is misleading, since the diagram is supposed todepict", "only the \"Pair_LSTM\" variant of the model.

The model is modified such that thischunking information is used differently by two recurrent layers: while onefocuses in generating a chunk at a time, the other focuses on generating thewords within the chunk. This is interesting. I believe readers will enjoygetting to know this approach and how it performs.The paper is very clearly written, and alternative approaches are clearlycontrasted. The evaluation is well conducted, has a direct contrast with otherpapers (and evaluation tables), and even though it could be strengthened (seemy comments below), it is convincing.- Weaknesses:As always, more could be done in the experiments section to strengthen the casefor chunk-based models. For example, Table", "3 indicates good results for Model 2and Model 3 compared to previous papers, but a careful reader will wonderwhether these improvements come from switching from LSTMs to GRUs. In otherwords, it would be good to see the GRU tree-to-sequence result to verify thatthe chunk-based approach is still best.Another important aspect is the lack of ensembling results. The authors put alot of emphasis is claiming that this is the best single NMT model everpublished. While this is probably true, in the end the best WAT system forEng-Jap is at 38.20 (if I'm reading the table correctly) - it's an ensemble of3.

Adding a column to Table3 with decoding times would give more value to the paper.- General Discussion:Overall I think the paper is interesting and worth publishing.

However, in this case, the actual task itself is quite motivating to meand rather than the authors fishing for a new domain to run things in, itreally does feel like \"hey, wait, these standard systems perform poorly in asetting that's actually pretty important.\"THE TASK: Main concept resolution is an intriguing task from an IE perspective. I can imagine many times where documents revolve primarily around a particularentity (biographical documents, dossiers or briefings about a person or event,clinical records, etc.) and where the information we care about extracting isspecific to that entity. The standard coreference task has always had the issueof large numbers of", "mentions that would seemingly be pretty irrelevant for mostIE problems (like generic mentions), and this task is unquestionably composedof mentions that actually do matter.From a methodology standpoint, the notion of a \"main concept\" provides a bit ofa discourse anchor that is useful for coreference, but there appears to stillbe substantial overhead to improve beyond the baselines, particularly onnon-pronominal mentions. Doing coreference directly on Wikipedia also opens thedoors for more interesting use of knowledge, which the authors illustrate here.So I think this domain is likely to be an interesting testbed for ideas whichwould improve coreference overall, but which in the general setting would bemore difficult to get robust improvements with and which would be dwarfed bythe amount of work dealing with other aspects of the problem.Moreover, unlike past work", "which has carved off a slice of coreference (e.g.the Winograd schema work), this paper makes a big impact on the metrics of the*overall* coreference problem on a domain (Wikipedia) that many in the ACLcommunity are pretty interested in.THE TECHNIQUES: Overall, the techniques are not the strong point of this paper,though they do seem to be effective.

The dataset used is a previously existing set of 90 compounds, whosecompositionality was ranked from 1 to 5(by a non specified number of judges).The general form of each experiment is to compute a cosine similarity betweenthe vector of the compound (treated as one token) and a composition of thevectors of the components.Evaluation is performed using a Spearman correlation between the cosinesimilarity and the human judgments.The experiments vary- for the vectors used: neural embeddings versus syntactic-context countvectors- and for the latter case, whether plain or \"aligned\" vectors should be used,for the dependent component of the compound. The alignment tries to capture ashift from the dependent to the head. Alignment were proposed in a previoussuppressed reference.The", "results indicate that syntactic-context count vectors outperformembeddings, and the use of aligned alone performs less well than non-modifiedvectors, and a highly-tuned combination of aligned and unaligned vectorsprovides a slight improvement.Regarding the form of the paper, I found the introduction quite well written,but other parts (like section 5.1) are difficult to read, although theunderlying notions are not very complicated. Rephrasing with running examplescould help.Regarding the substance, I have several concerns:- the innovation with respect to Reddy et al. seems to be the use of thealigned vectorsbut they have been published in a previous \"suppressed reference\" by theauthors.- the dataset is small, and not enough described. In particular, ranges offrequences are quite likely to impact the results.

There is a lot of chance that resultsvary depending on the frequency ranges.How many judgments were provided for a given compound? Are there many compoundswith same final compositionality score?

The authors start first by exposing what, according to them,should cover a semantic-based annotation scheme: (i) being graph-based(possibility for a token/node of having multiple governors) (2) havingnon-terminal nodes (representing complex structures \u00e2\u0080\u0093 syntactic -: coordinatephrases, lexical: multiword expression) and (3) allowing discontinuous elements(eg. Verbs+particules). Interestingly, none of these principles is tied to asemantic framework, they could also work for syntax or other representationlayers. The authors quickly position their work by first introducing the largercontext of broad-coverage semantic parsing then their annotation scheme ofchoice (UCCA).              They then present 3 sets of parsing experiments: (i)", "onedevoted to phrase-based parsing using the Stanford parser and an UCCA toconstituency conversion, (ii) one devoted to dependency parsing using an UCCAto dependency conversion and finally (iii) the core of their proposal, a  setof experiments showing that their transition-based graph parser is suitable fordirect parsing of UCCA graphs.I found this work interesting but before considering a publication, I haveseveral concerns with regards to the methodology and the empiricaljustifications:The authors claimed that there are the first to propose a parser for asemantically-oriented scheme such as theirs. Of course, they are. But with alldue respect to the work behind this scheme, it is made of graphs with a variouslevel of under-specified structural arguments and semantically oriented label(Process, state) and nothing in their transition sets treats the specificitiesof such a", "graph. Even the transitions related to the remote edges could havebeen handled by the other ones assuming a difference in the label set itself(like adding an affix for example). If we restrict the problem to graphparsing, many works post the 2014-2015 semeval shared tasks (Almeda andMartins, 2014,2015 ; Ribeyre et al, 2014-2015) proposed an extension totransition-based graph parser or an adaptation of a higher-model one, andnothing precludes their use on this data set.  It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s mostly the use of aspecific feature template that anchors this model to this scheme (even thoughit\u00e2\u0080\u0099s less influencial than the count features and the unigram one). Anyway,because the above-mentioned graph-parsers are available [1,2] I don\u00e2\u0080\u0099tunderstand why they couldn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t be used as a baseline or source of comparisons.Regarding the phrase-based  experiments using uparse,", "it could have been alsovalidated by another parser from Fernandez-Gonzales and Martins (2015) whichcan produce LCFRS-like parsing as good as Uparse (ref missing when you firstintroduced uparse).  Because this scheme supports a more abstract view of syntaxico-semanticstructures than most of the SDP treebanks, it would have been important to usethe same metrics as in the related shared task.

The authors formulate few-shot learning as a sequential meta-learning problem: each \"example\" includes a sequence of batches of \"training\" pairs, followed by a final \"test\" batch. The inputs at each \"step\" include the outputs of a \"base learner\" (e.g., training loss and gradients), as well as the base learner's current state (parameters). The paper applies an LSTM to this meta-learning problem, using the inner memory cells in the *second* layer to directly model the", "updated parameters of the base learner. In doing this, they note similarities between the respective update rules of LSTM memory cells and gradient descent. Updates to the LSTM meta-learner are computed based on the base learner's prediction loss for the final \"test\" batch. The authors make several simplifying assumptions, such as sharing weights across all second layer cells (analogous to using the same learning rate for all parameters). The paper recreates the Mini-ImageNet data set proposed in Vinyals et al 2016, and shows that the meta-learner LSTM is competitive with the current state-of-the-art (Matchin Networks, Vinyals 2016) on 1- and 5-shot learning.Strengths:- It is intriguing -- and in hindsight, natural -- to cast the few-shot learning problem as a sequential (meta-)learning problem. While the authors did not originate", "the general idea of persisting learning across a series of learning problems, I think it is fair to say that they have advanced the state of the art, though I cannot confidently assert its novelty as I am not deeply familiar with recent work on meta-learning.- The proposed approach is competitive with and outperforms Vinyals 2016 in 1-shot and 5-shot Mini-ImageNet experiments.- The base learner in this setting (simple ConvNet classifier) is quite different from the nearest-neighbor-on-top-of-learned-embedding approach used in Vinyals 2016. It is always exciting when state-of-the-art results can be reported using very different approaches, rather than incremental follow-up work.- As far as I know, the insight about the relationship between the memory cell and gradient descent updates is novel here. It is interesting regardless.- The paper", "offers several practical insights about how to design and train an LSTM meta-learner, which should make it easier for others to replicate this work and apply these ideas to new problems. These include proper initialization, weight sharing across coordinates, and the importance of normalizing/rescaling the loss, gradient, and parameter inputs. Some of the insights have been previously described (the importance of simulating test conditions during meta-training; assuming independence between meta-learner and base learner parameters when taking gradients with respect to the meta-learner parameters), but the discussion here is useful nonetheless.Weaknesses:- The writing is at times quite opaque. While it describes very interesting work, I would not call the paper an enjoyable read.

The method introduces a novel two-stream encoder-decoder architecture, MCNet, consisting of two separate encoders -- a convnet on single frames and a convnet+LSTM on sequences of temporal differences -- followed by combination layers (stacking + convolutions) and a deconvolutional network decoder leveraging also residual connections from the two encoders. The architecture is trained end-to-end using the objective and adversarial training strategy of Mathieu et al.2) Contributions+ The architecture seems novel and is well motivated. It is also somewhat related to the two-stream networks of Simonyan & Zisserman, which are very effective for real-world action recognition.+ The qualitative results are numerous, insightful, and very convincing (including quantitatively)", "on KTH & Weizmann, showing the benefits of decoupling content and motion for simple scenes with periodic motions, as well as the need for residual connections.3) Suggestions for improvementStatic dataset bias:In response to the pre-review concerns about the observed static nature of the qualitative results, the authors added a simple baseline consisting in copying the pixels of the last observed frame. On the one hand, the updated experiments on KTH confirm the good results of the method in these conditions. On the other hand, the fact that this baseline is better than all other methods (not just the authors's) on UCF101 casts some doubts on whether reporting average statistics on UCF101 is insightful enough. Although the authors provide some qualitative analysis pertaining to the quantity of motion, further", "quantitative analysis seems necessary to validate the performance of this and other methods on future frame prediction. At least, the results on UCF101 should be disambiguated with respect to the type of scene, for instance by measuring the overall quantity of motion (e.g., l2 norm of time differences) and reporting PSNR and SSIM per quartile / decile. Ideally, other realistic datasets than UCF101 should be considered in complement. For instance, the Hollywood 2 dataset of Marszalek et al would be a good candidate, as it focuses on movies and often contains complex actor, camera, and background motions that would make the \"pixel-copying\" baseline very poor.

The NPE consists of an encoder and a decoder function. The NPE takes as input the state of pairs of objects (within a neighbourhood of a focus object) at two previous time-steps in a scene. The encoder function summarizes the interaction of each pair of objects. The decoder then outputs the change in velocity of the focus object at the next time step. The NPE is evaluated on various environments containing bouncing balls.- noveltyThe differentiable NPE is a novel concept. However, concurrently Battaglia et al. (NIPS 2016) proposes a very similar model. Just as this work, Battaglia et al. (NIPS 2016) consider a model which consists of a encoder function (relation-centric) which encodes the interaction among a focus", "object and other objects in the scene and a decoder (relation-centric) function which considers the cumulative (encoded) effect of object interactions on the focus object and predicts effect of the interactions.  Aspects like only considering objects interactions within a neighbourhood (versus the complete object interaction graph in Battaglia et al.) based on euclideian distance  are novel to this work. However, the advantages (if any) of NPE versus the model of Battaglia et al. are not clear.

The exposition starts by describing a general formulation about how this additional gradient information (termed K(p_gen) could be added to the generative adversarial training objective function (Equation 1). Next, the authors prove that the shape of the optimal discriminator does indeed depend on the added gradient information (Proposition 3.1), which is unsurprising. Finally, the authors propose three particular alternatives to construct K(p_gen): the negative entropy of the generator distribution, the L2 norm of the generator distribution, and a constant function (which resembles the EBGAN objective of Zhao et al, 2016).The exposition moves then to an experimental evaluation of the method, which sets K(p_gen) to be the approximate entropy of the", "generator distribution. At this point, my intuition is that the objective function under study is the vanilla GAN objective, plus a regularization term that encourages diversity (high entropy) in the generator distribution.

Some discussion about this result and whether the authors expected it or not would be very welcome.Table 1 and Figure 4 also show the 2-tier SampleRNN outperforming the 3-tier model in terms of likelihood and human rating respectively, which is very counterintuitive as one would expect longer-range temporal correlations to be even more relevant for music than for speech.

It's not clear what value the machine learning component in the proposed approach actually adds, if any. I could be wrong about this as I haven't done the comparison myself, but I think the burden is on the authors to demonstrate that using ML here is actually useful.I would argue that one of the strenghts of the dataset is the variety of label information it provides, so a much more convincing setup would have been to demonstrate many", "different prediction tasks for both low-level (e.g. pitch, onsets) and high-level (e.g. composer) characteristics, perhaps with fewer and simpler models -- maybe even sticking to spectrogram input and forgoing raw audio input for the time being, as this comparison seems orthogonal to the introduction of the dataset itself.

My comments appear below:1. As the authors point out, the AUROC/AUPR criterion is threshold independent. As a result, it is not obvious whether the thresholds that would correspond to a certain operating point (say a true positive rate of 10%) would be similar across different data sets. In other words, it would", "be interesting to know how sensitive the thresholds are to different test sets (or different splits of the test set).

I think it\u2019s a little hard to look at the differences in AUC/AUPR to get a sense for how much better the proposed classifier is than the random baseline.

The authors argue that the dynamic decomposition approach can more naturally reflect the acoustic pattern. Interestingly, the motivation behind this approach is analogous to learning the pronunciation mixture model for HMM based speech recognition, where the probabilistic mapping from a word to its pronunciations also conditions on the acoustic input, e.g.,I.

Astandard memory network architecture is trained on both bAbI and a version ofthe WikiMovies dataset (as in Weston 2016, which this work extends). Numerousexperiments are performed comparing the behavior of different trainingalgorithms under various experimental conditions.STRENGTHS: The experimentation is comprehensive. I agree with the authors thatthese results provide additional useful insight into the performance of themodel in the 2016 paper (henceforth W16).WEAKNESSES: This is essentially an appendix to the earlier paper. There is nonew machine learning content. Secondarily, the paper seems to confuse thedistinction between \"training with an adaptive sampling procedure\" and \"trainingin interactive environments\" more generally. In particular, no comparisons arepresented to the to the experiments with a static exploration", "policy presentedin W16, when the two training can & should be evaluated side-by-side.The only meaningful changes between this work and W16 involve simple(and already well-studied) changes to the form of this exploration policy.My primary concern remains about novelty: the extra data introduced here iswelcome enough, but probably belongs in a *ACL short paper or a technicalreport. This work does not stand on its own, and an ICLR submission is not anappropriate vehicle for presenting it.\"REINFORCEMENT LEARNING\"[Update: concerns in this section have been addressed by the authors.]This paper attempts to make a hard distinction between the reinforcementlearning condition considered here and the (\"non-RL\") condition considered inW16. I don't think this distinction is nearly as sharp as it'smade out to be. As already noted in Weston 2016, the RBI objective", "is a special case of vanillapolicy gradient with a zero baseline and off-policy samples. In this sense theversion of RBI considered in this paper is the same as in W16, but with adifferent exploration policy; REINFORCE is the same objective with a nontrivialbaseline. Similarly, the change in FP is only a change to the sampling policy.The fixed dataset / online learning distinction is not especially meaningfulwhen the fixed dataset consists of endless synthetic data.It should be noted that some variants of the exploration policy in W16 provide astronger training signal than is available in the RL \"from scratch\" settinghere: in particular, when $\\pi_acc = 0.5$ the training samples will feature muchdenser reward. However, if I correctly understand Figures 3 and 4 in this paper,the completely random initial policy", "achieves an average reward of ~0.3 on bAbIand ~0.1 on movies---as good or better than the other exploration policies inW16!I think this paper would be a lot clearer if the delta from W16 were expresseddirectly in terms of their different exploration policies, rather than trying tocast all of the previous work as \"not RL\" when it can be straightforwardlyaccommodated in the RL framework.I was quite confused by the fact that no direct comparisons are made to thetraining conditions in the earlier work. I think this is a symptom of theproblem discussed above: once this paper adopts the position that this work isabout RL and the previous work is not, it becomes possible to declare that thetwo training scenarios are incomparable.

I think ALI somehow stabilizes the GAN training as demonstrated in Fig. 8 and learns a reasonable inference network.---------------Initial Review:This paper proposes a new method for learning an inference network in the GAN framework. ALI's objective is to match the joint distribution of hidden and visible units imposed by an encoder and decoder network. ALI is trained on multiple datasets, and it seems to have a good reconstruction even though it does not have an explicit reconstruction term in the cost function. This shows it is learning a decent inference network for GAN.There are currently many ways to learn an inference network for GANs: One can learn an inference network after training the GAN by sampling from the", "GAN and learning a separate network to map X to Z. There is also the infoGAN approach (not cited) which trains the inference network at the same time with the generative path. I think this paper should have an extensive comparison with these other methods and have a discussion for why ALI's inference network is superior to previous works.Since ALI's inference network is stochastic, it would be great if different reconstructions of a same image is included. I believe the inference network of the BiGAN paper is deterministic which is the main difference with this work. So maybe it is worth highlighting this difference.The quality of samples is very good, but there is no quantitative experiment to compare ALI's samples with other GAN variants. So I am not", "sure if learning an inference network has contributed to better generative samples. Maybe including an inception score for comparison can help.There are two sets of semi-supervised results: The first one concatenate the hidden layers of the inference network and uses an L2-SVM afterwards. Ideally, concatenating feature maps is not the best way for semi-supervised learning and one would want to train the semi-supervised path at the same time with the generative path. It would have been much more interesting if part of the hidden code was a categorical distribution and another part of it was a continuous distribution like Gaussian, and the inference network on the categorical latent variable was used directly for classification (like semi-supervised VAE). In this case, the inference network would be trained at the", "the quality of the paper.The second semi-supervised learning results show that ALI can match the state-of-the-art. But my impression is that the significant gain is mainly coming from the adaptation of Salimans et al. (2016) in which the discriminator is used for classification. It is unclear to me why learning an inference network help the discriminator do a better job in classification. How do we know the proposed method is improving the stability of the GAN? My understanding is that one of the main points of learning an inference network is to learn a mapping from the image to the high-level features such as class labels.

For solving these tasks, the paper uses memory networks (Sukhbaatar et al., 2015) learned through previously proposed supervised learning and reinforcement learning methods. In this setup, it is demonstrated that the agent learning from feedback (e.g. through question asking or question clarification) performs better.The motivation for the paper is excellent; dialogue agents which learn directly from unstructured human feedback (as opposed to reward signals alone) could be very useful in real-world applications. However, the paper falls short on the execution. All the numerous experiments presented are based on the synthetic dialogue simulator, which is highly artificial and different from real-world dialogues. The simulator is based on", "a simple factoid question-answering framework, which normally is not considered dialogue and which appears to be solvable with a few hand-crafted rules. The framework also assumes that the user's feedback is always correct and is given in one of a handful of forms (e.g. paraphrase of original question without typos) and that the agent can learn from examples of another agent asking questions or making clarifications, which simplifies the task even further.Because of the artificial setting and limited scope of the experiments, it seems difficult to draw conclusions about how to learn from unstructured user feedback. To test the hypothesis that it is possible to learn from such user feedback, I would strongly recommend the authors to continue working on this project by carrying out experiments with real", "human users (even in the factoid question answering domain, if necessary). This would provide much stronger evidence that a dialogue agent can learn from such feedback.Other comments:- The abstract uses the phrase \"interactive dialogue agents\". What is meant by \"interactive\" dialogue agents? All dialogue agents interact with the user, so isn't it redundant to call them interactive?- A major limitation of the experiments is that the questions the agent can ask are specified a priori. If I understand correctly, in the supervised learning setting the agent is trained to imitate the questions of another rule-based agent. While in the RL setting, the paper states \"For each dialogue, the bot takes two sequential actions $(a_1 , a_2)$: to ask or not to ask a question (denoted as a_1 );", "benefit of synthetic tasks is precisely the ability to measure many aspects of model performance, but in this case it confuses the reader to present so many results.

Some detailed comments:- In Table 1 comparisons to Resnets, the resnets from He et al. 2016b and Wide Resnets should be compared to FractalNet (in lieu of a proper baseline). The first outperforms FractalNet on CIFAR-100 while the second outperforms it on both. The authors compare to other results without augmentation, but did not perform additional experiments without augmentation for these architectures.- The 40 layer Fractal Net should not be compared to other models unless the parameter reduction tricks are utilized for the other models as well.- A proper comparison to Inception networks should also be performed for these networks. My guess", "[1].- It should be noted that Residual/Highway architectures do have a type of anytime property, as shown by lesioning experiments in Srivastava et al and Viet et al.- The architecture specific drop-path regularization is interesting, but is used along with other regularizers such as dropout, batch norm and weight decay and its benefit on its own is not clear.Overall, it's not clear to me that the experiments clearly demonstrate the utility of the proposed architecture.

The idea is to split the sample into two disjoint training and test sets, train a classifier on the training set, and use the accuracy on the test set as the test statistic. If the accuracy is above chance level, one concludes that the two samples are from different distributions i.e., reject H0.A theoretical result on an asymptotic approximate test power is provided. One implication is that the test is consistent, assuming that the classifier is better than coin tossing. Experiments on toy problems, evaluation of GANs, and causal discovery verify the effectiveness of the test. In addition, when the classifier is a neural net, examining the first linear filter layer allows", "one to see features which are most activated. The result is an interpretable visual indicator of how the two samples differ.## Review summary The paper is well written and easy to follow. The idea of using a binary classifier for a two-sample testing is not new, as made clear in the paper. The main contributions are the analysis of the asymptotic test power, the use of modern deep nets as the classifier in this context, and the empirical studies on various tasks. The empirical results are satisfactorily convincing.

A3C could be run for a comparable computation cost with a lower action repeat, which would probably result in increased performance of A3C.  Nevertheless,  the automatic determination of the appropriate action repeat is interesting, even if the overall message seems to be to not repeat actions too often.- Slightly problematic notation, where r sometimes denotes rewards, sometimes denotes elements of the repetition set R (top of page 5)- In the equation at the bottom of page 5 - since the sum is not indexed over decision steps, not time steps, shouldn't", "separate loss for learning the critic)?

I do not rule out this paper for acceptance based on the length but I do hold it as a negative because clarity of presentation is an important quality.

In its current form, it is much too long to long and his not self contained without the appendices.Spending more time on multiplicative RNNs, order 2 networks at the begining of the paper would be excellent. This will let you highlight the difference between this paper and earlier work. It would also be necessary to spend a little time on why multiplicative RNN were less used than gated RNN: it seems that the optimization problem their training involve is tricker and it would be helpful to explain whether you had a harder time tweaking optimization", "parameters or whether you needed longer training sessions compared to LSTMs, regular CNN. On name, I am not sure that \"hypernetwork\" help the reader understand better what the proposed architecture compared to multiplicative interactions.In section 3.2, you seem to imply that there are different settings of hypernetworks that allow to vary from an RNN to a CNN, this is not clear to me, maybe you could show how this would work on a simple temporal problem with equations. The work on CNN and RNN are rather disconnected to me: for CNN, you seem to be interested in a low rank structure of the weights, showing that similar performance can be achieved with less weights. It is not clear to me why to pursue that goal. Do you expect", "speedups? less memory for embedded applications? In that case you should compare with alternative strategies, e.g. model compression (Caruana et al 2006, aka Dark Knowledge, Hinton et al 2014) or hashed networks (Chen et al 2015). For RNN, you seem to target better perplexity/BLEU and model compactness is not a priority. Instead of making the weights have a simpler structure, you make them richer, i.e. dependent over time. It seems in that case models might be bigger and take longer to train. You might want to comment on training time, inference time, memory requirement in that case, as you highlight it might be an important goal in the CNN section. Overall, I am not sure it helps to have this mixed message. I would rather see the paper", "fit in the conference format with the RNN results alone and a clearer explanation and defers the publications of the CNN results when a proper comparison with memory concerned methods is performed.Some of the discussions are not clear to me, I am not sure what message the reader should get from Figure 2 or from the discussion on saturation statistics (p10, Figure 5). Similarly, I am not sure if Figure 4 is showing anything: everything should change more drastically at word boundaries even in a regular LSTM (states, gates units should look very different before/after a space); without such a comparison it is hard to see if this is unique to your network.The results on handwriting generation are harder to compare for me.

I have three main issues with the paper in its current form, if these can be addressed I believe the paper would be significantly strengthened:1) Although the recursive splitting approach for extracting the \"key-frames\" seems reasonable and the feature selection is well motivated I am missing two baselines in the experiments:   - what happens if the feature selection is disabled and the distance between all features is used ? will this immediately break the procedure ? If not, what is the trade-off here ?    - an even simpler baseline than what is proposed in the paper would be the following procedure: simply use all frames of the recorded trajectories, calculate the distance to them in feature space and weights them", "according to their time as in the approach proposed in the paper. How well would that work ?2) I understand the desire to combine the extracted reward function with a simple RL method but believe the used simple controller could potentially introduce a significant bias in the experiments since it requires initialization from an expert trajectory. As a direct consequence of this initialization the RL procedure is already started close to a good solution and the extracted reward function is potentially only queried in a small region around what was observed in the initial set of images (perhaps with the exception of the human demonstrations). Without an additional experiment it is thus unclear how well the presented approach will work in combination with other RL methods for training"], "machine_text": [" Please write a peer review for the paper of + Unsupervised Perceptual Rewards for Imitation Learning by + Yoshua Bengio, + Aaron Courville, + Pascal Vincent, + and + Nicolas Heess.The paper is available at https://arxiv.org/abs/1705.08818.The review should be submitted by 2017-06-15.The review should be submitted by 2017-06-15.

Also training a model to predict the presence of motion from the unsupervised data only would probably do very well.

In the basic version, these two structures are each multi-layer perceptrons (MLPs).Overall, this is an interesting approach to understanding relations among entities.  The core idea is clear and well-motivated -- pooling techniques that induce invariance can be used to learn relations.  The idea builds on pooling structures (e.g. spatial/temporal average/max pooling) to focus on pairwise relations.  The current pairwise approach could potentially be extended to higher-order interactions, modulo scaling issues.Experiments on scene descriptions and images verify the efficacy of relation networks.

I will elaborate below.1) One of the most important claims of this paper is that CKM is faster to learn than convnet. I am not clear why that is the case. Both CKM and convnet use gradient descent during learning, why would CKM be faster?Also during inference, the running time of convnet only depends on its network structure. But for CKM, in addition to the network structure, it also depends on the size of training set. From this perspective, it does not seem CKM is very scalable when the training size is big.

For example, if the \"elements\" correspond to raw pixel intensities, a leaf kernel essentially compares the intensity value of a pixel in the query image with that in a training image. But in this case, wouldn't you end up comparing a lot of background pixels across these two images (which does not help with recognition)?I think it probably helps to explain Sec 3.1 a bit better.

Regarding approaches pursuing similar goals with a different learning objective, you cite siamese network with pairwise supervision.

Second, GAM relies on the scores given by the discriminators, which can be ill-posed (focus on artifacts). Since there is There is nothing wrong with mode collapsing when this happens under control. Thus, I believe that a better strategy would be to not choose and combine all generators into a mixture. Of course, this would require a way to decide on mixture weights. This can be done, for instance, using rejection sampling based on discriminator scores.2) The authors should provide a theoretical (or at least conceptual) comparison to dropout.

This latter method is closely related to Noise Contrastive Estimation, GANs, etc.The approach benefits from strong theoretical guarantees, with strict conditions under which each boosting iteration is guaranteed to improve the log-likelihood.

For me now the biggest problem now is that the title and the content do not correspond. The authors clearly attack deterministic encoder-decoder models (as described in 3.2), which are not at all the same as generative models, even though many generative models make use of this architecture. A small experiment with sampling is interesting, but does not change the overall focus of the paper. This inconsistency in not acceptable. The whole issue could be resolved for example by simply replacing \"generative models\" by \"encoder-decoder networks\" in the title. Then I would tend towards recommending acceptance.------Initial review:The paper describes three approaches to generating adversarial", "examples for deep encoder-decoder generative networks (trained as VAE or VAE-GAN), and shows a comparative analysis of these. While the phenomenon of adversarial examples in discriminative models is widely known and relatively well studied, I am not aware of previous work on adversarial examples for generative networks, so this work is novel (there is a concurrent work by Tabacof et al. which should be cited, though).  The paper has significantly improved since the initial submission; still, I have a number of remarks on presentation and experimental evaluation. I am in the borderline mode, and may change my rating during the discussion phase.Detailed comments:1) The paper is 13 pages long - significantly over the recommended page limit of 8 pages. Reviewers have to read multiple papers, multiple versions", "of each, it is a lot of work. Large portions of the paper should be shortened and/or moved to the appendix. It is job of the authors to make the paper concise and readable. \"in our attempts to be thorough, we have had a hard time keeping the length down\" is a bad excuse - it may be hard, but has to be done.2) I intentionally avoided term \"generative model\" above because it is not obvious to me if the attacks described by the authors indeed attack generative models. To clarify, the authors train encoder-decoders as generative models (VAE or VAE-GAN), but then remove all stochasticity (sampling) and prior on the latent variables: that is, they treat the models as deterministic encoders-decoders.

The authors provide sufficient model details to allow reproduction (although public code would be preferred). I find the experiments a bit unconvincing (see below) but appreciate the attention to model capacity (via number of parameter) when comparing the 2D and 3D model variants.I am concerned that the evaluation may be insufficient to assess the effectiveness of this method.

If the goal of this work is to count the number of such instances this is defensible, but for localization this seems overly loose.Furthermore, the 3D CNN architecture (which is one of the the core novelties of this work compared to past efforts) does not seem capable of producing variable sized boxes (as noted in the last paragraph of page 7), which I imagine results in poorer performance at higher IoU thresholds (as many of the weather events appear small).

The dataset is collected through a four-stage process -- article filtering, question collection, answer collection and answer validation. Examples from the dataset are divided into different types based on answer types and reasoning required to answer questions. Human and machine performances on NewsQA are reported and compared with SQuAD.Paper Strengths: -- I agree that models can benefit from diverse set of datasets. This dataset is collected from news articles, hence might pose different sets of problems from current popular datasets such as SQuAD.-- The proposed dataset is sufficiently large for data hungry deep learning models to train. -- The inclusion of questions with null answers", "is a nice property to have.-- A good amount of thought has gone into formulating the four-stage data collection process.-- The proposed BARB model is performing as good as a published state-of-the-art model, while being much faster.    Paper Weaknesses: -- Human evaluation is weak. Two near-native English speakers' performance on 100 examples each can hardly be a representative of the complete dataset. Also, what is the model performance on these 200 examples?-- Not that it is necessary for this paper, but to clearly demonstrate that this dataset is harder than SQuAD, the authors should either calculate the human performance the same way as SQuAD or calculate human performances on both NewsQA and SQuAD in some other consistent manner on large enough subsets which are good", "representatives of the complete datasets. Dataset from other communities such as VQA dataset (Antol et al., ICCV 2015) also use the same method as SQuAD to compute human performance. -- Section 3.5 says that 86% of questions have answers agreed upon by atleast 2 workers. Why is this number inconsistent with the 4.5% of questions which have answers without agreement after validation (last line in Section 4.1)?-- Is the same article shown to multiple Questioners? If yes, is it ensured that the Questioners asking questions about the same article are not asking the same/similar questions?-- Authors mention that they keep the same hyperparameters as SQuAD. What are the accuracies if the hyperparameters are tuned using a validation set from NewsQA?-- 500 examples which are labeled for reasoning types", "be very small.-- Suggestion: Answer validation step is nice, but maybe the dataset can be released in 2 versions -- one with all the answers collected in 3rd stage (without the validation step), and one in the current format with the validation step.

The adversarial prior has a convolutional form matching local image statistics, rather than the entire image.  The particular form of network architecture with the memory-based fully convolutional adversarial loss appears to be novel and potentially interesting.- Motivation for the Architecture. The weakest point of the proposed architecture is the \"Memory retrieval engine\" R (section 2.4),where images are retrieved from the memory by", "measuring L2 distance on pixel intensities. While this maybe ok for simple problems considered in this work, it is unclear how this can generalize to other more complicated datasets and problems.  This should be better discussed, better justified and ideally results in some more realistic set-up shown (see below).Quality:- Experiments. Results are shown for inpainting of MNIST digits, intrinsic image decomposition on the MIT intrinsic image database, and figure/ground layer extraction on the synthesized dataset of 3D chairs rendered onto background from real photographs.   The experimental validation of the model is not very strong and proof-of-concept only. All the experiments are performed in simplified toy set-ups.

When the temperature is varied, the analysis of Neal (2001) applies, and the answer is different.

I did not read the social media comments about this paper prior to reviewing it.  I appreciate the authors' updates in response to the reviewer comments.  Overall, however, my review stands.  The authors have taken a task that had not yet been addressed with a straightforward modern deep learning approach, and addressed it with such an approach.  I assume that if we pick up any task that hasn't been worked on for a while, and give it a solid deep learning treatment, we will do well.  I do not see such papers as a contribution to ICLR, unless they also provide new insights, analysis, or surprising results (which, to my mind, this paper does", "not).  This is a general point and the program chairs may disagree with it, of course.I have removed my recommendation that this be accepted as a workshop paper, as I have since noticed that the workshop track this year has a different focus.  ************************ORIGINAL REVIEW:The authors show that an appropriately engineered LSTM+CNN+CTC network does an excellent job of lipreading on the GRID corpus.  This is a nice result to know about--yet another example of a really nice result that one can get the first time one applies such methods to an old task--and all of the work that went into getting it looks solid (and likely involved some significant engineering effort).  However, this in itself is not sufficiently novel for publication at ICLR. ", "The paper also needs to be revised to better represent prior work, and ideally remove some of the vague motivational language.  Some specifics on what I think needs to be revised:- First, the claim of being the first to do sentence-level lipreading.  As mentioned in a pre-review comment, this is not true.  The paper should be revised to discuss the prior work on this task (even though much of it used data that is not public).  Ideally the title should also be changed in light of this.- The comparison with human lipreaders needs to be qualified a bit.  This task is presumably very unnatural for humans because of the unusual grammar, so perhaps what you are showing is that a machine can better", "take into account the strong contraints.  This is great, but not a general statement about LipNet vs. humans.- The paper contains some unnecessary motivational platitudes.  We do not need to invoke Easton and Basala 1982 to motivate modeling context in a linguistic sequence prediction task, and prior work using older sequence models (e.g. HMMs) for lipreading has modeled context as well.  The McGurk effect does not show that lipreading plays a crucial role in human communication.- It is worth noting that even without the spatial convolution, your Baseline-2D already does extremely well.  So I am not sure about the \"importance of spatiotemporal feature extraction\" as stated in the conclusion.Some more minor comments, typos, etc.:- citations for LSTMs, CTC, etc. should be provided the first", "collapsing them into one?  Since you list Neti et al.'s full viseme set, it is worth mentioning why you modified it.- \"Given that the speakers are British, the confusion between /aa/ and /ay/...\" -- I am not sure what this has to do with British speakers, as the relationship between these vowels exists in other English dialects as well (e.g. American).- The discussion about confusions within bilabial stops and within alveolar stops is a bit mismatched with the actual confusion data in Fig. 3(b,c).  For example, there does not seem to be any confusion between /m/ and /b/ or between /m/ and /p/.- \"lipreading actuations\":  I am not sure what \"actuations\" means in this context- \"palato-alvealoar\" --> \"palato-alveolar\"- \"Articulatorily alveolar\" --> \"Alveolar\"?"], "machine_text": [" Please write a peer review for the paper of + LipNet: End-to-End Sentence-level Lipreading with Deep Neural Networks by Liu et al.Please write a peer review for the paper of + LipNet: End-to-End Sentence-level Lipreading with Deep Neural Networks by Liu et al.Please write a peer review for the paper of + LipNet: End-to-End Sentence-level Lipreading with Deep Neural Networks by Liu et al.

The authors use a multimodal neural network architecture which accepts both image and audio (as spectrograms) inputs. Joint training allows one to embed both image and spoken language captions into a shared representation space. Audio-visual groundings are generated by measuring affinity between image patches and audio clips. This allows the model to relate specific visual regions to specific audio segments. Experiments cover image search (audio to image) and annotation (image to audio) tasks and acoustic word discovery.NOVELTY+SIGNIFICANCEAs correctly mentioned in Section 1.2, the computer vision and natural language communities have studied multimodal learning for use in image captioning and retrieval.

As such, the main architectural novelty lies in 1) restricting the pointer mechanism to focus on co-referenced entities, 2) applying pointer mechanism to 2D arrays (tables), and 3) training with supervised alignments. Although useful in practice, these are minor contributions from an architectural perspective.The empirical contributions are centred around measuring perplexity on the three", "language modeling tasks. Measuring perplexity is typical for standard language modeling tasks, but is really an unreliable proxy for dialogue modeling and recipe generation performance. In addition to this, both the dialogue and recipe tasks are tiny compared to standard language modeling tasks. This makes it difficult to evaluate the impact of the dialogue and recipe modeling results. For example, if one was to bootstrap from a larger corpus, it seems likely that a standard sequence-to-sequence model with attention would yield performance comparable to the proposed models (with enough data, the attention mechanism could learn to align referring entities by itself). The language modeling task on news article (Gigaword) seems to yield the most conclusive results.

The CNN evaluated in this paperperforms perfectly at the task and the paper's goal is to inspect how theCNN works.The fundamental mechanism for this inspection is Class ActivationMapping (CAM) (Zhou et. al. 2016), which identifies regions of implicit attentionin the CNN. These implicit attention maps (localization heat maps) are used toderive actions (which square each player should move). The attention maps  (1) attend to squares in the tic-tac-toe board rather than arbitraryblobs,", "despite the fact that one square in a board has uniform color, and(2) they can be used to pick correct (winning) actions.This experiment are used to support assertions that the network understands(1) chess (tic-tac-toe) boards(2) a rule for winning tic-tac-toe(3) that there are two players.Some follow up experiments indicate similar results under various renderingsof the tic-tac-toe boards and an incomplete training regime.More Clarifying Questions===* I am not quite sure precisely how CAM is implemented here. In the original CAMone must identify a class of interest to visualize (e.g., cat or dog). I don'tthink this paper identifies such a choice. How is one of the 18 possible classeschosen for creating the CAM visualization and through that visualizationchoosing an action?* How was the test set for this dataset for the", "table 1 results created?How many of the final 1029 states were used for test and was thedistribution of labels the same in train and test?* How is RCO computed? Is rank correlation or Pearson correlation used?If Pearson correlation is used then it may be good to consider rank correlation,as argued in \"Human Attention in Visual Question Answering: Do Humans andDeep Networks Look at the Same Regions?\" by Das et. al. in EMNLP 2016.In table 1, what does the 10^3 next to RCO mean?Pros===* The proposed method, deriving an action to take from the result of avisualization technique, is very novel.* This paper provides an experiment that clearly shows a CNN relying on contextto make accurate predictions.* The use of a toy tic-tac-toe domain to study attention in CNNs(implicit", "or otherwise) is a potentially fruitful setting that maylead to better understanding of implicit and maybe explicit attention mechanisms.Cons===* This work distinguishes between predictions about \"what will happen\"(will the white player win?) and \"what to do\" (where should the whiteplayer move to win?). The central idea is generalization from \"what will happen\"to \"what to do\" indicates concept learning (sec. 2.1). Why should an ability toact be any more indicative of a learned concept than an ability to predictfuture states. I see a further issue with the presentation of this approach anda potential correctness problem:1. (correctness)In the specific setting proposed I see no difference between \"what to do\"and \"what will happen.\"Suppose one created labels dictating \"what to do\" for each example in theproposed dataset. How would these differ from", "the labels of \"what will happen\"in the proposed dataset? In this case \"what will happen\" labels includeboth player identity (who wins) and board position (which position they moveto win). Wouldn't the \"what to do\" labels need to indicate board position?They could also chosen to indicate player identity, which would make themidentical to the \"what will happen\" labels (both 18-way softmaxes).2. (presentation)I think this distinction would usually be handled by the Reinforcement Learningframework, but the proposed method is not presented in that framework orrelated to an RL based approach. In RL \"what will happen\" is the reward anagent will receive for making a particular action and \"what to do\" is theaction an agent should take.

It discusses how these measures relate to the `trajectory length', which is shown to depend exponentially on the depth of the network, in expectation (at least experimentally, at an intuitive level, or theoretically under certain assumptions). The paper also emphasises the importance of the weights in the earlier layers of the network, as these have a larger influence on the represented classes of functions, and demonstrates this in an experimental setting. PROS The paper further advances on topics related to the expressive power of feedforward neural networks with piecewise linear activation functions, in particular elaborating on the relations between various points of view. CONS The paper further advances and elaborates on", "interesting topics, but to my appraisal it does not contribute significantly new aspects to the discussion. COMMENTS- The paper is a bit long (especially the appendix) and seems to have been written a bit in a rush. Overall the main points are presented clearly, but the results and conclusions could be clearer about the assumptions / experimental vs theoretical nature. The connection to previous works could also be clearer. - On page 2 one finds the statement ``Furthermore, architectures are often compared via \u2018hardcoded\u2019 weight values -- a specific function that can be represented efficiently by one architecture is shown to only be inefficiently approximated by another.'' This is partially true, but it neglects important parts of the discussion conducted in the cited papers. In particular, the paper", "[Montufar, Pascanu, Cho, Bengio 2014] discusses not one hard coded function, but classes of functions with a given number of linear regions. That paper shows that deep networks generically* produce functions with at least a given number of linear regions, while shallow networks never do. * Generically meaning that, after fixing the number of parameters, any function represented by the network, for parameter values form an open, positive -measure, neighbourhood, belongs to the class of functions which have at least a certain number of linear regions. In particular, such statements can be directly interpreted in terms of networks with random weights. - One of the measures for expressivity discussed in the present paper is the number of Dichotomies. In statistical learning theory, this notion is used to define", "the VC-dimension. In that context, a high value is associated with a high statistical complexity, meaning that picking a good hypothesis requires more data. - On page 2 one finds the statement ``We discover and prove the underlying reason for this \u2013 all three measures are directly proportional to a fourth quantity, trajectory length.'' The expected trajectory length increasing exponentially with depth can be interpreted as the increase (or decrease) in the scale by a composition of the form a*...*a x, which scales the inputs by a^d. Such a scaling by itself certainly is not an underlying cause for an increase in the number of dichotomies or activation patterns or transitions. Here it seems that at least the assumptions on the considered types of trajectories also play an", "the bias is comparatively too large... then we no longer see exponential growth.''OTHER SPECIFIC COMMENTS In Theorem 1 - Here it would be good to be more specific about ``random neural network'', i.e., fixed connectivity structure with random weights, and also about the kind of one-dimensional trajectory, i.e., finite in length, closed, differentiable almost everywhere, etc. - The notation ``g \\geq O(f)'' used in the theorem reads literally as |g| \\geq \\leq k |f| for some k>0, for large enough arguments. It could also be read as g being not smaller than some function that is bounded above by f, which holds for instance whenever g\\geq 0.

However, the model is restricted to using a linear decoder. Experimental results are positive but not convincing.Strengths:- The authors target a worthwhile and challenging problem: incorporating the modeling of uncertainty over hidden states with the power of flexible neural net-like models.- The idea of representing relationships between hidden states using KL divergence between their (distributions over) corresponding hidden states is clever. Combined with the Gaussian distribution over hidden states, the resulting regularization term is simple and differentiable.- This general approach -- focusing on writing down the problem as a neural network-like loss function -- seems robust and flexible and could be combined with other", "approaches, including variants of variational autoencoders.Weaknesses:- The presentation is a muddled, especially the model definition in Sec. 3.3. The authors introduce four variants of their model with different combinations of decoder (with and without variance term) and linear vs. MLP transition function. It appears that the 2,2 variant is generally better but not on all metrics and often by small margins. This makes drawing a solid conclusions difficult: what each component of the loss contributes, whether and how the nonlinear transition function helps and how much, how in practice the model should be applied, etc. I would suggest two improvements to the manuscript: (1) focus on the main 2,2 variant in Sec. 3.3 (with the hypothesis that it should perform best) and make the simpler variants additional \"baselines\"", "described in a paragraph in Sec. 4.1; (2) perform more thorough experiments with larger data sets to make a stronger case for the superiority of this approach.- The authors only allude to learning (with references to gradient descent and ADAM during model description) in this framework.

For this, the authors propose a sensible method to decorrelate the activations of intermediate neurons, with the aim of delivering complementary inputs to the final classification layers: they split intermediate neurons to a \"foreground\" and a \"background\" subset, and append side-losses that force them to be zero on background and foreground pixels respectively. They demonstrate that this can improve classification on a mid-scale classification example (a fraction of imagenet, and a ResNet with 18, rather than 150 layers), when compared to a \"vanilla\" baseline that does not use these losses.I enjoyed reading the paper because the idea is simple, smart, and seems to be effective.

The paper describes the implementation of these three collectives (broadcast, reduce, and allreduce) using a linear pipelining (LP) scheme on a (logical) ring topology.  The paper compares the LP", "collectives to two alternatives:  collectives based on a minimal spanning tree (MST) topology and collectives based on bidirectional exchange (BE).  First, a theoretical comparison is made using a standard cost model used in the high performance computing community.  When assumptions based on multi-GPU system architecture (very low latency for messages) and on the communication characteristics of synchronous SGD training (very large messages) are integrated into the model, the paper finds that the LP collectives should be less costly than BE collectives by a factor of 2 and less costly than MST collectives by a factor of log(p), where p is the number of GPUs being used.  Second, an empirical comparison is performed in which (1) the time required to perform each of the different", "collectives on a 4-device (k40m) system is measured as a function of message size and (2) the time required to perform each of the different collectives with a 200 MB message length is measured as a function of the number of devices in the system.  These measurements show that the LP-based collectives are consistently the fastest.  Third, DNN training experiments with AlexNet and GoogLeNet are performed on a 4-device system using three different synchronous SGD algorithms with the different implementations of the collectives (a total of 6 different algorithms in all).  Measurements of the communication and computation costs show that the LP collectives reduce communication costs without affecting computation costs (as expected).  Measurements of the convergence of the training loss as a function of", "time for the two DNN architectures show that use of the LP collectives leads to faster training.While the theory says that the costs of LP collectives should be invariant to the number of devices in a multi-GPU system, the empirical work shows that in practice this does not hold going from 4 to 5 devices (in the tested configuration) because in a 5-device system messages must traverse the QPI.  Are there other practical considerations that the authors are aware of that affect the scaling of the LP collectives?

From my own experience, this has never happend for me on e.g. Amazon EC2 cloud, however, it happens on our own cluster at my university, if the cluster is shared and some users make some nodes very busy. So maybe if the nodes would be dedicated to just user's job, it wouldn't be such a big concer (I am not sure what kind of cluster was used to produce Figure 3 and 4).

In my own experience, most of", "the time I get the gradient on time from all nodes equality fast, but maybe just in less than 0.1% of iterations I observe that it took maybe twice as long for some node. Also the increasing shape of the curve is somehow implying some weird implementation of communication. Isn't it only because you are somehow serialize the communication? And it would be maybe much faster if a \"MPI_Reduce\" would be used (even if we wait for the slowest guy)?2. asynchronous algorithms are cutting the waiting time, however, the convergence speed may be slower. Moreover, those algorithms can be divergence it special care is not given to stale gradients.

How did you tune the learning rates and other parameters for e.g. Figure 5 you provide some formulas in (A2) but clearly this can bias your Figures, right? meaning, that if you tune \"\\gamma, \\beta\" for each N, it could be somehow more representative? also it would be nicer if you run the experiment many times and then report average, best and worst case behaviour. because now it can be just coinsidence, right?"], "machine_text": [" Please write a peer review for the paper of + Revisiting Distributed Synchronous SGD by Y.

Privacy-preserving machine learning papers often analyze both the privacy (in the worst case, DP setting) and the learning performance (often under different assumptions). Since the learning performance might depend on the choice of architecture; future experimentation is encouraged, even using the same data sets, with different architectures.

Importantly, the authors investigate whether it is possible to build an adversarial detector which is resilient to adversarial examples built against *both* the classifier and the detector. Their results suggest that training a detector in this more difficult setting still yields gains but does not entirely resolve the problem of detecting adversarial examples.Major comments:The authors describe a novel approach for dealing with adversarial examples from a security standpoint -- namely, build an independent system to detect the adversary so a human might", "intervene in those cases. A potential confound of this approach is that an adversary might respond by constructing adversarial examples to fool *both* the original classifier and the new detector. If that were possible, then this approach is moot since an attacker could always outwit the original system. To their credit, the authors show that building a 'dynamic' detector to detect adversarial examples but also be resilient to an adversary mitigates this potential escalation (worse case from 55% to 70% detection rate). Even though the 'dynamic' detector  demonstrates positive gains, I am concerned about overall scores. Detecting adversarial examples at this rate would not be a reliable security procedure.My second comment is about 'model transferability'. My definition of 'model transferability' is different then the one used in", "the paper. My definition means that one constructs an adversarial example on one network and measures how well the adversarial examples attack a second trained model -- where the second model has been trained with different initial conditions. (The author's definition of 'transferability' is based on seeing how well the detector generalizes across training methods). 'Model transferability' (per my definition) is quite important because it measures how general an adversarial example is across all models -- and not specific to a given trained model. Different methods have different levels of 'model transferability' (Kurakin et al, 2016) and I am concerned how well the detector they built would be able to detect adversarial examples across *all models* and not just the trained model in question. In other words, a", "adversarial examples from any network and not just one particularly trained network.

Still, I think some the authors could make some effort to make the key concepts more accessible, and give a more intuitive understanding of what the separation rank means rather before piling up different mathematical interpretation.My SVM-era algebra is", "quite rusted, and I am not familiar with the separation rank framework: it would have been much easier for me to first fully understand a simple and gentle case (shallow network in section 5.3), than the general deep case.To summarize my understanding of the key theorem 1 result:- The upper bound of the separation rank is used to show that in the shallow case, this rank grows AT MOST linearly with the network size (as measured by the only hidden layer). So exponential network sizes are caused by this rank needing to grow exponentially, as required by the partition.- In the deep case, one also uses the case that the upper bound is linear in the size of the network (as measured by the last hidden layer), however,", "this situation is caused by the selection of a partition (I^low, J^high), and the maximal rank induced by this partition is only linear anyway, hence the network size can remain linear.If tried my best to summarize the key point of this paper and still probably failed at it, which shows how complex is this notion of partition rank, and that its linear growth with network size can either be a good or bad thing depending on the setting.

The proposed systemlearns to play 3 Atari games both individually and when trained on all 3 in amulti-task setup at super-human level.The results presented in the paper are very encouraging but there are manyad-hoc design choices in the design of the system.

It would be good to see  predictions for several actions sequences from some carefully chosen start  states.

More broadly, the paper contains an interesting and informative discussion on the strength and limitations on such methods for texture synthesis.Figure 4 shows that the optimisation of images with respect to shallow filter banks may result in texture", "images that have a lower VGG-19 loss than optimising the VGG-19 objective directly. This is imputed to the difficulty of optimising the highly non-linear VGG-19 cost function, which is a reasonable explanation. In the new supplementary material, the authors show that better optimisation results can be obtained by initialising the VGG-19-based optimisation with the shallow network optimisation results, which is a useful complement to the original experiments.The main limitation of the paper is that it does not systematically compare different methods against a quantifiable objective.

The paper does solid experiments on one synthetic dataset, and outperforms alternative methods on one real-world IFTTT dataset.

Firstly, claims are emphasized which are often violated in practice (e.g., no convergence guarantees due to mini-batches), statements could be validated more convincingly (e.g., is monotone convergence a curse or a blessing), the experimental evaluation should be extended. In summary, I think the paper requires some more attention to form a compelling story.Quality: I think some of the techniques could be described more carefully to better convey the intuition. At times apples are compared to oranges, e.g., back propagation is contrasted with CCCP.Clarity: Some of the derivations and intuitions could be explained in more detail.Originality: The suggested idea is reasonable albeit heuristics are required.Significance: Since the experimental setup is somewhat limited according to my opinion, significance is hard to judge at this point in time.Details:\u2014\u2014\u2014\u20141.

The approach is based on a CNN that, in contrast to most related papers, work in the space of affine transformations (instead of pixels or flow). Said another way, the network takes as input a set of affine transforms that describe the motion of patches in the past frames, and likewise, outputs a set of affine transforms that predict future patch motion.To that aim, the authors make a few simplifying hypotheses, namely, that a sequence of frames can be modeled accurately enough in their patch-affine framework. This is not unreasonable. A lot of papers in the optical flow community are based on similar hypotheses, i.e. model the flow", "as a smoothly varying affine field (for instance see \"Locally affine sparse-to-dense matching for motion and occlusion estimation\" by Leordeanu et al., \"EpicFlow: Edge-Preserving Interpolation of Correspondences for Optical Flow\" by Revaud et al., \"Optical Flow With Semantic Segmentation and Localized Layers\" by Sevilla-Lara et al.). These methods are state of the art, which gives a hint about the validity of this kind of approach. In addition, it also seems very reasonable to reformulate the prediction task as predicting motion rather than predicting raw pixels. Indeed, the (patch-affine) motion space is considerably smaller than the image space, making the problem much more tractable and amenable to high-resolution videos.While I agree with the authors on these points, I also find that the paper suffer from important flaws. Specifically: ", "- the choice of not comparing with previous approaches in term of pixel prediction error seems very \"convenient\", to say the least. While it is clear that the evaluation metric is imperfect, it is not a reason to completely dismiss all quantitative comparisons with previous work. The frames output by the network on, e.g. the moving digits datasets (Figure 4), looks ok and can definitely be compared with other papers. Yet, the authors chose not to, which is suspicious.    - The newly proposed metric poses several problems. First, action classification is evaluated with C3D, which is not a state-of-the-art approach at all for this task. Second, this metric actually *does not* evaluate what the network is claimed to do, that is, next frame prediction. Instead,", "it evaluates if another network, which was never trained to distinguish between real or synthetic frames by the way, can accurately classify an action from the predicted frames. I find that this proxy metric is only weakly related to what is supposed to be measured. In adition, it does not really make sense to train a network for something else that the final task it is evaluated for.    - how is the affine motion of patches estimated? It is only explained that the problem is solved globally (not treating each patch independently) in a pretty vague manner. Estimating the motion of all patches is akin to solving the optical flow, which is still an active subject of research. Therefore, an important flaw of the paper", "lies in the potentially erroneous etimation of the motion input to the network. In the videos made available, it is clear that the motion is wrongly estimated sometimes. Since the entire approach depends on this input, I find it important to discuss this aspect. How do motion estimation failures impact the network? Also, the patch-affine hypothesis does not hold when patches are large enough that they cover several objects with contradictory motion. Which appears to be the case on UCF101 videos.    - Even ignoring the weird proxy-evaluation part, the network is still not trained end-to-end. That is, the network is trained to minimize the difference between (noisy) ground-truth and output affine transforms, instead of minimizing a loss in the actual output space (frame pixels) for", "years old. Second, it is not really fair to assume a constant flow for all frames. At least some basic extrapolation could be done to take into account the flow of all pairs of input frames and not just the last one. Overall, the approach is not compared to very challenging baselines.  - I disagree with the answer that the authors gave to a reviewer's question.

Moreover, some claims in the paper look wrong in the light of these results, for example:- \"This suggests that our gains stem from the CC-GAN method rather than the use of a better architecture.\"- \"Since discrimination of real/fake in-paintings is more closely related to the target task of object classification than extracting a feature representation suitable for in-filling, it is not surprising that we are able to exceed the performance of Pathak et", "al.

The authors show that the representation learned by the discriminator of a conditional GAN trained for image inpainting performs well on image classification. As a side-effect, fairly convincing inpaintings are produced.The proposed method combines two existing ideas: using the discriminator of a GAN as a feature learner [Radford et al. 2015] and performing unsupervised feature learning with image inpainting [Pathak et al. 2016].

Overall, I am in the borderline mode, and I will gladly raise the score if the authors address my concerns regarding the experiments.1) Experimental evaluation on Pascal VOC is not quite satisfactory. Comparison with prior work is unfair because the network architecture used by the authors (VGG) is different from the architecture used by all existing methods (AlexNet). It is great that the authors do not try to hide this fact in the paper, but I do not understand why the authors are not willing to simply run their method with AlexNet architecture, although two commenters asked them to do so.

To this end, the authors extend the learning with robotic priors approach by extending the loss function with additional term for task coherence, i.e., a task only changes representation between training episodes.

It performs experiments of the three methods on several toy examples - including a two-layer network on MNIST - and shows that the second-order method behaves much worse then the brute-force baseline. In addition, from the success of the brute-force pruning the authors conclude that the hypothesis of Mozer et al - that neurons either contribute to performance or cancel out the effect of other neurons - is probably correct.The authors put in considerable effort to explain all details of the paper clearly and at length, so the content of the paper is accessible even to people novel to pruning methods.", "Additionally, the authors have very carefully answered all questions that were coming up through the pre-review and have been very responsive.My major criticism is that the paper lacks focus, does not have a concrete conclusion and does not explain what it adds to the literature. To make this apparent, I here summarise each paragraph of the conclusion section:Paragraph 1: We do not benchmark / Pruning methods do not fare well against brute-force baseline / Some evidence for hypothesis of Mozer & Smolensky, but further investigation neededParagraph 2: Introduced 2nd order Taylor method / Does not fare well against baselineParagraph 3: Re-training may help but is not fairParagraph 4: Brute-force can prune 40-70% in shallow networksParagraph 5: Brute-force less effective in deep networksParagraph 6: Not all neurons contribute equally", "to performance of networkThe title of the paper and answers of the authors to the pre-review questions seemed to strongly suggest that the paper is not about the new second-order method, is not about benchmarking pruning algorithms but is instead about the learnt representations. But only two or three sentences in the conclusion, and no sentence in the part on results in the abstract, even refers to neural representations. In an answer to the pre-review questions the authors stated:> Furthermore, we do not have to accept the conclusion that re-training is a necessary part of pruning because a brute force search reveals that neurons can in fact be > pruned from trained networks in a piecemeal fashion with no retraining and minimal adverse effect on the overall performance", "of the network. This would be > impossible if neurons did not belong to the distinct classes we describe.\"But this can already be concluded from the 2nd order method, which has a similar characteristic and is based on other 2nd order methods (not shown here). What is the motivation to introduce a new 2nd order method here?In addition, some other minor conclusions about representations - in particular the cancellation effect - might be based on side-effects of the greedy serial pruning method. Optimally, one would need to consider all the different ways of pruning (which, of course, scales exponentially with the number of neurons and is computationally infeasible). Notably, the authors do consider this limitation in the context of conventional pruning methods in the conclusions: \"Third, we assumed", "that pruning could be done in a serial fashion [...]. We found that all of these assumptions are deeply flawed in the sense that the true relevance of a neuron can only be partially approximated [...] at certain stages of the pruning process\". But the brute-force pruning process is also serial - why is that not a problem?All in all it is unclear to me what the paper adds: there are little conclusions regarding the learnt representations nor is there sufficient benchmarking against state-of-the-art pruning methods.
