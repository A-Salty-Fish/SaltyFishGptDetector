To make such systems robust, multiclass neural network classifiers capable of learning from noisy data have been suggested. However on large face data sets such systems cannot provide the robustness at a high level. In this paper we explore a pairwise neural-network system as an alternative approach to improving the robustness of face recognition. In our experiments this approach is shown to outperform the multiclass neural-network system in terms of the predictive accuracy on the face images corrupted by noise.", "summarize": " This paragraph discusses the negative impact of noise, corruptions and variations in face images on the performance of face recognition systems and suggests that multiclass neural network classifiers may not be effective in improving robustness on large face data sets.

Structures are represented by a prototype  template, combined with a parametric warp mapping used to  deform the original shape.

The  algorithm initially identifies regions in the image most likely to  contain the desired objects and then examines these regions at  progressively increasing resolutions.

Patterns occurring with a balanced interval do not have the anti-monotone property, where the subset is either equally good or better than the superset.

The problem of computing PageRank is interesting from a practical viewpoint only if the size of the matrix is large and if the type of the matrix is a web graph. What do we mean by \"large\"? Currently, search engines claim to index a number of pages in the order of 1010. We cannot expect, as scientists, to replicate exactly", "summarize": " this amount of data, but even smaller graphs are large enough to be computationally challenging. So, in order to focus on page ranking in large web graphs, we can assume that the number of pages and the number of links in the web are both in the order of 1010, i.e., we are dealing with a large-scale web graph.\n\nThere are many methods for computing PageRank, but we describe here the method of Anderson and Karypis, which we find to be quite efficient. As we shall see, their algorithm is based on a stochastic process that is a simple generalization of the diffusion process used by Page and Brin to evaluate link importance. The key advantage of this approach is that it allows us to compute PageRank for large-scale web graphs that cannot be represented as matrices, which is much more efficient and practical than using matrix methods.\n\nThe efficiency of Anderson and Karypis's algorithm is due to its ability to exploit the similarities and overlaps between pages in the web. In particular, it avoids the need to compute and store the entire adjacency matrix, which is often too large to hold in memory. Instead, it approximates the adjacency matrix by sampling pages at random and computing the probability of moving from one page to another. These probabilities are used to update the PageRank rankings iteratively until convergence.\n\nThe main advantage of this method is that it is very robust to noise and fluctuations in the web. For example, it works well even if a page has a large number of inbound links from low-rank pages, or if a page has few outbound links. It also works well if the web graph is highly clustered or if there are many cycles in the graph.\n\nOverall, we find the method of Anderson and Karypis to be a very effective approach to computing PageRank for large-scale web graphs. It is efficient, robust, and practical, and it can be easily extended to handle more complex and dynamic web graphs."}

Meghini and Spyratos[4] characterize  aggregations in terms of extension (the set of objects within it)  and intension (the meaning of the aggregation, as differentiates it  from others and specifies a homogeneity criterion for the  resources within it).

For example, if you are running a blog about travel, you might create categories for different regions, activities, and accommodations.\n2. Within each main category, create subcategories to further organize your content. For example, within the “Accommodations” category, you might create subcategories for different types of accommodations, such as hotels, hostels, and vacation rentals.\n3. Use tags to allow users to search for content by specific keywords. For example, you might create a tag for “beach” that users can use to find articles about travel destinations with beaches.\n4. Consistency is key when it comes to organizing your content. Try to use the same naming convention for categories and tags throughout your site, so that users can easily understand how your content is organized.\n\nBy following these tips, you can create a well-organized and easy-to-use WordPress site for your content."}

Basing interaction management on this model is interesting because:1) Designing interaction as a collaborative process en hances mixed-initiative interaction.2) Non-understandings are interactively managed, thus in terface's robustness and nexibility are enhanced. 3) Positive and negative signals of understandings are consistently required, as part of the negotiation process.", "summarize": " The paragraph discusses the Intentional model of collaboration, based on the work of psycholinguist H.

One is based on occurrence metadata where a resource is considered similar to another if there is a direct reference from one resource to the other (e.g. a direct citation).

That is, two resources are deemed similar if the same metadata values occur in both their properties (i.e. same authors, same keywords, same publication venue, etc.).
