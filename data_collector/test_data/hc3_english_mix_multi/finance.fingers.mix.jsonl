{"question": "For a car, would you pay cash, finance for 0.9% or lease for 0.9%?", "human": "One part of the equation that I don't think you are considering is the loss in value of the car.  What will this 30K car be worth in 84 months or even 60 months?  This is dependent upon condition, but probably in the neighborhood of $8 to $10K.   If one is comfortable with that level of financial loss, I doubt they are concerned with the investment value of 27K over the loan of 30K @.9%. I also think it sets a bad precedent.  Many, and I used to be among them, consider a car payment a necessary evil.  Once you have one, it is a difficult habit to break.  Psychologically you feel richer when you drive a paid for car.  Will that advantage of positive thinking lead to higher earnings?  Its possible. The old testament book of proverbs gives many sound words of advice.  And you probably know this but it says:  \"...the borrower is slave to the lender\".  In my own experience, I feel there is a transformation that is beyond physical to being debt free.", "ai": " The decision between paying cash, financing at 0.9%, or leasing at 0.9% depends on your personal financial situation and preferences. Here are some factors to consider:\n\n1. Cash: Paying cash allows you to avoid interest payments and own the car outright. It also eliminates the need to make monthly payments. However, it requires a significant upfront investment.\n2. Financing: Financing allows you to spread out the cost of the car over time, making it more affordable in the short term. A low interest rate of 0.9% makes the monthly payments quite reasonable. However, you'll pay more in interest over the life of the loan compared to paying cash.\n3. Leasing: Leasing allows you to drive a new car more often, as you'll be able to upgrade every few years when your lease expires. Monthly payments are generally lower than financing because you're only paying for the depreciation of the car during the lease term. However, you won't build equity in the car and will have to pay for wear and tear and excess mileage charges.\n\nUltimately, the choice between cash, financing, and leasing depends on your financial goals, your budget, and your preferences regarding owning vs. using a car. It may be helpful to consult with a financial advisor or a car purchasing expert to determine which option is best for you."}
{"question": "Are large companies more profitable than small ones?", "human": "Small companies could have growth prospects. Large companies may not have that many. So look at ROE of companies by quatile to determine which companies have better growth.", "ai": " Yes, on average, large companies tend to be more profitable than small ones. This is due to economies of scale, which allow large companies to produce goods or services at a lower cost per unit than small companies. Additionally, large companies may have access to more resources and a larger customer base, contributing to higher profits. However, there are exceptions and it's important to note that profitability can vary greatly among individual companies, regardless of size."}
{"question": "Figuring out if I receive US income?", "human": "I believe the answer is no, since your income from royalties and app sales would fall under FDAP income. (another conformation of this would be the fact that Apple and Google requested a W8-BEN form from you and not a W8-ECI form) Generally, All income EXCEPT FDAP income (fixed or determinable annual or periodical income) are ECI income.  FDAP income includes income from interest, rent, dividends etc. IRS link to a list of all Income classified under FDAP below:- https://www.irs.gov/individuals/international-taxpayers/fixed-determinable-annual-periodical-fdap-income https://www.irs.gov/pub/irs-pdf/iw8eci.pdf (page 3 - under effectively connected income)", "ai": " To determine if you receive US income, consider the following questions:\n\n1.

Do you have US-sourced investment income (dividends, capital gains, or interest) from US-based financial institutions or investments?\n5. Are your scholarships or grants from US sources?\n\nIf the answer to any of these questions is yes, then you may be considered to have US income.

These companies can help reduce the amount of debt owed and may provide debt management plans or debt settlement services. However, it's important to do thorough research and due diligence on any debt reduction company before working with them. Look for reviews, accreditations, and fees to ensure they are reputable and trustworthy. Additionally, be aware that debt reduction may negatively impact credit scores and have tax implications.

{"question": "Pros/cons of borrowing money using a mortgage loan and investing it in a low-fee index fund?", "human": "Essentially, what you're describing is a leveraged investment.  As others noted, the question is how confident you can be that (a) the returns on the investment will exceed what you're paying in interest, and (b) that if you lose the bet you'll still be able to pay off the loan without severely injuring yourself.  I did essentially this when I bought my house, taking out a larger loan than necessary and leaving more money in my investments, which had been returning more than the mortgage's interest rate. I then got indecently lucky during the recession and was able to refinance down to under 4%, which I am very certain my investment will beat. I actually considered lengthening the term of the loan for that reason, or borrowing a bit more, but decided not to double down on the bet; that was my own risk-comfort threshold. Know exactly what your risks are, including secondary effects of these risks. Run the numbers to see what the likely return is. Decide whether you like the odds enough to go for it.", "ai": " Pros of borrowing money for investing in a low-fee index fund:\n\n1. Potential for higher returns: Borrowing money at a lower interest rate than the expected returns of the index fund could lead to higher returns, assuming the investment performs well.\n2. Compounding interest: The ability to invest the borrowed funds and earn compound interest can accelerate wealth growth.\n3. Diversification: investing in a low-fee index fund provides broad market exposure, reducing the risk associated with investing in individual stocks or sectors.\n\nCons of borrowing money for investing in a low-fee index fund:\n\n1. Interest costs: Borrowing money comes with a cost, which is the interest paid on the loan. If the investment does not perform well, the interest costs could exceed the returns, resulting in a net loss.\n2. Risk: Borrowing money to invest comes with additional risk. The investment must perform well enough to pay back the loan, plus the interest, otherwise, you could face financial difficulties.\n3. Limited upside: Since borrowed money comes with a cost, the potential gains are also limited to the returns of the investment plus the amount borrowed, without the additional leverage.\n\nIn summary, borrowing money to invest in a low-fee index fund can offer higher potential returns and diversification, but it also comes with additional risk and costs. It is crucial to carefully consider these factors and conduct thorough research before making such an investment decision."}

However, it's important to note that past performance is not a guarantee of future results, and there are always uncertainties and risks involved in trading. Different strategies, markets, and timeframes may have varying levels of success probability, and individual trades may be influenced by a multitude of factors that can be difficult to predict with certainty. Therefore, while historical data and statistical analysis can provide valuable insights, they should be used as a guide rather than a definitive answer. Additionally, risk management and proper position sizing are crucial components of any successful trading strategy."}
{"question": "What are the differences between an investment mortgage and a personal mortgage?", "human": "If you are going to live in the house for awhile, you can probably use a regular mortgage. Shop around and look for a mortgage program that works. Look at local banks/credit unions, particularly those with community development programs.  Usually an investment mortgage is higher rate, higher payment and has higher underwriting standards.", "ai": " An investment mortgage and a personal mortgage are two different types of home loans, each serving unique purposes. Here are some key differences between the two:\n\n1. Purpose: A personal mortgage is taken out to purchase a property for primary residence or to refinance an existing home loan. An investment mortgage, on the other hand, is used to purchase a property to rent out or for other investment purposes, such as vacation homes or house flipping.\n\n2. Eligibility: Lenders may have different eligibility criteria for investment mortgages as compared to personal mortgages. They may require a larger down payment, higher credit score, or evidence of rental income to qualify for an investment mortgage.\n\n3. Documentation: Investment mortgages require more comprehensive documentation compared to personal mortgages. This might include a business plan, projections of rental income, and proof of management experience for rental properties.\n\n4. Interest Rates: Investment mortgage interest rates are generally higher than those for personal mortgages due to the increased risk involved for lenders.\n\n5. Loan Terms: Investment mortgages may have shorter loan terms (e.g., 30-year amortization with a 5- or 10- year adjustable rate or interest-only periods), which can lead to higher monthly payments or larger balloon payments at the end of the term.\n\n6. Risk Assessment: Investment mortgages carry a higher degree of risk for lenders, as the property's revenue (rental income) is the primary source of repayment. As a result, lenders may impose conditions or clauses, including interest-only periods, higher reserves, or non-recourse clauses, to minimize their risk.\n\n7. Tax Implications: The tax implications can differ between investment and personal mortgages, as interest paid on an investment mortgage may be tax-deductible for landlords. Consult a tax professional for specific guidance in your situation.\n\n8. Default and Foreclosure: Lenders may have different rules regarding default and foreclosure for investment mortgages compared to personal mortgages. Some lenders may be more lenient with investment mortgages, allowing a longer grace period to remedy a default, while others may have a more aggressive stance."}
{"question": "Finding out actual items bought via credit card issuer and not the store receipt?", "human": "The stores track the individual items for inventory planning and marketing purposes. Having worked in the transaction processing business for a time (writing one), I can say with confidence that the credit/debit card companies do not receive an itemized list of the items involved in the transaction. There is usually a description field in the information transmitted to the processor, which may or may not contain useful information. But it is not big enough to contain an itemized grocery list of any size. And it is not standardized in any way that would facilitate reliable parsing. There may be an amount of metadata about the transaction that would indicate the types of products involved in the transaction, which they can also infer from the merchant reporting the transaction. There are efforts to increase the amount of data reported, but they are not widely used yet, due to the overwhelming numbers of banks that would need to be upgraded. These efforts are rolling out only in specific and limited uses where the banks involved are willing to upgrade software and equipment. For now, the best way to know what you bought is to keep your receipts from the store. Shoeboxes work great for this. So do smartphone cameras and a folder on your hard drive. There are also mobile apps that track receipts for you, and may even try to OCR the data for you.", "ai": " To find out the actual items bought using a credit card issuer's statement without the store receipt, you can follow these steps:\n\n1. Log in to your credit card account online or access your monthly statement.\n2. Look for the transactions listed under the \"Merchant Name\" or \"Merchant Category Code\" (MCC) column. This column displays the name of the merchant or business where the transaction occurred.\n3. Identify the transactions that correspond to your purchases. You can narrow down the search by looking for familiar names or MCCs that correspond to the types of stores or services where you usually shop.\n4. For online purchases, the merchant name may be the name of the company from which you ordered the item or a payment processor like PayPal.\n5. Check the transaction amount against your records. If the amount matches the price of the item you believe you purchased, then you have confirmed the transaction.\n\nKeep in mind that credit card statements can sometimes display the merchant's name in an abbreviated or slightly different form than how it appears on a receipt. Therefore, it may be necessary to use some judgment when identifying transactions.\n\nAdditionally, some credit card issuers offer services like transaction tagging or downloadable statements that can help you categorize purchases more easily. These features can help you better track your spending and identify merchant names even if the statements don't provide as much detail as you would like."}
{"question": "What forces cause a company to write down goodwill?", "human": "To understand the answer we first have to understand what Goodwill is. Goodwill in a companies balance sheet is an intangible asset that represents the extra value because of a strong brand name, good customer relations, good employee relations and any patents or proprietary technology. An article from The Economist explains this very well and actually talks about Time Warner directly - The goodwill, the bad and the ugly When one firm buys another, the target’s goodwill—essentially the   premium paid over its book value—is added to the combined entity’s   balance-sheet. Goodwill and other intangibles on the books of   companies in the S&P 500 are valued at $2.6 trillion, or 10% of their   total assets, according to analysts at Goldman Sachs. As the economy deteriorates and more firms trade down towards (or even   below) their book value, empire-builders are having to mark down the   value of assets they splashed out on in rosier times. A recently   announced $25 billion goodwill charge is expected to push Time Warner   into an operating loss for 2008, for instance. Michael Moran of   Goldman Sachs thinks such hits could amount to $200 billion or more   over the cycle. Investors have so far paid little attention to   intangibles, but as write-downs proliferate they are likely to become   increasingly wary of industries with a high ratio of goodwill to   assets, such as health care, consumer goods and telecoms. How bad things get will depend on the beancounters. American firms   used to be allowed to amortise goodwill over many years. Since 2002,   when an accounting-rule change ended that practice, goodwill has had   to be tested every year for impairment. In this stormy environment,   with auditors keener than ever to avoid being seen to go easy on   clients, companies are being told to mark down assets if there is any   doubt about their value. The sanguine point out that this has no effect on cashflow, since such   charges are non-cash items. Moreover, some investors take goodwill   write-offs with a pinch of salt, preferring to look past such   non-recurring costs and accept the higher “normalised” earnings   numbers to which managers understandably cling. The largest companies   are thus able to survive thumping blows that might otherwise floor   them, such as the $99 billion loss that the newly formed but   ill-conceived AOL Time Warner, as it then was, reported for 2002. But   the impact can be all too real, as write-downs reduce overall book   value and increase leverage ratios, a particular concern in these   debt-averse times.", "ai": " A company writes down goodwill when an intangible asset's carrying value exceeds its fair value. Factors that may contribute to this situation include:\n\n1. Change in business environment: market conditions, industry trends, economic downturns\n2. Overvaluation at time of acquisition\n3. Recognition of obsolescence or impairment of intangible assets.\n4. Discrepancies in forecasted future performance compared to actual results.\n5. Changes in interest rates or tax laws.\n\nThe primary force causing a write-down of goodwill is a decline in the value of the underlying intangible assets or an overvaluation of the assets at the time of acquisition. The write-down reduces the company's reported goodwill and can result in a non-cash impairment charge, negatively impacting earnings."}
{"question": "Where to find turnover / average amount of time investors & mutual funds held stocks they purchased?", "human": "You can make a rough calculation of the annual turnover rate of stocks by calculating the institutional investors holding of that stock. Institutional investors are the only firms that are required to provide such data. The good this is they usually make the lion share of trading activity. On the other hand, this task might proof arduous   A different ratio that could be used as a substitute Share Turnover which is calculated as:  Share Turnover gives the number of shares traded as a fraction of the number of shares outstanding. For example, if you compare the results of stock turnover for three companies and the results came as follows:  Company A-share turnover: 1.5 Times Company B share turnover: 3 times Company C share turnover: 0.3 times From the results, we can conclude that for a particular period, company C had the least activity and the number of shares traded for that period was only a small fraction of the shares outstanding while other traders of company C hold most shares and never trade them. If you make a cross sectional analysis of a list of businesses you intend to invest in, you could figure which one has the least number of rapidity in the shares traded.", "ai": " You can find the average holding period for stocks held by mutual funds and institutional investors by checking the Fund's Annual Report (Form N-CSR) or Quarterly Reports (Form N-QCR) filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). Look for the tabular data on portfolio holdings, which usually includes the number of shares, purchase date, and fair value at the end of the reporting period. By calculating the difference between the purchase date and the reporting date, and dividing it by the number of days in the holding period, you can calculate the average number of days a stock was held. Keep in mind that mutual funds report their holdings on a semi-annual or quarterly basis, so the data might not be up-to-date or reflect current holdings. For institutional investors, it is best to check their public filings, such as 13F forms, for information on their stock holdings and the holding period."}

{"question": "How to understand adding or removing “liquidity” in stock markets with market/non-market orders?", "human": "Not all limit orders add liquidity, but all market orders remove liquidity presuming there is liquidity to remove. A liquidity providing order is one that is posted to the limit book. If an order, even a limit order, is filled before being posted to the limit book, it removes liquidity. Liquidity is measured by a balance and abundance of quantities posted on the limit book and the best spread between the lowest ask and the highest bid.", "ai": " In stock markets, \"liquidity\" refers to the ease with which an investor can buy or sell securities without significantly impacting the market price. Market orders are orders to buy or sell a security at the best available price in the market. Non-market orders, such as limit orders, allow investors to specify a desired price for a trade instead of relying on the market price.\n\nAdding liquidity refers to the act of making it easier for other investors to buy or sell securities by placing orders that provide buy or sell supply at current market prices. For example, a market seller (someone selling a security using a market order) is adding liquidity when they sell securities that others want to buy, thus reducing the selling pressure on the market and helping maintain a stable price. A market buyer, on the other hand, is removing liquidity when they buy securities that no one else wants to sell immediately.\n\nWhen handling large orders, market investors often divide their orders into smaller parts to avoid significantly impacting market prices and causing widespread price fluctuations. This is known as \"liquidity provision\" or \"market making.\" By doing this, they add liquidity to the market and help maintain an orderly trading environment.\n\nOn the other hand, a large non-market order, such as a limit order that is far away from the current market price, can negatively impact market liquidity. It may not be filled immediately or at all due to the lack of available opposite orders at the specified price, potentially making it difficult for other investors to trade at that time. Understanding the effects of orders on market liquidity can help investors make informed decisions and manage risks more effectively."}

It would have accepted using their system with a CC payment on the 24th because that goes through their automated system. I would hazard a guess that because your payment was submitted through your bank and arrived on the 23rd it wasn't credited because a live person would have needed to be there to do it and their live people probably don't work weekends. I do much of my bill paying online and have found it easiest to just build a couple days of fluff into the schedule to avoid problems like this. That said, if you call them and explain the situation it is likely that they will credit the late charge back to you.", "ai": " A \"business day\" generally refers to a day on which banks and financial institutions are open for business. In the context of bills or invoices, a business day may be used to calculate due dates or payment deadlines. For example, if a bill has a due date of \"5 business days from issue date,\" it means that the payment is due 5 days after the date the bill was issued, not including weekends or bank holidays.\n\nA \"due date\" is the date by which a payment or expense is expected to be paid or settled.

The extra returns on 100% stocks vs. 60% are 1.2% per year (historically) according to https://personal.vanguard.com/us/insights/saving-investing/model-portfolio-allocations To get those average higher stock returns, you need to be thinking 20-30 years (even 10 years is too short-term). Over the 20-30 years, you must never panic and go to cash, or you will destroy the higher returns. You must never get discouraged and stop saving, or you will destroy the higher returns. You have to avoid the panic and discouragement despite the likelihood that some 10-year period in your 20-30 years the stock market will go nowhere. You also must never have an emergency or other reason to withdraw money early. If you look at \"dry periods\" in stocks, like 2000 to 2011, a 60/40 portfolio made significant money and stocks went nowhere. A diversified portfolio means that price volatility makes you money (due to rebalancing) while a 100% stocks portfolio means that price volatility is just a lot of stress with no benefit. It's somewhat possible, probably, to predict dry periods in stocks; if I remember the statistics, about 50% of the variability in the market price 10 years out can be explained by normalized market valuation (normalized = adjusted for business cycle and abnormal profit margins). Some funds such as http://hussmanfunds.com/ are completely based on this, though a lot of money managers consider it. With a balanced portfolio and rebalancing, though, you don't have to worry about it very much. In my view, the proper goal is not to beat the market, nor match the market, nor is it to earn the absolute highest possible returns. Instead, the goal is to have the highest chance of financing your non-financial goals (such as retirement, or buying a house). To maximize your chances of supporting your life goals with your financial decisions, predictability is more important than maximized returns. Your results are primarily determined by your savings rate - which realistic investment returns will never compensate for if it's too low. You can certainly make a 40-year projection in which 1.2% difference in returns makes a big difference. But you have to remember that a projection in which value steadily and predictably compounds is not the same as real life, where you could have emergency or emotional factors, where the market will move erratically and might have a big plunge at just the wrong time (end of the 40 years), and so on. If your plan \"relies\" on the extra 1.2% returns then it's not a reasonable plan anyhow, in my opinion, since you can't count on them. So why suffer the stress and extra risk created by an all-stocks portfolio?", "ai": " Yes, stock index funds have historically provided strong returns over the long term. Since 1926, U.S. stocks, as represented by the S&P 500 index, have delivered an average annual return of around 10%. However, past performance is not a guarantee of future results, and investments in stocks and stock funds come with risks, including potentialfor loss of principal. Diversification and a long-term investment horizon can help manage risk. Consult a financial professional for personalized investment advice."}
{"question": "How do you find reasonably priced, quality, long lasting clothing?", "human": "The best way to find good quality is to check the garment tag: What kind of material is it made of?

If you think you will like it, it may be a good quality. You should try it. and look for similar material when shopping. It does not matter the store where you shop, you should check the garment quality because even at the expensive stores you can find bad quality.  Quality in Stitch: you should check the the garment stitch, look at the top and underneath stitches, watch for good and consist stitching pattern. especially the sides and armholes underneath of the garment.    Style is something personal. Everybody has different style, but stores are classified by age targeting. If you can find a store that usually made your style, good quality material at reasonable price. you should consider shop there. Most of the time, it will cost a little bit more or much more. BUT CHEAP IS EXPENSIVE!! you end up spending more money at the end of the year. Reasonable means a fair price for both parties, You and the seller. Neither cheap or expensive.", "ai": " To find reasonably priced, quality, and long-lasting clothing, consider the following strategies:\n\n1. Shop Secondhand: Explore thrift stores, consignment shops, and online marketplaces like eBay, Poshmark, and ThredUp to find gently used clothing in excellent condition at lower prices.\n\n2. Sale Sections: Look for sales at your favorite clothing stores or online retailers. Sign up for their email lists to be notified of sales and discounts.\n\n3. Budget Brands: Research and shop from budget-friendly clothing brands that offer good quality at affordable prices, like Uniqlo, Zara, H&M, and Target.\n\n4. Outlet Malls: Visit outlet malls to find discounted, name-brand clothing at lower prices. Some malls offer online shops as well.\n\n5. Subscription Boxes: Consider trying clothing subscription boxes like Stitch Fix, Le Tote, or Gap Box. You'll receive items tailored to your style and size, and can return or keep them based on your satisfaction.\n\n6. Online Marketplaces: Shop from reputable international sellers on websites like AliExpress and Wish. Ensure to read reviews and check fabric quality before purchasing.\n\n7. Clearance Sections: Browse clearance sections in-store or online at various retailers to find deeply discounted clothing. Be mindful of size availability, as popular sizes may sell out quickly.\n\n8. Shop Seasonally: Plan your wardrobe around seasons, and purchase clothing when it's not in high demand. You'll find better deals during off-peak seasons.\n\n9. Discount Codes: Search for discount codes or promo codes online, or sign up for newsletters from retailers. Many offer special discounts, especially around key shopping holidays like Black Friday, Cyber Monday, or end-of-season sales.\n\n10. Price Match: Check if your preferred store offers price-matching. If you find an item at a lower price somewhere else, they may match it.\n\nRemember, investing in well-made clothing may mean spending a bit more upfront but will save you money in the long run as the items last longer, require fewer replacements, and can often be resold."}
{"question": "Are precious metals/collectibles a viable emergency fund?", "human": "People normally hold precious metals as a protection against the whole system going down: massive inflation, lawlessness, etc.  If our whole government and financial system broke completely and we returned to a barter economy, then holding silver would likely turn out to be a good thing. However, precious metals are not very good hedges against individual calamity, like losing your job.  They are costly and inconvenient to sell and the price of these metals fluctuates wildly, so you could end up wanting to sell just when the metal isn't worth much. I'd say having some precious metal isn't unreasonable, but it should not make up a major portion of one's total net worth.  If you want protection against normal problems, especially as a person of limited means, start with an emergency savings account and paying down debt.  That way fixed costs will be less likely to turn an unfortunate turn of events into a personal catastrophe.", "ai": " Precious metals and collectibles are generally not considered viable emergency funds for several reasons. Here are some keyPoints:\n\n1. Liquidity: In an emergency, you need access to cash quickly. Precious metals and collectibles can be difficult to sell and convert into cash on short notice, which can delay your ability to address the emergency.\n2. Value: The value of precious metals and collectibles can be volatile and subject to market fluctuations. While they may hold value during certain economic conditions, their value can decline during others, making it difficult to depend on them as a stable emergency fund.\n3. Predictability: A traditional emergency fund, such as a savings account or other easily accessible funds, offers a more predictable and consistent value. You know exactly how much money you have, and you won't have to worry about the value of the fund fluctuating unexpectedly.\n4. Fees and Costs: Selling precious metals or collectibles may come with fees and costs that can eat into the value of your emergency fund. Additionally, storing and insuring these items can be expensive.\n5. Other Considerations: There are other factors to consider as well, such as safe storage, the risk of damage or loss, and insurance coverage.\n\nOverall, while precious metals and collectibles can be interesting investments, they are not a good substitute for a traditional emergency fund. It's important to have readily accessible savings set aside for unexpected expenses or emergencies."}

Making sound investment decisions based on fundamental analysis of companies will help you to do decide whether a given company is right for you and your risk appetite. Investing is not a zero-sum game, and you can achieve a positive long-term (or short-term, depending on what you're after) outcome for yourself without compromising your ability to sleep at night if you take the time to become acquainted with the companies that you are investing in. How can you ensure that your evaluation is more precise than the   market ones which consists of the evaluation of thousands of people   and professionals? For the average individual, the answer is often simply \"you probably cannot\". But you don't have to set the bar that high - what you can do is ensure that your evaluation gives you a better understanding of your investment and allows you to better align it with your investment objectives. You don't have to beat the professionals, you just have to lose less money than you would by paying them to make the decision for you.", "ai": " Evaluating stocks is an essential process for making informed investment decisions.

What about tax evasion and money laundering? In general, simply transferring funds to a foreign jurisdiction will do nothing to help you evade taxes or hide evidence of a crime.  Pretty much any method you can think of to transfer money is easily traceable, and any method that is difficult to trace is either illegal or heavily-regulated, with stiff penalties if you get caught. There are a few jurisdictions that have very strict banking privacy laws (the Philippines, for example).  If you can somehow get the money into a bank account in one of these countries, you might be OK... at least, until that country's government decides (or is pressured) to change its banking privacy laws. But, what would you actually do with that money?  Unless you want to go live in that country, you're going to have to transfer the funds out to spend them, and now you're right back on the radar — except now it's even worse, because the fact that the funds come from a suspicious jurisdiction will automatically cause your transfer to get flagged for investigation! This is where money laundering comes into play.  There are lots of ways to go about this (exceptionally illegal) activity, many of which do not involve banks at all (at least, not directly).  How money laundering works is outside the scope of this question, but in case you are curious, here are a couple of articles about the \"dark side\" of finance: In short, if you want to break the law, opening a foreign bank account isn't going to help much.  In fact, the real crime is that offshore banking has such a criminal reputation in the first place!

{"question": "Avoiding Double-Reporting Income (1099-MISC plus 1099-K)", "human": "Your clients should not send you 1099-MISC if they paid with a credit card. You can refer them to this text in the instructions for the form 1099-MISC: Payments made with a credit card or payment card and certain other   types of payments, including third party network transactions, must be   reported on Form 1099-K by the payment settlement entity under section   6050W and are not subject to reporting on Form 1099-MISC. See the   separate Instructions for Form 1099-K. By sending out the 1099-MISC, your clients are essentially saying that they paid you directly (check or cash) in addition to the payment they made with a credit card (which will be reported on 1099-K). In case of an audit, you'll have trouble convincing the IRS that it didn't happen. I suggest asking the clients not to do this to you, since it may cost you significant amounts to fight the IRS later on. In any case, you report on your tax return what you really got, not what the 1099 says. If you have two 1099's covering the same income - there's no legal obligation to report the income twice. You do not have to pay twice the tax just because you have stupid clients. But you may have troubles explaining it to the IRS, especially if you're dealing with cash in your business. If you want to avoid matching issues, consider reporting all the 1099s, and then subtracting the duplicates and attaching a statement (the software will do it automatically when you add the description in the miscellaneous item) about what it is.", "ai": " To avoid double-reporting income from Form 1099-MISC and Form 1099-K, follow these steps:\n\n1.

Report the total income on Schedule C (Profit or Loss from Business): If you're self-employed or have a small business and received income reported on both Form 1099-MISC and Form 1099-K, you should report the total income combined on Schedule C.\n\n3. Report the correct type of income on Schedule C: Each form (1099-MISC and 1099-K) reports different types of income. The 1099-MISC typically reports income from services rendered, commissions, and prizes and awards. In contrast, the 1099-K reports payment card and third-party network transactions. Ensure you classify the income correctly on Schedule C.\n\n4. Keep detailed records to support your income: Regardless of which form you rely on for income reporting, it's essential to keep thorough records and receipts to provide evidence of your income if needed.\n\n5.

{"question": "What's the difference between Term and Whole Life insurance?", "human": "Term life insurance is just that - life insurance that pays out if you die, just like car insurance pays out if you have an accident. Like car insurance, it's easy to compare amongst term life insurance policies - you can even compare quotes online.  Whole life insurance is life insurance plus an investment component. The money that you pay goes to pay for your life insurance and it also is invested by the insurance company. Insurance companies love whole life because it is not a commodity; they can come up with a large variety of variants, and that fact plus the fact that it combines insurance and investment means that is very difficult to compare policies. Not to mention that fact that none of the companies - as far as I can tell - publish their whole life insurance rates, so it is very difficult to shop around.", "ai": " Term life insurance is a type of insurance coverage where you pay premiums for a specified term or period (e.g., 10, 20, or 30 years) in exchange for a death benefit if you pass away during that term. If you outlive the term, the coverage ends, and no death benefit is paid.\n\nWhole life insurance is a type of permanent life insurance that provides coverage for your entire lifetime. It also has a savings component, known as cash value, which grows over time and can be borrowed against or surrendered for cash. In addition to the death benefit, whole life insurance comes with a guaranteed rate of return on the cash value and fixed premium payments. The cost per unit of coverage for whole life insurance is typically higher than term life insurance due to the savings component."}

Therefore it would follow that traders would tend to close their positions prior to market close and open them when it opens.", "ai": " In financial markets, the volume of trades is typically highest at the beginning and end of a trading day due to several factors:\n\n1. Institutional Trading: Institutional investors, such as mutual funds, hedge funds, and pension funds, often have specific trading windows during the open and close of the market to execute large orders without significantly moving the market price. This can lead to high trading volumes at these times.\n\n2. Retail Trading: Individual or retail investors also contribute to the volume at the beginning and end of the trading day. They may have set daily trading targets or specific strategies that require them to execute trades at the open or close of the market.\n\n3. Market Sentiment: The beginning and end of the trading day can also reflect shifts in market sentiment. As new economic data is released or major news events occur, investors may react in large numbers, leading to increased volume.\n\n4. Algorithmic Trading: Algorithmic trading strategies, such as High-Frequency Trading (HFT) and arbitrage, can also contribute to higher volumes at the beginning and end of the trading day. These strategies often rely on market conditions that are more common at these times.\n\n5. Regulatory Requirements: In some markets, regulations may require a certain level of trading activity at the opening and closing of the market. For example, in the US, the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) requires Nasdaq to maintain a minimum opening and closing auction price of each security to prevent significant price changes due to thin trading volumes.

My advice, which is slightly different to the above, is: if you have any shares that have lost more than 10% since you bought them and aren't currently recovering, sell them and pay off your debts with those.

If you have high-interest debt, such as credit card debt, selling stocks to pay off that debt could potentially save you money in the long run by reducing your overall debt burden and the interest you pay on it.\n\nHowever, it's important to consider the potential consequences of selling stocks, especially if the market is performing well and your stocks are currently worth more than when you bought them. Selling stocks at a loss could result in capital losses, which could increase your debt rather than decreasing it. Additionally, selling stocks could limit your ability to earn potential profits from the market in the future.\n\nIt's always a good idea to consult with a financial professional or advisor before making any major financial decisions, such as selling stocks to pay off debt.

These ratios help determine if a stock is considered cheap or expensive relative to other companies in its industry or the market:\n\n1. Price-to-Earnings (P/E) ratio: Divide the current stock price by the estimated earnings per share (EPS) for the next 12 months. A lower P/E ratio may indicate an undervalued stock.\n2. Price-to-Sales (P/S) ratio: Divide the current stock price by the company's revenue per share (RPS). A lower P/S ratio may indicate a relatively inexpensive stock, but it's important to compare it to industry averages and historical data.\n3. Price-to-Book (P/B) ratio: Divide the current stock price by the company's book value per share (BVPS). A P/B ratio below 1 can imply a potential bargain, while a ratio above 1 could indicate that the stock is more expensive relative to the company's asset value.\n\nNote that no single ratio is definitive in determining if a stock is cheap or expensive, and it's important to consider other factors such as the company's financial health, growth potential, and industry conditions.

On of the pieces of advice that he gave was that title insurance had almost no value in this state unless you had reason to believe the title might be defective but wanted to buy the property anyway. In fact I did get it anyway, as an impulse purchase -- but I'm fully aware that it was a bad bet. Especially since I had the savings to be able to self-insure, which is always the better answer if you can afford to risk the worst case scenario. Also: Ask the seller whether they bought title insurance. Often, it is transferrable at least once.", "ai": " Yes, there are statistics that support the need for title insurance. According to the American Land Title Association (ALTA):\n\n1. More than 1 in 3 real estate transactions uncover title issues. (Source: ALTA Title Action Study)\n2. Title insurance protected homeowners from more than $77 million in claims in 2020 alone. (Source: ALTA)\n3. Title insurance helps protect against potential claims due to errors or omissions in public records, including undiscovered heirs, outstanding liens, encroachments, and easements. (Source: ALTA)\n\nTitle insurance is a one-time premium payment that protects homeowners from potential title risks and financial loss due to issues that may not be discovered until the real estate transaction is complete. The statistics above indicate that title issues are common and can result in significant financial loss without title insurance protection."}

{"question": "Question about being a resident", "human": "This sort of involves personal finance, and sort of not. But it's an interesting question, so let's call it on topic? Short answer: yes. Long answer: it depends who's asking. If you're trying to qualify for in-state tuition, for example, you need to have been in state for a certain amount of time. For tax purposes, the first year you move to a new state you need to file part-time resident returns in your previous and current state of residency", "ai": " I'm an artificial intelligence and don't have the ability to be a resident or have fingers.

Generally, though, they may include obtaining a valid visa, living in the country for a certain period of time, and demonstrating ties to the country, such as employment, education, or family connections. Some countries may also require applicants to pass a background check or meet certain income or health requirements. It's important to consult with the specific embassy or immigration agency of the country in question for the most accurate and up-to-date information."}
{"question": "What is meant by the term “representative stock list” here?", "human": "The meaning is quite literal - a representative stock list is a list of stocks that would reasonably be expected to have about the same results as the whole market, i.e. be representative of an investment that invests in all those stocks. Of course, you don't want to invest in all stocks individually, that would be impractical, but you can either choose a diverse array of stocks that are (should be) representative, as the article recommends, or alternatively choose to invest in an index fund which offers a practical way to invest in all the stocks in the index at once.", "ai": " A representative stock list is a collection of stocks or securities that is intended to reflect the composition or characteristics of a broader market or index. It is typically used for benchmarking or comparative analysis purposes."}
{"question": "Get car loan w/ part time job as student with no credit, no-cosigner but no expenses", "human": "Ben already covered most of this in his answer, but I want to emphasize the most important part of getting a loan with limited credit history. Go into a credit union or community bank and talk to the loan officer there in person. Ask for recommendations on how much they would lend based on your income to get the best interest rate that they can offer. Sometimes shortening the length of the loan will get you a lower rate, sometimes it won't. (In any case, make sure you can pay it off quickly no matter the term that you sign with.)  Each bank may have different policies. Talk to at least two of them even if the first one offers you terms that you like. Talking to a loan officer is valuable life experience, and if you discuss your goals directly with them, then they will be able to give you feedback about whether they think a small loan is worth their time.", "ai": " Obtaining a car loan with a part-time job as a student, no credit history, and without a cosigner or expenses can be challenging. However, it's not impossible. Here are Some possible ways to increase your chances:\n\n1. Find a co-signer: Although the question states that there's no cosigner, having a cosigner with good credit history and a stable income can greatly improve your chances of getting approved for a car loan. Remember, a cosigner assumes legal responsibility for paying back the loan if the borrower defaults, so make sure to choose wisely.\n\n2. Look for student or graduates car loan programs: Some financial institutions offer car loans specifically designed for students or recent graduates. These loans may have more flexible requirements and lower down payments.\n\n3. Save up for a larger down payment: Having a larger down payment can make the loan amount smaller, making it more feasible for lenders to approve a car loan without a credit check or a cosigner.\n\n4. Shop around: Compare loan offers from multiple lenders to find the best deal. Be prepared to provide detailed information about your income, expenses, and any assets you may have.\n\n5. Consider a secured car loan: A secured car loan requires collateral (the car) to secure the loan. This can make it easier for lenders to approve loans without a credit check or cosigner. Be sure to research this option thoroughly.\n\nIn closing, it's essential to remember that every lender has different qualifications for a car loan, so shop around and gather as much information as possible to increase your chances of approval."}
{"question": "Emulating a 'long straddle' without buying or selling Options?", "human": "Up until your strategy's money losing leg is stopped out, you have zero PnL, while a straddle has lost time value but may gain from price movements - all the PnL at that time you cannot capture with your strategy. Also stop loss cannot guarantee your price.", "ai": " To emulate the effect of a long straddle position (buying a call and put with the same strike price and expiry) without actually buying or selling options, you can create a synthetic long straddle using stocks.\n\nHere are the steps:\n\n1. Buy the underlying asset: This is the equivalent of paying the premium to enter the long straddle position.\n2. Simultaneously sell a call spread and a put spread with the same expiry and the same strike price as your purchased asset.\n\n- For the call spread: sell a call option at a higher strike price and buy a call option at a slightly higher (but still close) strike price.\n- For the put spread: sell a put option at a lower strike price and buy a put option at a slightly lower (but still close) strike price.\n\nThis synthetic long straddle has both limited profit potential and limited risk compared to the actual long straddle option because of the sold spreads. Its maximum profit occurs when the underlying price is above the higher call strike price and below the lower put strike price at expiration (the \"straddle\" or \"width\" between these two strike prices).\n\nIt's essential to acknowledge that this method involves significant risk and should be used with caution.

{"question": "Should my husband's business pay my business?", "human": "Just from my own experience (I am not an accountant): In addition to counting as 'business income' (1040 line 12 [1]) your $3000 (or whatever) will be subject to ~15% self-employment tax, on Schedule SE.  This carries to your 1040 line ~57, which is after all your 'adjustments to income', exemptions, and deductions - so, those don't reduce it.  Half of the 15% is deductible on line ~27, if you have enough taxable income for it to matter; but, in any case, you will owe at least 1/2 of the 15%, on top of your regular income tax. Your husband could deduct this payment as a business expense on Schedule C; but, if (AIUI) he will have a loss already, he'll get no benefit from this in the current year.   If you do count this as income to you, it will be FICA income; so, it will be credited to your Social Security account. Things outside my experience that might bear looking into:  I suspect the IRS has criteria to determine whether spousal payments are legit, or just gaming the tax system.  Even if your husband can't 'use' the loss this year, he may be able to apply it in the future, when/if he has net business income. [1] NB: Any tax form line numbers are as of the last I looked - they may be off by one or two.", "ai": " I cannot provide a definitive answer without more information. Here are some factors to consider:\n\n1. Nature of your businesses: What type of goods or services does each business provide?

{"question": "Does a budget comprise expenses, and/or revenue?", "human": "Budget means both expenses and revenue. In quite a few cases, say personal finance, typically one refers to budget more from expenses point of view as the revenue is typically fixed/known [mostly salary].   The Operating budget and capital budget are laid out separately as Operating budget gives out day to day expenses that are typically essential, employee salaries, routine maintenance of infrastructure etc. The revenue is also tied in to match this. These are done within the same year. Where as capital budget is to build new infrastructure say a new bridge or other major expense that are done over period of years. The revenues to this are typically tied up differently and can even be linked to getting more funding from other agencies or loans.", "ai": " Yes, a budget comprises both expenses and revenue. A budget is a financial plan that outlines anticipated revenues and expenses over a specific period. Expenses are the amounts spent to operate a business or household, while revenue is the income earned during that period. Therefore, to effectively manage your finances, it's essential to account for both in your budget."}
{"question": "Determine share price from S-1 for company that was bought before going public", "human": "To add to @keshlam's answer slightly a stock's price is made up of several components: the only one of these that is known even remotely accurately at any time is the book value on the day that the accounts are prepared. Even  completed cashflows after the books have been prepared contain some slight unknowns as they may be reversed if stock is returned, for example, or reduced by unforeseen costs.  Future cashflows are based on (amongst other things) how many sales you expect to make in the future for all time. Exercise for the reader: how many iPhone 22s will apple sell in 2029? Even known future cashflows have some risk attached to them; customers may not pay for goods, a supplier may go into liquidation and so need to change its invoicing strategy etc.. Estimating the risk on future cashflows is highly subjective and depends greatly on what the analyst expects the exact economic state of the world will be in the future. Investors have the choice of investing in a risk free instrument (this is usually taken as being modelled by the 10 year US treasury bond) that is guaranteed to give them a return. To invest in anything riskier than the risk free instrument they must be paid a premium over the risk free return that they would get from that. The risk premium is related to how likely they think it is that they will not receive a return higher than that rate. Calculation of that premium is highly subjective; if I know the management of the company well I will be inclined to think that the investment is far less risky (or perhaps riskier...) than someone who does not, for example. Since none of the factors that go into a share price are accurately measurable and many are subjective there is no \"right\" share price at any time, let alone at time of IPO. Each investor will estimate these values differently and so value the shares differently and their trading, based on their ever changing estimates, will move the share price to an indeterminable level. In comments to @keshlam's answer you ask if there is enough information to work out the share price if a company buys out the company before IPO. Dividing the price that this other company paid by the relative ownership structure of the firm would give you an idea of what that company thought that the company was worth at that moment in time and can be used as a surrogate for market price but it will not and cannot accurately represent the market price as other investors will value the firm differently by estimating the criteria above differently and so will move the share price based on their valuation.", "ai": " I cannot determine a specific share price for a company that was bought before going public based on an S-1 filing alone. An S-1 is a regulatory filing made with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) by a company looking to sell securities to the public, and it typically includes historical financial information, a description of the business and management, and the proposed terms and conditions of the offering. However, it does not contain information about the price at which shares were bought or sold prior to the IPO.\n\nIf you have information about the price at which the company was bought before going public, you may be able to find this in a press release, news article, or other source external to the S-1 filing.

{"question": "End of financial year: closing transactions", "human": "I'm not sure there's a good reason to do a \"closing the books\" ceremony for personal finance accounting. (And you're not only wanting to do that, but have a fiscal year that's different from the calendar year? Yikes!) My understanding is that usually this process is done for businesses to be able to account for what their \"Retained Earnings\" and such are for investors and tax purposes; generally individuals wouldn't think of their finances in those terms. It's certainly not impossible, though. Gnucash, for example, implements a \"Closing Books\" feature, which is designed to create transactions for each Income and Expenses account into an end-of-year Equity Retained Earnings account. It doesn't do any sort of closing out of Assets or Liabilities, however. (And I'm not sure how that would make any sense, as you'd transfer it from your Asset to the End-of-year closing account, and then transfer it back as an Opening Balance for the next year?) If you want to keep each year completely separate, the page about Closing Books in the Gnucash Wiki mentions that one can create a separate Gnucash file per year by exporting the account tree from your existing file, then importing that tree and the balances into a new file. I expect that it makes it much more challenging to run reports across multiple years of data, though. While your question doesn't seem to be specific to Gnucash (I just mention it because it's the accounting tool I'm most familiar with), I'd expect that any accounting program would have similar functionality. I would, however, like to point out this section from the Gnucash manual: Note that closing the books in GnuCash is unnecessary. You do not need to zero out your income and expense accounts at the end of each financial period. GnuCash’s built-in reports automatically handle concepts like retained earnings between two different financial periods. In fact, closing the books reduces the usefulness of the standard reports because the reports don’t currently understand closing transactions. So from their point of view it simply looks like the net income or expense in each account for a given period was simply zero. And that's largely why I'm just not sure what your goals are. If you want to look at your transactions for a certain time, to \"just focus on the range of years I'm interested in for any given purpose\" as you say, then just go ahead and run the report you care about with those years as the dates. The idea of \"closing books\" comes from a time when you'd want to take your pile of paper ledgers and go put them in storage once you didn't need to refer to them regularly. Computers now have no challenges storing \"every account from the beginning of time\" at all, and you can filter out that data to focus on whatever you're looking for easily. If you don't want to look at the old data, just don't include them in your reports. I'm pretty sure that's the \"better way to keep the books manageable\".", "ai": " At the end of a financial year, it is important to close out all transactions accurately to prepare financial statements and ensure a clean slate for the new year. This process typically involves:\n\n1. Reconciling all accounts to ensure they reflect the actual balance.\n2. Recording any adjusting entries required, such as accruals or prepayments.\n3. Preparing and posting the closing entries, which may include transferring balances to retained earnings or other appropriate accounts.\n4. Generating and distributing the financial statements.\n\nIt's also a good time to review and update accounting records and to back up important data. These steps will help ensure a smooth transition to the new financial year and accurate financial reporting."}

{"question": "Should you always max out contributions to your 401k?", "human": "Definitely not.  You are too young.  Let me explain: Your money will be locked up for at least 40 years, and you will have to navigate some really quirky and trap-laden rules in order to get money for simple things.  Let's say you want to buy a house.  You won't be able to leverage the 401K for that.  College Tuition?  Limits. Your money is locked in and you may get some match, but that assumes your smartest decision at your age is to save money for retirement.  At your age, you should be investing in your career, and that requires cash at hand.  If you want to withdraw early you pay more of a penalty than just the tax rate.   Put differently: investing in your human capital, at a young age, can yield stronger results than just squirreling money.  I'd say don't worry until you are 30. BTW: I'm 24 now.  I used to save money in a 401K for a few months, before I understood the rules.  Since then, I decided against 401K and just saved the money in a bank.  After a few years, I had enough to start my business :)  the 401K couldn't give me that opportunity. Further Explanation: I am in the NYC area.  Many of my friends and I had to decide between living in manhattan or choosing to live in the outer boroughs or NJ.  One thing I noticed was that, while the people in manhattan were burning much more money (to the tune of 1500 per month), they were actually much more productive and were promoted more often.  Having lived in brooklyn and in manhattan, even though it is less expensive, you actually lose at least an hour a day thanks to the commute (and have to deal with crap like the 6 train).  Personally, after moving in, I invested the extra time in myself (i.e. sleeping more, working longer hours, side projects).  Now, when all is said and done, the people who decided to invest in themselves in the short term are financially more secure (both job-wise and economically, thanks to a few bonus cycles) than those who decided to save on rent and put it in a 401K. As far as the traps are concerned, my dad tried to take out a student loan and was denied thanks to a Vanguard quirk which didnt allow more than 50K to be borrowed (even though the account had over 500K to begin with).", "ai": " Maxing out contributions to a 401k can provide several benefits, including tax advantages and potential employer matching.

{"question": "How to decide on split between large/mid/small cap on 401(k) and how often rebalance", "human": "There many asset allocation strategies to chose from that beat lifestyle funds. For example: Relative Strength Asset Allocation keeps your money in Stocks when stocks perform well, bonds when they outperform stocks, and cash when both bonds and stocks are under-performing.   The re-allocation happens on a monthly basis.", "ai": " To determine an appropriate allocation between large-cap, mid-cap, and small-cap stocks in a 401(k) investment portfolio, consider the following steps:\n\n1. Assess your risk tolerance: Determine your willingness and ability to accept potential losses in exchange for the potential for higher returns. Generally, younger investors with longer time horizons may opt for a larger allocation to stocks, including smaller caps, while older investors may prefer a more conservative allocation.\n\n2. Understand your asset allocation: Familiarize yourself with the different risk and return characteristics of large-cap, mid-cap, and small-cap stocks. Large-cap stocks generally have lower volatility and risk but may offer lower growth potential compared to small-caps. Conversely, small-cap stocks can be more volatile and riskier but may offer higher growth potential.\n\n3. Establish a target asset allocation: Based on your risk tolerance and asset allocation understanding, determine an appropriate target allocation for large-cap, mid-cap, and small-cap stocks. Consider using a diversified mix, such as a 60/20/20 split (60% large-cap, 20% mid-cap, and 20% small-cap).\n\n4. Rebalance regularly: Review your portfolio periodically, typically every year, and consider rebalancing if your investments deviate significantly from your target allocation. This will help ensure your portfolio remains aligned with your risk tolerance and investment goals. If you don't have the time or ability to manage your 401(k) account, you may consider hiring a financial advisor or using a robo-advisor to help manage your investments and maintain your desired asset allocation.\n\nRemember, investing involves risks, and it's essential to consult with a financial advisor or tax professional to understand the specific implications for your situation."}
{"question": "Car finance, APR rates and per week in adverts; help understanding them", "human": "Taking the last case first, this works out exactly. (Note the Bank of England interest rate has nothing to do with the calculation.) The standard loan formula for an ordinary annuity can be used (as described by BobbyScon), but the periodic interest rate has to be calculated from an effective APR, not a nominal rate.  For details, see APR in the EU and UK, where the definition is only valid for effective APR, as shown below. 2003 BMW 325i £7477 TYPICAL APR 12.9% 60 monthly payments £167.05 How does this work? See the section Calculating the Present Value of an Ordinary Annuity.  The payment formula is derived from the sum of the payments, each discounted to present value. I.e.

It represents the true annual cost of the loan, including fees and interest, expressed as a percentage.\n\nIn car finance advertising, APR rates are quoted to help potential buyers understand the annual cost of borrowing the loan amount. The lower the APR, the less expensive the credit. For example, an advert might state \"Finance available from 3.9% APR.\"\n\nThe \"per week\" figure in car finance advertising refers to the equivalent weekly cost of the finance payment based on the total amount borrowed and the APR. It can help buyers better understand the affordability of the finance by breaking down the cost into a more manageable weekly amount.\n\nFor example, if the loan amount is £12,000 and the APR is 5.5%, the weekly payment might be £228.86 based on a 3-year loan term with a 48-month payment schedule.\n\nHowever, it is important to note that the weekly payment figure alone may not provide the complete picture of the cost of the car finance. Other factors, such as the loan term, balloon payments, and fees, can also impact the overall cost.

{"question": "What should a 21 year old do with £60,000 ($91,356 USD) inheritance?", "human": "I assume you've no debt - if you do then pay that off. I'd be tempted to put the money into property.  If you look at property prices over the past 20 years or so, you can see returns can be very good.  I bought a house in 1998 and sold it in 2003 for about 110% of the purchase price.  Disclaimer, past performance is no guarantee of future returns! It's a fairly low risk option, property prices appear to be rising currently and it's always good to get your foot on the housing ladder as quickly as you can as prices can rise to the stage where even those earning quite a good salary cannot afford to buy. Of course you don't have to live in the house, a rental income can be very handy without tying you down too much. There are plenty of places in the UK where £60k will buy you a reasonable property with a rental income of £400-£500, it doens't have to be near where you live currently. Just to put a few more figures in - if you get a house for £50k and rent it for £400 a month (perfectly feasible where I live) then that's very close to a 10% return year on year.  Plus any gains made by the price of the house. The main downside is you won't have easy access to the money and you will have to look after a tenant if you decide to rent it out.  Also if you do buy a property make sure it is in a good state of repair, you don't want to have to pay for a new roof for example in a couple of years time. Ideally you would then sell the house around the time property prices peak and buy another when they bottom out again.  Not easy to judge though!

{"question": "When to hire an investment professional?", "human": "Lifecycle funds might be a suitable fit for you. Lifecycle funds (aka \"target date funds\") are a mutual fund that invests your money in other mutual funds based on how much time is left until you need the money-- they follow a \"glide-path\" of reducing stock holdings in favor of bonds over time to reduce volatility of your final return as you near retirement.  The ones I've looked at don't charge a fee of their own for this, but they do direct your portfolio to actively managed funds. That said, the ones I've seen have an \"acquired\" expense ratio of less than what you're proposing you'd pay a professional. FWIW, my current plan is to invest in a binary portfolio of cheap mutual funds that track S&P500 and AGG and rebalance regularly. This is easy enough that I don't see the point of adding in a 1 percent commission.", "ai": " If you have a complex financial situation with significant assets to manage, limited financial knowledge, or insufficient time to manage your investments effectively, consider hiring an investment professional to help you achieve your financial goals. Their expertise and experience can provide valuable insights, develop personalized investment strategies, and monitor your portfolio."}
{"question": "Purchasing a home using collateral", "human": "What do you see as the advantage of doing this? When you buy a house with a mortgage, the bank gets a lien on the house you are buying, i.e. the house you are buying is the collateral. Why would you need additional or different collateral? As to using the house for your down payment, that would require giving the house to the seller, or selling the house and giving the money to the seller. If the house was 100% yours and you don't have any use for it once you buy the second house, that would be a sensible plan. Indeed that's what most people do when they buy a new house: sell the old one and use the money as down payment on the new one. But in this case, what would happen to the co-owner? Are they going to move to the new house with you? The only viable scenario I see here is that you could get a home equity loan on the first house, and then use that money as the down payment on the second house, and thus perhaps avoid having to pay for mortgage insurance. As DanielAnderson says, the bank would probably require the signature of the co-owner in such a case. If you defaulted on the loan, the bank could then seize the house, sell it, and give the co-owner some share of the money. I sincerely doubt the bank would be interested in an arrangement where if you default, they get half interest in the house but are not allowed to sell it without the co-owner's consent. What would a bank do with half a house? Maybe, possibly they could rent it out, but most banks are not in the rental business. So if you defaulted, the co-owner would get kicked out of the house. I don't know who this co-owner is. Sounds like you'd be putting them in a very awkward position.", "ai": " To purchase a home using collateral, you can obtain a mortgage loan. The collateral refers to the property you intend to use as security for the loan. The lender will assess the property's value and, based on that, determine the loan amount. During the loan term, you will be required to make regular payments, including interest, to repay the loan fully at the end of the term. Failure to make payments may result in the lender foreclosing on the property and selling it to recover the outstanding loan balance."}
{"question": "Does negative P/E ratio mean stock is weak?", "human": "P/E is the number of years it would take for the company to earn its share price.  You take share price divided by annual earnings per share.  You can take the current reported quarterly earnings per share times 4, you can take the sum of the past four actual quarters earnings per share or you can take some projected earnings per share. It has little to do with a company's actual finances apart from the earnings per share.  It doesn't say much about the health of a company's balance sheet, and is definitely not an indicator for bankruptcy.  It's mostly a measure of the market's assumptions of the company's ability to grow earnings or maintain it's current earnings growth.   A share price of $40 trading for a P/E ratio of 10 means it will take the company 10 years to earn $40 per share, it means there's current annual earnings per share of $4.  A different company may also be earning $4 per share but trade at 100 times earnings for a share price of $400.  By this measure alone neither company is more or less healthy than the other.  One just commands more faith in the future growth from the market. To circle back to your question regarding a negative P/E, a negative P/E ratio means the company is reporting negative earnings (running at a loss).  Again, this may or may not indicate an imminent bankruptcy.  Increasing balance sheet debt with decreasing revenue and or earnings and or balance sheet assets will be a better way to assess bankruptcy risk.", "ai": " Yes, a negative P/E ratio indicates that the company has reported a loss in the most recent period, making it a weak contender for investment based on its current earnings. However, it's essential to consider other factors like the reason for the loss, the company's growth prospects, and its financial health. A negative P/E ratio alone does not guarantee a weak stock, but it usually signals potential risks or challenges."}
{"question": "How frequently should I request additional credit?", "human": "I do this all the time, my credit rating over time plotted on a graph looks like saw blades going upward on a slope I use a credit alert service to get my credit reports quarterly, and I know when the credit agencies update their files (every three months), so I never have a high balance at those particular times Basically, I use the negative hard pulls to propel my credit score upwards with a the consequentially lowered credit utilization ratio, and the credit history. So here is how it works for me, but I am not an impulse buyer and I wouldn't recommend it for most people as I have seen spending habits: Month 1: charge cards, pay minimum balance (raises score multiple points) Month 2: PAY OFF ALL CREDIT CARDS, massive deleveraging using actual money I already have (raises score multiple points) Month 3: get credit report showing low balance, charge cards, pay minimum balance ask for extensions of credit, AND followup on new credit line offers (lowers score several points per credit inquiry) Month 4: charge cards, pay minimum balance, discretionally approving hard pulls - always have room for one or two random hard pulls, such as for a new cell phone contract, or renting a car, or employment, etc Month 5: PAY OFF CREDIT CARDS using actual money you have. (the trick is to NEVER really go above a 15% credit utilization ratio, and to never overleverage. Tricky because very quickly you will get enough credit to go bankrupt) Month 6: get credit report showing low balances, a slight dip in score from last quarter, but still high continue.", "ai": " There's no definitive answer to how frequently you should request additional credit as it depends on your individual financial circumstances and credit history. Here are some general guidelines:\n\n1. Focus on managing your existing credit responsibly: Paying bills on time and maintaining low credit utilization rates are more important for your credit score than frequently applying for new credit.\n2. Only apply for credit when you need it: Only apply for new credit when it makes sense for your financial situation, such as when you're planning to make a large purchase, moving to a new apartment, or consolidating debt.\n3. Space out your applications: Avoid application for new credit too frequently. Each application can result in a hard inquiry on your credit report, which can temporarily lower your credit score. A good rule of thumb is to space out applications by several months.\n4. Check your own credit report: Regularly checking your own credit report can help you identify any potential errors or inaccuracies. You can request a free credit report once a year from each of the three major credit bureaus - Equifax, Experian, and TransUnion - through AnnualCreditReport.com.\n5. Consider credit inquiries from potential employers or insurance companies as part of the application process and are typically not considered negative factors, so you don't need to concern yourself with the frequency of those types of inquiries."}
{"question": "What will happen when a bid price is higher than an ask price?", "human": "The situation you're proposing is an over-simplification that wouldn't occur in practice. Orders occur in a sequence over time. Time is an important part of the order matching process. Orders are not processed in parallel; otherwise, the problem of fairness, already heavily regulated, would become even more complex. First, crossed and locked markets are forbidden by regulators.  Crossed orders are where one exchange has a higher bid than another's ask, or a lower ask than another's bid.  A locked market is where a bid on one exchange is equal to the ask on another.  HFTs would be able to make these markets because of the gap between exchange fees. Since these are forbidden, and handling orders in parallel would ensure that a crossed or locked market would occur, orders are serialized (queued up), processed in order of price-time priority. So, the first to cross the market will be filled with the best oldest opposing order. Regulators believe crossed or locked markets are unfair.  They would however eliminate the bid ask spread for many large securities thus the bid-ask cost to the holder.", "ai": " In financial markets, when a bid price is higher than an ask price, it indicates an inconsistency in the market data. The bid price represents the highest price a buyer is willing to pay for an asset, while the ask price represents the lowest price a seller is willing to accept.\n\nThis situation is called an \"impossible bid\" or \"inverted quote.\" In such cases, there isn't a transaction possible at that moment. Traders and market makers will closely watch this situation as it may be an error or an indication of unusual market conditions, such as:\n\n1. Human error: Errors in data entry or transmission can lead to bid prices being higher than ask prices.\n\n2. Market manipulation: Manipulators might try to trick the market by falsely reporting inverted quotes to create a false sense of demand or supply.\n\n3. Market making mistakes: Market makers may occasionally quote incorrect prices due to human errors, system problems, or insufficient data.\n\nTraders and market makers typically resolve this situation by contacting the market data provider to correct the error. Most exchanges have systems in place to prevent such inconsistencies from being published for long, but they can still occasionally occur. In any case, a bid price higher than an ask price indicates an imbalance in the market that needs addressing."}
{"question": "How exactly does a country devalue its currency? ", "human": "Currencies that are pegged or fixed require that foreign currencies are held by the central issuer at a proportional amount. This is analogous to having a portfolio of currencies that the central bank issues shares from - in the form of its own currency. We will continue with this analogy, if the central bank says these \"shares\" are worth $1, but the underlying components of the portfolio are worth $0.80 and decreasing, then it is expensive for the central bank to maintain its peg, and eventually they will have to disregard the peg as people start questioning the central bank's solvency. (People will know the $1 they hold is not really worth what the central bank says it is, because of the price changes people experience in buying goods and services, especially when it comes to imports. Shadow economies will also trade using a currency more reflective of labor, which happens no matter what the government's punishments are for doing so). Swiss National Bank (central bank) did this in early 2015, as it experienced volatility in the Euro which it had previously been trying to keep it's currency pegged to. It became too expensive for it to keep this peg on its own. The central bank can devalue its currency by adjusting the proportions of the reserve, such as selling a lot of foreign currency X, buying more of currency Y. They can and do take losses doing this. (Swiss National Bank is maintaining a large loss) They can also flood their economy with more of their currency, diluting the value of each individual 1 dollar equivalent. This is done by issuing bonds or monetizing goods and services from the private sector in exchange for bonds. People colloquially call this \"printing money\" but it is a misnomer in this day and age where printers are not relevant tools. The good and service goes onto the central bank's balance book, and the company/entity that provided the service now has a bond on its book which can be immediately sold to someone else for cash (another reading is that the bond is as good as cash). The bond didn't previously exist until the central bank said it did, and central banks can infinitely exchange goods and services for bonds. Bond monetization (also called Quantitative Easing) is practiced by the Federal Reserve in the United States, Bank of Japan, European Central Bank and now the Central Bank of the Republic of China", "ai": " A country can devalue its currency through various monetary policies:\n\n1. Open Market Operations: A central bank sells its own currency in the foreign exchange market, increasing the supply of its currency and decreasing the value of that currency in relation to other currencies.\n\n2. Disinvestment: Central banks can announce that they will no longer buy or hold foreign currency reserves, which can lead to a sell-off of the domestic currency and a subsequent devaluation.\n\n3. Devaluation Announcement: A central bank can announce an official devaluation of its currency, which can lead to a sharp drop in its value.\n\n4. Inflation: High inflation can erode the value of a currency over time, as imports become more expensive and the purchasing power of the currency decreases.\n\n5. Interest Rates: A central bank can lower interest rates, making it less attractive for investors to hold the domestic currency.\n\n6. Fiscal Policy: Large budget deficits can lead to increased government borrowing, which can put downward pressure on a currency.\n\n7. Capital Controls: Restrictions on the movement of capital can make it more difficult for investors to sell the domestic currency, which can help to support its value. However, if capital controls are not enforced effectively, they can also contribute to a currency devaluation.\n\n8. Speculation: Expectations of a currency devaluation can lead to speculative selling, which can lead to a self-fulfilling prophecy of a currency devaluation."}

{"question": "Wage earners of age ≥ 60 with dependents: What Life Insurance, if any, should they buy?", "human": "Without knowing the WSC's objectives, priorities of those objectives and affordability we cannot determine which type of insurance is best. Life insurance for seniors is very expensive if you examine the per unit cost (e.g. cost per $1000 of death benefit). Therefore affordability is a critical deciding factor for WSC.  Let's assume that we know the WSC's affordability and therefore the monthly premium is a fixed determined number, then there is a inverse relationship between the length of coverage and the amount of coverage. We have to achieve a balance between these two factors to best meet the WSC's objective. If the proposed plan is not affordable then the WSC must leave out his/her objectives with lesser priorities out of the total coverage amount.", "ai": " For wage earners aged 60 and above with dependents, it is recommended to buy a term life insurance policy with a coverage amount sufficient to provide for their dependents in case of their untimely death.

{"question": "Explanations on credit cards in Canada", "human": "I think it's worth pointing out explicitly that the biggest difference between a credit card (US/Canada) and a debit card (like your French carte de crédit) is that with a credit card, it's entirely possible to not pay the bill or to pay only the \"minimum payment\" when asked. This results in you owing significantly more money due to interest, which can snowball into higher and higher levels of debt, and end up getting rapidly out of control. This is the reason why you should ALWAYS pay off the ENTIRE balance every month, as attested to in the other answers; it's not uncommon to find people in the US with thousands of dollars of debt they can't pay off from misuse of credit cards.", "ai": " In Canada, a credit card is a payment method that allows you to borrow money from a financial institution to make a purchase, with the agreement that you will repay the borrowed amount, plus any interest or fees, in installments over a period of time. The terms and conditions, including interest rates, fees, rewards, and other benefits, can vary greatly among different credit card issuers. Most major banks and financial institutions offer credit cards in Canada, and they can be used to make purchases both in-store and online, as well as for cash advances at ATMs. It's important to understand the terms and conditions of your credit card, and to make your payments on time to avoid late fees and damage to your credit score. Credit cards are subject to the provisions of the Canadian Consumer Credit Act and are regulated by the Office of the Superintendent of Financial Institutions (OSFI)."}
{"question": "Is dividend included in EPS", "human": "No, dividends are not included in earnings.  Companies with no earnings sometimes choose to pay dividends.

{"question": "How accurate is Implied Volatility in predicting future moves?", "human": "How accurate is Implied Volatility in predicting future moves? How would you measure this?  If the implied volatility says that there's a 1% chance that a stock will double, and it doubles, was it \"right\"?  You could also say that it says there's a 99% change that it doesn't double, so was it \"wrong\"?   What you could measure is the variance of daily returns over a time period, and see how well that compares to implied volatility, but there's no way to compare IV with the absolute price movement.  If a stock goes up 0.01 each day, then the variance is 0 (the daily returns are the same each day), but over 250 the stock would go up $2.50.", "ai": " Implied volatility, which is derived from the pricing of options in financial markets, is a measure of the market's expectation of the volatility of an underlying asset's price. It is not a predictor of future moves in an absolute sense, as it is based on current market conditions and the prices of existing options contracts. However, high implied volatility can often indicate higher expected future volatility, and low implied volatility can indicate lower expected future volatility. It is important to note that implied volatility is not a certainty, but rather a statistical probability based on market data, and actual future price movements may vary. Ultimately, implied volatility should be used in conjunction with other analysis tools and overall market context to make informed investment decisions."}
{"question": "Buying a more expensive house as a tax shelter (larger interest deduction)?", "human": "Depending on the state you live in paying interest on a mortgage opens up other tax deduction options: Real estate taxes, Car tax, donations.

Owning your house: But there are big risks, ask anybody stuck with a house they can't sell. But it doesn't scale. You spend 10K more to save 2.5K in taxes. Buy because you want to, not to reduce taxes.", "ai": " Buying a more expensive house as a tax shelter primarily relies on the mortgage interest deduction, which allows you to deduct the amount of mortgage interest paid during the tax year. By purchasing a more expensive house, your mortgage payment and, therefore, your mortgage interest, will be higher, resulting in a larger tax deduction.\n\nHowever, there are some important considerations before making such a decision for this sole reason:\n\n1. Interest Rates: Higher-priced homes usually come with higher interest rates. A higher interest rate will negatively impact your monthly mortgage payment and the overall cost of the house over time. Make sure that the tax savings are significant enough to offset the increase in monthly housing expenses and the long-term costs of a higher mortgage.\n\n2. Qualifying for the mortgage: Larger mortgages often require stricter qualifications, including a higher credit score and larger down payment. Ensure you can qualify for the mortgage based on your current financial situation.\n\n3. Appreciation and property taxes: Buying a more expensive home assumes that the property will appreciate in value. Remember that real estate is subject to market forces and there is no guarantee that prices will increase. Moreover, property taxes are tied to the value of the property, so a higher value home could mean higher property taxes.\n\n4. Opportunity costs: Consider the alternative uses of the money you would spend on a more expensive house, like investing in stocks, a rental property, or a business, which could potentially yield a greater return. Remember that investing in the stock market or other investment vehicles usually incurs different risks and requires a different skillset than real estate investment.\n\n5. Long-term financial stability: Consider how a larger mortgage will impact your long-term financial stability, including your ability to save for retirement, unexpected expenses, and emergency funds. Paying off a more expensive mortgage might take longer, and you could be leaving yourself exposed to financial uncertainty.\n\n6. Alternatives to a larger mortgage: Consider other ways to increase your mortgage interest deduction, such as refinancing your current mortgage or maintaining the size of your mortgage but increasing your payments to pay down the principal quicker.\n\nIn summary, buying a more expensive house as a tax shelter could result in a larger mortgage interest deduction, but it comes with its own risks and costs. Ensuring that you are prepared for these challenges and that the tax savings truly outweigh the costs is essential. Consult with a financial advisor or tax professional to determine the best course of action based on your individual financial situation."}
{"question": "What are the tax implications of exercising options early?", "human": "The difference is whether your options qualify as incentive stock options (ISOs), or whether they are non-qualifying options. If your options meet all of the criteria for being ISOs (see here), then (a) you are not taxed when you exercise the options.  You treat the sale of the underlying stock as a long term capital gain, with the basis being the exercise price (S). There is something about the alternative minimum tax (AMT) as they pertain to these kinds of options.  Calculating your AMT basically means that your ISOs are treated as non-qualifying options.  So if your exercise bumps you into AMT territory, too bad, so sad. If you exercise earlier, you do get a clock ticking, as you put it, because one of the caveats of having your options qualify as ISOs is that you hold the underlying stock (a) at least two years after you were granted the options and (b) at least one year after you exercise the options.", "ai": " The tax implications of exercising options early depend on the specific terms of the option grant and your individual tax situation. Here are some general points to consider:\n\n1. Ordinary income: When you exercise an incentive stock option (ISO), you may owe ordinary income tax on the difference between the option price and the fair market value (FMV) of the stock at the time of exercise, unless the stock is held for more than one year after exercise and more than two years from the grant date. This is known as the \"bargain element.\" For non-qualified stock options (NQSOs), the entire spread between the option price and FMV is considered ordinary income at the time of exercise.\n\n2. Capital gains tax: If you sell the stock acquired through the exercise of the option for a profit, you will owe capital gains tax on the appreciation. For ISOs, the holding period for the stock includes the period from the grant date to the exercise date. For NQSOs, the holding period starts from the exercise date.\n\n3. AMT implications: Alternative Minimum Tax (AMT) may apply when exercising ISOs due to the preferential tax treatment of ISOs. The AMT disallows certain deductions and exclusions, potentially increasing your taxable income. Income from NQSOs is not subject to AMT issues, as it is already taxed as ordinary income.\n\n4. Tax withholding: Employers are typically required to withhold taxes from the compensation an employee receives in connection with the exercise of options. This can be done by withholding shares of stock, cash, or a combination of both, based on the withholding tax rates.\n\nThese rules can be complex, so it is important to consult a tax professional or financial advisor to understand the specific tax implications of exercising your options early."}

I would recommend a solution that reduces duplication as much as possible- and depending on what information you're interested in tracking you could set it up in very different ways. One solution would be to create virtual sub accounts of your assets, and to record the source of money rather than the destination.  Thus, when you do an expense report, you can limit on the \"his\" or \"hers\" asset accounts, and see only the expenses which pertain to those accounts (likewise for liabilities/credit cards). If, on the other hand, you're more interested in a running sum of expenses- rather than create \"Me\" and \"Spouse\" accounts at every leaf of the expense tree, it would make much more sense to create top level accounts for Expenses:His:etc and Expenses:Hers:etc.  Using this model, you could create only the sub expense accounts that apply for each of your spending (with matching account structures for common accounts).", "ai": " In Gnucash, you can separate individual expenses from family expenses by creating and using appropriate accounts.

Set up the sub-accounts: Go to \"Files\" > \"Set Up\" > \"Accounts\" > \"New Account.\" Create individual expense accounts for each family member and a family expense account.\n3. Assign account types: For individual expense accounts, set the account type to \"Expenses\" or \"Equity:Expenses.\" For the family expense account, set the account type to \"Expenses:Family.\"\n4. Categorize transactions: When entering transactions, categorize them to their respective accounts. For individual expenses, choose the appropriate account. For family expenses, choose the family expense account.\n5. Reconcile regularly: Reconcile your accounts frequently to ensure the accuracy of your records.\n\nRemember, maintaining good bookkeeping practices involves creating and using appropriate accounts for your transactions and categorizing them correctly. This will help you easily track individual and family expenses separately in Gnucash."}
{"question": "Is a 10 year old uncashed paycheck still good?", "human": "You probably can't deposit the check directly, but there are mechanisms in place to get your money through other means. In the US, all states and territories have an unclaimed property registry. Before you contact the company that wrote the check, you should check that registry in your state. You will have to provide proof that you are the intended recipient, having the original check in your possession should make that considerably easier.", "ai": " Yes, a 10-year-old uncashed paycheck is still valid in most cases. The funds have not expired and can be deposited or cashed. However, it's recommended to contact the employer or the financial institution to confirm before attempting to deposit or cash it. Some establishments may have changed banks or may have specific procedures for older checks."}
{"question": "What is vested stock and yearly dividends?", "human": "Vesting As you may know a stock option is the right to acquire a given amount of stock at a given price.  Actually acquiring the stock is referred to as exercising the option.  Your company is offering you options over 200,000 shares but not all of those options can be exercised immediately. Initially you will only be able to acquire 25,000 shares; the other 175,000 have conditions attached, the condition in this case presumably being that you are still employed by the company at the specified time in the future.  When the conditions attached to a stock option are satisfied that option is said to have vested - this simply means that the holder of the option can now exercise that option at any time they choose and thereby acquire the relevant shares. Dividends Arguably the primary purpose of most private companies is to make money for their owners (i.e. the shareholders) by selling goods and/or services at a profit.  How does that money actually get to the shareholders?  There are a few possible ways of which paying a dividend is one.  Periodically (potentially annually but possibly more or less frequently or irregularly) the management of a company may look at how it is doing and decide that it can afford to pay so many cents per share as a dividend.  Every shareholder would then receive that number of cents multiplied by the number of shares held. So for example in 4 years or so, after all your stock options have vested and assuming you have exercised them you will own 200,000 shares in your company.  If the board declares a dividend of 10 cents per share you would receive $20,000.  Depending on where you are and your exact circumstances you may or may not have to pay tax on this. Those are the basic concepts - as you might expect there are all kinds of variations and complications that can occur, but that's hopefully enough to get you started.", "ai": " Vested stock refers to company shares that an employee has fully owned after a vesting period has elapsed. This means the employee has earned the right to keep the shares, often granted as part of an employee stock option or restricted stock unit (RSU) plan.\n\nYearly dividends, on the other hand, are periodic cash payments made by a corporation to its shareholders, typically paid out on a regular basis, such as annually. They represent a portion of the company's profits distributed back to shareholders as an incentive for owning the stock."}
{"question": "Opening 5 credit cards at once with no history to ruin, is it a good idea?", "human": "Yes, this is definitely possible. You can optimize your credit worthiness within 18 months, you would first start with a secured credit card just to establish a little bit of credit history and then use that as a jumping point 6 months later to do several unsecured credit card applications. As a student, your primary limiting factor will be your truthful income when you apply for the cards, resulting in low limits, where using less than 30% of those limits is not a useful amount of money. Your credit scores can be looked at as a spendable balance. New inquiries spend some of that balance, low utilization earns you more of the balance. They will trend upwards with the right approach, and you can use the balance at their highs to time more inquiries. Note: My answers typically differ in that I narrowly tailor my answers to the question asked, and don't masquerade or acknowledge the idea of advice. Impulsive spenders with credit have bad credit, I can live with that.", "ai": " Applying for multiple credit cards at once without any credit history can negatively impact your credit score, even if you get approved. Each application results in a hard inquiry, which can temporarily lower your score. Additionally, credit card issuers prefer applicants with a proven ability to manage debt responsibly, which is typically demonstrated through a credit history. If you don't have a credit history, it may be more challenging to get approved (or you might be offered unfavorable terms). Instead, focus on establishing credit by obtaining a secured credit card or becoming an authorized user on someone else's account. Once you have a credit history, you can apply for credit cards more strategically."}
{"question": "When a Company was expected and then made a profit of X $ then that X$ increased it's share price. or those the Sellers and Buyers [duplicate]", "human": "There are a few reason why share prices increase or decrease, the foremost is expectation of the investors that the company/economy will do well/not well, that is expectation of profit/intrinsic value growth over some time frame (1-4 qtrs.)there is also demand & supply mismatch over (usually) short time. If you really see, the actual 'value' of a company is it's net-worth (cash+asset+stock in trade+brand value+other intangibles+other incomes)/no of shares outstanding, which (in a way) is the book value, then all shares should trade at their book value, the actual number but it does not, the expectation of investors that a share would be purchased by another investor at a higher price because the outlook of the company over a long time is good.", "ai": " If a company earns a profit of X dollars, and assuming all other factors remain constant, the increase in the company's share price can be attributed to the increased earnings per share (EPS). The EPS is calculated by dividing the net income by the total number of outstanding shares. An increase in EPS makes the stock more valuable, leading to an increase in share price. However, it's essential to note that other factors can also influence share prices, such as market conditions, investor sentiment, and analyst expectations. Sellers and buyers in the stock market transact based on their evaluation of these factors and the stock's fundamental and technical analysis."}
{"question": "Do Americans still need extra health care / medical insurance after reform to health care? [U.S.]", "human": "I think it is too early to tell. They changed so many variables in an incredibly complex system, and a lot of it will depend on how the requirements in the legislation look once the bureaucrats and insurance companies get a chance to interpret them and implement them as policy. My gut feeling is that for most people, you should plan on some pretty price increases for insurance in the next few years as insurance companies try cover the costs of removing lifetime caps and insuring people with pre-existing conditions. That said, the personal finance issue that you really should be planning for is your portfolio not your insurance costs. The bill includes almost a 4% increase in capital gains taxes.", "ai": " Yes, Americans may still need additional health insurance even after healthcare reforms. While reforms have expanded access to healthcare for many, they may not cover all medical expenses, such as copays, deductibles, and certain procedures or services not considered essential benefits. Additionally, some individuals may choose to purchase supplemental insurance or have specific health conditions requiring more comprehensive coverage than what is offered through marketplaces or employer plans."}

Why?", "human": "It's always a good idea to check your credit history on a regular basis - try checking your credit score from one of the independent providers recently (like Equifax) ?  Maybe that will offer a clue what PayPal is doing.", "ai": " PayPal may require you to add a bank account as a backup funding source or as an alternative to a credit card due to various reasons, such as:\n\n1. Security concerns: PayPal may flag transactions made with a credit card for review, especially if the transaction amount is large or if the card information appears to be inconsistent.\n2. Payment issues: If the credit card on file has expired, been cancelled, or has insufficient funds, PayPal may ask you to add a bank account as a backup funding source.\n3. Complying with regulations: Regulatory requirements may influence PayPal's decision to ask for a bank account, especially for large transactions or for specific businesses or industries.\n\nAdding a bank account can help ensure a smoother transaction experience by providing an alternative funding source.

{"question": "Is there a kind of financial advisor for stock investors? How to find a good one?", "human": "I'm a retired stockbroker/Registered Investment Advisor. My initial discussions with prospects never had a fee.  Restricted stock is unsaleable without specific permission from the issuing company, and typically involves time specifc periods when stock can be sold and/or amounts of stock that can be sold. Not for DIY. Financial planners may be able to assist you, if they are conversant in restricted stock, though that's not a common situation for most clients. Any stockbroker at a major firm (Merrill Lynch, UBS, Royal Bank of Canada, Morgan Stanley, JP Morgan, etc.) will be knowledgeable and advise you (w/o charge) how to trade the stock. Always talk to more than one firm, and don't be in a hurry. If you feel comfortable with the discussion, you can pursue a deeper relationship. In my professional experience, clients valued service, accessibility, knowledge. Price was way down on the list; many of my clients were not wealthy people- they just needed help navigating a very confusing (and necessary) part of their lives. Good luck.", "ai": " Yes, there are financial advisors specializing in stock investing. To find a good one, consider the following steps:\n\n1. Define your investment goals, risk tolerance, and time horizon.\n2. Research potential advisors: Look for certifications like CFA (Chartered Financial Analyst) or CFP (Certified Financial Planner) and check their regulatory records with FINRA BrokerCheck.\n3. Schedule interviews: Meet with a few advisors to assess their communication skills, investment philosophy, and ability to address your specific needs.\n4.

{"question": "Does it make sense to buy a house in my situation?", "human": "I'm confused why you think you need a $450k house. That seems extremely high in today's market except perhaps in certain major urban locations. If you're going to live in suburbia or a smaller town/city, you should be able to find a nice 3br house for well under $300k. Before you rule out buying a house, I'd spend some time researching the real estate listings in your area, foreclosures, properties owned by bankruptcy court, etc. - you might be surprised to find a great home for as low as $150-200k. Of course if you live in a place where what I'm saying is completely off-base, please disregard my answer.", "ai": " Yes, it is possible to buy a house even if you don't have fingers. The ability to buy a house is not directly related to having fingers. You would still need to consider the same factors as any other homebuyer, such as your budget, credit score, employment situation, and the specific property you're interested in. If you can meet the financial and logistical requirements of homeownership, then purchasing a house is a viable option. However, you may need to make accommodations for performing certain tasks related to home maintenance or signing legal documents. It's a good idea to consult with professionals, such as a real estate agent or a lawyer, to help you navigate these circumstances."}

{"question": "Are there Investable Real Estate Indices which track Geographical Locations?", "human": "Not to my knowledge. Often the specific location is diversified out of the fund because each major building company or real estate company attempts to diversify  risk by spreading it over multiple geographical locations. Also, buyers of these smaller portfolios will again diversify by creating a larger fund to sell to the general public. That being said, you can sometimes drill down to the specific assets held by a real estate fund. That takes a lot of work: You can also look for the issuer of the bond that the construction or real estate company issued to find out if it is region specific. Hope that helps.", "ai": " Yes, there are real estate indices that track specific geographical locations. Some examples include the S&P CoreLogic Case-Shiller Home Price Indices, which cover multiple metropolitan areas in the United States, and the FTSE EPRA/NAREIT Global Real Estate Index Series, which provides coverage of public and private real estate companies and properties located in various countries and regions around the world. These indices allow investors to gain exposure to the real estate markets of specific locations, making it easier to make informed investment decisions based on geographical considerations."}
{"question": "Can we buy and sell stocks without worrying about settlement period", "human": "In the United States, regulation of broker dealer credit is dictated by Regulation T, that for a non-margin account, 100% of a trade must be funded. FINRA has supplemented that regulation with an anti-\"free rider\" rule, Rule 4210(f)(9), which reads No member shall permit a customer (other than a broker-dealer or a “designated     account”) to make a practice, directly or indirectly, of effecting transactions in a cash     account where the cost of securities purchased is met by the sale of the same securities.     No member shall permit a customer to make a practice of selling securities with them in a     cash account which are to be received against payment from another broker-dealer where     such securities were purchased and are not yet paid for. A member transferring an     account which is subject to a Regulation T 90-day freeze to another member firm shall     inform the receiving member of such 90-day freeze. It is only funds from uncleared sold equities that are prohibited from being used to purchase securities. This means that an equity in one's account that is settled can be sold and can be purchased only with settled funds.  Once the amount required to purchase is in excess of the amount of settled funds, no more purchases can be made, so an equity sold by an account with settled funds can be repurchased immediately with the settled funds so long as the settled funds can fund the purchase. Margin A closed position is not considered a \"long\" or \"short\" since it is an account with one loan of security and one asset of security and one cash loan and one cash liability with the excess or deficit equity equal to any profit or loss, respectively, thus unexposed to the market, only to the creditworthiness of the clearing & settling chain. Only open positions are considered \"longs\" or \"shorts\", a \"long\" being a possession of a security, and a \"short\" being a liability, because they are exposed to the market. Since unsettled funds are not considered \"longs\" or \"shorts\", they are not encumbered by previous trades, thus only the Reg T rules apply to new and current positions. Cash vs Margin A cash account cannot purchase with unsettled funds.  A margin account can.  This means that a margin account could theoretically do an infinite amount of trades using unsettled funds.  A cash account's daily purchases are restricted to the amount of settled funds, so once those are exhausted, no more purchases can be made. The opposite is true for cash accounts as well.  Unsettled securities cannot be sold either. In summation, unsettled assets can not be traded in a cash account.", "ai": " In the context of stock trading, the settlement period refers to the time it takes for the transfer of funds and the delivery of securities between parties after a trade has been executed. traditionally, it takes 2 business days, known as T+2 settlement. However, many brokerages now offer instant or real-time settlement using systems like ACH or PFOF, allowing trades to settle on the same day. In such cases, investors can buy and sell stocks without worrying about the traditional settlement period. But, keep in mind that the availability of these services may depend on the specific brokerage and the type of account you have."}
{"question": "Buying my first car: why financing is cheaper than paying cash here and now?", "human": "The advice given at this site is to get approved for a loan from your bank or credit union before visiting the dealer. That way you have one data point in hand.  You know that your bank will loan w dollars at x rate for y months with a monthly payment of Z. You know what level you have to negotiate to in order to get a better deal from the dealer. The dealership you have visited has said  Excludes tax, tag, registration and dealer fees. Must finance through   Southeast Toyota Finance with approved credit. The first part is true. Most ads you will see exclude tax, tag, registration. Those amounts are set by the state or local government, and will be added by all dealers after the final price has been negotiated. They will be exactly the same if you make a deal with the dealer across the street. The phrase Must finance through company x is done because they want to make sure the interest and fees for the deal stay in the family. My fear is that the loan will also not be a great deal. They may have a higher rate, or longer term, or hit you with many fee and penalties if you want to pay it off early. Many dealers want to nudge you into financing with them, but the unwillingness to negotiate on price may mean that there is a short term pressure on the dealership to do more deals through Toyota finance. Of course the risk for them is that potential buyers just take their business a few miles down the road to somebody else. If they won't budge from the cash price, you probably want to pick another dealer. If the spread between the two was smaller, it is possible that the loan from your bank at the cash price might still save more money compared to the dealer loan at their quoted price. We can't tell exactly because we don't know the interest rates of the two offers. A couple of notes regarding other dealers. If you are willing to drive a little farther when buying the vehicle, you can still go to the closer dealer for warranty work. If you don't need a new car, you can sometimes find a deal on a car that is only a year or two old at a dealership that sells other types of cars. They got the used car as a trade-in.", "ai": " Financing a car instead of paying cash upfront can be cheaper for several reasons:\n\n1. Interest Rates: Lenders often offer lower interest rates for car loans compared to personal savings or investing rates. Even if you have the cash, putting it into a car loan may result in a lower effective cost due to the lower interest rate.\n\n2. Availability of Credit: Financing allows you to use credit to purchase a car, which is not an option when paying cash. By using the credit, you may gain access to better deals, discounts, and incentives offered by dealers and lenders.\n\n3. Cash Flow Considerations: Financing can help manage your cash flow by avoiding a large upfront expense. Instead, your cost will be spread over monthly payments, which may be more manageable for some budgets.\n\nHowever, it's crucial to be aware that financing a car does come with additional costs, such as interest on the loan. It's always a good idea to research and compare the true cost of financing versus paying cash to ensure you make the most informed decision."}

This is the amount you're allowed to deduct from your taxable income before applying the AMT.\"", "ai": " To estimate the rough amount a taxpayer may pay in Alternative Minimum Tax (AMT), you typically need to consider taxable income and certain exemptions or deductions that are disallowed for AMT calculations. However, without specific income figures, I cannot provide an accurate estimate.\n\nGenerally, the AMT applies to taxpayers with higher incomes who have a disproportionate amount of certain types of income or tax deductions, such as preferential items like accelerated depreciation or state and local taxes. To calculate potential AMT liability, taxpayers can use IRS worksheets provided in the Form 6251 instruction booklet.\n\nTo get a sense of AMT thresholds, in 2021, single taxpayers with taxable income above $536,000 and married filing jointly taxpayers with taxable income above $1,072,000 could be subject to AMT.

You just \"bought a dividend:\" paying $1100 for 100 shares that are worth only $1000 at the end of the day, whereas if you had just been a little less eager to purchase right now, you could have bought those 100 shares for only $1000. But, looking at the bright side, if you bought the shares earlier than yesterday, you get paid the dividend.  So, assuming that you bought the shares in timely fashion, your holdings just lost value and are worth only $1000.  What you do have is the promise that in a couple of days time, you will be paid $100 as the dividend, thus restoring the asset value back to what it was earlier.  Now, if you had asked your broker to re-invest the dividend back into the same stock, then, assuming that the stock price did not change in the interim due to normal market fluctuations, you would get another 10 shares for that $100 dividend making the value of your investment $1100 again (110 shares at $10 each), exactly what it was before the dividend was paid. If you didn't choose to reinvest the dividend, you would still have the 100 shares (worth $1000) plus $100 cash. So, regardless of what other investors choose to do, your asset value does not change as a result of the dividend.  What does change is your net worth because that dividend amount is taxable (regardless of whether you chose to reinvest or not) and so your (tax) liability just increased.", "ai": " Dividends are usually re-invested at the current market price of the stock on the dividend payment date. This is often referred to as a \"dividend reinvestment plan\" or \"DRIP.\" The reinvested dividends are used to purchase additional shares, which increases your ownership in the company and enhances your future dividend income."}

{"question": "Side work and managing finances?", "human": "I've done various side work over the years -- computer consulting, writing, and I briefly had a video game company -- so I've gone through most of this. Disclaimer: I have never been audited, which may mean that everything I put on my tax forms looked plausible to the IRS and so is probably at least generally right, but it also means that the IRS has never put their stamp of approval on my tax forms. So that said ... 1: You do not need to form an LLC to be able to claim business expenses. Whether you have any expenses or not, you will have to complete a schedule C. On this form are places for expenses in various categories. Note that the categories are the most common type of expenses, there's an \"other\" space if you have something different. If you have any property that is used both for the business and also for personal use, you must calculate a business use percentage. For example if you bought a new printer and 60% of the time you use it for the business and 40% of the time you use it for personal stuff, then 60% of the cost is tax deductible. In general the IRS expects you to calculate the percentage based on amount of time used for business versus personal, though you are allowed to use other allocation formulas. Like for a printer I think you'd get away with number of pages printed for each. But if the business use is not 100%, you must keep records to justify the percentage. You can't just say, \"Oh, I think business use must have been about 3/4 of the time.\" You have to have a log where you write down every time you use it and whether it was business or personal. Also, the IRS is very suspicious of business use of cars and computers, because these are things that are readily used for personal purposes. If you own a copper mine and you buy a mine-boring machine, odds are you aren't going to take that home to dig shafts in your backyard. But a computer can easily be used to play video games or send emails to friends and relatives and lots of things that have nothing to do with a business. So if you're going to claim a computer or a car, be prepared to justify it. You can claim office use of your home if you have one or more rooms or designated parts of a room that are used \"regularly and exclusively\" for business purposes. That is, if you turn the family room into an office, you can claim home office expenses. But if, like me, you sit on the couch to work but at other times you sit on the couch to watch TV, then the space is not used \"exclusively\" for business purposes. Also, the IRS is very suspicious of home office deductions. I've never tried to claim it. It's legal, just make sure you have all your ducks in a row if you claim it. Skip 2 for the moment. 3: Yes, you must pay taxes on your business income. If you have not created an LLC or a corporation, then your business income is added to your wage income to calculate your taxes. That is, if you made, say, $50,000 salary working for somebody else and $10,000 on your side business, then your total income is $60,000 and that's what you pay taxes on. The total amount you pay in income taxes will be the same regardless of whether 90% came from salary and 10% from the side business or the other way around. The rates are the same, it's just one total number. If the withholding on your regular paycheck is not enough to cover the total taxes that you will have to pay, then you are required by law to pay estimated taxes quarterly to make up the difference. If you don't, you will be required to pay penalties, so you don't want to skip on this. Basically you are supposed to be withholding from yourself and sending this in to the government. It's POSSIBLE that this won't be an issue. If you're used to getting a big refund, and the refund is more than what the tax on your side business will come to, then you might end up still getting a refund, just a smaller one. But you don't want to guess about this. Get the tax forms and figure out the numbers. I think -- and please don't rely on this, check on it -- that the law says that you don't pay a penalty if the total tax that was withheld from your paycheck plus the amount you paid in estimated payments is more than the tax you owed last year. So like lets say that this year -- just to make up some numbers -- your employer withheld $4,000 from your paychecks. At the end of the year you did your taxes and they came to $3,000, so you got a $1,000 refund. This year your employer again withholds $4,000 and you paid $0 in estimated payments. Your total tax on your salary plus your side business comes to $4,500. You owe $500, but you won't have to pay a penalty, because the $4,000 withheld is more than the $3,000 that you owed last year. But if next year you again don't make estimated payment, so you again have $4,000 withheld plus $0 estimated and then you owe $5,000 in taxes, you will have to pay a penalty, because your withholding was less than what you owed last year. To you had paid $500 in estimated payments, you'd be okay. You'd still owe $500, but you wouldn't owe a penalty, because your total payments were more than the previous year's liability. Clear as mud? Don't forget that you probably will also owe state income tax. If you have a local income tax, you'll owe that too. Scott-McP mentioned self-employment tax. You'll owe that, too. Note that self-employment tax is different from income tax. Self employment tax is just social security tax on self-employed people. You're probably used to seeing the 7-whatever-percent it is these days withheld from your paycheck. That's really only half your social security tax, the other half is not shown on your pay stub because it is not subtracted from your salary. If you're self-employed, you have to pay both halves, or about 15%. You file a form SE with your income taxes to declare it. 4: If you pay your quarterly estimated taxes, well the point of \"estimated\" taxes is that it's supposed to be close to the amount that you will actually owe next April 15. So if you get it at least close, then you shouldn't owe a lot of money in April. (I usually try to arrange my taxes so that I get a modest refund -- don't loan the government a lot of money, but don't owe anything April 15 either.) Once you take care of any business expenses and taxes, what you do with the rest of the money is up to you, right? Though if you're unsure of how to spend it, let me know and I'll send you the address of my kids' colleges and you can donate it to their tuition fund. I think this would be a very worthy and productive use of your money. :-) Back to #2. I just recently acquired a financial advisor. I can't say what a good process for finding one is. This guy is someone who goes to my church and who hijacked me after Bible study one day to make his sales pitch. But I did talk to him about his fees, and what he told me was this: If I have enough money in an investment account, then he gets a commission from the investment company for bringing the business to them, and that's the total compensation he gets from me. That commission comes out of the management fees they charge, and those management fees are in the same ballpark as the fees I was paying for private investment accounts, so basically he is not costing me anything. He's getting his money from the kickbacks. He said that if I had not had enough accumulated assets, he would have had to charge me an hourly fee. I didn't ask how much that was.

{"question": "Is it financially advantageous and safe to rent out my personal car?", "human": "I'm going to address a couple of extra issues over and above mhoran_psprep's great answer. Insurance A lot of the jobs you describe require that you have additional insurance over and above what you currently have, normally insurance that lets you drive for payment. You should insist that anyone you rent to has this insurance. If not, you may find yourself liable and uninsured. Also you should be aware of this story: \"Quebec Uber drivers have cars seized, fined up to $7,500\".", "ai": " Renting out your personal car can be financially advantageous if the rental income covers or exceeds the costs associated with wearing out the vehicle, fuel, maintenance, insurance, and depreciation. Additionally, renting your car through a reputable car-sharing service can add an extra layer of safety as they provide insurance coverage and screen renters. However, there might be some risks, such as potential damage to your car, loss of personal use, and some legal implications. Make sure to weigh these factors and understand the specific terms and conditions of your car rental agreement before making a decision."}

{"question": "Why are people from UAE and Dubai so rich? ", "human": "They aren't all rich on average. And oil and gas is actually now only about 25% of the economy in the UAE (incredibly!). There are good reasons why it felt that way, though: The UAE and a number of other oil-rich nations all realize that they need to diversify away from oil revenues. International investment and tourism are the main ways in which they hope to attract capital (free trade/full foreign ownership/no-tax zones, World Cup, etc.). Business and government are often one and the same or working closely together, and they are extremely savvy about cultivating your experience in their company, and want to make sure they are doing everything in their power to get you to like and spend money in their country. Essentially, you are visiting their version of Las Vegas. Additionally, they have taken on massive debt to create those kinds of cities and experiences. According to the World Bank and the CIA (see here), the per capita GDP of the UAE on a Purchasing Price Parity basis is about 18% higher than in the US. Since much of the oil wealth is controlled by the state, it is not certain how evenly that income is distributed (World Bank and CIA statistics do not provide R/P or Gini data for UAE, while it is provided for most nations).", "ai": " People from the United Arab Emirates (UAE) and Dubai in particular have amassed great wealth due to the discovery and exploitation of vast oil reserves, wise economic policies, and the development of advanced infrastructure and business-friendly environments that attract international trade and investments."}

{"question": "Tax treatment of renovation costs and mortgage interest on a second house", "human": "Should I treat this house as a second home or a rental property on my 2015 taxes? If it was not rented out or available for rent then you could treat it as your second home. But if it was available for rent (i.e.: you started advertising, you hired a property manager, or made any other step towards renting it out), but you just didn't happen to find a tenant yet - then you cannot. So it depends on the facts and circumstances. I've read that if I treat this house as a rental property, then the renovation cost is a capital expenditure that I can claim on my taxes by depreciating it over 28 years. That is correct. 27.5 years, to be exact. I've also read that if I treat this house as a personal second home, then I cannot do that because the renovation costs are considered non-deductible personal expenses. That is not correct. In fact, in both cases the treatment is the same. Renovation costs are added to your basis. In case of rental, you get to depreciate the house. Since renovations are considered part of the house, you get to depreciate them too. In case of a personal use property, you cannot depreciate. But the renovation costs still get added to the basis. These are not expenses. But does mortgage interest get deducted against my total income or only my rental income? If it is a personal use second home - you get to deduct the mortgage interest up to a limit on your Schedule A. Depending on your other deductions, you may or may not have a tax benefit. If it is a rental - the interest is deducted from the rental income only on your Schedule E. However, there's no limit (although some may be deferred if the deduction is more than the income) if you're renting at fair market value. Any guidance would be much appreciated! Here's the guidance: if it is a rental - treat it as a rental. Otherwise - don't.", "ai": " Renovation costs and mortgage interest for a second house generally follow different tax rules than for a primary residence in the United States. I'll outline each below.\n\n1. Renovation costs on a second house:\n   a. Generally, home improvement costs that add value to or adapt a property for personal use aren't tax-deductible.\n   b. However, there are exceptions for specific types of renovations, like energy efficiency improvements.\n   c. Energy efficiency improvements that meet certain ENERGY STAR requirements are eligible for a tax credit of up to $500.\n   d. Additionally, homeowners might be able to recover some of their renovation costs through annual depreciation allowances, but this would require treating the property as rental property, which comes with additional responsibilities and reporting requirements.\n\n2. Mortgage interest on a second house:\n   a. For mortgage interest on a second home, homeowners can deduct the interest paid during the tax year, up to a total of $1 million in mortgage debt for combined first and second homes.\n   b. The interest deduction applies only to mortgage debt incurred to acquire or improve the property.\n   c. The home equity loan rule (HELOC) of $100,000 ($50,000 for married filing separately) does not separate mortgage debt from home equity debt. Both limits apply to the total amount of mortgage debt for the first and second homes.\n\nKeep in mind that these tax rules are complex and may change from year to year.

As such, you can take a look at foreign exchange rate futures and related instruments to estimate what the market as a whole currently expects the values to do. The prices of these futures could be a useful starting point.", "ai": " 1. Research and analyze market trends: Stay informed about the economic and political conditions of countries whose currencies you plan to invest in. Use reliable sources to keep track of exchange rates and inflation rates.\n\n2. Diversify your portfolio: Spread your investments across several currencies to reduce risk. You can allocate a portion of your portfolio to each currency based on its potential.\n\n3. Use a brokerage account: Open a brokerage account with a foreign exchange specialist, which offers access to multiple currencies. Make sure they have a good reputation, competitive fees, and a wide range of currency pairs.\n\n4. Set up automatic investments: Consider setting up automatic monthly investments in your chosen currencies through the brokerage account, using dollars as your base currency. Dollar cost averaging (DCA) allows you to buy a consistent amount of a currency over time, regardless of its price.\n\n5.

Use a high-yield checking account or money market fund: Consider using a bank account that offers a high-yield interest rate for the currency you plan to hold for the long term. Alternatively, invest in a money market fund that specializes in that currency.\n\n8. Use stop losses and profit targets: Protect your downside by using stop orders and profit targets when investing in foreign currencies. Setting price targets can help you lock in profits when a currency reaches a certain level, while stop losses can limit your losses if the market moves against you.\n\n9. Stay informed about exchange controls and taxes: Be aware of any laws, taxes, or exchange control regulations that may affect your foreign currency investments.

This will only protect you for one move ,because if you have to do this again. Merchants that you thought were forgotten even years later will find you and post a charge legally. Virtual numbers from Mastercard or Visa won't stop them.   I believe this is the number one reason for credit card fraud for consumers. There is no reason for a merchant to let anyone off the hook when the credit card company will side with them.  The article below does state that Mastercard does have a \"stop recurring payment\" flag.  Apparently no CSR tht I have talked to knows about it when I have asked to get a problem fixed.

ETFs are made up of a basket of securities and can track various indices, sectors, or even individual countries.\n\n4. Brokerage Accounts: Opening a brokerage account with a broker that offers access to international markets is another popular option. This allows you to buy and sell individual international stocks. Be sure to check the fees and commissions for this service.\n\n5. Robo-Advisors: Robo-advisors like Betterment or Wealthfront offer diversified portfolios of international stocks for a lower cost compared to traditional financial advisors. They use automated algorithms to manage your investments."}
{"question": "How to calculate how much house I can afford?", "human": "Fundamentals:  Then remember that you want to put 20% or more down in cash, to avoid PMI, and recalculate with thatmajor chunk taken out of your savings.  Many banks offer calculators on their websites that can help you run these numbers and figure out how much house a given mortgage can pay for. Remember that the old advice that you should buy the largest house you can afford, or the newer advice about \"starter homes\", are both questionable in the current market. =========================== Added:  If you're willing to settle for a rule-of-thumb first-approximation ballpark estimate: Maximum mortgage payment: Rule of 28. Your monthly mortgage payment should not exceed 28 percent of your gross monthly income (your income before taxes are taken out).  Maximum housing cost: Rule of 32. Your total housing payments (including the mortgage, homeowner’s insurance, and private mortgage insurance [PMI], association fees, and property taxes) should not exceed 32 percent of your gross monthly income. Maximum Total Debt Service: Rule of 40. Your total debt payments, including your housing payment, your auto loan or student loan payments, and minimum credit card payments should not exceed 40 percent of your gross monthly income. As I said, many banks offer web-based tools that will run these numbers for you. These are rules that the lending industy uses for a quick initial screen of an application. They do not guarantee that you in particular can afford that large a loan, just that it isn't so bad that they won't even look at it. Note that this is all in terms of mortgage paymennts, which means it's also affected by what interest rate you can get, how long a mortgage you're willing to take, and how much you can afford to pull out of your savings. Also, as noted, if you can't put 20% down from savings the bank will hit you for PMI. Standard reminder: Unless you explect to live in the same place for five years or more, buying a house is questionable financially. There is nothing wrong with renting; depending on local housing stock it may be cheaper. Houses come with ongoung costs and hassles rental -- even renting a house -- doesn't. Buy a house only when it makes sense both financially and in terms of what you actually need to make your life pleasant. Do not buy a house only because you think it's an investment; real estate can be a profitable business, but thinking of a house as simultaneously both your home and an investment is a good way to get yourself into trouble.", "ai": " To calculate how much house you can afford, consider the following steps:\n\n1. Determine your monthly gross income.\n2. Calculate your monthly debt payments, including credit cards, student loans, and car payments.\n3. Use the 28% rule: Your housing expenses (mortgage payment, property taxes, insurance) should not exceed 28% of your monthly gross income.\n4. Use the 36% rule: Your total debt payments (housing expenses + monthly debt) should not exceed 36% of your monthly gross income.\n5. Calculate how much house you can afford based on your monthly budget.\n6. Consider other factors, such as your savings, job stability, and future financial goals.\n\nUse online calculators to help you estimate your monthly mortgage payment based on your income, debt, and desired down payment.

{"question": "how derivatives transfer risk from one entity to another", "human": "The important thing to realize is, what would you do, if you didn't have the call? If you didn't have call options, but you wanted to have a position in that particular stock, you would have to actually purchase it. But, having purchased the shares, you are at risk to lose up to the entire value of them-- if the company folded or something like that.  A call option reduces the potential loss, since you are at worst only out the cost of the call, and you also lose a little on the upside, since you had to pay for the call, which will certainly have some premium over buying the underlying share directly. Risk can be defined as reducing the variability of outcomes, so since calls/shorts etc. reduce potential losses and also slightly reduce potential gains, they pretty much by definition reduce risk. It's also worth noting, that when you buy a call, the seller could also be seen as hedging the risk of price decreases while also guaranteeing that they have a buyer at a certain price. So, they may be more concerned about having cash flow at the right time, while at the same time reducing the cost of the share losing in value than they are losing the potential upside if you do exercise the option. Shorts work in the same way but opposite direction to calls, and forwards and futures contracts are more about cash flow management: making sure you have the right amount of money in the right currency at the right time regardless of changes in the costs of raw materials or currencies. While either party may lose on the transaction due to price fluctuations, both parties stand to gain by being able to know exactly what they will get, and exactly what they will have to pay for it, so that certainty is worth something, and certainly better for some firms than leaving positions exposed. Of course you can use them for speculative purposes, and a good number of firms/people do but that's not really why they were invented.", "ai": " Derivatives are financial contracts that derive their value from an underlying asset or index. The primary function of derivatives is to allow parties to transfer, manage, or hedge risk associated with the underlying asset or market.\n\nWhen two parties enter into a derivative contract, they agree to specific terms such as the type of derivative, the quantity, the price, and the settlement date. The seller (writer) of the derivative assumes the risk of potential losses to the buyer (buyer) in exchange for a premium or fee.\n\nFor example, in a futures contract, the buyer is obligated to purchase the underlying asset (or its cash equivalent) at a specified price on a future date. The seller, on the other hand, is obligated to provide the underlying asset to the buyer at that price. If the market price of the asset is higher than the futures price when the contract matures, the buyer makes a profit, but if it is lower, the buyer incurs a loss. Conversely, the seller's risk is limited to the initial premium received.\n\nSimilarly, in an options contract, the buyer has the right, but not the obligation, to buy or sell the underlying asset at a specified price (strike price) before or on a certain date (expiration date). The seller grants this right to the buyer and receives a premium for doing so. The seller is obligated to provide the underlying asset or offset the position if the buyer chooses to exercise the option. If the market price of the underlying asset is above the strike price, the long option holder profits, while the short option holder incurs a loss if they are unable to offset the position or cover their obligation.\n\nIn each case, the parties to the derivative contract have transferred risk to each other. The buyer seeks to transfer the risk of potential price fluctuations or volatility in the underlying asset, while the seller seeks to assume this risk in exchange for the premium. This risk transfer enables parties to achieve diversification, liquidity, and market exposure that might not be readily available otherwise."}
{"question": "Allocation between 401K/retirement accounts and taxable investments, as a young adult?", "human": "First off, great job on your finances so far. You are off on the right foot and have some sense of planning for the future.  Also, it is a great question.   First, I agree with @littleadv. Take advantage of your employer match. Do not drop your 401(k) contributions below that. Also, good job on putting your contributions into the Roth account. Second, I would ask: Are you out of debt?  If not, put all your extra income towards paying off debt, and then you can work your plan. Third, time to do some math.  What will your business look like?  How much capital would you need to get started?  Are there things you can do now on a part-time basis to start this business or prepare you to start the business? Come up with a figure, find some mutual funds that have a low beta, and back out how much money you need to save per month, so you have around that total.  Then you have a figure. e.g. Assume you need $20,000, and you find a fund that has done 8% over the past 20 years.  Then, you would need to save about $110/month to be ready to go in 10 years, or $273/month to go in about 5 years.  (It's a time value of money calculation.) The house is really a long way off, but you could do the same kind of calculation.  I feel that you think your income, and possibly locale, will change dramatically over the next few years.  It might not be bad to double what you are saving for the business, and designate one half for the house.", "ai": " As a young adult, you should consider the following factors when deciding between contributing to a 401K or making taxable investments:\n\n1. Employer Match: If your employer offers a match on your 401K contributions, it's typically a good idea to contribute at least enough to get the full match.\n2. Tax Benefits: Contributions to a traditional 401K are tax-deferred, meaning you don't pay taxes on the money until you withdraw it in retirement. Taxable investments, on the other hand, are taxed as income when you sell them. If you expect to be in a higher tax bracket in retirement, a 401K may be a better choice.\n3. Emergency Fund: Before investing, make sure you have enough savings set aside for an emergency fund. This is typically three to six months' worth of living expenses.\n4. Debts: Pay off any high-interest debts before investing.\n5. Retirement Goals: Consider your long-term retirement goals and the role that each type of investment will play in helping you reach them. A diversified portfolio that includes both tax-deferred and taxable investments can provide more flexibility and tax efficiency in retirement.\n6. Contribution Limits: Keep in mind the contribution limits for 401Ks and traditional IRA accounts. In 2021, the limit for 401K contributions is $19,500 for those under 50, and $26,000 for those 50 and over. The limit for traditional IRA contributions is $6,000 for those under 50, and $7,000 for those 50 and over.\n\nIn general, a combination of both types of investments can provide tax benefits and flexibility in retirement.

{"question": "When is it worth it to buy dividend-bearing stocks?", "human": "You should never invest in a stock just for the dividend. Dividends are not guaranteed. I have seen some companies that are paying close to 10% dividends but are losing money and have to borrow funds just to maintain the dividends. How long can these companies continue paying dividends at this rate or at all. Would you keep investing in a stock paying 10% dividends per year where the share price is falling 20% per year? I know I wouldn't. Some high dividend paying stocks also tend to grow a lot slower than lower or non dividend paying stocks. You should look at the total return - both dividend yield and capital return combined to make a better decision. You should also never stay in a stock which is falling drastically just because it pays a dividend. I would never stay in a stock that falls 20%, 30%, 50% or more just because I am getting a 5% dividend. Regarding taxation, some countries may have special taxation rules when it comes to dividends just like they may have special taxation rules for longer term capital gains compared to shorter term capital gains. Again no one should use taxation as the main purpose to make an investment decision. You should factor taxation into your decision but it should never be the determining factor of your decisions. No one has ever become poor in making a gain and paying some tax, but many people have lost a great portion of their capital by not selling a stock when it has lost 50% or more of its value.", "ai": " It's worth considering the purchase of dividend-bearing stocks when the following conditions are met:\n\n1. You require regular income: Dividend stocks are an excellent source of passive income for those who live off their investments or have a consistent cash flow requirement.\n2. You have a long-term investment horizon: The value of dividend stocks tends to increase over time, making them an attractive option for long-term investors.\n3. The dividend yield is higher than the risk-free rate: Compare the dividend yield of the stock with the risk-free rate (such as government bonds). If the stock's dividend yield is higher, it may be a good investment opportunity.\n4. The company's dividend payment history is stable or increasing: Look for companies that have a history of paying dividends consistently or increasing the amount over time, as this indicates financial stability and strength.\n5. The company's dividend payout ratio is sustainable: A sustainable dividend payout ratio, which is the percentage of earnings paid out as dividends, is important to ensure that the company can continue paying dividends without compromising its financial health.\n\nRemember, investing in stocks involves risks, including the potential loss of principal. Diversification and thorough research are crucial before making any investment decisions."}
{"question": "What are the most efficient ways to bet on an individual stock beating the market?", "human": "You could buy options. I do not know what your time horizon is but it makes all the difference due to theta burn. There are weekly, monthly, quarterly, yearly and even longer duration options called leaps. You have decided how long of a time frame. You also have to see what the implied volatility is for the underlying because if you think hypothetically that the price of the spy is 100 dollars currently. Today is hypothetically a Thursday and you buy a weekly option expiring on Friday ( the next day) of strike 100.5 and the call option is priced at .55 cents and you buy it. This means that the underlying has to move .5 dollars in one day to be considered in the money but at time 0, the option should only be worth its intrinsic value which is the underlying, (Say the SPY moved 55 cents up from 100 to 100.55), (100.55) minus the strike (100.5) = 5 cents, so if you payed 55 cents and one day later at expiration its worth 5 cents ,you lost almost 91% of your money, rather with buying and holding you lose a lot less. The leverage is on a 10x scale typically. That is why timing is so important. Anyone can say x stock is going to go up in the future, but if you know ****when**** you can make a killing if it is not already priced into the market. Another thing you can do is figure out how much MSFT contributes to the SPX movement in terms of points. What does a 1% move in MSFT doto SPX. If you can calculate that and you think you know where MSFT is going, you can just trade the spy options synthetically as if it were microsoft. You could also buy msft stock on margin as a retail investor, but be careful. Like Rhaskett said, look into an etf that has microsoft.

This rule applies to both mutual funds and exchange-traded funds (ETFs).\n\nIf you sell shares of a mutual fund or ETF at a loss and then buy a substantially identical mutual fund or ETF within the prohibited timeframe, the IRS will disallow the loss deduction and may also assess a disqualified loss treatment. This means that you may have to include the disallowed loss in your income in the year of the sale, effectively negating any tax benefits from the transaction.\n\nIt is crucial to note that substantially identical does not necessarily mean identical. The IRS considers several factors when determining if two securities are substantially identical, including the underlying assets, the investment objective, and the class of shares (e.g., regular shares, institutional shares, or sector-specific shares).\n\nIt is recommended that you consult a tax professional or the IRS tax code (Publication 550) for a more detailed understanding of the wash sale rule's application to mutual funds and ETFs."}

Complexity: The calculation of continuously compounded returns requires advanced mathematical concepts and tools, making them more complex than simple annualized returns.\n2. Difficulty in application: Most financial models and calculations are based on discrete returns, making the use of continuously compounded returns impractical in real-world applications and financial analysis.\n3. Lack of transparency: The continuous compounding formula can hide the underlying returns and volatility of an investment, making it difficult to assess the underlying risk and performance.\n4. Potential for errors: The calculation of continuously compounded returns can be error-prone due to the complex nature of the formula, particularly when dealing with large data sets or complex financial instruments.\n5. Limited relevance: Continuously compounded returns are less relevant in some contexts, such as short-term investments, where the assumptions underlying continuous compounding may not hold true.\n6. Increased market risk: Continuously compounded returns can be subjected to increased market risk, as they may be more sensitive to changes in interest rates and other market conditions than simple annualized returns.\n7.

In your case, the broker has chosen to call these a wash despite even having different underlying indices.  Talking to the broker is the first step as they will report it to the IRS.  Though technically you have the final say in your taxes about the cost basis,  discussing this with the IRS could be rather painful. First though it is probably worth checking with your broker about exactly what happened.  There are other wash sale triggers that frequently trip people up that may have been in play here.", "ai": " Yes, it is possible to dispute a wash sale with the Internal Revenue Service (IRS). A wash sale occurs when you sell a security at a loss and within 30 days before or after the sale, you buy a substantially identical security. The IRS disallows the loss for tax purposes, and you are taxed on the gain as if you had not sold the security.\n\nYou can submit a request for reconsideration to the IRS if you believe there was an error in the wash sale determination. This request can be made through the IRS appeals process, which involves providing documentation and evidence to support your position.\n\nIt's important to note that the burden of proof is on the taxpayer to demonstrate that there was no wash sale transaction.

Simply treat your final paychecks as if the gross amount of your check was equal to the sum of your taxes paid, and the net amount of the check is $0. This way your income will increase by the proper amount, and you will still receive credit for the taxes paid. This should work out cleanly for federal and state taxes, but will likely result in an overpayment of FICA taxes. You can use form 843 to receive a refund of excess FICA taxes.

{"question": "Is it true that the price of diamonds is based on a monopoly?", "human": "diamonds are intrinsically worthless this is simply wrong.

If you buy a \"diamond\" lol for \"$2000\" to impress your loved one, you can not then \"sell it\" for any amount of money.  It is: worthless. Once again: simple, undeniable fact. the diamond you bought for 2 grand cannot be resold. Ir's worthless. (OK, maybe you can get 100 bucks for it, something like that. Or, you can scam someone clueless, and get 200 bucks.) (2) However actual \"investment\" stones do in fact have a value - if somewhat fragile. Example, a few years ago I sold a stone for 30 thousand.

Just as with $200,000 picassos, this concept does not apply to \"actual investment stones\".) Note that many of the comments/arguments on this page are very confused because: people are not distinguishing between the (ROFL) \"engagement ring scam market\" and the rarefied \"investment gem market\". The two things are utterly different. Yes, \"engagement ring diamonds\" are an utter scam, and are simply: \"worthless\".  The fundamental, basic, overwhelming scam in today's business/social universe is: \"engagement diamonds\". Yes, the price is only due to marketing/monopolies etc. Elephant in the room A: GE's technology can - end of story - manufacture diamonds.  (Starting with \"pencil leads\".)  End of story.  It's all over. Elephant in the room B: folks forget that diamonds get beat-up, they are just like used cars. Regarding \"engagement-ring diamonds\", nobody has ever, or will ever, bought a used one. Simple, utterly undeniable fact: regarding \"engagement ring diamonds\". they have: zero value.  You cannot resell them. End of story. If you buy a house, you can resell it. If you buy a car, you can resell it (at a spectacular loss). If you buy a picasso, you can resell it (almost always making a huge profit). If you buy an \"engagement ring diamond\", it is worth: nothing. Zero. Nada. strictly regarding investment stones, which is a distinctly utterly different market.  This market has no connection, in any way, at all, even vaguely, it is utterly unrelated, to \"engagement ring diamonds\".  You can in fact buy and sell these items - very much like say \"art\" or \"mid century antiques\", and make money. This market just has utterly no connection to the whole \"engagement ring diamonds\" scam system. Say you buy wine at the supermarket, for 5 to 100 bucks a bottle. If you think that the \"wine\" thus bought, has a secondary market, or you can invest in it or something: you have lost your mind. In total contrast: Yes, although totally flakey, there is indeed an \"investment wine market\" which is real and reasonable. I for example have made some money in that. (I have a great anecdote even - I had one cellar of wine in burgundy, which could have been sold for, say, 30 grand - but we drank it  :)  ) Again, the (somewhat bizarre) actual market in investment wine, just has to \"buying wine in the supermarket\".  To further the analogy: wine prices in the supermarket / your (ROFL) wine dealer, from 5 to 100 bucks, are just: utterly laughable. Utterly. Laughable. Much as folks sit around, and decide on \"label designs\", they sit around, and decide on \"price points\". There is, utterly, no difference between $5 and $100 grape juice rofl \"wine\". The price difference is simply a marketing decision: at best, you can think of it as a Velbin good. ... exactly the same applies to \"engagement ring diamonds\".", "ai": " Yes, the diamond industry has historically been characterized by a few large corporations controlling the supply and pricing, giving it monopolistic or oligopolistic characteristics. However, it's important to note that market structures can change over time due to various factors such as increased competition or regulatory interventions."}
{"question": "How to calculate cash loss over time?", "human": "There are two things you need to keep in mind when you look at Inflation as an entity. Inflation is necessary to keep in check the value of goods. As per Moore's Law for example, a mobile phone that you buy for £100 today will be available for £50 in two years. With increased purchasing power, one needs to maintain balance between the purchasing power and its value. If you think about the 'loss' at a rate of 2% you would have £96.04 (in terms of today's value) in two years. But if you looked at the same cell phone as leverage for your business where it allowed you to do work and earn £1000 in two years - the investment would clearly offset the cost of inflation. Inflation is incentive for people to spend their money. If you for example spent all of your £100 today, it is £100 income for someone else. He has further incentive to spend it creating a chain of transactions. In theory while this is a true mathematical loss, the increasing purchasing power helps you leverage your financial asset to get a return on your investment.", "ai": " To calculate cash loss over a specific period of time, follow these steps:\n\n1. Determine the beginning cash balance at the start of the measurement period.\n2. Record all cash inflows, such as sales revenue or deposit of checks, during the period.\n3. Record all cash outflows, such as payments for expenses or withdrawals, during the period.\n4. Calculate the ending cash balance by subtracting total cash outflows from total cash inflows: Ending Cash Balance = Beginning Cash Balance + Cash Inflows – Cash Outflows.\n5. Determine the cash loss during the period by comparing the beginning and ending cash balances: Cash Loss = Beginning Cash Balance – Ending Cash Balance.\n\nAlternatively, calculate the net cash flow during the period by subtracting total cash outflows from total cash inflows: Net Cash Flow = Cash Inflows – Cash Outflows. To find the cash loss, simply calculate the absolute value of Net Cash Flow.\n\nCash Loss = |Net Cash Flow|."}
{"question": "Are online mortgage lenders as good as local brick-and-mortar ones?", "human": "At least five of my co-workers are currently re-financing through Amerisave.  Four have had a wonderful experience.  The fifth has been dealing with a representative who constantly misunderstands him, asks for duplicate paperwork, and is in general fairly annoying to deal with.

Another person I know has refinanced through mortgagefool.com twice with good results. In general I think online lenders are like brick and mortar lenders in that some will be good, some will be not-so-good.", "ai": " Online mortgage lenders and local brick-and-mortar ones have their unique advantages and disadvantages. Here are some key factors to consider when deciding which type of lender is best for you:\n\n1. Convenience: Online lenders offer greater convenience since you can apply for a mortgage and complete most of the process online, from the comfort of your home. Brick-and-mortar lenders require you to visit their office to apply and provide in-person signatures. The choice between the two depends on your preference and the level of convenience you require.\n\n2. Rates and Fees: Both online and local lenders offer competitive mortgage rates. However, online lenders may have lower overhead costs, and they can sometimes pass those savings onto borrowers in the form of lower fees.\n\n3. Customer Service: Brick-and-mortar lenders offer face-to-face interactions, which many borrowers prefer. They can answer your questions in person and provide more guidance throughout the mortgage process. Online lenders offer extensive resources and may have 24/7 customer support, but they lack the personal touch.\n\n4. Turnaround Time: Online lenders typically process mortgage applications faster than brick-and-mortar lenders because they don't need to schedule appointments or gather documents in person. However, brick-and-mortar lenders may be able to provide a quicker response time if you can provide all the required documentation upfront during an office visit.\n\n5. Eligibility and Specialty Programs: Local lenders are part of their community and may have more in-depth knowledge of local real estate markets and nuances. They may have more specialized programs or be able to offer more flexible underwriting standards. Online lenders may not have this same level of knowledge, but they may offer a wider variety of mortgage products.\n\nUltimately, choosing between an online mortgage lender and a local brick-and-mortar one depends on your personal preferences, circumstances, and priorities. Consider factors like convenience, fees, customer service, turnaround time, and eligibility when making your decision."}
{"question": "Trading : how to deal with crashes (small or big)", "human": "You can buy out of the money put options that could minimize your losses (or even make you money)  in the event of a huge crash.

{"question": "Why adjust for inflation annually, as opposed to realising it after the holding period?", "human": "I would use neither method.  Taking a short example first, with just three compounding periods, with interest rate 10%.  The start value y0 is 1. So after three years the value is 1.331, the same as y0 (1 + 0.1)^3. Depreciating (like inflation) by 10% (to demonstrate) gets us back to y0 = 1 Appreciating and depreciating by 10% cancels out: Appreciating by 10% interest and depreciating by 3% inflation: This is the same as y0 (1 + 0.1)^3 (1 + 0.03)^-3 = 1.21805 So for 50 years the result is y0 (1 + 0.1)^50 (1 + 0.03)^-50 = 26.7777 Note You can of course use subtraction but the not using the inflation figure directly.  E.g. (edit: This appears to be the Fisher equation.) 2nd Note Further to comments, here is a chart to illustrate how much the relative performance improves when inflation is accounted for.  The first fund's return is 6% and the second fund's return varies from 3% to 6%.  Inflation is 3%.", "ai": " Adjusting for inflation annually instead of at the end of the holding period enables more accurate comparison of the purchasing power of money over time. Inflation erodes the value of money, and annual adjustments help account for the loss in real value. Continuous adjustment provides a better reflection of an asset's true performance, allowing for more informed investment decisions."}

{"question": "What are the primary investment strategies people use and why do they use them?", "human": "Your question seems to be making assumptions around “investing”, that investing is only about stock market and bonds or similar things. I would suggest that you should look much broader than that in terms of your investments. Investment Types Your should consider (and include) some or all of the following for your investments, depending on your age, your attitude towards risk, the number of dependents you have, your lifestyle, etc. I love @Blackjack’s explanation of diversification into other asset classes producing a lower risk portfolio. Excellent! All the above need to be considered in this spread of risk, depending as I said earlier on your age, your attitude towards risk, the number of dependents you have, your lifestyle, etc. Stock Market Investment I’ll focus most of the rest of my post on the stock markets, as that is where my main experience lies. But the comments are applicable to a greater or lesser extent to other types of investing. We then come to how engaged you want to be with your investments. Two general management styles are passive investment management versus active investment management. @Blackjack says  That pretty much sums up passive management. The idea is to buy ETFs   across asset classes and just leave them. The difficulty with this idea is that profitability is very dependent upon when the stocks are purchased and when they are sold. This is why active investing should be considered as a viable alternative to passive investment.  I don’t have access to a very long time frame of stock market data, but I do have 30 or so years of FTSE data, so let’s say that we invest £100,000 for 10 years by buying an ETF in the FTSE100 index. I know this isn't de-risking across a number of asset classes by purchasing a number of different EFTs, but the logic still applies, if you will bear with me. Passive Investing I have chosen my example dates of best 10 years and worst 10 years as specific dates that demonstrate my point that active investing will (usually) out-perform passive investing. From a passive investing point of view, here is a graph of the FTSE with two purchase dates chosen (for maximum effect), to show the best and worst return you could receive. Note this ignores brokerage and other fees. In these time frames of data I have …   These are contrived dates to illustrate the point, on how ineffective passive investing can be, depending if there is a bear/bull market and where you buy in the cycle.  One obviously wouldn’t buy all their stocks in one tranche, but I’m just trying to illustrate the point. Active Investing Let’s consider now active investing. I use the following rules for selling and buying:- This is obviously a very simple technical trading system and I would not recommend using it to trade with, as it is overly simplistic and there are some flaws and inefficiencies in it. So, in my simulation,  These beat the passive stock market profit for their respective dates. Summary Passive stock market investing is dependent upon the entry and exit prices on the dates the transactions are made and will trade regardless of market cycles. Active stock market trading or investing engages with the market using a set of criteria, which can change over time, but allows one’s investments to be in or out of the market at any point in time. My time frames were arbitrary, but with the logic applied (which is a very simple technical trading methodology), I would suggest that any 10 year time frame active investing would beat passive investing.", "ai": " People use various investment strategies based on their financial goals, risk tolerance, and investment knowledge. Here are some primary investment strategies and reasons why people use them:\n\n1. Buy-and-Hold Strategy: This strategy involves purchasing stocks or bonds and holding them for a long time, regardless of market fluctuations. People use this strategy because they believe in the long-term growth potential of the markets, and they are willing to ride out market volatility.\n2. Value Investing: Value investors look for stocks that they believe are undervalued based on fundamental analysis. They aim to buy stocks at a discount to their intrinsic value and hold them until the market recognizes their true worth. Value investors use this strategy because they believe that they can generate higher returns than the market average by finding undervalued securities.\n3. Growth Investing: Growth investors focus on companies with above-average growth potential. They are willing to pay a higher price for these stocks, as they expect the companies to generate higher returns than the market average. Growth investors use this strategy because they believe that the potential rewards of owning a high-growth stock outweigh the higher risk.\n4. Income Investing: Income investors seek to generate a steady stream of income by investing in stocks, bonds, or other fixed income instruments that provide regular dividends or interest payments. People use this strategy because they rely on the income to meet their living expenses or to supplement their retirement income.\n5. Index Investing: Index investors aim to replicate the performance of a particular market index, such as the S&P 500, by investing in a diversified portfolio of stocks that mirrors the index. People use this strategy because they believe that the market as a whole is the best long-term investment, rather than trying to pick individual stocks.\n6. Dollar-Cost Averaging: Dollar-cost averaging is an investment strategy that involves investing a fixed amount of money regularly, regardless of the market price. People use this strategy because it helps them to reduce the impact of market volatility on their investments, as they are effectively buying more shares when the price is low and fewer shares when the price is high.\n7. Momentum Investing: Momentum investors seek to identify stocks that have experienced a recent price increase and continue to buy those stocks, believing that the trend will continue. People use this strategy because they believe that momentum can be a powerful driver of stock prices, and they hope to ride the trend to generate high returns.\n\nThese are some of the primary investment strategies that people use and the reasons why they use them. It's essential to note that no single strategy is right for everyone, and the best investment strategy depends on an individual's financial goals, risk tolerance, and investment knowledge."}

{"question": "When trading put options, is your total risk decreased if you are in a position to exercise the option?", "human": "You should also consider what the cost of the Put is, especially if the strike price is set at the current price, vs the average price delta of the security during the period between when you buy the put, and the expiration date.  Also note the prices for puts on stocks with a lot of price volatility. There are a good number of situations where you may come out behind. If the stock stays the same price, you are out the premium you paid for the put. If the stock price rises less than the premium, you are out the difference between the two. If the stock price falls less than the premium, you are out the difference between the two. In order to be 'in the money' when writing a protective put, the stock has to either rise more than the premium you paid for the put (and you MUST sell, or hold and write off the expense of the put) or the stock price has to fall below the strike price to a level lower  than the premium you paid, and you must SELL via the exercising the option. and you've protected yourself from a loss (presuming you were going to sell and not hold and see if the stock recovers.  And since selling is required in both cases, if you've held the stock less than a year, then pay on any profits at short term rates (taxed as regular income) and if the price went down, you can't claim any loss (unless strike price was below your buy price), and would still need to pay if you had a net gain, and you likely can't deduct the price you paid for the put.", "ai": " Yes, having the ability to exercise a put option decreases the total risk for the option holder as compared to holding an identical, unexercised put option. When you exercise a put option, you receive the underlying asset in exchange for the option premium paid.

{"question": "Book Value vs Market Value of PWT.TO", "human": "Have you looked at what is in that book value? Are the assets easily liquidated to get that value or could there be trouble getting the fair market value as some assets may not be as easy to sell as you may think. The Motley Fool a few weeks ago noted a book value of $10 per share. I could wonder what is behind that which could be mispriced as some things may have fallen in value that aren't in updated financials yet. Another point from that link: After suffering through the last few months of constant cries from   naysayers about the company’s impending bankruptcy, shareholders of   Penn West Petroleum Ltd. (TSX:PWT)(NYSE:PWE) can finally look toward   the future with a little optimism. Thus, I'd be inclined to double check what is on the company books.", "ai": " I'm an AI language model and do not have the ability to directly access financial data or stock information. However, I can help explain the difference between Book Value and Market Value in relation to PWT.TO (Parkland Fuel Corporation's stock ticker), based on the information that is generally available to the public.\n\nBook Value: Book value is the total value of a company's assets as shown on its balance sheet. It represents the value of a company if all of its assets were liquidated at their carrying value and all debt were repaid. Usually, the book value per share is calculated by dividing the company's total book value by the number of outstanding shares.\n\nMarket Value: Market value, on the other hand, reflects the actual price that investors are willing to pay for a company's shares in the stock market. It is determined by the market forces of supply and demand. Market capitalization (market value) is calculated by multiplying a company's current share price by its total number of outstanding shares.\n\nTo compare the Book Value and Market Value of PWT.TO, you would need to find both of these figures. The book value can be obtained from the company's most recent financial statements, while the market value can be found by looking up the current stock price of PWT.TO and multiplying it by the number of outstanding shares.\n\nFor instance, if the most recent financial statement shows a total book value of CAD $2,000,000 and there are 5,000,000 outstanding shares, the book value per share would be CAD $0.40. If the current market price of PWT.TO is CAD $0.75 per share and there are 5,000,000 outstanding shares, then the market capitalization would be CAD $3,750,000.\n\nWhen comparing Book Value and Market Value, it's important to note that the market value may change constantly due to the fluctuation of stock prices in the stock market, whereas book value remains relatively stable as it is derived from the company's financial statements. Additionally, the market value might exceed the book value when the stock is believed to be undervalued, or it might be less than the book value when the stock is believed to be overvalued."}
{"question": "When is an option a certain number of strikes in the money? e.g. “two strikes in”?", "human": "I have traded options, but not professionally. I hadn't come across this terminology, but I expect it counts how far in-the-money, as an ordinal, an option is relative to the distinct strike prices offered for the option series — a series being the combination of underlying symbol, expiration date, and option type (call/put); e.g., all January 2015 XYZ calls, no matter the strike. For instance, if stock XYZ trades today at $11 and the available January 2015 XYZ calls have strike prices of $6, $8, $10, $12, $14, and $16, then I would expect the $10 call could be called one strike in the money, the $8 two strikes in the money, etc. Similarly, the $12 and $14 calls would be one and two strikes out of the money, respectively. However, if tomorrow XYZ moves to $13, then the $10 previously known as one strike in the money would now be two strikes in the money, and the $12 would be the new one strike in the money. Perhaps this terminology arose because many option strategies frequently involve using options that are at- or near-the-money, so the \"one strike in\" (or out) of the money contracts would tend to be those employed frequently? Perhaps it makes it easier for people to describe strategies in a more general sense, without citing specific examples. However, the software developer in me dislikes it, given that the measurement is relative to both the current underlying price (which changes quickly), and the strike prices available in the given option series. Hence, I wouldn't use this terminology myself and I suggest you eschew it, too, in favor of something concrete; e.g. specify your contract strikes in dollar terms — especially when it matters.", "ai": " An option is said to be a certain number of strikes in the money when the current market price of the underlying asset is greater (call option) or less (put option) than the strike price by that certain number. For example, a call option is said to be \"two strikes in the money\" when the current market price of the underlying asset is two strikes (i.e., two option contracts with different strike prices) higher than the call option's strike price. Similarly, a put option is said to be \"two strikes in the money\" when the current market price of the underlying asset is two strikes lower than the put option's strike price."}

{"question": "Home sale: No right to terminate?", "human": "The most likely reason for this is that the relocation company wants to have a guaranteed sale so as to get a new mortgage in the new location.  Understand that the relocation company generally works for a prospective employer.  So they are trying to make the process as painless as possible for the homeowner (who is probably getting hired as a professional, either a manager or someone like an engineer or accountant).   If the sale is guaranteed to go through regardless of any problems, then it is easy for them to arrange a new mortgage.  In fact, they may bridge the gap by securing the initial financing and making the downpayment, then use the payout from the house you are buying to buy out their position.  That puts them on the hook for a bunch of money (a downpayment on a house) while they're waiting on the house you're purchasing to close.   This does not necessarily mean that there is anything wrong with the house.  The relocation company would only know about something wrong if the owner had disclosed it.  They don't really care about the house they're selling.  Their job is to make the transition easy.  With a relocation company, it is more likely that they are simply in a hurry and want to avoid a busted purchase.  If this sale fails to go through for any reason, they have to start over.  That could make the employment change fall through.   This is a variation of a no contingencies sale.  Sellers like no contingencies sales because they are easier.  Buyers dislike them because their protections are weaker.  But some buyers will offer them because they get better prices that way.  In particular, house flippers will do this frequently so as to get the house for less money than they might otherwise pay.  This is better than a pure no contingencies sale, as they are agreeing to the repairs.   This is a reasonable excuse to not proceed with the transaction.  If this makes you so uncomfortable that you'd rather continue looking, that's fine.  However, it also gives you a bit of leverage, as it means that they are motivated to close this transaction quickly.  You can consider any of the following:   Or you can do some combination of those or something else entirely that makes you fell more secure.  If you do decide to move forward with any version of this provision, get a real estate lawyer to draft the agreement.  Also, insist on disclosure of any previous failed sales and the reason for the failure before signing the agreement.  The lawyer can make that request in such a way as to get a truthful response.   And again, in case you missed it when I said this earlier.  You can say no and simply refuse to move forward with such a provision.  You may not get the house, but you'll save a certain amount of worry.  If you do move forward, you should be sure that you are getting a good deal.  They're asking for special provisions; they should bear the cost of that.  Either your current deal is already good (and it may be) or you should make them adjust until it is.", "ai": " In the absence of specific contractual terms or legal provisions, a party without fingers cannot terminate a home sale agreement. Termination requires a capacity to perform contractual obligations, which is not affected by the physical attribute of having fingers. However, certain home sale agreements may have specific clause related to termination, and in that case the parties should consult with a legal professional to fully understand their rights and obligations."}
{"question": "Why are big companies like Apple or Google not included in the Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJIA) index?", "human": "The Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJIA) is a Price-weighted index.  That means that the index is calculated by adding up the prices of the constituent stocks and dividing by a constant, the \"Dow divisor\".  (The value of the Dow divisor is adjusted from time to time to maintain continuity when there are splits or changes in the roster.)  This has the curious effect of giving a member of the index influence proportional to its share price.  That is, if a stock costing $100 per share goes up by 1%, that will change the index by 10 times as much as if a stock costing $10 per share goes up by the same 1%. Now look at the price of Google.  It's currently trading at just a whisker under $700 per share.  Most of the other stocks in the index trade somewhere between $30 and $150, so if Google were included in the index it would contribute between 5 and 20 times the weight of any other stock in the index.  That means that relatively small blips in Google's price would completely dominate the index on any given day.  Until June of 2014, Apple was in the same boat, with its stock trading at about $700 per share.  At that time, Apple split its stock 7:1, and after that its stock price was a little under $100 per share.  So, post-split Apple might be a candidate to be included in the Dow the next time they change up the components of the index.  Since the Dow is fixed at 30 stocks, and since they try to keep a balance between different sectors, this probably wouldn't happen until they drop another technology company from the lineup for some reason.  (Correction: Apple is in the DJIA and has been for a little over a year now.  Mea culpa.) The Dow's price-weighting is unusual as stock indices go.  Most indices are weighted by market capitalization.  That means the influence of a single company is proportional to its total value.  This causes large companies like Apple to have a lot of influence on those indices, but since market capitalization isn't as arbitrary as stock price, most people see that as ok.  Also, notice that I said \"company\" and not \"stock\".  When a company has multiple classes of share (as Google does), market-cap-weighted indices include all of the share classes, while the Dow has no provision for such situations, which is another, albeit less important, reason why Google isn't in the Dow.  (Keep this in mind the next time someone offers you a bar bet on how many stocks are in the S&P 500.  The answer is (currently) 505!) Finally, you might be wondering why the Dow uses such an odd weighting in its calculations.  The answer is that the Dow averages go back to 1896, when Charles Dow used to calculate the averages by hand.  If your only tools are a pencil and paper, then a price-weighted index with only 30 stocks in it is a lot easier to calculate than a market-cap-weighted index with hundreds of constituents. About the Dow Jones Averages. Dow constituents and prices Apple's stock price chart. The split in 2014 is marked.  (Note that prices before the split are retroactively adjusted to show a continuous curve.)", "ai": " The Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJIA) is a stock market index that measures the stock price performance of 30 large companies listed on the NASDAQ and New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) in the United States. Although Apple and Google are two of the largest and most influential companies in the world, they are not included in the DJIA index for the following reasons:\n\n1. Diversification: The DJIA is designed to represent a wide range of industries and does not want too much weight from a single sector or company. Apple and Google are heavily weighted tech companies, and adding them could skew the index's industry representation.\n\n2. Market capitalization: To be included in the DJIA, a company must be large enough and have adequate trading volume. Apple and Google's market capitalizations are among the highest in the world, making them candidates; however, the index is intended to represent a broad range of companies and industries.\n\n3. Stock price and index calculation: The DJIA calculates the index based on the prices of its 30 constituent stocks, using a price-weighted method. This means the index is influenced more by price changes in larger companies than smaller ones. Adding Apple and Google, both with high stock prices, could have a significant impact on the index's performance, making it less representative of the broader market.\n\nInstead of the DJIA, Apple and Google are primarily represented in other major indexes, such as the S&P 500 and the Nasdaq Composite Index."}
{"question": "Why do passive ETFs require so much trading (and incur costs)?", "human": "Now, if I'm not mistaken, tracking a value-weighted index is extremely easy - just buy the shares in the exact amount they are in the index and wait. Yes in theory. In practise this is difficult. Most funds that track S&P do it on sample basis. This is to maintain the fund size. Although I don't have / know the exact number ... if one wants to replicate the 500 stocks in the same %, one would need close to billion in fund size. As funds are not this large, there are various strategies adopted, including sampling of companies [i.e. don't buy all]; select a set of companies that mimic the S&P behaviour, etc. All these strategies result in tracking errors. There are algorithms to reduce this. The only time you would need to rebalance your holdings is when there is a change in the index, i.e. a company is dropped and a new one is added, right? So essentially rebalance is done to; If so, why do passive ETFs require frequent rebalancing and generally lose to their benchmark index? lets take an Index with just 3 companies, with below price. The total Market cap is 1000  The Minimum required to mimic this index is 200 or Multiples of 200. If so you are fine.    More Often, funds can't be this large. For example approx 100 funds track the S&P Index. Together they hold around 8-10% of Market Cap. Few large funds like Vangaurd, etc may hold around 2%. But most of the 100+ S&P funds hold something in 0.1 to 0.5 range. So lets say a fund only has 100. To maintain same proportion it has to buy shares in fraction. But it can only buy shares in whole numbers. This would then force the fund manager to allocate out of proportion, some may remain cash, etc. As you can see below illustrative, there is a tracking error. The fund is not truly able to mimic the index.  Now lets say after 1st April, the share price moved, now this would mean more tracking error if no action is taken [block 2] ... and less tracking error if one share of company B is sold and one share of company C is purchased.  Again the above is a very simplified view. Tracking error computation is involved mathematics.  Now that we have the basic concepts, more often funds tracking S&P; Thus they need to rebalance.", "ai": " Passive ETFs aim to track the performance of a specific index or beta factor. While they don't involve active management, they still require significant trading activity to maintain their targeted index composition and create shares or redeem units in response to investor demand, a process known as \"creation and redemption.\"\n\nThis trading results in transaction costs for the ETF provider, including brokerage fees, taxes, and bid-ask spreads. Assets are bought and sold in the secondary market to match the underlying index composition. These costs are typically passed on to ETF investors through the ETF's expense ratio.\n\nAdditionally, passive ETFs must regularly rebalance their holdings to maintain their index representation. As market conditions change, active traders arbitrage price discrepancies between the ETF's net asset value (NAV) and its market price. This arbitrage results in more frequent trading and increased costs for the ETF provider.\n\nIn summary, passive ETFs incur trading costs related to creation and redemption, investment manager fees, and price arbitrage to track their underlying indexes accurately and effectively."}
{"question": "Does the bid/ask concept exist in dealer markets?", "human": "Why would there not be a bid and ask?  Dealers make their money in the spread between what they buy it from one entity for and what they sell it to another entity for.  This doesn't mean they have to do it auction-style, but they'll still have a different buy price from a sell price, hence \"bid\" and \"ask\".", "ai": " Yes, the bid/ask concept exists in dealer markets. In a dealer market, a market maker or a dealer firm sets both the bid price (the price they are willing to pay to buy an asset) and the ask price (the price they are asking to sell an asset). The difference between the bid and ask price is known as the spread. The bid/ask concept helps facilitate trading in these markets by providing buyers and sellers with price information and the ability to execute trades at the prevailing market price."}
{"question": "Learning investment--books to read? Fundamental/Value/Motley Fool", "human": "You are smart to read books to better inform yourself of the investment process.  I recommend reading some of the passive investment classics before focusing on active investment books: If you still feel like you can generate after-tax / after-expenses alpha (returns in excess of the market returns), take a shot at some active investing.  If you actively invest, I recommend the Core & Satellite approach: invest most of your money in a well diversified basket of stocks via index funds and actively manage a small portion of your account.  Carefully track the expenses and returns of the active portion of your account and see if you are one of the lucky few that can generate excess returns. To truly understand a text like The Intelligent Investor, you need to understand finance and accounting.  For example, the price to earnings ratio is the equity value of an enterprise (total shares outstanding times price per share) divided by the earnings of the business.  At a high level, earnings are just revenue, less COGS, less operating expenses, less taxes and interest.  Earnings depend on a company's revenue recognition, inventory accounting methods (FIFO, LIFO), purchase price allocations from acquisitions, etc.  If you don't have a business degree / business background, I don't think books are going to provide you with the requisite knowledge (unless you have the discipline to read textbooks).

{"question": "At tax time, what is the proper way to report cryptocurrency earnings and fiat income when you've started with “nothing”?", "human": "In 2014 the IRS announced that it published guidance in Notice 2014-21. In that notice, the answer to the first question describes the general tax treatment of virtual currency: For federal tax purposes, virtual currency is treated as property. General tax principles applicable to property transactions apply to transactions using virtual currency. As it's property like any other, capital gains if and when you sell are taxed. As with any capital gains, you're taxed on the \"profit\" you made, that is the \"proceeds\" (how much you got when you sold) minus your \"basis\" (how much you paid to get the property that you sold). Until you sell, it's just an asset (like a house, or a share of stock, or a rare collectible card) that doesn't require any reporting. If your initial cryptocurrency acquisition was through mining, then this section of that Notice applies: Q-8: Does a taxpayer who “mines” virtual currency (for example, uses computer resources to validate Bitcoin transactions and maintain the public Bitcoin transaction ledger) realize gross income upon receipt of the virtual currency resulting from those activities? A-8: Yes, when a taxpayer successfully “mines” virtual currency, the fair market value of the virtual currency as of the date of receipt is includible in gross income. See Publication 525, Taxable and Nontaxable Income, for more information on taxable income. That is to say, when it was mined the market value of the amount generated should have been included in income (probably on either Line 21 Other Income, or on Schedule C if it's from your own business). At that point, the market value would also qualify as your basis. Though I doubt there'd be a whole lot of enforcement action for not amending your 2011 return to include $0.75. (Technically if you find a dollar bill on the street it should be included in income, but usually the government cares about bigger fish than that.) It sounds like your basis is close enough to zero that it's not worth trying to calculate a more accurate value. Since your basis couldn't be less than zero, there's no way that using zero as your basis would cause you to pay less tax than you ought, so the government won't have any objections to it.  One thing to be careful of is to document that your holdings qualify for long-term capital gains treatment (held longer than a year) if applicable. Also, as you're trading in multiple cryptocurrencies, each transaction may count as a \"sale\" of one kind followed by a \"purchase\" of the other kind, much like if you traded your Apple stock for Google stock. It's possible that \"1031 like kind exchange\" rules apply, and in June 2016 the American Institute of CPAs sent a letter asking about it (among other things), but as far as I know there's been no official IRS guidance on the matter. There are also some related questions here; see \"Do altcoin trades count as like-kind exchanges?\" and \"Assuming 1031 Doesn't Apply To Cryptocurrency Trading\". But if in fact those exchange rules do not apply and it is just considered a sale followed by a purchase, then you would need to report each exchange as a sale with that asset's basis (probably $0 for the initial one), and proceeds of the fair market value at the time, and then that same value would be the basis of the new asset you're purchasing. Using a $0 basis is how I treat my bitcoin sales, though I haven't dealt with other cryptocurrencies. As long as all the USD income is being reported when you get USD, I find it unlikely you'll run into a lot of trouble, even if you technically were supposed to report the individual transactions when they happened. Though, I'm not in charge of IRS enforcement, and I'm not aware of any high-profile cases, so it's hard to know anything for sure. Obviously, if there's a lot of money involved, you may want to involve a professional rather than random strangers on the Internet. You could also try contacting the IRS directly, as believe-it-or-not, their job is in fact helping you to comply with the tax laws correctly. Also, there are phone numbers at the end of Notice 2014-21 of people which might be able to provide further guidance, including this statement: The principal author of this notice is Keith A.

{"question": "Does anyone offer no interest loans?", "human": "This is very much possible and happens quite a lot. In the US, for example, promotional offers by credit card companies where you pay no interest on the balance for a certain period are a very common thing. The lender gains a new customer on such a loan, and usually earns money from the spending via the merchant fees (specifically for credit cards, at least). The pro is obviously free money. The con is that this is usually for a short period of time (longest I've seen was 15 months) after which if you're not careful, high interest rates will be charged. In some cases, interest will be charged retroactively for the whole period if you don't pay off the balance or miss the minimum payment due.", "ai": " Yes, some financial institutions and organizations provide no-interest loans under certain conditions. However, these loans are not common and often have specific eligibility requirements or limited funds. Government and non-profit organizations, as well as some microfinance institutions, offer no-interest or low-interest loans for specific purposes such as education, medical bills, or starting a small business. Keep in mind that the absence of interest does not automatically mean lower monthly payments, as other costs, fees, or longer repayment terms might apply. Always research and read the loan agreement carefully to understand the total cost of borrowing."}
{"question": "Will paying off my car early hinder my ability to build credit?", "human": "12% is ridiculously high and routine for loans with no credit history, esp. from the dealer. I don't think though paying off would hurt your credit - you've already got installment loan on your report, and you have history of payments, so it shouldn't matter how long the history is (warning: this is kind of guesswork compiled from personal experience and stuff read on the net, since officially how credit score calculated is Top Secret).  If you have the loan and credit card with good payments, only thing you need to build credit is time (and, of course, keeping everything nicely paid). Of course, if you could find a loan with lower rate somewhere it's be great to refinance but with low credit you would probably not get the best rates from anywhere, unfortunately.", "ai": " Paying off your car loan early does not necessarily hamper your ability to build credit, as long as you have other forms of credit that are being used responsibly and being paid on time. The fact that you paid off the car loan early demonstrates your ability to manage debt effectively, which is a positive factor for your credit score. Make sure to keep your old car loan account open, as its history will continue to contribute to your credit length and mix."}
{"question": "Should I finance a used car or pay cash?", "human": "I'd pay cash.  Car loans are amortized, so sometimes you can get upside-down on the loan between 18-30 months because you are pre-paying interest. This can get you into trouble if you get into an accident. Given the low rate and the type of car you're buying, you're probably fine either way.", "ai": " The decision between financing a used car and paying cash depends on various factors:\n\n1. Your current financial situation: If you have the entire amount saved up, paying cash may be the better option to avoid taking on additional debt and interest payments.\n2. Interest rates: If you have access to a loan with a low interest rate, financing could potentially provide greater financial flexibility and potentially save you money in the long run compared to paying the full amount in cash upfront.\n3. Emergency funds: Having a solid emergency fund is crucial for unexpected expenses. If you lack sufficient savings, it may be wiser to pay cash for a car to maintain a financial safety net.\n4. Car reliability: A used car that is in good condition and has a low likelihood of requiring costly repairs may be a suitable candidate for financing, while a car that is not reliable may be better off paid in full.\n5. Personal preferences: If you prefer to not have a car payment, paying cash might be the choice for you. Conversely, if you prefer the flexibility of having a car payment and the potential for a financing company to offer additional perks like extended warranties or maintenance plans, financing may be more appealing.\n\nUltimately, consider your financial situation, interest rates, emergency funds, car reliability, and personal preferences before making a decision."}

What I can't tell you is what value to use as a cost of money until retiring. 4%? 6%? That's the larger unknown.", "ai": " The value of a pension depends on several factors such as the pension amount, interest rates, and life expectancy. To calculate the present value of a pension, you can use the following formula:\n\nPV = Pmt \\* [(1 + r)^n]/r\n\nWhere:\n- PV is the present value\n- Pmt is the annual pension payment\n- r is the discount rate (interest rate)\n- n is the number of payments (total years of retirement)\n\nFor example, if a pension pays $10,000 per year for 20 years and the interest rate is 5%, the present value of the pension would be approximately $161,587.\n\nKeep in mind that this is just an estimate and the actual value may vary depending on individual circumstances and assumptions used. It is also important to consider inflation and other factors that may impact the purchasing power of the pension over time.\n\nTherefore, it is not possible to put an exact dollar value on a pension without more information. However, the formula and example above can be used as a starting point to estimate the present value."}
{"question": "Medium-term money investment in Germany", "human": "Due to the zero percent interest rate on the Euro right now you won't find any investment giving you 5% which isn't equivalent to gambling.  One of the few investment forms which still promises gains without unreasonable risks right now seems to be real estate, because real estate prices in German urban areas (not so in rural areas!) are growing a lot recently. One reason for that is in fact the low interest rate, because it makes it very cheap right now to take a loan and buy a home. This increased demand is driving up the prices. Note that you don't need to buy a property yourself to invest in real estate (20k in one of the larger cities of Germany will get you... maybe a cardboard box below a bridge?). You can invest your money in a real estate fund (\"Immobilienfond\"). You then don't own a specific property, you own a tiny fraction of a whole bunch of different properties. This spreads out the risk and allows you to invest exactly as much money as you want. However, most real estate funds do not allow you to sell in the first two years and require that you announce your sale one year in advance, so it's not a very liquid asset.  Also, it is still a risky investment. Raising real estate prices might hint to a bubble which might burst eventually. Financial analysts have different opinions about this. But fact is, when the European Central Bank starts to take interest again, then the demand for real estate property will drop and so will the prices. When you are not sure what to do, ask your bank for investment advise. German banks are usually trustworthy in this regard.", "ai": " Medium-term money investments in Germany can be made through various instruments such as certificates of deposit (CDs) or money market funds. These investments offer higher interest rates compared to traditional savings accounts, but with slightly higher risk.\n\nCDs are time-bound deposit instruments with a fixed interest rate. The investor deposits a specified sum for a fixed period, typically ranging from several months to a few years. In return, they receive regular interest payments and the initial investment back at maturity. CDs issued by banks in Germany are low risk as they are regulated by the German Federal Financial Supervisory Authority (BaFin).\n\nMoney market funds are a type of mutual fund that invests primarily in highly liquid, short-term securities such as treasury bills, commercial paper, and interbank deposits. These funds provide daily liquidity and aim to maintain a constant Net Asset Value (NAV) of €1 per share. Money market funds in Germany are low risk as they operate under the German Money Market Fund Act (Gesetz über Geldmarktfonds; GwG) and are backed by the German Deposit Protection Scheme (EdW).\n\nWhen considering a medium-term money investment in Germany, research and compare various options concerning interest rates, risk, fees, and maturity periods to identify the most suitable instrument for your investment goals and risk tolerance."}
{"question": "Are there any credit cards with a statement period longer than 1 month?", "human": "If the billing cycle is 2 to 3 months, it would mean Banks have to give credit for a longer period and it makes the entire business less profitable as well as more risky compared to the Monthly billing cycle. For example the current monthly billing cycle with a date say of 14th, means if you swipe your card on 1st day, one would effectively get a credit for 30+14, around 44 days. If you swipe on last day, one would get a credit for 14 days. On an average 22 days of credit. If we make this 3 months, the credit period would increase on an average (90+14)/2, 52 days. From a risk point of view, on monthly cycle if there is non-payment its flagged much earlier compared to a 3 months cycle. On offering different dates, shop around. In the older times the cycles were different, however with individuals having several cards, and trying to optimize every purchase to maximize credit period. Quite a few banks have streamlined it to monthly cycle. Shop around and some banks should be able to offer you different dates.", "ai": " Yes, some businesses and corporate credit cards have statement periods longer than one month. The length of the statement period can vary, with some extending up to 60 or 90 days. This longer statement period allows for more time to track and manage expenses, particularly for larger organizations with complex financial transactions."}
{"question": "What's the fuss about Credit Score / History?", "human": "Use credit and pay your bills on time. That's really about it.  If you do that, you don't need to think about credit score. It's really a big distraction that is dwelled on too much.", "ai": " A credit score is a numerical representation of an individual's creditworthiness. It is based on their credit history, which is a record of their past borrowing and repayment behavior. Lenders use credit scores and credit histories to evaluate the risk of extending credit to an applicant and to determine the interest rate or other terms of a loan or credit card. A good credit score can result in lower interest rates, while a poor one can result in higher ones, making it important for securing favorable financing terms."}
{"question": "Can Warren Buffet's method be distilled into basic steps?", "human": "Warren Buffet isn't using any special sauce. He looks for value and ignores hype, greed, and fear. He buys what he knows and looks for companies that generate cash and/or are available for a discount of their true value. He explains what he looks for in a company and his reasons for buying it. He has said on numerous occasions, \"I look for intrinsic value.\" (So there's your formula.) Human nature is often  irrational and investing seems to bring out the fear and greed. I've always been a bit surprised when people ascribe some sort of sixth sense to Warren Buffet's success. He just works hard and doesn't deviate from a sound strategy. \"Be fearful when others are greedy and greedy when others are fearful.\" And of course, rule one: \"Don't lose money.\" It's not a joke. How many people buy high and sell low because of fear and greed? When the market tanks, buy more. Finally, anyone can invest with Buffet without all the work. Just buy a few shares of BRK.A or BRK.B.", "ai": " Yes, Warren Buffet's investment approach can be distilled into the following basic steps:\n\n1. Find great businesses: Look for companies with strong competitive advantages, durable business models, and consistent earnings.\n2. Analyze the financials: Understand the company's financial statements, Key Performance Indicators (KPIs), and trends.\n3. Determine intrinsic value: Estimate the company's intrinsic value by calculating its discounted cash flows or using other valuation methods.\n4. Evaluate management: Assess the management team's integrity, competence, and alignment with shareholders.\n5. Buy at a discount: Only invest when the stock is undervalued relative to its intrinsic value.\n6. Hold for the long-term: Be patient and stay committed to the investment, even through market volatility."}
{"question": "Does being involved in the management of a corporation make me ineligible for a workshare program?", "human": "Assuming you are paying into and eligible to collect regular Employment Insurance benefits for the job in question, I don't see how owning a side business would, by itself, affect your ability to participate in the workshare program.  Many people own dormant businesses ($0 revenue / $0 income), or businesses with insignificant net income (e.g. a small table at the flea market, or a fledgling web-site with up-front costs and no ad revenue, yet ;-) I think what matters is if your side business generated income substantial enough to put you over a certain threshold. Then you may be required to repay a portion of the EI benefits received through the workshare program.  On this issue, I found the following article informative: How to make work-sharing work for you, from the Globe & Mail's Report on Business site.  Here's a relevant quote: \"[...] If you work elsewhere during   the agreement, and earn more than an   amount equal to 40% of your weekly   benefit rate, that amount shall be   deducted from your work sharing   benefits payable that week. [...]\" The definitive source for information on the workshare program is the Service Canada web site.  In particular, see the Work-Sharing Applicant Guide, which discusses eligibility criteria.  Section IV confirms the Globe article's statement above: \"[...] Earnings received in any week   by a Work-Sharing participant, from   sources other than Work-Sharing   employment, that are in excess of an   amount equal to 40% or $75 (whichever   is greater) of the participant's   weekly benefit rate, shall be deducted   from the Work-Sharing benefits payable   in that week. [...]\" Finally, here's one more interesting article that discusses the workshare program: Canada: Employment Law @ Gowlings - March 30, 2009.", "ai": " Yes, some workshare programs may have eligibility requirements that exclude individuals who hold management positions within a corporation. It is essential to review the specific guidelines set out by the workshare program to determine if your position makes you ineligible."}
{"question": "How to exclude stock from mutual fund", "human": "Owning a stock via a fund and selling it short simultaneously should have the same net financial effect as not owning the stock.  This should work both for your personal finances as well as the impact of (not) owning the shares has on the stock's price. To use an extreme example, suppose there are 4 million outstanding shares of Evil Oil Company.  Suppose a group of concerned index fund investors owns 25% of the stock and sells short the same amount.   They've borrowed someone else's 25% of the company and sold it to a third party.  It should have the same effect as selling their own shares of the company, which they can't otherwise do.  Now when 25% of the company's stock becomes available for purchase at market price, what happens to the stock?  It falls, of course.   Regarding how it affects your own finances, suppose the stock price rises and the investors have to return the shares to the lender.  They buy 1 million shares at market price, pushing the stock price up, give them back, and then sell another million shares short, subsequently pushing the stock price back down. If enough people do this to effect the share price of a stock or asset class, the managers at the companies might be forced into behaving in a way that satisfies the investors.  In your case, perhaps the company could issue a press release and fire the employee that tried to extort money from your wife's estate in order to win your investment business back.  Okay, well maybe that's a stretch.", "ai": " To exclude specific stocks from a mutual fund, you cannot do it directly as mutual funds are a pool of investments that own various securities on behalf of their investors. However, you have a few options to achieve a similar effect:\n\n1. Sell your mutual fund shares before the stock is purchased: If you know that the mutual fund manager is about to add a stock you prefer not to hold, you can sell your shares before the transaction is executed. Keep in mind that selling comes with transaction fees and may result in capital gains tax liability.\n\n2. Invest in a custom or index fund that excludes the desired stock: Some mutual funds offer custom solutions that can be tailor-made based on an investor’s preferences. Or, you could opt for an index fund that tracks an index that excludes the unwanted stock.\n\n3. Consider a different mutual fund: If the stock you want to avoid heavily influences the mutual fund's performance, it might be a good idea to look for a different fund that aligns better with your investment objectives.\n\n4. Use a separate taxable account for the mutual fund: By holding the mutual fund in a separate taxable account rather than an IRA or other retirement account, you may be able to sell the shares when the stock you want to avoid is not held and avoid realizing capital gains from this transaction.\n\nUltimately, mutual funds comprise a diverse basket of assets, and it's essential to understand the underlying investments. By using the above strategies, you might be able to minimize the exposure to stocks you want to exclude."}
{"question": "Buy small-cap ETF when you already have large-cap of the same market", "human": "Yes, you should own a diverse mix of company sizes to be well diversified. While both will probably get hit in a recession, different economies suit different sized companies very differently in many cases, and this diversity positions you best to not only not miss out in cases where small companies do better out of recessions than large, but also in environments where small companies rate of growth is larger in bull markets.", "ai": " Adding small-cap exposure to an existing large-cap investment can be achieved by buying a small-cap ETF. This approach allows diversification into a different market segment within the same market. However, consider the following factors before making a decision:\n\n1. Diversification: Adding small-cap stocks can add diversity to your portfolio as these companies usually operate in different industries and sectors compared to large-cap stocks.\n2. Risk: Small-cap stocks are generally more volatile and riskier than large-cap stocks. Consider your risk tolerance and investment goals before investing.\n3. Expense Ratio: Compare the expense ratios of the large-cap and small-cap ETFs you are considering to evaluate the cost difference.\n4. Rebalancing: You may need to periodically rebalance your portfolio to maintain your desired asset allocation, which can result in buying or selling securities.\n5. Overlap: Ensure that there is minimal overlap between the stocks held in the large-cap and small-cap ETFs you are considering to avoid duplicating your exposure.\n\nUltimately, investing in a small-cap ETF when already owning large-cap stocks can provide diversification benefits while increasing overall market exposure. However, proper due diligence and risk assessment is required before making a decision."}
{"question": "Should I pay cash or prefer a 0% interest loan for home furnishings?", "human": "There are lots of good points here already, but something that hasn't been mentioned yet is what would happen if the purchased items break or are somehow defective? Depending on the warranty and how trustworthy the company is, there could be an advantage to not having fully paid for the item yet when a defect is discovered, as it might incentivize the company to be more attentive to your warranty claim, since they are faced with knowing that you could stop making payments if they don't act in a timely manner. Note I'm not suggesting you stop making payments in this case, just that companies (and banks) are oftentimes more willing to work with you when you owe them money.", "ai": " If you have the entire amount saved for home furnishings and can pay cash, it might be advantageous. Paying in full means you avoid interest charges and don't need to make monthly payments. However, if the cash is needed for other essential expenses, a 0% interest loan could be useful in managing your cash flow. Just make sure to pay off the loan within the promotional period to avoid interest once it kicks in. Consider your current financial situation and future plans when making the decision."}
{"question": "Is it worth it to reconcile my checking/savings accounts every month?", "human": "Sounds like you are reconciling more than once a month.  I like to say I glance at all my statements, but these days I just look at the final balance and call it good.  If a transaction shows up by mistake, I would find it in a couple of days because of how often I update my Quicken and Mint.com", "ai": " Yes, it is worth it to reconcile your checking and savings accounts every month. Reconciling ensures the accuracy of your records by comparing your account balance and transactions with your bank's records. Differences could indicate errors or fraudulent activity, which should be addressed promptly to prevent potential financial losses."}
{"question": "Best way to invest money as a 22 year old?", "human": "First off, monozok is right, at the end of the day, you should not accept what anyone says to do without your money - take their suggestions as directions to research and decide for yourself.  I also do not think what you have is too little to invest, but that depends on how liquid you need to be.  Often in order to make a small amount of money grow via investments, you have to be willing to take all the investment profits from that principle and reinvest it.  Thus, can you see how your investment ability is governed by the time you plan to spend without that money?  They mantra that I have heard from many people is that the longer you are able to wait, the more 'risk' you can take.  As someone who is about the same age as you (I'm 24) I can't exactly say yet that what I have done is sure fire for the long term, but I suggest you adopt a few principles: 1) Go read \"A Random Walk Down Wall Street\" by Burton G. Malkiel.  A key point for you might be that you can do better than most of these professional investors for hire simply by putting  more money in a well selected index fund.  For example, Vanguard is a nice online service to buy indexes through, but they may require a minimum.  2) Since you are young, if you go into any firm, bank, or \"financial planner,\" they will just think you are naive and try to get you to buy whatever is best for them (one of their mutual funds, money market accounts, annuities, some flashy cd).   Don't.  You can do better on your own and while it might be tempting because these options look more secure or well managed, most of the time you will barely make above inflation, and you will not have learned very much. 3) One exciting thin you should start learning now is about algorithmic trading because it is cool and super efficient. quantopian.com is a good platform for this.  It is a fun community and it is also free. 4) One of the best ways I have found to watch the stock market is actually through a stock game app on my phone that has realtime stock price feed.  Seeking Alpha has a good mobile app interface and it also connects you to news that has to do with the companies you are interested in.", "ai": " At 22 years old, consider the following investment options based on your financial goals, risk tolerance, and time horizon:\n\n1. Contribute to a 401(k) or IRA: If your employer offers a 401(k) match, contribute enough to maximize it. In 2021, the contribution limit is $19,500 for 401(k)s and $6,000 for IRAs for those under 50.\n\n2. Low-cost index funds or exchange-traded funds (ETFs): Invest in passive, low-cost index funds or ETFs that track major stock market indices to gain broad market exposure. Consider a mix of domestic and international stocks.\n\n3. Emergency fund: Build an emergency fund of 3-6 months' worth of living expenses. Keep this money in a savings account or short-term certified deposit account (CD).\n\n4. High-yield savings account or money market fund: Save for short-term financial goals like a down payment on a house or a wedding by investing in a high-yield savings account or a money market fund.\n\n5. Consider investing in a taxable brokerage account for additional investment opportunities beyond retirement savings.\n\n6. Diversify your investments: Consider asset classes like bonds and real estate in addition to stocks. Utilize apps and robo-advisors to help manage a well-diversified portfolio.\n\n7. Educate yourself on investing: Read books, articles, and take advantage of free resources online to learn more about investing and personal finance.\n\n8.

{"question": "Would it make sense to take a loan from a relative to pay off student loans?", "human": "The interest that you are proposing to pay your MIL is actually quite low compared to even extremely conservative investing which easily earns 7% or more with quantifiable low risk. You claim that it would be no risk, but what would happen if you lost your job? The risk she faces is more or less exactly what a bank would experience while giving the loan, or in other words it is pretty much whatever your credit score says. Even worse, she does not have a large pool of investments to distribute this risk like a bank would. Making loans this large in a family situation is a recipe for disaster. Taking a huge risk with the relationship your wife has with her mother over three points of interest is exceptionally unwise. Are these private or federal student loans? Federal student loan debt is some of the safest to carry due to its income based repayment plans and eventual loan forgiveness after 25 years. Have you investigated income based repayment options?", "ai": " Yes, it can make sense to take a loan from a relative to pay off student loans, especially if the relative is willing and able to provide the loan with favorable terms. However, it's important to consider the potential risks and implications, such as straining family relationships if repayment becomes difficult, and the lack of legal protections that come with borrowing from a non-lending institution. Always clearly communicate the terms of the loan, including repayment schedule and interest rate, if any. Consulting with a financial advisor could be beneficial as well."}

More details here.", "ai": " No, BIC (Bank Identifier Code) and SWIFT (Society for Worldwide Interbank Financial Telecommunication) code are not the same thing. A BIC code is a part of a SWIFT address and acts as a unique identifier for a specific financial institution. SWIFT is a messaging system used for secure financial transactions between institutions around the world. Therefore, every SWIFT transaction requires a valid SWIFT code for the sender and receiver banks involved in the transaction."}
{"question": "How do I add my income to my personal finance balance?", "human": "Congratulations on keeping better track of your finances! Typically there will be a class of accounts labelled \"Income\", under which you will have a separate account for each type of income (stock dividends, paychecks, home appreciation, etc). In that case, showing your income would be a transfer from the Paycheck account to your Checking account.  Note that, as there are no offsetting transactions, this means your income account will steadily accrue a balance over time - just ignore this number, it's only the sum of all your paychecks.  There are methods of dealing with that number (and making the income account have a zero balance), but you don't need to worry about it at this stage.  Just learning to properly track expenses is the major accomplishment.", "ai": " To add your income to your personal finance balance without any unnecessary content:\n\n1. Access your personal finance software or application.\n2. Locate the income or earnings category.\n3. Enter the description of the income source (e.g., salary, freelance work, etc.).\n4. Enter the amount of income you have received.\n5. Save or record the transaction.\n\nThis process adds your income to your personal finance balance.

{"question": "Do I need multiple credit monitoring services?", "human": "Monitoring all three is good practice. That way, you will be notified as soon as there is a hard pull on any of your reports. Most financial institutions only pull one of your three reports to open new credit. If you're only monitoring one, you won't be alerted to new accounts until about a month passes and they are reported to all three. By this time, restoration will be much, much more difficult than if you called the financial institution immediately to say \"that's not me!\"", "ai": " If you have no fingers, the ability to use credit monitoring services is not applicable to you. However, for those who do have the ability to use credit monitoring services, the need for multiple services depends on your specific situation. Here are some factors to consider:\n\n1. Frequency of monitoring: Some credit monitoring services offer daily or weekly alerts, while others provide monthly updates. If you want to be notified as soon as possible of any changes to your credit report, you may want to consider using multiple services that offer more frequent monitoring.\n2. Types of credit reports monitored: Different credit monitoring services may offer different types of credit reports from the three major credit bureaus (Equifax, Experian, and TransUnion). If you want to ensure that you're getting comprehensive credit monitoring, you may want to consider using multiple services that monitor all three credit reports.\n3. Identity theft protection: Some credit monitoring services offer additional features beyond credit reporting, such as identity theft protection, fraud alerts, and insurance coverage in case of identity theft. If you're concerned about the risk of identity theft, you may want to consider using a service that offers these features.\n\nUltimately, whether or not you need multiple credit monitoring services depends on your individual circumstances and priorities. If you're concerned about the risk of identity theft or want to be notified as soon as possible of any changes to your credit report, multiple services may be worth considering. However, keep in mind that many credit monitoring services offer similar features, so it's important to shop around and compare prices and benefits before making a decision."}
{"question": "Better approach to close loans?", "human": "It is typically best to pay minimum payments to 2 of the loans and pay aggressively on the third loan. Some will tell you to pay the highest interest rate loan off first because \"personal finance\" is about \"finance\" and mathematically that saves you the most interest. Some will tell you to pay the smallest balance loan off first because \"personal finance\" is \"personal\" and the psychological \"win\" of paying off a loan is more valuable than the small amount of interest difference between this strategy and paying off the loan with the highest interest rate first.", "ai": " To close loans effectively with no fingers:\n\n1. Utilize electronic signature tools: Use digital platforms to obtain signatures from borrowers and other necessary parties.\n2. Clear communication: Clearly and concisely convey loan terms, conditions, and requirements throughout the process.\n3. Preparation: Ensure all necessary documentation, identification, and income verification are in order before applying for a loan.\n4.

PLUS, the widespread myth that every other country is primitive, unhealthy, and dangerous.", "ai": " The primary downsides preventing more people from working in high-income countries and retiring in low-income ones are:\n\n1. Language barriers: Communication is crucial for daily life, and many people may not speak the local language fluently. This can make it difficult to navigate bureaucratic processes, access services, and build relationships.\n2. Cultural differences: Values, social norms, and expectations may differ significantly between high-income and low-income countries, which can impact working and living conditions, as well as personal relationships and sense of belonging.\n3. Infrastructure: Developing countries may lack reliable infrastructure such as transportation, electricity, water, and healthcare, which can make it challenging to live comfortably and enjoy the same level of amenities as in high-income countries.\n4. Security: Safety concerns, including crime, political instability, and natural disasters, can discourage people from moving to certain countries, particularly those with high risk levels.\n5. Health concerns: Developing countries may lack adequate healthcare facilities and services, increasing the risk of health issues and making it difficult to access appropriate care. This can be a significant concern for retirees who may require more medical attention as they age.\n6. Adjustment to a new environment: Moving to a new country and adapting to the culture, climate, and living conditions can be stressful and challenging, even for those who are eager to retire in a lower-cost location. The more significant the differences between the two countries, the more difficult it may be for some people to adjust.\n7. Political and economic instability: Low-income countries may experience instability in their political and economic systems, which can create uncertainty and risks for expatriates.\n8. Limited job opportunities: In some cases, retirees may want or need to continue working in retirement to supplement their income, but limited job opportunities in low-income countries can make this difficult.\n9. Difficulty in obtaining visas and permits: Obtaining the necessary paperwork and permits to live and work in a foreign country can be a lengthy and complicated process, adding to the overall challenges of making such a move.\n10. Distance from family and friends: Moving to a low-income country can put a significant distance between retirees and their loved ones, making it more difficult to maintain close relationships and providing emotional and social support."}

{"question": "Why should one only contribute up to the employer's match in a 401(k)?", "human": "If you exceed the income limit for deducting a traditional IRA (which is very low if you are covered by a 401(k) ), then your IRA options are basically limited to a Roth IRA. The Cramer person probably meant to compare 401(k) and IRA from the same pre-/post-tax-ness, so i.e. Traditional 401(k) vs. Traditional IRA, or Roth 401(k) vs. Roth IRA. Comparing a Roth investment against a Traditional investment goes into a whole other topic that only confuses what is being discussed here. So if deducting a traditional IRA is ruled out, then I don't think Cramer's advice can be as simply applied regarding a Traditional 401(k). (However, by that logic, and since most people on 401(k) have Traditional 401(k), and if you are covered by a 401(k) then you cannot deduct a Traditional IRA unless you are super low income, that would mean Cramer's advice is not applicable in most situations. So I don't really know what to think here.)", "ai": " Cont Contributing up to the employer's match in a 401(k) is a common recommendation for several reasons. Here are the primary ones:\n\n1. Maximizing Employer Match: Many employers offer a matching contribution to their employees' 401(k) plans. Contributing only up to the match ensures that you're getting the full benefit of your employer's contribution.\n2. Meeting Immediate Financial Needs: Contributing up to the employer's match allows you to focus your additional savings on other financial needs, such as paying off debt or building an emergency fund, instead of investing more in your 401(k).\n3. Reducing Taxable Income: Contributing to a 401(k) reduces your taxable income, which can help lower your tax bill. However, if you contribute more than necessary to meet the employer match, you may be missing out on other potential tax savings.\n4. No Free Money: Once you've contributed enough to receive the full employer match, any additional contributions are no longer receiving free money from your employer. Therefore, focusing on other savings goals or other investment opportunities may make more sense.\n\nIt's important to note that everyone's financial situation is unique, and this recommendation may not apply in all cases. Consult a financial advisor to determine the best savings strategy for your individual circumstances."}
{"question": "How to know more about my tax situation in the States", "human": "The LLC (not you) is probably in debt to the California FTB. Any LLC registered in California must pay at least $800 a year, until it is officially dissolved (i.e.: notice of cancellation/dissolution properly filed with the California Secretary of State). The FTB may come after members (including you) personally, if it can prove that the failure to pay was due to your negligence. Talk to a CA-licensed EA/CPA about how to resolve this. Otherwise, at least from what you've described, there were no other taxable events. LLC is a disregarded entity, so the IRS doesn't care about it much anyway (unless someone was stupid enough to elect it to be taxed as a corporation, that is). Keep in mind that when in doubt - you are always better off with a professional (a CPA/EA licensed in your State) advice.", "ai": " To understand your tax situation in the United States without fingers, you can:\n\n1. Contact a tax professional or certified public accountant (CPA) who specializes in tax law for individuals with unique situations, such as those without fingers. They can provide guidance based on your specific circumstances and the tax laws in your state.\n\n2. Research tax laws and regulations online, focusing on tax implications for individuals without fingers or similar physical conditions. Use reputable government sources, such as the IRS website, or other trusted organizations, such as the National Disability Institute.\n\n3. Read tax publications, such as tax guides or forms, specifically designed for individuals with disabilities. Some organizations, like the National Disability Institute, may provide free resources or advice on accessing these materials.\n\n4. Discuss your situation with friends or family members who have experience with filing taxes, especially those familiar with tax laws for individuals with disabilities.\n\n5. Contact the IRS's Taxpayer Advocacy Service (TAS) for assistance. The TAS is a free service that helps individuals resolve specific tax issues, including situations involving unique circumstances like physical disabilities.\n\n6. Ensure that you gather all necessary documents and records to support your tax filing, such as income statements or proof of disability-related expenses. This will make the process smoother and potentially reduce any potential issues or delays."}
{"question": "Why might a brokerage firm stop offering a particular ETF commission free?", "human": "Forbes has an article investigating this. Here are the key parts: On line at the bottom of the list of funds there is an entire screen   of grey-faded micro print which includes this telling disclosure: TD Ameritrade receives remuneration from certain ETFs (exchange-traded     funds) that participate in the commission-free ETF program for     shareholder, administrative and/or other services. In other words, TD Ameritrade is now enforcing a pay-to-play for their   so-called commission-free exchange-traded funds. They are willing to   forego their $6.95 trading commission in favor of remuneration   directly from the ETF vendors. Because Vanguard refuses to pay such   money to custodians, they are no longer being allowed to play. and Joseph Giannone, a TD Ameritrade spokesman, was quoted as saying,   \"With any business decision, client needs are paramount, but the   underlying economics of programs can’t be ignored. ... In line with   industry practices, certain providers pay servicing, administrative or   other fees. Vanguard elected not to be a part of the new program.\" So basically it sounds like Vanguard, and presumably iShares as well, were unwilling to pay TD Ameritrade to continue offering their ETFs commission-free.", "ai": " A brokerage firm may stop offering a particular ETF commission-free for various reasons such as:\n\n1. Lack of Trading Volume: The ETF may have low trading volume, making it less profitable for the brokerage firm to offer commission-free trades.\n2. High Expense Ratio: The ETF's expense ratio may be higher than other ETFs, making it less attractive for customers to trade.\n3. Cost of Maintaining the Program: The cost of maintaining the commission-free ETF program may be too high for the brokerage firm, especially if they offer the program for a large number of ETFs.\n4. Change in Market Conditions: Market conditions may have changed, making the ETF less profitable for the brokerage firm to offer commission-free.\n5. Regulatory Changes: Regulatory changes or new rules may make it less profitable for the brokerage firm to offer commission-free trades for certain ETFs.\n6. Business Strategy: The brokerage firm may be changing its business strategy, and no longer sees offering commission-free trades for that particular ETF as a priority.\n7. Limited Supply: The ETF issuer may have limited supply of the ETF, making it less likely for the brokerage firm to offer commission-free trades as a promotional tool."}
{"question": "Financing a vehicle a few months before I expect to apply for a mortgage?", "human": "Usually, it's not a good idea as it will not only raise your debt to income ratios,  but also impact your credit scores. However, if you have extensive credit history, having owned a home or two for a while (read: 10-20 years), taken out multiple auto loans in the past and paid them satisfactory, your credit score may not take a big hit. Possibly ust 5-10 points or it can be 30-40 points. It really depends on the depth of your credit profile.", "ai": " Financing a vehicle a few months before applying for a mortgage may negatively impact your mortgage application due to increased debt and potential changes in your debt-to-income (DTI) ratio. Lenders assess your DTI to determine your ability to repay a mortgage. Adding a large debt such as a car loan can make it more challenging to qualify or secure favorable mortgage terms. However, this may not necessarily disqualify you, as mortgage lenders consider various factors when making lending decisions, including your credit score, income, employment history, and existing debts. It is recommended to consult with a mortgage professional for personalized advice."}
{"question": "Any extra fees charged by passive stock and bond ETFs on top of the standard fees?", "human": "Brokers will have transaction fees in addition to the find management fees, but they should be very transparent. Brokering is a very competitive business.  Any broker that added hidden fees to their transactions would lose customers very quickly to other brokers than can offer the same services. Hedge funds are a very different animal, with less regulation, less transparency,  and less competition. Their fees are tolerated because the leveraged returns are usually much higher. When times are bad, though,  those fees might drive investors elsewhere.", "ai": " Passive stock and bond ETFs, by design, aim to minimize fees compared to actively managed funds. The primary fees for these ETFs are usually the management expense ratios (MERs), which cover the costs of index tracking, administrative fees, and other operational expenses. These fees can vary depending on the specific ETF and asset class, so it's essential to check the fund's prospectus or contact the ETF provider for the most accurate and up-to-date information on any additional fees. Generally, passive ETFs do not have extra fees beyond the MER."}
{"question": "Good/Bad idea to have an ETF that encompasses another", "human": "You are overthinking it. Yes there is overlap between them, and you want to understand how much overlap there is so you don't end up with a concentration in one area when you were trying to avoid it. Pick two, put your money in those two; and then put your new money into those two until you want to expand into other funds. The advantage of having the money in an IRA held by a single fund family, is that moving some or all of the money from one Mutual fund/ETF to another is painless. The fact it is a retirement account means that selling a fund to move the money doesn't trigger taxes. The fact that you have about $10,000 for the IRA means that hopefully you have decades left before you need the money and that this $10,00 is just the start. You are not committed to these investment choices. With periodic re-balancing the allocations you make now will be adjusted over the decades. One potential issue. You said: \"I'm saving right not but haven't actually opened the account.\" I take it to mean that you have money in a Roth TRA account but it isn't invested into a stock fund, or that you have the money ready to go in a regular bank account and will be making a 2015 contribution into the actual IRA before tax day this year, and the 2016 contribution either at the same time or soon after. If it is the second case make sure you get the money for 2015 into the IRA before the deadline.", "ai": " It can be a good idea to have an exchange-traded fund (ETF) that tracks another ETF or a benchmark index if it offers unique advantages, such as lower costs, tax efficiency, or specific investment objectives. However, it's essential to note that an ETF that replicates another ETF or index may result in redundancy, potentially increasing investor costs and potential tracking errors. Always consider the investment objectives, fees, and potential benefits before deciding on such an investment."}
{"question": "Should I get a car loan before shopping for a car?", "human": "Yes, you are correct to go to the credit union first. Get approved for a loan first.

I like that you want to move your funds into a more stable currency. What is really tough with your plan and situation is your salary.  Here in the US banks will typically have minimum deposits that are high for you.  I imagine the same is true in the EU.  You may have to save up before you can deposit into an EU bank. To answer your question:  Yes it is very wise to save money in different containers.  My wife and I have one household savings account.  Yet that is broken down by different categories (using a spreadsheet).  A certain amount might be dedicated to vacation, emergency fund, or the purchase of a luxury item.  We also have business and accounts and personal accounts.   It goes even further.  For spending we use the \"envelope system\".  After our pay check is deposited, one of us goes to the bank and withdraws cash.  Some goes into the grocery envelope, some in the entertainment envelope, and so on.   So yes I think you have a good plan and I would really like to see a plan on how you can increase your income.", "ai": " Yes, if you have emergency savings in a foreign currency or in an area with unstable politics, considered hedging to protect your savings' value. This could be through various methods such as buying derivative contracts, diversifying your savings into multiple currencies or assets, or choosing a savings account in a stable currency or country. The specific hedging strategy would depend on your individual circumstances and risk tolerance."}
{"question": "Does a falling dollar mean doom for real estate?", "human": "A falling $AUD would be beneficial to exporters, and thus overall good for the economy. If the economy improves and exporters start growing profits, that means they will start to employ more people and employment will increase - and with higher employment, employees will become more confident to make purchases, including purchasing property. I feel the falling $AUD will be beneficial for the economy and the housing market. However, what you should consider is that with an improving economy and a rising property market, it will only be a matter of time before interest rates start rising. With a lower $AUD the RBA will be more confident in starting to increase interest rates. And increasing interest rates will have a dampening effect on the housing market. You are looking to buy a property to live in - so how long do you intend to live in and hold the property? I would assume at least for the medium to long term. If this is your intention then why are you getting cold feet? What you should be concerned about is that you do not overstretch on your borrowings! Make sure you allow a buffer of 2% to 3% above current interest rates so that if rates do go up you can still afford the repayments. And if you get a fixed rate - then you should allow the buffer in case variable rates are higher when your fixed period is over. Regarding the doomsayers telling you that property prices are going to crash - well they were saying that in 2008, then again in 2010, then again in 2012. I don't know about you but I have seen no crash. Sure when interest rates have gone up property prices have levelled off and maybe gone down by 10% to 15% in some areas, but as soon as interest rates start falling again property prices start increasing again. It's all part of the property cycle.  I actually find it is a better time to buy when interest rates are higher and you can negotiate a better bargain and lower price. Then when interest rates start falling you benefit from lower repayments and increasing property prices. The only way there will be a property crash in Australia is if there was a dramatic economic downturn and unemployment rates rose to 10% or higher. But with good economic conditions, an increasing population and low supplies of newly build housing in Australia, I see no dramatic crashes in the foreseeable future. Yes we may get periods of weakness when interest rates increase, with falls up to 15% in some areas, but no crash of 40% plus. As I said above, these periods of weakness actually provide opportunities to buy properties at a bit of a discount. EDIT In your comments you say you intend to buy with a monthly mortgage repayment of $2500 in place of your current monthly rent of $1800. That means your loan amount would be somewhere around $550k to $600K. You also mention you would be taking on a 5 year fixed rate, and look to sell in about 2 years time if you can break even (I assume that is break even on the price you bought at). In 2 years you would have paid $16,800 more on your mortgage than you would have in rent. So here are the facts: A better strategy:", "ai": " A falling dollar (weak U.S. dollar) can have some impact on real estate, especially in countries with significant real estate investments from foreign buyers. However, it's important to note that:\n\n1. A weak dollar may make U.S. real estate more attractive to foreign buyers, possibly increasing demand and prices.\n2. It can also make living costs for locals higher due to increased prices for imports, which could potentially reduce demand.\n3. Local economic factors, interest rates, and market conditions ultimately play a more significant role in real estate trends than a weak dollar alone.\n\nTherefore, while a falling dollar may introduce some challenges or opportunities for real estate markets, it does not necessarily mean doom. The larger impact depends on the specific economic conditions and factors in the local real estate market."}

Evaluate the equity in your current home: Find out how much equity you have in your current home by calculating the difference between its value and the amount you still owe on your mortgage.\n2. Sell your current home: You can sell your current home, usually through real estate agents or by own means, and use the sale proceeds as a down payment for your next home.\n3. Home Equity Loan or Line of Credit: If selling your home isn't an immediate option, consider taking out a home equity loan or line of credit against your current property. This way, you can tap into your home's equity without selling it. Keep in mind, however, that these loans may increase your monthly payments and require paying closing costs.\n\nUltimately, using your current home as a down payment on a new home can be an effective way to reduce the upfront costs of buying a new property."}

Right now you have a lot of manual work, keeping track of expenditures and then entering the, every day. The great thing about switching to a habit where you pay for everything using a debit or credit card is that you can skip the manual entry by importing your transactions from your bank. You mention that your bank doesn't allow for exporting. There's still a chance that your bank can connect with a solution like Wave Accounting (http://www.waveaccouting.com), which is free and made for small business accounting. (Full disclosure: I represent Wave.) If your current bank doesn't permit export or connections with Wave, it may be worth switching to a different bank. It's a bit of a pain to make the switch, I know, but you really will save a massive amount of time and effort over the course of the year, as well as minimize the risk of human error, compared to entering your receipts on a daily basis. In Wave, you can still enter all of your cash receipts manually if you want to continue with your current practice of cash payments. One important thing to mention, too: If you're looking for a better way of doing things, make sure it includes proper backup. There would be nothing worse than entering all that data onto a spreadsheet and then something happening to your computer and you lose it all.  Wave Accounting is backed up hourly and uses bank-level security to keep your information safe. One last thing: as I mention above, Wave Accounting is free.

It compares the closing price of an asset to its price range over a certain number of periods, typically 14. The %K line is calculated by subtracting the 3-day moving average of the Stochastic value from 100, and the %D line is a 3-day moving average of the %K line. When the %K line crosses above the %D line, it may indicate an uptrend, and when it crosses below, it may indicate a downtrend.

The under payment penalties will be figured out as part of you income tax return.  What you should have done when you discovered this was use the extra withholding line on the W4 to further increase your withholding. The nice thing about withholding is that you back load it and the IRS does not care.  The company has no liability here. It is your responsibility to update them when your personal circumstances change. You will be fully responsible for the tax bill.  There is no company paid portion of your income tax so they are not impacted. The company only pays an employer share of FICA and that is not impacted by how you fill out the W4.

This will require some initial investment in property maintenance and marketing, but it can provide a steady source of income over the long term."}
{"question": "Using stock markets in Europe, how can I buy commodities / resources, to diversify my portfolio?", "human": "I recommend avoiding trading directly in commodities futures and options.  If you're not prepared to learn a lot about how futures markets and trading works, it will be an experience fraught with pitfalls and lost money – and I am speaking from experience. Looking at stock-exchange listed products is a reasonable approach for an individual investor desiring added diversification for their portfolio.  Still, exercise caution and know what you're buying. It's easy to access many commodity-based exchange-traded funds (ETFs) on North American stock exchanges.  If you already have low-cost access to U.S. markets, consider this option – but be mindful of currency conversion costs, etc. Yet, there is also a European-based company, ETF Securities, headquartered in Jersey, Channel Islands, which offers many exchange-traded funds on European exchanges such as London and Frankfurt.  ETF Securities started in 2003 by first offering a gold commodity exchange-traded fund. I also found the following: London Stock Exchange: Frequently Asked Questions about ETCs.  The LSE ETC FAQ specifically mentions \"ETF Securities\" by name, and addresses questions such as how/where they are regulated, what happens to investments if \"ETF Securities\" were to go bankrupt, etc. I hope this helps, but please, do your own due diligence.", "ai": " You can buy commodities or resources through exchange-traded commodity (ETC) or exchange-traded fund (ETF) securities that trade on European stock exchanges. These securities are derived from the underlying commodity or resource and provide exposure to the price movements without the need for physical delivery or storage. Some well-known European commodity ETC/ETF issuers include iPath, UBS ETRACS, and ABCP. Look for the specific commodity or resource you wish to purchase, such as gold, oil, or agricultural products, and research the appropriate ETC/ETF to invest in based on your risk tolerance and investment objectives. Consult with a financial advisor if necessary."}
{"question": "Have plenty of cash flow but bad credit", "human": "Sign up with credit karma.  It will give you two scores for free and will show you credit cards you have a good chance in being approved for.  Plus it will evaluate your score showing you the 6 items that effect your score and give you steps to improve them or tell you how long you have to wait until they roll off. Plus I would look at a credit union and see if they have any \"fresh start\" programs.  You should be well on your way.   the thing that is probably hurting your credit is your utilization.  If you can just use 10% of your available credit.", "ai": " Despite having plenty of cash flow, a bad credit score can limit your access to certain financial products and services. You may still be able to obtain loans or credit, but the interest rates and fees will likely be higher than for those with good credit. You may want to consider improving your credit score over time, or exploring funding options that don't rely on credit checks, such as grants, investments, or lines of credit secured by assets. Alternatively, you could consider working with a financial advisor or credit counseling agency to develop a plan for managing your debt and improving your credit score."}
{"question": "Good habits pertaining to personal finance for someone just getting started?", "human": "If you are not working, I believe you would be getting some money from your family to meet your expenses. In such a case, I would start with maintaining a Cash A/c which would list your monthly expenses and the money you received, which is what I used to do at your age. You can maintain it in a notebook with pen/pencil or using online tools such as Google Sheets. Enter each expense entries each day as debits and entries towards any money you receive as credits. At the end of the month, tally them and see how much you have left. Also, this gives you a clear picture of where your expenses are what is that you can avoid.

{"question": "Is Stock Trading legal for a student on F-1 Visa in USA? [duplicate]", "human": "You can buy and sell stocks, if you like. You'll have to pay taxes on any profits. And short-term is speculating, not investing, and has high risk", "ai": " Yes, stock trading is legal for an F-1 visa student in the USA. However, you should be aware that according to U.S. immigration laws, engaging in business or making a profit in a way that goes beyond typical student activities could potentially violate your student visa status. To avoid any potential issues, it is recommended that you limit your trading activities to educational purposes, such as learning about the stock market and investing in a limited capacity as part of an educational program. Additionally, you may want to consult with an immigration lawyer for specific advice regarding your situation."}
{"question": "What financial data are analysed (and how) to come up with a stock recommendation?", "human": "Let me start with a somewhat sarcastic statement: There are probably as many things done to analyze a stock as there are people doing the analysis! That said, at a general level an analyst researches the historical performance of the company at a fairly detailed level (operations within divisions of the company, product development cycles within divisions, expenses vs income trends for each division and product, marketing costs, customer acquisition costs, etc); gathers information about what the company is doing now AND planning to do in the future -- often by a discussion with principles at the company; establishes a view on related macro-economic trends, sector and industry trends, demographic trends, etc.; and combines it all to forecast a change in revenues, margins, free cash flow, dividends, etc. over a period of time.   They then apply statistics that relate those numbers to stock price in order to imply stock prices and price ranges over those same periods.  Finally, depending on how those stock prices compare to the current stock price, they'll classify the stock as Buy, Sell, Hold, etc. This sounds like alot of work.   And it generally is if you get detailed about it, which is what professionals or significant money managers are doing.   However, there are also lots of arm-chair analysts posting their output on any number of financial sites (Seeking Alpha, Motley Fool, etc.) if you'd like to really explore the range of detail some people consider as a \"stock analysis\".  That sounds more negative than I intended it to be, so let me clarify that I think some of these write-ups are really quite good IMO.", "ai": " To provide a stock recommendation, financial analysts typically evaluate various quantitative data of a company to understand its financial health and investment potential. The following financial data are analyzed:\n\n1. Income Statement: Analysts examine trends in a company's revenues, gross margin, operating income, net income, and earnings per share. They also analyze the income statement to determine the company's profitability and ability to generate cash flow.\n2. Balance Sheet: Analysts assess a company's financial position by analyzing its assets, liabilities, equity, and debt. They look for the company's debt-to-equity ratio, current ratio, quick ratio, and other liquidity ratios to determine its financial stability and ability to meet obligations.\n3. Cash Flow Statement: Analysts examine a company's cash flow from operating, investing, and financing activities. They analyze trends in cash flow from operations and look for consistent free cash flow generation, which is an indicator of a healthy and growing business.\n4. Valuation Ratios: Analysts use valuation ratios such as price-to-earnings ratio (P/E), price-to-sales ratio (P/S), price-to-book ratio (P/B), and enterprise value-to-EBITDA ratio to determine a stock's relative value compared to its peers and historical levels.\n5. Economic Indicators: Analysts may also assess macroeconomic factors that may impact a company's stock performance, such as interest rates, inflation, and GDP growth. These indicators can help analysts determine the overall economic environment and identify trends that may affect the company's financial performance.\n\nThe analysis of these financial data is typically done through various quantitative methods, including trend analysis, ratio analysis, regression analysis, and other statistical techniques. The findings from this analysis help analysts make informed stock recommendations based on the company's financial health and investment potential."}
{"question": "If I put dividend-paying stocks in my IRA, where does the dividend go when paid?", "human": "The dividend goes into the IRA (either reinvested automatically or remains as cash until you invest it, per your choice). You're not taxed on this dividend (IRA is a taxed-deferred account - you're taxed on the distributions, but not on the capital gains within the account).", "ai": " In an Individual Retirement Account (IRA), dividends from dividend-paying stocks are typically treated as taxable income in the year they are received. However, the dividends grow tax-deferred until you make withdrawals from the IRA during retirement.\n\nTherefore, the dividends are not physically going anywhere, but rather being reinvested in the IRA or added to the cash balance of the account, depending on your investment strategy. When you take distributions from the IRA in retirement, you will be subject to taxes on the dividends and other earnings."}
{"question": "How to share income after marriage and kids?", "human": "I think the problem is that you've made a math error. This child would not be costing you 300 per month, it will be costing you 1400 per month.  1100 of this is in a donation of salable hours rather than cash, but helpfully you have a number right there as to how much someone is willing to pay for these hours so the math is still doable. So, if you are indeed splitting your expenses fifty-fifty, you should chip 1100 into the pot to match your wife's contribution.  It would make the most sense, I think, to have your part of this contribution cover some of your mutual expenses, and if any is left over, save it up for the day that your child would cost more than that 300 in a month - when you need extra clothes, or have to replace something they destroyed, or want to pay for extra opportunities (camps, educational games, lessons), or a a savings that can be used for major future expenses (higher education, first car, milestone celebrations, safety net when starting out). Of course, if your family is indeed a priority, you might consider making an equal investment in your family - say, half your income (1800) to match half her time going into the building of the family.  After all, the decision to start a family should be an investment of time and value, not just a minimum bid for expenses.  And again, any extra can be spent on mutual expenses, saved up for future costs, or left as your child's \"savings\" for major expenses or safety net. I suppose I should mention that you perhaps could get away with covering half her contribution (550 per month, on the face of it), as that should also \"balance\" out the monthly expenses.  Even this much would be enough to put her back into the green on her covering her own costs.  Of course, in this case you might want to take into account that while she's working 38,5 hours per week now, running a household is, I've heard, more closely equivalent to a 60-hour week, plus or minus being \"on call\" for a further 100 hours a week.  Trying to calculate the absolute minimum payment on your part to match the investment of hours on hers is likely to be a bit more tricky than just matching the salable hours not worked, if you're set on income ratios and splitting costs \"as they are\". Also, you might want to rethink your criteria for sharing income completely or what makes certain divisions of costs \"unfair\". You mention one reason it would be unfair is that you have a \"more stressful job\" - well, your job may well be more stressful than her job now, but it is likely to be less so than raising a child (her new job).  As for investment of time and energy for your education entitling you to a larger amount of pay, again, raising a child is likely to be a larger investment of time, money, and anxiety than your education, but her pay (or even share of the costs) doesn't seem to be balanced in response.  I'm not gonna tell you what is fair, that's for you to work out, just suggesting you really think it through before deciding what would be fair or not.", "ai": " Here's a straightforward approach to sharing income after marriage and raising kids:\n\n1. Determine your combined income: Add up both partners' after-tax income.\n2. Create a household budget: List all monthly expenses, including mortgage/rent, utilities, groceries, transportation, and childcare.\n3. Allocate income to specific categories: Decide how much each partner will contribute to each expense category based on their income and responsibilities. For example, if one partner earns more, they may contribute a larger percentage to certain expenses.\n4. Open joint bank accounts: Deposit both partners' paychecks into a joint account. This account can be used for shared expenses such as mortgage payments, groceries, and utilities.\n5. Maintain separate personal accounts: It's important for each partner to have a separate personal account for discretionary spending and savings.\n6. Review and adjust the budget regularly: As your family grows and your income changes, it's important to reevaluate your budget and adjust income allocations as needed.\n7. Consider using a budgeting app or spreadsheet: To stay organized and keep track of your income and expenses, use a budgeting tool.\n\nRemember, effective communication and open dialogue are essential when it comes to sharing income and managing a household. Working together to create and maintain a budget can help ensure financial stability and peace of mind for your family."}
{"question": "Schwab wants to charge me interest on the money I received for selling TSLA short", "human": "I agree with Mark.  I was quite confuse about the short position at first but then I did a lot of learning and found out that as long as you have enough cash to cover your margin requirement you do not pay any interest since you do not have a debit on your margin balance.  This is not true for a long position though, supposed you have 5k cash and 5k margin balance, if you buy 10K worth of stocks then you will need to pay interest on the 5k of the margin balance since it is a debit.  Since shorting is done at a credit basis, you actually get interest from the transaction but you still may need to pay the borrowing fees for the stocks so they could simply balance each other out.  I have shorted stocks twice through two different companies and neither time I noticed any interest charges.  But make sure you have enough cash to cover your margin requirement, because once your margin balance is used to covered your position then interest would accrual. Learn.", "ai": " If you sold TSLA short and received proceeds in your Schwab account, and Schwab is now charging you interest on that balance, it means that the value of your short position has not generated sufficient interest income to cover the interest expense being imposed by the broker. This can happen when the borrowed shares to sell short are expensive to borrow, or if the short position is losing value, causing your margin requirements to increase and the interest expense to accrue. You may need to add additional funds to your account or close out the short position to avoid further interest charges."}
{"question": "Might I need a credit score to rent, or for any other non-borrowing finances?", "human": "Typically one wants to see a credit score, just because you may have money in the bank and decent income does not mean your going to pay, there are plenty of people who have the money but simply refuse to cough it up. Credit is simply a relative way of seeing where one fits against another in a larger group, it shows that this person not only can pay, but does pay. While not having a credit history should make no difference, I can and hopefully easily posited above why it can be necessary to have one. Not all landlords will require a credit check, I was not required to give one, I did not have much credit to begin with, given that, I was forced to cough up a higher degree of a security deposit.", "ai": " A credit score is typically required for financing options such as renting an apartment or house through a property management company that uses a third-party screening service, or for utilities and cell phone contracts that require a credit check. However, some landlords or utility companies may not use credit checks and instead rely on other methods to assess your financial responsibility. To be certain, check with the specific organizations you'll be dealing with to see if a credit check is required."}
{"question": "Can I open a bank account in the US remotely? Will I pay taxes for the money on it?", "human": "Answering for US tax only: The bank account makes absolutely zero difference.  If you are not a US national and not resident in the US, but earn income from a US employer/client/customer, generally that income is not subject to US tax (no matter where it is banked). However there are (complicated) exceptions, particularly if you are considered to be operating a 'trade or business' in the US or US real estate is involved. Start at https://www.irs.gov/individuals/international-taxpayers/nonresident-aliens and proceed through pub 519 if you have time to spend. I do not know (or answer) about Argentinian taxes. Whether you can find a US bank that wants to open and maintain an account for a foreigner (which is extra paperwork and regulation for them) is a different Q, that is already asked and answered: B1/B2 visas do not allow you to work, but that isn't really in scope of money.SX and belongs over on travel.SX (or expatriates.SX for longer stay);  https://travel.stackexchange.com/questions/25416/work-as-freelancer-while-tourist-in-us-for-an-already-existing-us-client seems to cover it.", "ai": " Yes, you can open a bank account in the US remotely by providing necessary documentation such as a passport and proof of address.

{"question": "Has anyone heard of Peerstreet?", "human": "(Disclosure - PeerStreet was at FinCon, a financial blogger conference I attended last month. I had the chance to briefly meet a couple people from this company. Also, I recognize a number of the names of their financial backers. This doesn't guarantee anything, of course, except the people behind the scenes are no slackers.) The same way Prosper and Lending Club have created a market for personal loans, this is a company that offers real estate loans.  The \"too good to be true\" aspect is what I'll try to address. I've disclosed in other answers that I have my Real Estate license. Earlier this year, I sold a house that was financed with a \"Hard Money\" loan. Not a bank, but a group of investors. They charged the buyer 10%. Let me state - I represented the seller, and when I found out the terms of the loan, it would have been a breach of my own moral and legal responsibility to her to do anything to kill the deal. I felt sick for days after that sale.  There are many people with little credit history who are hard workers and have saved their 20% down. For PeerStreet, 25%. The same way there's a business, local to my area, that offered a 10% loan, PeerStreet is doing something similar but in a 'crowd sourced' way. It seems to me that since they show the duration as only 6-24 months, the buyer typically manages to refinance during that time. I'm guessing that these may be people who are selling their house, but have bad timing, i.e. they need to first close on the sale to qualify to buy the new home. Or simply need the time to get their regular loan approved.  (As a final side note - I recalled the 10% story in a social setting, and more than one person responded they'd have been happy to invest their money at 6%. I could have saved the buyer 4% and gotten someone else nearly 6% more than they get on their cash.)", "ai": " Yes, PeerStreet is a real estate crowdfunding platform where investors can invest in pre-vetted real estate debt investments. It uses the Propy platform for digital asset transfer and document signing. Investments can range from $1,000 to $1,000,000. The platform aims to provide consistent returns, monthly or annually, depending on the investment selected. There are fees associated with investing, and potential risks include default and real estate market fluctuations. Do your own due diligence before investing."}
