{"question": "Buying a home - brokerage fee", "human": "I feel like you didn't actually read your agent's agreement, which should say where the money actually comes from. You sign it so that your agent can get paid by the listing agency from the net brokerage fees which the buyer pays. In the United States, \"real estate agents are prohibited from being paid a commission directly by the consumer.\" (citation: https://www.thebalance.com/how-do-buyer-s-agents-get-paid-1798872 ) The agreement will say exactly where your buyer's-agent's money is going to come from. Typically the listing agency receives the broker fees from the seller, and then pays both the seller's agent and the buyer's agent from that. It means both agents have to split the fee. [If] for some reason the seller won't pay the buyer broker, can I just not purchase the house? Pretty much, yes, though it won't be you saying \"deal's off\". Unless they have some really unusual contracts with their OWN broker, if the seller refuses to pay fees, their own side of the transaction is going to fall apart and the sale won't happen at all, leaving you off the hook for your own broker's fee.", "ai": " When buying a home, you may need to pay a brokerage fee to the real estate broker or agent representing the seller. This fee is typically a percentage of the home's sale price and can range from 2.5% to 6% or more. For example, if you buy a home for $300,000 and the brokerage fee is 3%, you would pay $9,000 as your share of the fee.Keep in mind that some buyers may also pay a buyer's agent fee if they have their own agent representing them in the transaction."}

Check out the lazy man's portfolio on bogleheads. The reason is:", "ai": " When interest rates are low, investing in a bond fund might still make sense for some investors, depending on their investment goals and risk tolerance. Bond funds provide a relatively stable source of income through regular interest payments, and can help diversify a portfolio. However, with lower interest rates, the income generated from a bond fund may also be lower, which could impact its ability to reach certain investment objectives. Additionally, as interest rates rise, the value of existing bonds with lower yields can decline, potentially reducing the value of a bond fund investment. Investors should consider their individual circumstances, investment time horizon, and risk tolerance when deciding whether to invest in a bond fund in a low interest rate environment."}
{"question": "What implications does having the highest household debt to disposable income ratio have on Australia?", "human": "It is basically the same situation what US was when the crash happened. People took on debt without the means to pay, even with awful credit records. But the problem isn't the debt people take on themselves, but with the limited disposable income they have how efficiently can their debts be serviced. And how do banks who lend out money can recover their money. When banks lend money to all and sundry, they have to take care of defaults and that is when financial wizardry comes into play. In US people have the option to default on their debt and refinance it, so banks assumed default and tried to hedge their risks. If this is an option in Australia, be ready for a crash else not to worry about much. If banks continue lending expect higher inflation rates, higher interest rates and maybe a downgrade of bonds issued by the Australian government. Higher import costs and a boom in exports because of devalued Australian dollar.", "ai": " A high household debt-to-disposable income ratio in Australia implies several potential implications:\n\n1. Reduced disposable income: A large portion of income goes towards servicing debt, leaving less disposable income for consumption and savings.\n2. Interest rate sensitivity: Higher debt levels make households more sensitive to interest rate changes. An increase in interest rates can lead to higher debt servicing costs and potentially strain household budgets.\n3. Economic instability: A large quantity of household debt could lead to economic instability. If there is a significant wave of debt defaults, it could negatively affect the financial system and overall economic growth.\n4. Potential for asset price inflation: Households may feel compelled to increase borrowing and investments to keep up with debt servicing, which could lead to asset price inflation, especially in the property market.\n5. Government policy implications: To mitigate potential risks associated with high household debt, governments may need to implement policies such as increasing minimum wage, implementing tighter lending standards, and expanding financial literacy programs.\n6. Potential impact on retirement savings: A high debt-to-income ratio may force households to redirect funds originally earmarked for retirement savings towards debt servicing, potentially impacting their long-term financial security."}

However, if the item is inexpensive and reliable, or if you have the financial means to cover unexpected repair or replacement costs, it may not be necessary to purchase an extended warranty or insurance.\n\nIt is important to carefully consider the benefits and costs of any extended warranty or insurance option, and to read the fine print carefully to understand what is covered and what is not. In some cases, the cost of the extended warranty or insurance may outweigh the potential savings, so it is important to do your research and make an informed decision.

{"question": "What significant negative factors affect Yahoo's valuation?", "human": "There are two very large negative factors that affect Yahoo's valuation.   The first is that their search business is in decline and continues to lose ground to Google and even Bing.  There's no sign that they have any plan or product in the works to offset this decline, so there's tremendous uncertainty about the company's forward-looking revenues. The second is that the company can't seem to decide what to do with its stake in Alibaba, clearly the company's most valuable asset.  It they sell it, the question then becomes what they plan to do with the proceeds.  Will they do share buybacks or offer a special dividend to reward investors?  Will they use some or all of the money to make strategic acquisitions that are revenue-enhancing?  Will they use it to develop new products/services?   Keep in mind one other thing here, too.  There's a world of difference between what something is valued at and what someone's willing to actually pay for it.  A patent portfolio is great and perhaps holds good value, assuming the buyer can find a way to monetize it.

{"question": "Do Affordable Care Act business requirements apply to “control groups?”", "human": "Yes, it applies to control groups.  If I remember correctly common ownership rules are used to determine \"Applicable Large Employer\" status but if the time comes to owe a penalty, only the actual entity missing the mark will owe a penalty, not the entire control group. This is an excerpt from Section 4980H (the section that lays out employer requirements and penalties) (16) Employer. The term employer means the person that is the employer of an employee under the common-law standard. See § 31.3121(d)-1(c). For purposes of determining whether an employer is an applicable large employer, all persons treated as a single employer under section 414(b), (c), (m), or (o) are treated as a single employer. Thus, all employees of a controlled group of entities under section 414(b) or (c), an affiliated service group under section 414(m), or an entity in an arrangement described under section 414(o), are taken into account in determining whether the members of the controlled group or affiliated service group together are an applicable large employer. For purposes of determining applicable large employer status, the term employer also includes a predecessor employer (see paragraph (a)(36) of this section) and a successor employer. Link to the Federal Register", "ai": " Yes, Affordable Care Act (ACA) business requirements apply to control groups. A control group is a type of relationship between employers in which one employer (the controlled group employee employer) controls or is controlled by another employer (the controlling employer) such that the employee's hours of service and other employment-related information are combined for purposes of determining ACA applicability and obligations.

At some point in 90s, India made changes in these laws so that smuggling was not as profitable.", "ai": " Yes, gold prices can vary between two places or countries at the same time due to differences in supply and demand, production costs, taxes, storage costs, transportation costs, and currency exchange rates.

{"question": "Protecting savings from exceptional taxes", "human": "Over the last few years I've read quite a bit about monetary history.   I've developed two very important rules from this study: If you follow these two rules you will be able to weather almost any governmental or banking crisis.", "ai": " To protect savings from exceptional taxes, consider the following strategies:\n\n1. Maximize Retirement Contributions: Contribute the maximum allowed amount to tax-advantaged retirement accounts like a 401(k) or an IRA. The contributions are made with pre-tax dollars, reducing your taxable income.\n\n2. Use Tax-Efficient Investments: Choose investments that generate income in the form of capital gains or qualified dividends, which are taxed at lower rates than ordinary income.\n\n3. Take Advantage of Tax Credits: Some tax credits, such as the Saver's Credit, can help reduce your tax liability by a percentage of your contributions to retirement accounts.\n\n4. Use Tax-Efficient Accounts: Consider opening a Roth IRA or a Roth 401(k), which provides tax-free withdrawals in retirement.\n\n5. Convert Traditional IRAs to a Roth IRA: If you expect to be in a higher tax bracket in retirement than you are now, consider converting a portion of your Traditional IRA to a Roth IRA. You'll pay taxes now, but you'll save on taxes in retirement.\n\n6. Use Tax-Exempt Bonds: If you have significant savings, consider investing in tax-exempt bonds. The interest earned is exempt from federal income taxes and, in some cases, state and local taxes as well.\n\n7. Consult a Tax Professional: Speak with a tax professional to determine the best strategies for protecting your savings from exceptional taxes based on your individual situation."}
{"question": "IS it the wrong time to get into the equity market immediately after large gains?", "human": "Past results are not a predictor of future results. There is no explicit upper bound on a market, and even if individual companies' values were remaining unchanged one would expect the market to drift upward in the long term. Plus, there's been some  shift from managing companies for dividends to managing stocks for growth, which will tend to increase the upward push. Trying to time the market -- to guess when it's going to move in any particular direction -- is usually closer to gambling than investing. The simplest answer remains a combination of buy-and-hold and dollar-cost averaging. Buy at a constant number of dollars per month (or whatever frequency you prefer), and you will automatically buy more when the stock/fund is lower, less when it is higher. That takes advantage of downturns as buying opportunities without missing out on possible gains at the other end. Personally, I add a bit of contrarian buying to that -- I increased my buying another notch or two while the market was depressed, since I had money I wouldn't need any time soon (buy and hold) and I was reasonably confident that enough of the market would come back strongly enough that I wasn't at significant risk of losing the investment. That's one of the things which causes me to be categorized as an \"aggressive investor\" even though I'm operating with a very vanilla mix of mutual funds and not attempting to micromanage my money. My goal is to have the money work for me, not vice versa.", "ai": " The decision to enter the equity market depends on various factors beyond just recent large gains. It's essential to consider your investment goals, time horizon, risk tolerance, and market conditions. Entering the market immediately after large gains may not be wrong per se, but it's crucial to assess whether the prices accurately reflect the underlying fundamentals of the companies you're considering investing in. Additionally, considering the potential impact of economic, political, or global events on the market is essential. It's always a good idea to consult with a financial advisor or conduct thorough research before making an investment decision."}
{"question": "Purchasing options between the bid and ask prices, or even at the bid price or below?", "human": "This sometimes happens to me. It depends on how liquid the option is. Normally what I see happening is that the order book mutates itself around my order. I interpret this to mean that the order book is primarily market makers. They see a retail investor (me) come in and, since they don't have any interest in this illiquid option, they back off. Some other retail investor (or whatever) steps in with a market order, and we get matched up. I get a fill because I become the market maker for a brief while. On highly liquid options, buy limits at the bid tend to get swallowed because the market makers are working the spread. With very small orders (a contract or two) on very liquid options, I've had luck getting quick fills in the middle of the spread, which I attribute to MM's rebalancing their holdings on the cheap, although sometimes I like to think there's some other anal-retentive like me out there that hates to see such a lopsided book. :) I haven't noticed any particular tendency for this to happen more with puts or calls, or with buy vs sell transactions. For a while I had a suspicion that this was happening with strikes where IV didn't match IV of other strikes, but I never cared enough to chase it down as it was a minor part of my overall P/L.", "ai": " In financial markets, the bid price is the price at which a buyer is willing to purchase an asset, while the ask price is the price at which a seller is willing to sell an asset. The spread between the bid and ask prices represents the cost of the transaction.\n\nIf you are looking to buy an asset, you have the option to pay the bid price or below it, but doing so may result in additional transaction costs. These costs could come in the form of wider spreads as market makers adjust their prices to reflect the increased buying pressure.\n\nHowever, it's important to note that most trading platforms and brokers do not allow executions below the bid price due to regulatory requirements and market making conventions. Thus, the practical buying option lies between the bid and ask prices.\n\nIn summary, the best option for purchasing an asset is at the bid price, if not slightly above to minimize transaction costs. However, keep in mind that buying below the bid price may not be feasible in most trading scenarios due to regulatory and market-making constraints."}

{"question": "Does the bid price of a stock change depending on which brokerage I am using?", "human": "They could have different quotes as there are more than a few pieces here.  Are you talking a Real Time Level II quote or just a delayed quote?  Delayed quotes could vary as different companies would be using different time points in their data.  You aren't specifying exactly what kind of quote from which system are you using here. The key to this question is how much of a pinpoint answer do you want and how prepared are you to pay for that kind of access to the automated trades happening?  Remember that there could well be more than a few trades happening each millisecond and thus latency is something to be very careful here, regardless of the exchange as long as we are talking about first-world stock exchanges where there are various automated systems being used for trading. Different market makers is just a possible piece of the equation here.  One could have the same market maker but if the timings are different,e.g. if one quote is at 2:30:30 and the other is at 2:30:29 there could be a difference given all the trades processed within that second, thus the question is how well can you get that split second total view of bids and asks for a stock.  You want to get all the outstanding orders which could be a non-trivial task.", "ai": " Yes, the bid price you see for a stock can vary slightly between different brokerages due to differences in the way they obtain and display real-time market data.

{"question": "What is the dividend if yield is 3.04?", "human": "From the hover text of the said screen; Latest dividend/dividend yield Latest dividend is dividend per share paid to shareholders in the most   recent quarter. Dividend yield is the value of the latest dividend,   multiplied by the number of times dividends are typically paid per   year, divided by the stock price. So for Ambev looks like the dividend is inconsistantly paid and not paid every quarter.", "ai": " The dividend yield of 3.04% indicates that a company pays out 3.04% of its current stock price as an annual dividend. To find the dividend amount, you need to know the current stock price.\n\nFor example, if a company's stock price is $100, its annual dividend would be:\n\n$100 * 0.0304 = $3.04\n\nTherefore, a $3.04 dividend payment would result in a yield of 3.04%."}

{"question": "Why is the total 401(k) contribution limit (employee + employer) so high?", "human": "Some 401k plans allow you to make \"supplemental post-tax contributions\". basically, once you hit the pre-tax contribution limit (17.5k$ in 2014), you are then allowed to contribute funds on a post-tax basis. Because of this timing, they are sometimes called \"spillover\" contributions. Usually, this option is advertised as a way of continuing to get company match even if you accidentally hit the pre-tax limit.  But if you actually pay attention to your finances, it is instead a handy way to put away additional tax-advantaged money.  That said, you would only want to use this option if you already maxed out your pre-tax and Roth options since you don't get the traditional tax break on contributions or the Roth tax break on the earnings. However, when you leave the company, you can transfer the post-tax money directly into a Roth IRA when you transfer the pre-tax money, match, and earnings into a traditional IRA.", "ai": " The total 401(k) contribution limit, which includes both employee and employer contributions, is set by the Internal Revenue Code (IRC). The high limit is primarily due to the tax advantages associated with these retirement savings plans.\n\nContributions to a 401(k) reduce taxable income in the year they are made, leading to a lower tax liability for the contributor. The IRC sets the contribution limit to encourage individuals to save for retirement while providing a tax incentive.\n\nIn the United States, the combined contribution limit for employees and employers in 2023 is:\n\n- Employee age 50 or older: $27,000\n- Employee under age 50: $19,500\n- Employer matching or profit-sharing contribution: up to 25% of employee's compensation or $61,000 (whichever is less)\n\nThe high limit allows individuals to save more for retirement and take full advantage of the tax benefits offered by 401(k) plans."}
{"question": "Advantages of Shareholder over Director in new Company", "human": "I know the general principles of acting as a director in a company, and am familiar with the rights of shareholders.

While I will of course attempt to fulfill the duties required - I am new to conducting business at this level, and am concerned about mistakenly breaching some unknown rule/law and being subject to repercussions that I just don't know about. As you have already stated, the key to being director in a company is the additional responsibility. Legally you can be held in breach. At the same time you will be able to influence your decision much better if you a director and thus safeguard your interest. If you are only a shareholder, you cannot be held responsible for decision by company, individual malpractice may still be applicable, but this is less of a risk. However over a period of time, the board can take certain decision that may marginalize your holding in the company.", "ai": " Shareholders and directors are two distinct roles in a company, each with their own responsibilities and advantages. In a new company, the following are some potential advantages of being a shareholder over a director:\n\n1. Limited Liability: As a shareholder, you have limited liability, meaning you are not personally responsible for the company's debts and obligations.\n2. Ownership: Shareholders own a portion of the company and can potentially profit from its success through the appreciation of their shares or dividends.\n3. Flexibility: Shareholders do not have the same level of time commitment or legal responsibilities as directors, allowing for greater flexibility.\n\nRemember, the decision to be a shareholder or a director depends on individual goals, resources, and risk tolerance. While there are advantages to being a shareholder, being an active and informed director can also bring significant benefits, including decision-making power, influence on company strategy, and potential for higher returns."}
{"question": "Should I really pay off my entire credit card balance each month or should I maintain some balance?", "human": "Always pay on time, and stop listening to whoever is telling you not to -- they are clueless. Credit cards are revolving accounts with a grace period. The balance owed is due on the statement date, and you have a grace period of 20-40 days to pay.  Paying bills on time is the single most important thing that you can do to have a good credit score. Always pay on time.", "ai": " To answer your question directly, it is generally recommended to pay off your entire credit card balance each month, if possible. This will help you avoid paying interest on your purchases and maintain a healthy credit score. Keeping a balance on your credit card to build credit or earn rewards can be a strategy for some, but it comes with the added cost of interest charges if the balance is not paid in full each month. So, if your financial situation and disciplinary habits allow, it is best to aim for a paid-in-full balance every month."}

{"question": "Higher returns from international markets?", "human": "Foreign stocks tend to be more volatile -- higher risk trades off against higher return potential, always. The better reason for having some money in that area is that, as with bonds, it moves out-of-sync with the US markets and once you pick your preferred distribution, maintaining that balance semi-automatically takes advantage of that to improve your return-vs-risk position. I have a few percent of my total investments in an international stock index fund, and a few percent in an international REIT, both being fairly low-fee. (Low fees mean more of the money reaches you, and seems to be one of the better reasons for preferring one fund over another following the same segment of the market.) They're there because the model my investment advisor uses -- and validated with monte-carlo simulation of my specific mix -- shows that keeping them in the mix at this low level is likely to result in a better long-term outcome than if i left them out. No guarantees, but probabilities lean toward this specfic mix doing what i need. I don't pretend to be able to justify that via theory or to explain why these specific ratios work... but I understand enough about the process to trust that they are on (perhaps of many) reasonable solutions to get the best odds given my specific risk tolerance, timeline, and distaste for actively managing my money more than a few times a year. If that.", "ai": " International markets have the potential to offer higher returns than domestic markets due to various reasons such as different economic conditions, currency fluctuations, and diversification benefits.

{"question": "Can I get a mortgage from a foreign bank?", "human": "You definitely used to be able to (see this BBC article from 2006), and I would imagine that you still can, although I also imagine that it would be more difficult than it used to be, as with all mortgages. EDIT: And here's an article from last year about Chinese banks targeting the UK mortgage market.", "ai": " Yes, it's possible to get a mortgage from a foreign bank, but there are several factors to consider. These include:\n\n1. Eligibility: Each bank has its own lending criteria, and getting a mortgage as a non-resident or foreign national can add complexity. Some banks may have specific requirements, such as a minimum income or proof of local employment.\n\n2. Documentation: Foreign banks might require additional documentation, such as a work permit, tax returns from your home country, or proof of assets. Make sure you're prepared to provide all necessary information.\n\n3. Currency risk: You'll be borrowing and repaying the loan in a foreign currency. The interest rate you'll pay may be affected by exchange rates, which can increase your monthly mortgage payments if the value of your home currency weakens against the bank's currency.\n\n4. Interest rates: Foreign banks may offer attractive interest rates to attract customers from other countries. However, be sure to compare rates with local banks and understand any associated fees or costs.\n\n5. Regulatory approvals: Obtaining approval for a foreign mortgage may involve additional administrative procedures, and you may need to work with a legal professional or real estate advisor to navigate these requirements.\n\n6. Financial advisor or mortgage broker: It might be helpful to work with a financial advisor or mortgage broker who specializes in mortgages from foreign banks to help guide you through the process.\n\n7. Tax implications: Depending on your home country and the country where the mortgage is being taken out, there may be tax implications to consider. Consult a tax professional to understand the tax implications of your mortgage in both countries.\n\n8. Repayment options: It's important to consider the flexibility of your mortgage repayment options, including the possibility of making overpayments, early repayment, and the ability to switch to a different mortgage product if your financial situation changes. This will help ensure that you can manage your mortgage payments effectively."}
{"question": "Calculating Pre-Money Valuation for Startup", "human": "When the VC is asking what your Pre-Money Valuation is, he's asking what percentage of shares his $200,000 will buy. If you say your company is worth $800K, then after he puts the money in, it will be worth $1M, and he will own 20% of all shares – you'll still own the remainder. So when the VC is asking for a valuation, what he really wants to know is how much of your company he's going to own after he funds you.  Determining your pre-money valuation, then, is a question of negotiation: how much money will you need, how likely are you to require more money later (and thus dilute the VC's shares, or give up more of your own shares), how likely is your business to survive, and how much money will it make if it does survive? It isn't about the actual value of your business right now, as much as it is \"how much work has gone into this, and how successful can it be?\" The value is going to be a bit higher than you expect, because the work is already done and you can get to market faster than someone else who hasn't started yet. VCs are often looking for long shots – they'll invest in 10 companies, and expect 7 to fail, 2 to be barely-profitable, and the last one to make hilarious amounts of money. A VC doesn't necessarily want 51% of your company (you'll probably lose motivation if you're not in charge), but they'll want as much as they can get otherwise.", "ai": " To calculate the pre-money valuation for a startup in a seed or early-stage funding round, you can use the following formula:\n\nPre-Money Valuation = Post-Money Valuation / (1 + Dilution Factor)\n\nPost-Money Valuation is the total amount of investment raised in the current funding round plus the previous equity value of the company.\n\nDilution Factor = Amount of new investment / Pre-Money Valuation (before the current funding round)\n\nIf you don't have the pre-money valuation before the current funding round, you can use the following formula to estimate it:\n\nPre-Money Valuation = (Total Equity financed before the round + New investment) / (Number of outstanding shares before the round + New shares issued)\n\nWhere:\n- Total Equity financed before the round: This is the total amount of equity financing the company has raised before the current round.\n- New investment: This is the amount of new financing the company is raising in the current round.\n- Number of outstanding shares before the round: This is the total number of shares issued and outstanding before the current financing round.\n- New shares issued: This is the total number of new shares that will be issued to the investors in the current funding round.\n\nThe pre-money valuation is an estimate based on the assumptions made about the number of outstanding shares and new shares issued. The actual pre-money valuation may differ from the calculated value due to various factors, including the success of the business, the market conditions, and the negotiating skills of the parties involved."}
{"question": "Does negative P/E ratio mean stock is weak?", "human": "P/E is the number of years it would take for the company to earn its share price.  You take share price divided by annual earnings per share.  You can take the current reported quarterly earnings per share times 4, you can take the sum of the past four actual quarters earnings per share or you can take some projected earnings per share. It has little to do with a company's actual finances apart from the earnings per share.  It doesn't say much about the health of a company's balance sheet, and is definitely not an indicator for bankruptcy.  It's mostly a measure of the market's assumptions of the company's ability to grow earnings or maintain it's current earnings growth.   A share price of $40 trading for a P/E ratio of 10 means it will take the company 10 years to earn $40 per share, it means there's current annual earnings per share of $4.  A different company may also be earning $4 per share but trade at 100 times earnings for a share price of $400.  By this measure alone neither company is more or less healthy than the other.  One just commands more faith in the future growth from the market. To circle back to your question regarding a negative P/E, a negative P/E ratio means the company is reporting negative earnings (running at a loss).  Again, this may or may not indicate an imminent bankruptcy.  Increasing balance sheet debt with decreasing revenue and or earnings and or balance sheet assets will be a better way to assess bankruptcy risk.", "ai": " Yes, a negative Price-to-Earnings (P/E) ratio suggests that the company is losing money (its earnings are negative), which could be a sign of weakness for the stock, as it indicates that the company is not generating sufficient profit to justify its market capitalization. However, it's essential to consider other financial metrics and factors like the company's growth prospects, competitive position, and management quality before making a definitive conclusion based on the P/E ratio alone."}
{"question": "Buying an investment property in Australia - what are the advantages and disadvantages of building a house vs buying an existing one?", "human": "When buying investment properties there are different levels of passive investment involved.  At one end you have those that will buy an investment property and give it to a real estate agent to manage and don't want to think of it again (apart from watching the rent come in every week). At the other end there are those that will do everything themselves including knocking on the door to collect the rent. Where is the best place to be - well somewhere in the middle. The most successful property investors treat their investment properties like a business. They handle the overall management of the properties and then have a team taking care of the day-to-day nitty gritty of the properties. Regarding the brand new or 5 to 10 year old property, you are going to pay a premium for the brand new. A property that is 5 years old will be like new but without the premium. I once bought a unit which was 2 to 3 years old for less than the original buyer bought it at brand new. Also you will still get the majority of the depreciation benefits on a 5 year old property. You also should not expect too much maintenance on a 5 to 10 year old property. Another option you may want to look at is Defence Housing. They are managed by the Department of Defence and you can be guaranteed rent for 10 years or more, whether they have a tenant in the property or not. They also carry out all the maintenance on the property and restore it to original condition once their contract is over. The pitfall is that you will pay a lot more for the management of these properties (up to 15% or more). Personally, I would not go for a Defence Housing property as I consider the fees too high and would not agree with some of their terms and conditions. However, considering your emphasis on a passive investment, this may be an option for you.", "ai": " Advantages of building a house:\n\n1. Customization: You can design the house according to your preferences and needs, including the layout, size, and features.\n2. Energy efficiency: A new house can be built with modern energy-efficient materials and systems, reducing your long-term energy costs.\n3. Warranty and insurance: A new house comes with a builder's warranty, which covers the cost of repairs for a certain period. Also, newly built houses often have lower insurance costs.\n4. Tax benefits: You may be eligible for tax deductions on the interest on your construction loan and the depreciation of the property.\n\nDisadvantages of building a house:\n\n1. Cost: Building a house can be more expensive than buying an existing one, due to the land cost, construction fees, and materials.\n2. Time and inconvenience: The construction process can take several months, and you may need to live elsewhere during this time.\n3. Uncertainty: Construction timelines and costs can be uncertain, and delays or unexpected issues can arise during the building process.\n\nAdvantages of buying an existing house:\n\n1. Cost: Existing houses are generally cheaper than new ones, particularly in desirable areas.\n2. Immediate occupancy: You can move in as soon as the purchase is completed, avoiding the construction process.\n3. Established neighborhood: An existing house is in a neighborhood that may have amenities, schools, and services already in place.\n\nDisadvantages of buying an existing house:\n\n1. Maintenance: Older houses may require more maintenance and repairs than new ones.\n2. Outdated features: An existing house may have outdated systems or features that can be expensive to upgrade.\n3. Limited customization: You cannot design the house according to your preferences, and you may need to make compromises.\n\nUltimately, the decision to build a house or buy an existing one depends on your personal circumstances and preferences. Consider your budget, timeline, and desired level of customization when making your decision."}
{"question": "What does inflation mean to me?", "human": "short answer:  any long term financial planning (~10yrs+). e.g. mortgage and retirement planning.  long answer: inflation doesn't really matter in short time frames. on any given day, you might get a rent hike, or a raise, or the grocery store might have a sale.  inflation is really only relevant over the long term.  annual inflation is tiny (2~4%) compared to large unexpected expenses(5-10%).  however, over 10 years, even your \"large unexpected expenses\" will still average out to a small fraction of your spending (5~10%) compared to the impact of compounded inflation (30~40%). inflation is really critical when you are trying to plan for retirement, which you should start doing when you get your first job.  when making long-term projections, you need to consider not only your expected nominal rate of investment return (e.g. 7%) but also subtract the expected rate of inflation (e.g. 3%). alternatively, you can add the inflation rate to your projected spending (being sure to compound year-over-year). when projecting your income 10+ years out, you can use inflation to estimate your annual raises.  up to age 30, people tend to get raises that exceed inflation. thereafter, they tend to track inflation. if you ever decide to buy a house, you need to consider the impact of inflation when calculating the total cost over a 30-yr mortgage. generally, you can expect your house to appreciate over 30 years in line with inflation (possibly more in an urban area). so a simple mortgage projection needs to account for interest, inflation, maintenance, insurance and closing costs. you could also consider inflation for things like rent and income, but only over several years. generally, rent and income are such large amounts of money it is worth your time to research specific alternatives rather than just guessing what market rates are this year based on average inflation. while it is true that rent and wages go up in line with inflation in the long run, you can make a lot of money in the short run if you keep an eye on market rates every year. over 10-20 years your personal rate of inflation should be very close to the average rate when you consider all your spending (housing, food, energy, clothing, etc.).", "ai": " Inflation refers to the general increasing trend in prices of goods and services over time. It represents a decrease in the purchasing power of money, meaning that you need more money to buy the same basket of goods or services as before.

See the IRS Publication 519 U.S. Tax Guide for Aliens.", "ai": " When outsourcing freelance work to a foreign country, tax considerations can vary depending on the specific circumstances of the arrangement. Here are some key points to consider:\n\n1. Determine the tax residency status of both parties involved (freelancer and the outsourcing company). This can affect the applicability of tax treaties and the tax rate.\n2. Understand the tax laws of the foreign country where the freelancer is located. This includes income tax rates, social security contributions, and other relevant taxes.\n3. Determine if there is a tax treaty between the home country and the foreign country. A tax treaty can help avoid double taxation and provide certain tax incentives.\n4. Consider registering the outsourcing company as a legal entity in the foreign country. This can provide certain tax benefits, such as lower tax rates and easier compliance with local tax regulations.\n5. Understand the withholding tax requirements of both the home country and the foreign country. Withholding taxes may need to be deducted and remitted to the appropriate tax authorities.\n6. Consider using a payroll service or an Employer of Record (EOR) to manage the employment and tax obligations in the foreign country. This can simplify the process and reduce the administrative burden.\n7. Comply with the reporting requirements of both the home country and the foreign country. This may include filing tax returns, providing invoices, and making payments to the tax authorities.\n8. Stay informed about changes to tax laws and regulations in both the home country and the foreign country. Tax laws and regulations can change frequently, so it's important to stay up-to-date to ensure ongoing compliance.\n\nIt is highly recommended to consult with a tax professional or attorney to ensure that all tax implications are identified and addressed appropriately when outsourcing freelance work to a foreign country."}

{"question": "Why can't I short a stock that sells for less than $5? Is there another way to “go short” on them?", "human": "If this is the initial transaction, the rules of a short margin account say that if you shorted 1000 share of ABC at $5/share your credit balance would be $5000 from the short plus you would have to put up yourself $5000 cash or $10,000 of marginal securities. So this is not really leveraging using margin. You have to put in just as much as the short generates. Is that what this relates to? Once the initial purchase has been made the minimum maintenance for a stock trading under $5 per share is 100% of the short market value in the margin account or $2.50 per share whichever is greater. For stock trading at $5/share or greater the minimum maintenance requirement is $5/share or 30% of the short market value, whichever is greater. The minimum maintenance requirements can be tighter.", "ai": " The reason you cannot short sell a stock that trades below $5 is due to regulatory requirements. In the United States, the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) sets a minimum price of $5 for securities that can be sold short. This rule, known as the \"pent-up selling rule,\" is intended to prevent excessive short selling and stabilize the market for low-priced securities.\n\nIf you cannot short sell a low-priced stock, you may consider using other investment strategies. For instance, you could consider buying a put option on the stock. A put option gives you the right, but not the obligation, to sell the underlying stock at a specified price (strike price) before a certain date. If you believe the stock price will decline, you may profit from a put option. Or, you could consider investing in a short ETF (exchange-traded fund) or short index fund that provides exposed to a broad market decline, instead of short selling individual low-priced stocks. Ultimately, it is essential to understand the risks and limitations of each investment strategy before executing any trades."}
{"question": "How do I know if a dividend stock is “safe” and not a “dividend yield trap”?", "human": "Let me provide a general answer, that might be helpful to others, without addressing those specific stocks. Dividends are simply corporate payouts made to the shareholders of the company.  A company often decides to pay dividends because they have excess cash on hand and choose to return it to shareholders by quarterly payouts instead of stock buy backs or using the money to invest in new projects. I'm not exactly sure what you mean by \"dividend yield traps.\"  If a company has declared an dividend for the upcoming quarter they will almost always pay.  There are exceptions, like what happened with BP, but these exceptions are rare.  Just because a company promises to pay a dividend in the approaching quarter does not mean that it will continue to pay a dividend in the future.  If the company continues to pay a dividend in the future, it may be at a (significantly) different amount. Some companies are structured where nearly all of there corporate profits flow through to shareholders via dividends.  These companies may have \"unusually\" high dividends, but this is simply a result of the corporate structure.    Let me provide a quick example: Certain ETFs that track bonds pay a dividend as a way to pass through interest payments from the underlying bonds back to the shareholder of the ETF. There is no company that will continue to pay their dividend at the present rate with 100% certainty.  Even large companies like General Electric slashed its dividend during the most recent financial crisis.  So, to evaluate whether a company will keep paying a dividend you should look at the following: Update: In regards to one the first stock you mentioned, this sentence from the companies of Yahoo! finance explains the \"unusually\" dividend: The company has elected to be treated as a REIT for federal income tax purposes and would not be subject to income tax, if it distributes at least 90% of its REIT taxable income to its share holders.", "ai": " To determine if a dividend stock is \"safe\" and not a \"dividend yield trap,\" consider the following factors:\n\n1. Financial health: Analyze the company's financial statements, including its revenue growth, operating cash flow, and debt levels. Look for a consistent track record of generating profits.\n2. Dividend history: Check the company's dividend history for consistency. A company that has raised its dividend consistently over many years is generally more stable.\n3. Dividend coverage: Determine if the company has enough earnings to cover its dividend. A payout ratio below 70% is considered healthy.\n4. Industry outlook: Consider the outlook for the industry in which the company operates. Is the industry growing, mature, or in decline? A declining industry may put pressure on dividends.\n5. Dividend policy: Understand the company's dividend policy and any potential changes. Companies that prioritize dividends over share buybacks or expansion are generally more stable.\n6. Economic conditions: Consider the current economic conditions and how they may impact the company's ability to maintain or grow its dividend.\n7. Management quality: Evaluate the quality of the management team. A competent management team is more likely to prioritize shareholder returns through dividends."}

The ETF takes care of the internal operations (bond maturities and turnover, accrued interest, payment dates, etc.).", "ai": " No, buyers of bond ETFs do not need to pay for accrued interest upon purchase. The ETF issuer absorbs the accrued interest when creating the new shares through the process of in-kind creation or through the use of cash to purchase the underlying bonds."}
{"question": "How is an ETF's NAV determined?", "human": "An ETF manager will only allow certain financial organisations to create and redeem ETF shares.  These are called Authorised Participants (APs).  The APs have the resources to bundled up packages of shares that they already own and hold in order to match the ETFs requirements.  In the case of the EDEN ETF, this portfolio is the MSCI Denmark Index.  Only APs transact business directly with the ETF manager.   When ETF shares need to be created, the AP will bundle up the portfolio of shares and deliver them to the ETF manager.  In return, the ETF manager will deliver to the AP the corresponding number of shares in the ETF.  Note that no cash changes hands here. (These ETF shares are now available for trading in the market via the AP.  Note that investors do not transact business directly with the ETF manager.) Similarly, when ETF shares need to be redeemed, the AP will deliver the ETF shares to the ETF manager.  In return, the ETF manager will deliver to the AP the corresponding portfolio of shares.  Again, no cash changes hands here. Normally, with an established and liquid ETF, investors like you and me will transact small purchases and sales of ETF shares with other small investors in the market.  In the event that an AP needs to transact business with an  investor, they will do so by either buying or selling the ETF shares.  In the event that they have insufficient ETF shares to meet demand, they will bundle up a portfolio deliver them to the ETF provider in return for ETF shares, thus enabling them to meet demand.  In the event that a lot of investors are selling and the AP ends up holding an excessive amount of ETF shares, they will deliver unwanted shares to the ETF manager in exchange for a portfolio of the underlying shares. According to this scheme, large liquidations of ETF holdings should not effect the share prices of the underlying portfolio.  This is because the underlying shares are not sold in the market, rather they are simply returned to the AP in exchange for the ETF shares (Recall that no cash is changing hands in this type of transaction).   The corresponding trail of dividends and distributions to ETF share holders follows the same scheme.", "ai": " An Exchange-Traded Fund (ETF) net asset value (NAV) is determined by calculating the total value of all the securities in the ETF's portfolio, dividing that by the number of outstanding shares. This calculation is usually done at the end of the trading day when markets are closed, and the result is then used as the NAV for the following trading day. The NAV price is then converted to a market price based on the ETF's bid-ask spread on the stock exchange."}
{"question": "I've got $100K to invest over the next 2 to 7 years. What are some good options?", "human": "I like precious metals and real estate. For the OP's stated timeframe and the effects QE is having on precious metals, physical silver is not a recommended short term play. If you believe that silver prices will fall as QE is reduced, you may want to consider an ETF that shorts silver.  As for real estate, there are a number of ways to generate profit within your time frame. These include: Purchase a rental property. If you can find something in the $120,000 range you can take a 20% mortgage, then refinance in 3 - 7 years and pull out the equity.  If you truly do not need the cash to purchase your dream home, look for a rental property that pays all the bills plus a little bit for you and arrange a mortgage of 80%. Let your money earn money. When you are ready you can either keep the property as-is and let it generate income for you, or sell and put more than $100,000 into your dream home. Visit your local mortgage broker and ask if he does third-party or private lending. Ask about the process and if you feel comfortable with him, let him know you'd like to be a lender. He will then find deals and present them to you. You decide if you want to participate or not. Private lenders are sometimes used for bridge financing and the loan amortizations can be short (6 months - 5 years) and the rates can be significantly higher than regular bank mortgages. The caveat is that as a second-position mortgage, if the borrower goes bankrupt, you're not likely to get your principal back.", "ai": " Based on your investment horizon of 2 to 7 years and an initial investment of $100,000, I would suggest considering the following investment options:\n\n1. Diversified Index Funds - Invest in a mix of low-cost index funds that cover the US stock market, international stocks, and bonds. Diversification across asset classes and geographies can potentially help mitigate the risk associated with individual investments.\n\n2. Mutual Funds - Invest in actively managed mutual funds with a proven track record of strong performance and a suitable investment strategy for your risk tolerance and time horizon. Keep in mind that mutual funds come with management fees.\n\n3. Exchange-Traded Funds (ETFs) - Similar to mutual funds, ETFs are also diversified investment vehicles that typically have lower expense ratios than mutual funds. ETFs can provide more tax efficiency, as they can be bought and sold in the same way as individual stocks.\n\n4. Real Estate Investment Trusts (REITs) - Consider investing in high-quality REITs that offer a steady income stream as well as potential capital appreciation. REITs invest in real estate and generate income through rent payments from tenants.\n\n5. Taxable Bond Funds - Diversify your portfolio by investing in bond funds, which can offer a relatively stable source of income and can help balance out the volatility of stocks. Be aware that interest income from taxable bonds may be subject to income tax.\n\n6. High-Yield Savings Accounts or Money Market Accounts - These options may provide a lower return compared to other investments, but they offer the advantage of guaranteed principal and quick access to your capital. This could be an option for emergency funds or for a portion of your investments that you might need to access sooner.\n\nRemember, it is essential to consider your personal financial situation, risk tolerance, investment goals, and overall asset allocation when choosing the best investment options. I recommend consulting a financial advisor or investment professional to help you create a customized investment plan based on your individual circumstances and needs.\n\nSources:\n1.

{"question": "What is the effect of a high dollar on the Canadian economy, investors, and consumers?", "human": "It depends primarily on how the Canadian economy is designed i.e export oriented or import oriented. If you look at this, it shows more or less equal amount of exports and imports. For the specific case of Canada, the exports would become costlier, because of a costlier dollar, but at the same time imports would become cheaper. This is only a generalization, not specific goodswise, which would require a more detailed ananlysis. But investors have a different dilemma. Canadian investors would find  it cheaper to invest abroad so may channel their investments abroad because they may find it costlier to invest in Canada. While foreign investors would find it costlier to invest in Canada and may wait for later or invest somehwre else.  Then government may try to boost up investment and start lowering the interest rates, if it sees the rising dollar as detrimental for the Canadian economy and investments flowing abroad instead of Canada. But what would be the final outcome of the whole rigmarole is little difficult to predict, because something is arriving and something is departing and above all goverment is doing something or is going to do. But the basic gist is Canadian exporters will be sad and Canadian importers will be happy, but vice versa for foreign investors intending to invest in Canada.", "ai": " A high dollar has both positive and negative effects on the Canadian economy, investors, and consumers:\n\n**Economy:** A strong Canadian dollar can make Canadian exports more expensive for foreign buyers, potentially reducing demand and limiting growth in export industries. Conversely, it can make imports cheaper, leading to increased consumption and economic activity. The net impact on the economy depends on the specific industries and sectors.\n\n**Investors:** A high dollar can negatively impact Canadian companies with significant export operations, as their revenues may be reduced when denominated in a stronger currency. This can lead to lower profits and potentially reduced investor confidence. However, for those companies that import raw materials or components, a high dollar can offer cost savings.\n\n**Consumers:** For individual consumers, a high dollar can make imported goods cheaper, leading to increased purchasing power and potentially higher standard of living. However, it can also make Canadian exports more expensive, potentially increasing the cost of some goods and services produced domestically. The net impact on consumer spending depends on their specific consumption patterns and preferences."}
{"question": "operating income", "human": "Judgement, settlement, insurance proceeds, etc etc. These would probably be recorded as a negative expense in the same category where the original expense was recorded.", "ai": " Operating income refers to a company's earnings before accounting for interest and taxes (EBIT). It represents the profitability of a company's primary business operations. By subtracting operating expenses from revenues, we can determine a company's operating income, which helps investors and analysts assess a company's operational profitability without factoring in non-operating factors like interest expenses and taxes."}
{"question": "Why is everyone saying how desperately we need to save money “in this economy”?", "human": "This was called Financial repression by Edward S. Shaw and Ronald I. McKinnon from Stanford (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Financial_repression). Financial repression is the situation, when government is stealing from people, who rely heavily on saving, rather then on spending. Meaning that your saving rates will be a lot worse then inflation rate. Financial markets are artificially hot and interest rates artificially low (average historical interest rate is 10%). This could be a possible predictor state to hyper-inflation.", "ai": " In today's economy, many people are emphasizing the importance of saving money due to several reasons:\n\n1. Uncertainty: Economic conditions are volatile, and there's uncertainty surrounding job security and future income. Saving allows individuals to build a financial safety net against unexpected expenses or potential loss of income.\n\n2. Inflation: Prices for goods and services continue to rise. Saving money today will help mitigate the impact of inflation on future purchasing power.\n\n3. Debt: High levels of personal debt, particularly from student loans and credit card debt, can make it difficult for individuals to save. Paying down debt and focusing on savings is crucial.\n\n4. Retirement: With people living longer and relying on their own savings for retirement, it's essential to save more for the future.\n\n5. Economic instability: Economic instability and fluctuations can lead to financial hardships. Saving money can provide a sense of security and help individuals weather financial storms.\n\nIn summary, the repeated emphasis on saving money in the current economy is due to the uncertainty, inflation, debt, retirement needs, and overall economic instability of the times."}

It's a bit overkill for 'retirement', but Yale has a free online course in Financial Markets. It's very light on math, but does a good job establishing jargon and its history. It covers most of the things you'd buy or sell in financial markets, and is presented by Nobel Prize winner Robert Schiller. This particular series was filmed in 2007, so it also offers a good historical perspective of the start of the subprime collapse. There's a number of high profile guest speakers as well. I would encourage you to think critically about their speeches though. If you research what's happened to them after that lecture, it's quite entertaining: one IPO'd a 'private equity' firm that underperformed the market as a whole, another hedge fund manager bought an airline with a partner firm that was arrested for running a ponzi scheme six months later.

{"question": "what is shareholders' Equity in balance sheets?", "human": "Shareholder's Equity consists of two main things: The initial capitalization of the company (when the shares were first sold, plus extra share issues) and retained earnings, which is the amount of money the company has made over and above capitalization, which has not been re-distributed back to shareholders. So yes, it is the firm's total equity financing-- the initial capitalization is the equity that was put into the company when it was founded plus subsequent increases in equity due to share issues, and retained earnings is the increase in equity that has occurred since then which has not yet been re-distributed to shareholders (though it belongs to them, as the residual claimants). Both accounts are credited when they increase, because they represent an increase in cash, that is debited, so in order to make credits = debits they must be credits. (It doesn't mean that the company has that much cash on hand, as the cash will likely be re-invested). Shareholder's Equity is neither an asset nor a liability: it is used to purchase assets and to reduce liabilities, and is simply a measure of assets minus liabilities that is necessary to make the accounting equation balance: Since the book value of stocks doesn't change that often (because it represents the price the company sold it for, not the current value on the stock market, and would therefore only change when there were new share issues), almost all changes in total assets or in total liabilities are reflected in Retained Earnings.", "ai": " Shareholders' Equity, also known as Stockholders' Equity or Share Capital, represents the amount of money that would be returned to shareholders if all of the assets were liquidated and all debts were paid off. It is the difference between a company's total assets and its total liabilities. Shareholders' Equity is composed of capital stock issued, retained earnings, and other comprehensive income. It represents the ownership interest of common and preferred shareholders in the company."}
{"question": "why would closing price of a stock be different from different sources, and which would you take as the real price?", "human": "There is more than one exchange where stock can be traded.   For example, there is the New York Stock Exchange and the London Stock Exchange.  In fact, if you look at all the exchanges, there is essentially continuous trading 24/7 for many financial instruments (eg US government bonds). The closing price quoted in papers is usually the price at the close on the NYSE.  However, options close after that and so there is after-the-close trading in many stocks with active options, so the price at the close of options trading at CBOE is often used. The \"real\" price is always changing.  But for the purpose of discussion, using the closing price in NYSE (for NYSE listed stocks) is pretty standard and unlikely to be questioned.  Likewise, using Bloomberg's price makes sense. Using some after-hours or small market quote could lead to differences with commonly accepted numbers - until tomorrow :)", "ai": " Closing prices of a stock can differ among various sources due to the timing of when the trade is considered completed. Some sources, like major financial news outlets or exchanges, may report the closing price based on the last trade completed before the market close. Others may use an alternative method, such as the volume-weighted average price (VWAP) of trades during the last hour of trading or a simple average of closing bids. The use of different methods to calculate the closing price can result in slight variations.\n\nAs for which source to take as the real price, it ultimately depends on the specific context and information requirements of the user. If the user is interested in the official and widely accepted closing price, it is recommended to use the closing price reported by reputable financial news outlets or the exchange itself.\n\nHowever, it is also essential for investors to understand that the closing price is just one data point, and making investment decisions based solely on it could be limiting. Incorporating additional data like open, high, low, and volume prices can provide a more complete and accurate understanding of a stock's price action. Intraday data or real-time quotes may be helpful for short-term traders, while historical price data and charts can offer insights for long-term investors."}
{"question": "What to make of historical stock market volatility?", "human": "The first thing to realize is that the type of chart you saw is not appropriate for long-term comparisons.  The vertical axis uses a linear scale, where each unit occupies the same amount of space.  This is visually misleading because the relevant information at any point in the chart is \"how much is the value going up or down?\" and \"how much\" change depends on how much the value of the investment is at that moment.  For example, if you buy something at $10 and the price changes $1, that is significant, 10%.  If you buy something at $1000 and the price changes $1, that is not so significant, only 0.1%.  The problem in that chart is that 100 Dow points occupy the same space whether the Dow is at 870 or 10800. To get a better feel for the volatility, you should use a log (logarithmic) scale.  Google has an option for this.  Using it shows:   In this chart you can see that the volatility appears much less extreme in recent years.  True, the 2006-2009 change is the largest drop, and there might be slightly higher volatility generally, but it is not nearly as extreme-looking.  The drops in 1974 and 1987 can be seen to be significant.", "ai": " Historical stock market volatility refers to the price swings or fluctuations that have occurred in the past in stock markets. It is a normal and expected part of investing in stocks, as markets are influenced by various economic, political, and other factors that can cause prices to rise or fall.\n\nVolatility can be measured by statistical methods, such as the standard deviation of daily returns, which quantifies the amount of variation or dispersion of returns. High volatility indicates larger swings in stock prices, both up and down.\n\nHistorically, stock markets have gone through periods of increased and decreased volatility. For example, the stock market during the tech boom in the late 1990s was characterized by high volatility, as stock prices fluctuated widely from day to day. On the other hand, during periods of stable economic growth and low inflation, such as the 1960s and 1970s, stock market volatility was relatively low.\n\nInvestors should be aware of historical stock market volatility but not be unduly alarmed by it. While volatility can lead to short-term losses, it also presents opportunities for gains. Historically, stock markets have tended to recover from corrections and bear markets, and have delivered strong returns for long-term investors. Diversifying a portfolio across different asset classes and sectors can help reduce the impact of stock market volatility."}
{"question": "What is a bull put spread?", "human": "Bull means the investor is betting on a rising market. Puts are a type of stock option where the seller of a put option promises to buy 100 shares of stock from the buyer of the put option at a pre-agreed price called the strike price on any day before expiration day.  The buyer of the put option does not have to sell (it is optional, thats why it is called buying an option).  However, the seller of the put is required to make good on their promise to the buyer. The broker can require the seller of the put option to have a deposit, called margin, to help make sure that they can make good on the promise.   Profit... The buyer can profit from the put option if the stock price moves down substantially.   The buyer of the put option does not need to own the stock, he can sell the option to someone else.  If the buyer of the put option also owns the stock, the put option can be thought of like an insurance policy on the value of the stock.  The seller of the put option profits if the stock price stays the same or rises.  Basically, the seller comes out best if they can sell put options that no one ends up using by expiration day. A spread is an investment consisting of buying one option and selling another. Let's put bull and put and spread together with an example from Apple. So, if you believed Apple Inc. AAPL (currently 595.32) was going up or staying the same through JAN you could sell the 600 JAN put and buy the 550 put.  If the price rises beyond 600, your profit would be the difference in price of the puts.  Let's explore this a little deeper (prices from google finance 31 Oct 2012): Worst Case:  AAPL drops below 550.  The bull put spread investor owes (600-550)x100 shares = $5000 in JAN but received $2,035 for taking this risk. EDIT 2016: The \"worst case\" was the outcome in this example, the AAPL stock price on options expiry Jan 18, 2013 was about $500/share. Net profit = $2,035 - $5,000 = -$2965 = LOSS of $2965 Best Case:  AAPL stays above 600 on expiration day in JAN. Net Profit = $2,035 - 0 = $2035 Break Even:  If AAPL drops to 579.65, the value of the 600 JAN AAPL put sold will equal the $2,035 collected and the bull put spread investor will break even. Commissions have been ignored in this example.", "ai": " A bull put spread is an options strategy where an investor sells a near-term put option and buys a longer-term put option with the same strike price. This strategy is used when the investor expects the underlying asset's price to stay above the strike price but believes there may be volatility that could result in a short-term price drop. The strategy aims to profit from the difference in option premiums between the two contracts."}
{"question": "How do I cash in physical stock certificates? (GM 1989)", "human": "which means the current total is $548,100. Is that correct? Yep Unfortunately the \"current\" GM stock is different than the GM stock of 1989.  GM went bankrupt in 2011.  It's original stock changed to Motors Liquidation Company (MTLQQ) and is essentially worthless today.  There was no conversion from the old stock to the new stock. What do I do with these certificates? Can I bring them to my bank, or do I need to open an account with a stock company like Fidelity? See here for some instructions on cashing them in (or at least registering them electronically).  I've never dealt with physical stocks, but I presume that a broker is going to charge you something for registering them vs. direct registration, though I have no idea how much that would be. I read somewhere that I only have to pay taxes when I cash out these stocks. But are these rules any different because I inherited the stocks? You will pay capital gains tax on the increase in value from the time your father died to the time you sell the shares.  If that time is more than one year (and the stock has gone up in value) you will pay a 15% tax on the total increase.  If you have held them less than one year, they will be short-term capital gains which will count as regular income, and you will pay whatever your marginal tax rate is. If you sell the stock at a loss, then you'll be able to deduct some or all of that loss from your income, and may be able to carry forward losses for a few years as well. I did not catch that the stock you mention was GM stock.  GM went bankrupt in 2011, so it's likely that the stock you own is worthless.  I have edited the first answer appropriately but left the other two since they apply more generally.  In your case the best you get is a tax deduction for the loss in value from the date your father died.", "ai": " To cash in physical GM (General Motors) stock certificates from 1989, follow these steps:\n\n1. Gather your documents: Locate your physical stock certificates and any accompanying documents such as a letter of transfer or power of attorney, if you have previously assigned the certificates to a broker or another party.\n\n2. Contact the transfer agent: Look up the transfer agent for GM stock and contact them with the following information to initiate the sale process:\n   a. Name of certificate holder\n   b. Address\n   c. Phone number\n   d. Social Security number or taxpayer identification number\n   e. Number and type of certificates being sold\n   f. Desired method of payment\n\n3. Complete required forms: The transfer agent will provide you with necessary forms to complete the sale of the stock certificates. Follow the instructions carefully and ensure that the information is accurate.\n\n4. Sign the necessary forms: All parties involved, including the transfer agent and certificate holder, must sign the forms before they can be processed.\n\n5. Return the forms: Mail the completed forms to the address provided by the transfer agent. The agent will then process the sale of your GM stock and issue payment according to your chosen method. Please note that selling stock certificates may incur processing fees that will be deducted from the proceeds.\n\n6. Monitor your account: Keep track of your brokerage account or receiving banking information to ensure that the proceeds of the sale have been credited appropriately. If you don't have a brokerage account or bank, the transfer agent may require you to open one before releasing the funds.\n\n7. Keep records: Keep a copy of the documents related to the sale of your stock certificates, including any necessary receipts, confirmations, and the completed forms, for your records."}
{"question": "Company A is buying company B, what happens to the stock?", "human": "I think the correct statement is that Expedia wants to buy Orbitz for $12/share. The market price is $11, which means there is somebody willing to sell for that price. But you can't say that a stock price of $11 means that everybody is willing to sell for that price. And Expedia is unlikely to bid $12/share for just 40% of Orbitz shares; they'll want at least a controlling majority.", "ai": " When Company A announces its intention to buy Company B, the stocks of both companies are typically affected. Here's what generally happens:\n\n1. Company B's stock price may experience a significant increase in value leading up to the announcement due to takeover speculation. Shareholders may buy Company B's stock in expectation of a premium price they will receive upon acquisition.\n\n2. After the announcement, Company B's stock price will usually be traded at the agreed purchase price, if it is an all-cash deal. If it's a stock-for-stock merger, then the price will be determined by the exchange ratio.\n\n3. Company A's stock price may experience a short-term decrease as investors may view the acquisition as a potential use of resources and a shift in focus. However, long term, the acquisition may positively impact Company A's stock price as it brings new opportunities, synergy benefits, and increased scale to the combined entity.\n\n4. For shareholders of both companies, the acquisition means that they will have an ownership interest in the combined entity. If the acquisition is a friendly transaction, the shareholders of Company B will receive the agreed price/exchange ratio and become shareholders of Company A. If it is an hostile takeover, Company B's shareholders may not have a choice but to accept the offer or sell their shares in the open market.\n\n5. Overall, the outcome for the stock prices depends on various factors, including the size and structure of the deal, the financial position of both companies, and the overall market conditions."}
{"question": "How can I buy an ETF?", "human": "First of all, you'll need a securities account. Nowadays, most large banks offer this as a standard product for all their customers, though it may require some extra paperwork. Then you need to buy shares in the ETF. This is indeed typically done through the stock market, but there are alternatives. Some banks will sell securities to you directly, but usually only those they create themselves (options and such). Some also offer ETF investment plans that allow you to buy shares for a fixed amount each month through the bank. In any case, the bank's online banking interface should support all these options. However, fees are an important consideration! With some banks, the securities account is free, others charge an annual fee. And the fees on stock market transactions and investment plans also vary considerably, so it could be worth it to consider some alternatives.", "ai": " To buy an Exchange-Traded Fund (ETF), follow these steps:\n\n1. Open a brokerage account: If you don't already have one, you'll need to open a brokerage account with a firm that offers the ETF you're interested in buying.\n2. Fund your account: Transfer money from a bank account or other source into your brokerage account.\n3. Place an order: Use the brokerage platform or mobile app to search for the ETF you want to buy. Enter the ticker symbol, the number of shares you want to purchase, and the type of order (market or limit). Click \"Buy\" to execute the order.\n\nAdditional tips:\n- Consider the fees associated with buying and holding the ETF in your brokerage account.\n- Research the ETF's holdings, past performance, and other relevant information before making a purchase.\n- Determine your budget and investment goals before deciding on an ETF to buy.\n- Consider using a limit order to buy the ETF at a specific price, rather than at the current market price."}
{"question": "UK companies house - what can I glean from an abbreviated balance sheet?", "human": "What this abbreviated balance sheet tells you is that this company has negative equity.  The liabilities are greater than the value of the assets.  The obvious problem for the company who wants to do business with you is that they are going to have a real hard time accessing credit to pay off any debts that they incur with doing business with you.  In this case, the recommended course would be to ask them put cash up front instead of putting them on account. You don't really need to look at the income statement to see that they are currently underwater.  If their income statement turns out to be splendid, then you can wait for them to get their liabilities under control before you set up an account for them.", "ai": " From an abbreviated balance sheet filed with the UK Companies House, you can glean the following key financial information:\n\n1. Assets: total assets, current assets (cash, inventories, accounts receivable, prepaid expenses), and non-current assets (property, plant, equipment, intangible assets).\n2. Liabilities and equity: total liabilities, current liabilities (accounts payable, accrued expenses, short-term loans), and equity (share capital, retained earnings).\n3. Net assets (or net worth): calculates as total assets minus total liabilities, which indicates the company's net worth or equity position.\n4. Current and acid-test ratios: These ratios, also known as quick ratios, provide an indication of a company's short-term liquidity.\n5. Solvency ratio: calculates as total assets divided by total liabilities, which shows the company's ability to meet its long-term obligations.\n\nThese ratios can help evaluate a company's financial position, liquidity, and ability to meet its obligations.

{"question": "Can you explain this options calls & puts quote table to me?", "human": "(Note: I am omitting the currency units.  While I strongly suspect it's US$ I don't know from the chart.  The system works the same no matter what the currency.) A call or a put is the right to sell (put) or buy (call) shares at a certain price on a certain day. This is why you see a whole range of prices.  Not all possible stock values are represented, the number of possibilities has to be kept reasonable.  In this case the choices are even units, for an expensive stock they may be spaced even farther apart than this. The top of the chart says it's for June.  It's actually the third Friday in the month, June 15th in this case.  Thus these are bets on how the stock will move in the next 10 days. While the numbers are per share you can only trade options in lots of 100. The left side of the chart shows calls.  Suppose you sell a call at 19 (the top of the chart)  The last such trade would have gotten you a premium of 9.70 per share (the flip side of this is when the third friday rolls around it will most likely be exercised and they'll be paying you only 19 a share for a stock now trading at something over 26.)  Note the volume, bid and ask columns though--you're not going to get 9.70 for such a call as there is no buyer.  The most anybody is offering at present is 7.80 a share. Now, lets look farther down in the chart--say, a strike price of 30.  The last trade was only .10--people think it's very unlikely that FB will rise above 30 to make this option worthwhile and thus you get very little for being willing to sell at that price.  If FB stays at 26 the option will expire worthless and go away.  If it's up to 31 when the 15th rolls around they'll exercise the option, take your shares and pay you 30 for them.  Note that you already gave permission for the trade by selling the call, you can't back out later if it becomes a bad deal. Going over to the other side of the chart with the puts: Here the transaction goes the other way, come the 15th they have the option of selling you the shares for the strike price.  Lets look at the same values we did before.  19?  There's no trading, you can't do it. 30?  Here you will collect 3.20 for selling the put.  Come the 15th they have the right to sell you the stock for 30 a share.  If it's still 26 they're certainly going to do so, but if it's up to 31 it's worthless and you pocket the 3.20 Note that you will normally not be allowed to sell a call if you don't own the shares in question.  This is a safety measure as the risk in selling a call without the stock is infinite.  If the stock somehow zoomed up to 10,000 when the 15th rolls around you would have to come up with the shares and the only way you could get them is buy them on the open market--you would have to come up with a million dollars.  If there simply aren't enough shares available to cover the calls the result is catastrophic--whoever owns the shares simply gets to dictate terms to you.  (And in the days of old this sometimes happened.)", "ai": " Sure, I'll do my best to explain the options quotes table with minimal unnecessary content.\n\nAn options quotes table displays the bid and ask prices for buying and selling options contracts.

{"question": "File bankruptcy, consolidate, or other options?", "human": "Tough spot. I'm guessing the credit cards are a personal line of credit in their name and not the company's (the fact that the business can be liquidated separately from your parents means they did at least set up an LLC or similar business entity). Using personal debt to save a company that could have just been dissolved at little cost to their personal credit and finances was, indeed, a very bad move. The best possible end to this scenario for you and your parents would be if your parents could get the debt transferred to the LLC before dissolving it. At this point, with the company in such a long-standing negative situation, I would doubt that any creditor would give the business a loan (which was probably why your parents threw their own good money after bad with personal CCs). They might, in the right circumstances, be able to convince a judge to effectively transfer the debt to the corporate entity before liquidating it. That puts the debt where it should have been in the first place, and the CC companies will have to get in line. That means, in turn, that the card issuers will fight any such motion or decision tooth and nail, as long as there's any other option that gives them more hope of recovering their money. Your parents' only prayer for this to happen is if the CCs were used for the sole purpose of business expenses. If they were living off the CCs as well as using them to pay business debts, a judge, best-case, would only relieve the debts directly related to keeping the business afloat, and they'd be on the hook for what they had been living on. Bankruptcy is definitely an option. They will \"re-affirm\" their commitment to paying the mortgage and any other debts they can, and under a Chapter 13 the judge will then remand negotiations over what total portion of each card's balance is paid, over what time, and at what rate, to a mediator. Chapter 13 bankruptcy is the less damaging form to your parent's credit; they are at least attempting to make good on the debt.  A Chapter 7 would wipe it away completely, but your parents would have to prove that they cannot pay the debt, by any means, and have no hope of ever paying the debt by any means. If they have any retirement savings, anything in their name for grandchildren's college funds, etc, the judge and CC issuers will point to it like a bird dog. Apart from that, their house is safe due to Florida's \"homestead\" laws, but furniture, appliances, clothing, jewelry, cars and other vehicles, pretty much anything of value that your parents cannot defend as being necessary for life, health, or the performance of whatever jobs they end up taking to dig themselves out of this, are all subject to seizure and auction. They may end up just selling the house anyway because it's too big for what they have left (or will ever have again). I do not, under any circumstance, recommend you putting your own finances at risk in this. You may gift money to help, or provide them a place to live while they get back on their feet, but do not \"give till it hurts\" for this. It sounds heartless, but if you remove your safety net to save your parents, then what happens if you need it? Your parents aren't going to be able to bail you out, and as a contractor, if you're effectively \"doing business as\" Reverend Gonzo Contracting, you don't have the debt shield your parents had. It looks like housing's faltering again due to the news that the Fed's going to start backing off; you could need that money to weather a \"double-dip\" in the housing sector over the next few months, and you may need it soon.", "ai": " If you're considering options for managing significant debt, here are some possible solutions:\n\n1. File Bankruptcy: Bankruptcy is a legal process that can help eliminate or reduce certain types of debt. There are two main types of consumer bankruptcy: Chapter 7 and Chapter 13. Chapter 7 bankruptcy involves liquidating your assets to pay off debts, while Chapter 13 bankruptcy involves creating a repayment plan for your debts. Bankruptcy can provide a fresh financial start, but it has long-term consequences, such as a negative impact on your credit score, and may not be an option for everyone.\n2. Debt Consolidation: Debt consolidation involves taking out a single loan to pay off multiple debts. The goal is to simplify your payments and potentially lower your overall interest rate. To qualify, you usually need a good credit score and steady income. This option can be a good choice for people who have a manageable amount of debt and the ability to make regular payments on time.\n3. Other Options: There are other ways to manage debt, such as negotiating with creditors for lower interest rates or payment plans, using a debt management plan through a nonprofit credit counseling agency, or even selling assets to pay off debts. These options may not be as drastic as bankruptcy or consolidation, but they can still be effective in reducing debt and improving financial situations.\n\nUltimately, the best option depends on your specific situation, including the amount and type of debt, your income, and your credit history. It's important to carefully evaluate each option and consider the potential risks and benefits before making a decision. You may want to consult with a financial advisor or credit counselor to help determine the best course of action for your unique situation."}
{"question": "Lend money at a rate linked to the prime rate", "human": "Yes.  In the US these are called certificates of deposit or savings accounts.  Every run-of-the-mill bank offers them.  You give the bank money and in return they pay you an interest rate that is some fraction of or (negative) offset from the returns they expect to make from your money. Since most investments that a bank makes (say, loaning money to a local business) are themselves based on some multiple of or (positive) offset from the prime rate, in return the interest rate that they offer you is also mathematically based on the prime rate. You can find lists of banks offering the best returns on CDs or savings accounts at sites like BankRate.", "ai": " Lending money at a rate linked to the prime rate means setting the interest rate for a loan based on the prime rate, which is the interest rate that banks charge their most creditworthy customers for short-term loans. This is a common practice in the financial industry, as the prime rate is an indicator of the general level of interest rates in the economy. When you lend money at a variable rate linked to the prime rate, the interest rate on the loan will fluctuate based on changes to the prime rate. This can benefit borrowers if interest rates are falling, but it can also result in higher payments if rates rise."}
{"question": "Why do stock prices change? [duplicate]", "human": "In addition to D. Stanley's very fine answer, the price of stocks change as a result of changing market conditions and the resulting investor estimation of its effect on the company's future earnings. Take these examples. Right now, in the USA, there is a housing shortage; that is, there are fewer houses available for purchase than there are willing buyers. Investors will correctly assume that the future earnings of home builders will be higher than they were, say ten years ago. Seeking to capitalize on these higher earnings, they will try to buy the stocks. However, the current owners of the stock, potentially the sellers, know the same thing as the investor-buyer and therefore demand a premium to entice a sale. The price of the stock has risen. The reverse is true, also. Brick and mortar retailers are declining as more consumers prefer on-line retail shopping. The current owners of these stocks will probably want to sell their stock before it is worth even less. The investor-buyer also knows the same facts; that future earnings will most likely be less for these companies. The potential buyer offers a very low price to entice a sale. The price of the stock has fallen. Finally, the price of stocks rise and fall with general market conditions. As an example, assume that next months jobs report is released showing that 350,000 new jobs were created in July. Investors will believe that if companies are hiring, then the companies are doing well; they are selling products and services at a higher than expected rate, requiring that they add new employees. They will also conclude that those 350,000 new employees will be spending their salaries to buy not just food, clothing and shelter, but also a few luxuries like a newer car, a TV, perhaps even a new home (please see paragraph 2!). All of these companies will have more business, more earnings and, likely, a higher stock price.", "ai": " Stock prices change primarily based on the supply and demand dynamics in the market. Factors influencing supply and demand include:\n\n1. Earnings reports and profitability: Companies releasing strong or weak earnings can significantly impact the demand for their stock.\n2. Economic indicators: Data releases related to employment, inflation, and GDP growth can influence investor sentiment and thus stock prices.\n3. Interest rates: Changes in interest rates set by central banks affect the cost of borrowing and the relative attractiveness of stocks versus bonds.\n4. Market sentiment: The overall mood or feeling among investors about the stock market and specific sectors or companies can drive stock prices.\n5. Company news: Announcements about mergers, acquisitions, product launches, or executive changes can cause stock prices to move.\n\nThese factors are continually influencing the market and leading to price changes for individual stocks."}
{"question": "Does a growing economy mean the economy is becoming less efficient?", "human": "A growing economy should become more efficient because of increased opportunity for division of labor: specialization. External regulation or monetary policy external to the free market can cause parts of the economy to grow in response to said regulations.  This creates inefficiencies that are wrung out of the economy after the policies reverse.  A couple of examples: Tinkering with the economy causes the inefficiencies.", "ai": " No, a growing economy does not necessarily mean that it is becoming less efficient. In fact, economic growth can be a sign of increasing efficiency, as resources are being used more productively to produce greater output. However, it's important to note that economic growth doesn't always equate to sustainable or efficient growth. Unchecked growth can lead to inefficiencies, resource depletion, and environmental challenges. Additionally, growth rates can vary greatly, and high growth rates can sometimes indicate unsustainable or speculative bubbles. Therefore, while growth itself doesn't mean inefficiency, it's crucial to consider the underlying causes and context when evaluating the efficiency of an economy."}
{"question": "Requirements for filing business taxes?", "human": "While she can certainly get an LLC or EIN, it isn't necessarily required or needed.  She can file as a sole-proprietor on her (or your joint) taxes by filling out a schedule-C addition to the 1040.  Any income or losses will pass through to your existing income situation (from W-2's and such). The general requirement for filing as a business in this regard has nothing to do with any minimum income, revenue, or size.  It is simply the intent to treat it as a business, and unlike a hobby, the overall intent to earn a profit eventually. If you're currently reporting the 1099-MISC income, but not deducting the expenses, this would be a means for you to offset the income with the expenses you mentioned (and possibly other legitimate ones).  There is no \"2% AGI\" restriction for schedule-C.", "ai": " To file business taxes, you generally need the following:\n\n1. A valid Tax Identification Number (TIN) for your business, such as an Employer Identification Number (EIN) for US businesses.\n2. Financial records, including income, expenses, and all supporting documents.\n3. Knowledge of the tax forms required for your business type and location.\n4. Properly recorded financial transactions and account balances.\n5. Payment for any taxes owed or evidence that estimated tax payments have been made throughout the year.\n6. Filing the taxes on time to avoid penalties and interest.\n7. Completion and submission of the business tax return (e.g., Form 1120 for corporations or Form 1040-Schedule C for sole proprietorships).\n8. Depending on your business, you may need to file additional forms for payroll taxes, sales taxes, or other types.\n9. Keeping accurate records to support future tax filings and audits."}
{"question": "How bad is it to have a lot of credit available but not used?", "human": "Ironically, the worst financial advice I read comes from \"bankers.\" The top dozen members here can be trusted to give better advice than the average banker.  Your score is not improved by maintaining a balance, only by using the card(s) regularly. No need to carry charges month to month and pay interest, rather, have the bill reflect a 1-9% utilization.  I'd recommend Credit Karma to see how the factors affect your score. FICO scoring prefers to see a large number of accounts, low utilization, high average account age, low number of inquiries, no late payments. CK will let you see a simulated score and how it changes based on these variables.", "ai": " Having a large amount of unused credit does not negatively impact your credit score. In fact, having available credit that is not being used can actually be beneficial because it shows creditors that you are able to manage credit responsibly. It also lowers your credit utilization ratio, which is a factor in credit scoring calculations. However, it's important to keep in mind that having unused credit can also mean missing out on potential rewards or benefits associated with using your credit cards."}
{"question": "How do credit card banks detect fraudulent transactions without requiring a travel advisory?", "human": "One bank is more willing to risk losses and customer hassle in exchange for lower processing costs than the other bank is. It's strictly a business decision. Regarding how they detect suspicious transactions: Patten detection based on your past usage history. I've gotten calls asking me to confirm that I just placed a large order with a company I'd never bought from before, or in a country that I haven't previously visited, or...", "ai": " Credit card banks use advanced fraud detection systems to analyze transaction data in real-time and identify suspicious activity based on various factors. These systems employ machine learning algorithms, rule-based systems, and statistical analysis to identify patterns and anomalies that may indicate fraudulent transactions. This includes monitoring for transactions that are out of the norm for the cardholder's spending history, such as unusual locations, amounts, or frequency. The banks also use geolocation data to ensure that transactions are consistent with the cardholder's typical location. These methods enable credit card banks to detect and prevent fraudulent transactions without requiring travel advisories from cardholders."}
{"question": "Main source of the shares/stocks data on the web", "human": "To expand on keshlam's answer: A direct feed does not involve a website of any kind.  Each exchange publishes its order/trade feed(s) onto a packet network where subscribers have machines listening and reacting. Let's call the moment when a trade occurs inside an exchange's matching engine \"T0\".  An exchange then publishes the specifics of that trade as above, and the moment when that information is first available to subscribers is T1.  In some cases, T1 - T0 is a few microseconds; in other (notorious) cases, it can be as much as 100 milliseconds (100,000x longer). Because it's expensive for a subscriber to run a machine on each exchange's network -- and also because it requires a team of engineers devoted to understanding each exchange's individual publication protocols -- it seems unlikely that Google pays for direct access.  Instead Google most likely pays another company who is a subscriber on each exchange around the world (let's say Reuters) to forward their incoming information to Google.  Reuters then charges Google and other customers according to how fast the customer wants the forwarded information.  Reuters has to parse the info it gets at T1, check it for errors, and translate it into a format that Google (and other customers) can understand.  Let's say they finish all that work and put their new packets on the internet at time T2. Then the slow crawl across the internet begins.  Some 5-100 milliseconds later your website of choice gets its pre-processed data at time T3.  Even though it's preprocessed, your favorite website has to unpack the data, store it in some sort of database, and push it onto their website at time T4. A sophisticated website might then force a refresh of your browser at time T4 to show you the new information.  But this forced refresh involves yet another slow crawl across the internet from where your website is based to your home computer, competing with your neighbor's 24/7 Netflix stream, etc.  Then your browser (with its 83 plugins and banner ads everywhere) has to refresh, and you finally see the update at T5. So, a thousand factors come into play, but even assuming that Google is doing the most expensive and labor-intensive thing it can and that all the networks between you and Google and the exchange are as short as they can be, you're not going to hear about a trade -- even a massive, market-moving trade -- for anywhere from 500 milliseconds to 5 seconds after T0.  And in a more realistic world that time will be 10-30 seconds. This is what Google calls \"Realtime\" on that disclaimer page, because they feel they're getting that info to you as fast as they possibly can (for free). Meanwhile, the computers that actually subscribe to an exchange heard about the trade way back at time T1 and acted on that information in a few microseconds.  That's almost certainly before T2 and definitely way way before T3.  The market for a particular instrument could change direction 5 times before Google even shows the first trade. So if you want true realtime access, you must subscribe to the exchange feed or, as keshlam suggests, sign up with a broker that provides its own optimized market feeds to you.

{"question": "What happens to your spouse's sole proprietorship if they die?", "human": "For sure you should get a lawyer on this one, but it would seem to me that the simplest path forward would be to convert the business to a partnership where both spouses are owners, and to write a clause into the partnership agreement stipulating what happens upon death of a partner.  Such an approach really should be done with a lawyer to make sure that it's all legally sound and will stand up in court if needed.", "ai": " If a sole proprietor dies, the business does not continue to exist under the name it had when the proprietor was alive. The proprietor's assets, including the business, pass through probate and become part of their estate.

If the business assets are meant for specific beneficiaries, they may need to establish a new business entity to continue operating."}
{"question": "What happens to my stocks when broker goes bankrupt?", "human": "+1 to YosefWeiner. Let me add: Legally, technically, or at least theoretically, when you buy stock through a broker, you own the stock, not the broker. The broker is just holding it for you. If the broker goes bankrupt, that has nothing to do with the value of your stock. That said, if the broker fails to transfer your shares to another broker before ceasing operation, it could be difficult to get your assets. Suppose you take your shoes to a shoe repair shop. Before you can pick them up, the shop goes bankrupt. The shoes are still rightfully yours. If the shop owner was a nice guy he would have called you and told you to pick up your shoes before he closed the shop. But if he didn't, you may have to go through legal gyrations to get your shoes back. If as his business failed the shop owner quit caring and got sloppy about his records, you might have to prove that those shoes are yours and not someone else's, etc.", "ai": " If your broker goes bankrupt, you may lose access to your stocks and other securities held with that broker until the bankruptcy proceedings are complete. The Securities Investor Protection Corporation (SIPC) typically steps in to protect customers of failed brokerages up to a certain limit. However, there may be potential losses if the value of your assets exceeds the SIPC coverage limit. Additionally, the bankruptcy process can take a significant amount of time, during which you may not be able to buy, sell, or otherwise manage your investments. It's a good idea to diversify your investments across multiple brokerages to minimize this risk."}
{"question": "When people say 'Interest rates are at all time low!\" … Which interest rate are they actually referring to?", "human": "I would say people are generally talking about the prime lending rate. I have heard the prime lending rate defined as \"The rate that banks charge each other when they borrow money overnight.\" But it often defined as the rate at which banks lend their most creditworthy customers. That definition comes with the caveat that it is not always held to strictly. Either definition has the same idea: it's the lowest rate at which anyone could currently borrow money. The rate for many types of lending is based upon the prime rate. A variable rate loan might have an interest rate of (Prime + x). The prime rate is in turn based upon the Federal Funds Rate, which is the rate that the Fed sets manually. When the news breaks that \"the Fed is raising interest rates by a quarter of a point\"  (or similar) it is the Federal Funds Rate that they control. Lending institutions then \"fall in line\" and adjust the rates at which they lend money. So to summarize: When people refer to \"high\" or \"low\" or \"rising\" interest rates they are conceptually referring to the prime lending rate. When people talk about the Fed raising/lowering interest rates (In the U.S.) they are referring specifically to the Federal Funds Rate (which ultimately sets other lending rates).", "ai": " People commonly refer to the interest rate set by central banks, known as the benchmark short-term rate, when they say \"interest rates are at all-time low.\" This rate influences various types of loans, including mortgages, car loans, and business loans. However, it's essential to remember that other interest rates, such as savings account rates, long-term bond yields, and credit card interest rates, can also be influenced by the central bank's policy but are not precisely the same."}
{"question": "Calculating NPV for future cash inflows ", "human": "When calculating the NPV, is there anything I need to do in between the project start date outlay (Nov 2017), and the first cash inflow (July 2019). Do I need to discount the cashflow to the present, and if so, how? Yes, you need to discount every cash flow to the present time, not just the first one.   When discounting cash flows, the appropriate discount rate needs to represent the opportunity cost of the initial cash outlay.  Meaning if you were to use that money for something else, what rate of return would you expect? You could be safe and assume only a risk-free return (like 2-3%) or use the average rate of return of other investments (e.g. 10-15%). Another common approach is to use your cost of capital if you're raising funds for the project, or would instead have use the funds to pay off existing debt. Once you find a relevant discount rate, then just discount each cash flow by dividing them by e^rt, where r is the annualized discount rate (e.g. 0.10 for 10%) and t is the decimal number of years between now and the cash flow (e.g. 1.5 for 18 months)", "ai": " To calculate the Net Present Value (NPV) of future cash inflows, follow these steps:\n\n1. Identify the initial investment amount (Cash Outflow at time 0)\n2. Determine the cash inflows and their corresponding time periods\n3. Calculate the present value of each cash inflow using an appropriate discount rate\n4. Sum up the present values of all cash inflows\n5. Subtract the initial investment amount from the sum\n\nThe result will be the Net Present Value of the future cash inflows."}
{"question": "What does “Yield Curve” mean?", "human": "Yield is the term used to describe how much income the bond will generate if the bond was purchased at a particular moment in time. If I pay $100 for a one year, $100 par value bond that pays 5% interest then the bond yields 5% since I will receive $5 from a $100 investment if I held the bond to maturity. If I pay $90 for the same one year bond then the bond yields 17% since I will receive $15 from a $90 investment if I held the bond to maturity. There are many factors that affect what yield creditors will accept: It is the last bullet that ultimately determines yield.  The other factors feed into the creditor’s desire to hold money today versus receiving money in the future.  I desire money in my hand more than a promise to receive money in the future.  In order to entice me to lend my money someone must offer me an incentive.  Thus, they must offer me more money in the future in order for me to part with money I have. A yield curve is a snapshot of the yields for different loan durations.  The x-axis is the amount of time left on the bond while the y-axis is the yield.  The most cited yield curve is the US treasury curve which displays the yields for loans to the US government.  The yield curve changes while bonds are being traded thus it is always a snapshot of a particular moment in time. Short term loans typically have less yield than longer term loans since there is less uncertainty about the near future. Yield curves will flatten or slightly invert when creditors desire to keep their money instead of loaning it out.  This can occur because of a sudden disruption in the market that causes uncertainty about the future which leads to an increase in the demand for cash on hand. The US government yield curve should be looked at with some reservation however since there is a very large creditor to the US government that has the ability to loan the government an unlimited amount of funds.", "ai": " A yield curve is a graphical representation of the interest rates of bonds with different maturities issued by the same entity, typically a government or central bank. The curve shows how the yield (or interest rate) changes for bonds with varying terms to maturity, usually ranging from short-term to long-term. An upward-sloping yield curve indicates that longer-term bonds have higher yields than shorter-term bonds, which is also referred to as normal or positive yield curve. Conversely, a downward-sloping yield curve indicates that shorter-term bonds have higher yields than longer-term bonds, which is called an inverted yield curve. The shape and position of the yield curve can provide important insights into the economic outlook and monetary policy."}
{"question": "What is the difference between a stock and a bond?", "human": "In a sentence, stocks are a share of equity in the company, while bonds are a share of credit to the company. When you buy one share of stock, you own a (typically infinitesimal) percentage of the company. You are usually entitled to a share of the profits of that company, and/or to participate in the business decisions of that company. A particular type of stock may or may not pay dividends, which is the primary way companies share profits with their stockholders (the other way is simply by increasing the company's share value by being successful and thus desirable to investors). A stock also may or may not allow you to vote on company business; you may hear about companies buying 20% or 30% \"interests\" in other companies; they own that percentage of the company, and their vote on company matters is given that same weight in the total voting pool. Typically, a company offers two levels of stocks: \"Common\" stock usually has voting rights attached, and may pay dividends. \"Preferred\" stock usually gives up the voting rights, but pays a higher dividend percentage (maybe double or triple that of common stock) and may have payment guarantees (if a promised dividend is missed in one quarter and then paid in the next, the preferred stockholders get their dividend for the past and present quarters before the common shareholders see a penny). Governments and non-profits are typically prohibited from selling their equity; if a government sold stock it would basically be taxing everyone and then paying back stockholders, while non-profit organizations have no profits to pay out as dividends. Bonds, on the other hand, are a slice of the company's debt load. Think of bonds as kind of like a corporate credit card. When a company needs a lot of cash, it will sell bonds. A single bond may be worth $10, $100, or $1000, depending on the investor market being targeted. This is the amount the company will pay the bondholder at the end of the term of the bond. These bonds are bought by investors on the open market for less than their face value, and the company uses the cash it raises for whatever purpose it wants, before paying off the bondholders at term's end (usually by paying each bond at face value using money from a new package of bonds, in effect \"rolling over\" the debt to the next cycle, similar to you carrying a balance on your credit card). The difference between the cost and payoff is the \"interest charge\" on this slice of the loan, and can be expressed as a percentage of the purchase price over the remaining term of the bond, as its \"yield\" or \"APY\". For example, a bond worth $100 that was sold on Jan 1 for $85 and is due to be paid on Dec 31 of the same year has an APY of (15/85*100) = 17.65%. Typically, yields for highly-rated companies are more like 4-6%; a bond that would yield 17% is very risky and indicates a very low bond rating, so-called \"junk status\".", "ai": " A stock represents ownership in a corporation, providing the holder with potential profits through capital appreciation and dividends. A bond is a debt security, which means the holder lends money to an entity (often a government or corporation) that borrows the funds, earning a return through regular interest payments and potentially the return of the borrowed principal upon maturity. In essence, stocks offer a share in the future earnings potential and risks of a company, while bonds provide fixed income with the risk being mostly limited to the creditworthiness of the borrower."}
{"question": "Can I transfer money from a personal pension to a SIPP, while leaving the original pension open?", "human": "Yes it's entirely possible; see below.  If you can't find anything on transfers out (partial or otherwise) on anyone's site it's because they don't want to give anyone ideas. I have successfully done exactly what you're proposing earlier this year, transferring most of the value from my employer's group personal pension scheme - also Aviva! - to a much lower-cost SIPP.  The lack of any sign of movement by Aviva to post-RDR \"clean priced\" charge-levels on funds was the final straw for me.  My only regret is that I didn't do it sooner!  Transfer paperwork was initiated from the SIPP end but I was careful to make clear to HR people and Aviva's rep (or whatever group-scheme/employee benefits middleman organization he was from) that I was not exiting the company scheme and expected my employee and matching employer contributions to continue unchanged (and that I'd not be happy if some admin mess up led to me missing a month's contributions). There's a bit more on the affair in a thread here.  Aviva's rep did seem to need a bit of a prod to finally get it to happen.  With hindsight my original hope of an in-specie transfer does seem naive, but the out-of-the-market time was shorter and less scary than anticipated. Just in case you're unaware of it, Monevator's online broker list is an excellent resource to help decide who you might use for a SIPP; cheapest choice depends on level of funds and what you're likely to hold in it and how often you'll trade.", "ai": " Yes, you can transfer funds from a personal pension to a Self-Invested Personal Pension (SIPP) while keeping the original pension open. This process is commonly referred to as a pension transfer or a pension roll-up. When you make this transfer, you are moving the funds from one pension provider to another, while retaining the tax advantages of a pension scheme. Your original pension will remain open and can continue to grow or be accessed according to its terms. However, it's important to note that pension transfers may come with potential tax implications and other considerations, and should be carefully reviewed with a financial advisor before making a decision."}
{"question": "Would it make sense to sell a stock, then repurchase it for tax purposes?", "human": "What you're talking about is called \"tax gain harvesting,\" and it is considered good tax management. From The Oblivious Investor, investors in the 10% or 15% bracket pay 0% tax on long-term capital gains. For an interesting take on never paying income taxes again, check out Go Curry Cracker. You can claim up to $70,000 or so in capital gains before paying any taxes if you are the 10% or 15% tax bracket.", "ai": " Yes, selling and immediately buying back the same stock in a process called tax-loss harvesting can help reduce tax liabilities, especially in taxable accounts. This strategy is used to realize losses to offset capital gains. However, there are regulations like the \"wash sale rule\" that may disallow or delay the tax benefit if the transaction is not carried out with sufficient time between the sale and repurchase. Furthermore, there could be transaction costs, such as brokerage fees, to consider. Always consult a tax professional or financial advisor before making any tax-related decisions."}
{"question": "Is CFD a viable option for long-term trading?", "human": "Yes it is viable but uncommon. As with everything to do with investment, you have to know what you are doing and must have a plan. I have been successful with long term trading of CFDs for about 4 years now. It is true that the cost of financing to hold positions long term cuts into profits but so do the spreads when you trade frequently. What I have found works well for me is maintaining a portfolio that is low volatility, (e.g. picking a mix of positions that are negatively correlated) has a good sharpe ratio, sound fundamentals (i.e. co-integrated assets - or at least fairly stable correlations) then leveraging a modest amount.", "ai": " Yes, Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) can be a viable option for certain types of long-term trading, particularly in the commodities market where the price movements are heavily influenced by physical processes and environmental conditions that can be modeled using CFD simulations.

{"question": "Mortgage interest income tax deduction during year with a principal residence change", "human": "Very simple. If it wasn't rented, it's deductible as a schedule A home mortgage interest. If it was rented, you go into Schedule E land, still a deduction along with any/every expense incurred.", "ai": " If you sold your principal residence during the tax year and made a profit, you may be required to pay capital gains tax on the profit. However, you may be able to deduct mortgage interest that you paid on the old and new residences during the year of the sale, subject to certain limits.\n\nUnder the tax laws (as of 2021), you can deduct mortgage interest on up to $750,000 of acquired mortgage debt ($375,000 if married filing separately) for your primary and secondary residences combined. This limit applies to mortgage debt incurred after December 15, 2017.\n\nTo take advantage of the mortgage interest deduction, you should report the mortgage interest you paid on both the old and new residences on your tax return using Form 1040, Schedule A (Form 1040-SR for taxpayers age 65 or older).\n\nWhen calculating the mortgage interest deduction for the year of the sale, you need to consider the following:\n\n1. Mortgage interest paid on the old residence: You can only deduct the mortgage interest you paid on the old residence up to the mortgage debt limit for the year of the sale. Any remaining mortgage interest will not be deductible.\n2. Mortgage interest paid on the new residence: You can deduct the mortgage interest you paid on the new residence without any limitation, as long as the mortgage debt does not exceed the new mortgage debt limit of $750,000 or $375,000 if married filing separately.\n3. Prorated mortgage interest: To determine the portion of mortgage interest that applies to the year of sale for the old residence, you must prorate the interest paid according to the number of days you owned and occupied the property during the tax year.\n4. Capital gains exclusion: You might be able to exclude up to $250,000 of capital gains ($500,000 for married filing jointly) if you meet specific requirements, such as using the property as your principal residence for at least 2 of the 5 years before the sale.\n\nIt is recommended that you consult a tax professional or the IRS publications to ensure that you properly report your mortgage interest deduction and apply the appropriate rules for your situation."}
{"question": "Equity or alternative compensation in an LLC?", "human": "I'm not sure 1099-MISC is what you should expect. Equity means ownership, and in LLC context it means membership. As an LLC member, you'll get distributions and should receive a K-1 form for tax treatment, not 1099 or W2. If the CEO is talking about 1099 it means he's going to hire you as a contractor which contradicts the statement about equity allocation. That's an entirely different situation. 1) Specifically, would the 1099-MISC form be used in this case? 1099-MISC is used to describe various payments. Depending on which box is filled, the tax treatment may be as of employment income (subject to SE taxes) or passive income (royalties, rents, etc - subject to various limitations in the tax code). 3) If this is the only logical method of compensation (receiving a % of real estate sales), how would it be taxed? That would probably be a commission and taxed as employment income. I suggest to get a professional tax adviser consultation on this issue, with specific details, numbers, and kinds of deals involved. You can get gain or lose a lot of money just because you're characterized as a contractor and not LLC member or employee (each has its own benefits and disadvantages, and you have to consider them all). 4) Are there any advantages/disadvantages to acquiring and selling   properties through the company as opposed to receiving a % of sales? Yes. There are advantages and there are disadvantages. For example, if you're using a corporation, you can get salary, if you're a contractor you cannot. There are a lot of issues hidden in this distinction (which I've just discussed with KeithS in this argument).", "ai": " In an LLC, members can receive compensation in the form of equity or distributions of profits, rather than fixed salaries. Equity refers to ownership interest in the LLC, while distributions of profits are payments of a portion of the LLC's profits to members. Alternative compensation methods in an LLC can include bonuses, profits shares, or salaries, but these are separate from equity. The choice between equity and alternative compensation methods depends on the specific needs and goals of the LLC and its members."}
{"question": "Can I use FOREX markets to exchange cash?", "human": "As far as I understand, OP seems to be literally asking: \"why, regarding the various contracts on various exchanges (CBE, etc), is it that in some cases they are 'cash settled' and in some 'physically settled' -?\" The answer is only that \"the exchange in question happens to offer it that way.\" Note that it's utterly commonplace for contracts to be settled out physically, and happens in the billions as a daily matter.  Conversely zillions in \"cash settled\" contracts play out each day.  Both are totally commonplace. Different businesses or entities or traders would use the two \"varieties\" for sundry reasons. The different exchanges offer the different varieties, ultimately I guess because they happen to think that niche will be profitable.  There's no \"galactic council\" or something that enforces which mode of settlement is available on a given offering - ! Recall that \"a given futures contracts market\" is nothing more than a product offered by a certain exchange company (just like Burger King sells different products). I believe in another aspect of the question, OP is asking basically:  \"Why is there not, a futures contract, of the mini or micro variety for extremely small amounts, of currency futures, which, is 'physically' settled rather than cash settled ..?\" If that's the question the answer is just \"whatever, nobody's done it yet\".  (Or, it may well exist.  But it seems extremely unlikely?  \"physically\" settled currencies futures are for entities operating in the zillions.) Sorry if the question was misunderstood.", "ai": " Yes, you can use the FOREX market to exchange one currency for another. FOREX stands for \"Foreign Exchange,\" and it is a decentralized market where currencies are bought and sold based on the current exchange rate. When you exchange currencies in the FOREX market, you're essentially buying one currency with another. For example, if you want to purchase goods or services in Euros, but you only have US Dollars, you can exchange your US Dollars for Euros in the FOREX market."}
{"question": "What is the rough estimate of salary value for a taxpayer to pay AMT?", "human": "Turbox Tax states the following:  \"For 2015, the AMT exemption amounts are $53,600 for individual taxpayers, $83,400 for married taxpayers filing jointly and surviving spouses, and $41,700 for married persons filing separately. This is the amount you're allowed to deduct from your taxable income before applying the AMT.\"", "ai": " The Alternative Minimum Tax (AMT) is a tax imposed on individuals, estates, and corporations in addition to the regular income tax. The exact threshold for AMT liability varies depending on the taxpayer's income, exemptions, and deductions.\n\nAs of tax year 2021, for single filers, the AMT exemption amount is $75,900, and for married filing jointly, it is $118,100. These amounts begin to phase out for taxpayers with income above certain thresholds: $536,500 for single filers and $873,300 for married filing jointly.\n\nTo get a rough estimate of the AMT payment, you first need to calculate the AMT income, which is the regular income adjusted by certain disallowed deductions like state and local taxes, certain miscellaneous deductions, and personal exemptions. If the AMT income exceeds the AMT exemption, the difference between the two is the amount of AMT liability.\n\nFor example, a single taxpayer with an income of $300,000 and tax-exempt interest income of $30,000 would have an AMT income of approximately $330,000 ($300,000 + $30,000). Based on this calculation, they would owe an AMT payment of about $23,800 ($330,000 - $75,900).\n\nPlease note that this example is just for illustration purposes, and actual calculations may differ depending on individual circumstances. It's always recommended to consult a tax professional for an accurate estimation of AMT liability."}

{"question": "Is this the right formula to use implied volatility to gauge probability of a stock being within a certain range?", "human": "To get the probability of hitting a target price you need a little more math and an assumption about the expected return of your stock.  First let's examine the parts of this expression. IV is the implied volatility of the option.  That means it's the volatility of the underlying that is associated with the observed option price.  As a practical matter, volatility is the standard deviation of returns, expressed in annualized terms.  So if the monthly standard deviation is Y, then Y*SQRT(12) is the volatility. From the above you can see that IV*SQRT(DaysToExpire/356) de-annualizes the volatility to get back to a standard deviation.  So you get an estimate of the expected standard deviation of the return between now and expiration. If you multiply this by the stock price, then you get what you have called X, which is the standard deviation of the dollars gained or lost between now and expiration.  Denote the price change by A (so that the standard deviation of A is X). Note that we seek the expression for the probability of hitting a target level, Q, so mathematically we want 1 - Pr( A < Q - StockPrice)  We do 1 minus the probability of being below this threshold because cumulative distribution functions always find the probability of being BELOW a threshold, not above. If you are using excel and assuming a mean of zero for returns, the probability of hitting or exceeding Q at expiration, then, is That's your answer for the probability of exceeding Q. Accuracy is in the eye of the beholder.  You'd have to specify a criterion by which to judge it to know the answer.  I'm sure more sophisticated methods exist that are more unbiased and have less error, but I think it's a fine first approximation.", "ai": " The Black-Scholes formula is not designed to directly gauge the probability of a stock being within a certain range. Implied volatility calculated from the Black-Scholes formula represents the market's expectation of volatility for the underlying stock based on the price of an option. It can be used as an indicator of market sentiment and potential price movements, but it does not provide a direct probability of the stock being within a certain range. For probability calculations, models like binomial or Monte Carlo simulations are more appropriate."}
{"question": "Definition of “U.S. source” for US non-resident alien capital gains tax", "human": "The examples you provide in the question are completely irrelevant. It doesn't matter where the brokerage is or where is the company you own stocks in. For a fairly standard case of an non-resident alien international student living full time in the US - your capital gains are US sourced. Let me quote the following text a couple of paragraphs down the line you quoted on the same page: Gain or loss from the sale or exchange of personal property generally   has its source in the United States if the alien has a tax home in the   United States. The key factor in determining if an individual is a   U.S. resident for purposes of the sourcing of capital gains is whether   the alien's \"tax home\" has shifted to the United States. If an alien   does not have a tax home in the United States, then the alien’s U.S.   source capital gains would be treated as foreign-source and thus   nontaxable. In general, under the \"tax home\" rules, a person who is away (or who   intends to be away) from his tax home for longer than 1 year has   shifted tax homes to his new location upon his arrival in that new   location. See Chapter 1 of Publication 463, Travel, Entertainment,   Gift, and Car Expenses I'll assume you've read this and just want an explanation on what it means. What it means is that if you move to the US for a significant period of time (expected length of 1 year or more), your tax home is assumed to have shifted to the US and the capital gains are sourced to the US from the start of your move. For example: you are a foreign diplomat, and your 4-year assignment started in May. Year-end - you're not US tax resident (diplomats exempt), but you've stayed in the US for more than 183 days, and since your assignment is longer than 1 year - your tax home is now in the US. You'll pay the 30% flat tax. Another example: You're a foreign airline pilot, coming to the US every other day flying the airline aircraft. You end up staying in the US 184 days, but your tax home hasn't shifted, nor you're a US tax resident - you don't pay the flat tax. Keep in mind, that tax treaties may alter the situation since in many cases they also cover the capital gains situation for non-residents.", "ai": " A \"U.S. source\" capital gain is the gain from the sale of a capital asset located in the United States or from the sale of a capital asset that is effectively connected with a U.S. trade or business, regardless of the alien taxpayer's residence or citizenship.

{"question": "how exactly do companies make money from warrants?", "human": "Well, they don't \"make\" money in the sense of income, but they receive money in exchange for shares of stock (more of the company is owned by the public).  The Warrant entitles the holder to purchase stock directly from the company at a fixed price.  It is very much like an open-market call option, but instead of the option holder buying stock from a third party (which does not affect the company at all), the holder buys it directly from the company, increasing the number of shares outstanding, and the proceeds go directly to the company. If the holders do not exercise the warrants, the company does not receive any cash, but they also don't issue any new shares.", "ai": " Companies issue warrants as a financial instrument, typically as a component of a securities offering or as a standalone issue. A warrant is a contract that grants the holder the right, but not the obligation, to purchase a specific number of shares of common stock or other securities of the company at a predetermined price, called the exercise price, within a specified period.\n\nWhen a company issues warrants, it sets the exercise price at a level that is higher than the current market price of its common stock. This creates an intrinsic value for the warrant, as it represents the right to buy shares at a lower price than the current market rate. The difference between the current market price of the underlying stock and the exercise price of the warrant is called the \"implied volatility\" or \"time value\" of the warrant.\n\nCompanies make money from warrants in several ways:\n\n1. Warrant Issue Premium: When a company issues warrants as part of a securities offering or in a standalone warrants transaction, it receives cash in exchange for granting the warrants to the investors. This cash inflow constitutes revenue for the company.\n\n2. Dilution: If and when the warrant holders decide to exercise their warrants and purchase the underlying shares, the company issues new shares, thereby diluting the ownership of existing shareholders. However, this dilution effect is a byproduct of the warrant issuance and does not directly generate revenue but rather impacts the share capital structure of the company.\n\n3. Cash Settlement or Early Exercise: In some cases, investors or traders may choose to exercise their warrants early or settle them in cash, usually when the implied volatility or time value of the warrants is high or expected to decrease significantly. When this happens, the company must buy back the shares at the exercise price and make a cash payment to the warrant holders. This creates a cash outflow for the company but also represents revenue recognition, as the company has effectively sold warrants and received cash upfront when issuing them.\n\n4. Increased Share Value: Another indirect way companies make money from warrants is when the implied volatility or time value of their warrants increases significantly. This usually occurs when the underlying stock price moves substantially in the direction favorable to the warrant holders. An increased implied volatility or time value can lead to higher revenue when the company eventually sells the warrants to investors or when traders or investors exercise their warrants.\n\nOverall, companies typically make money from warrants through the issuance premium and the opportunity to benefit from increased share value if the underlying stock performs well. However, there may also be costs or risks associated with issuing warrants, such as potential dilution and the obligation to buy back shares if warrants are exercised."}
{"question": "Where should I park my rainy-day / emergency fund?", "human": "Something with an FDIC guarentee, so a bank.

The beauty is that since the bank is local, you can walk in and withdraw it all during any weekday.", "ai": " A rainy-day or emergency fund is intended for unexpected expenses. It should be easily accessible with minimal fees or penalties for withdrawals. Consider placing it in a high-yield savings account or a money market account. These types of accounts typically offer higher interest rates compared to traditional savings accounts while maintaining liquidity. Some financial institutions offer online accounts that may have higher interest rates than brick-and-mortar branches.

{"question": "Responsible investing - just a marketing trick?", "human": "A share is just a part ownership of a company. If you buy a share of a green stock in the open market, you now just own  part of a green company. Just like if you buy a house, the money you paid moves to the former owner, but what you are getting is a clear asset in return that you now own. Via mutual funds/indexes this can get a little more complicated (voting rights etc tend to go to the mutual/indexing company rather than the holders of the fund), but is approximately the same thing: the fund buys assets on the open market, then holds them, buys more, or sells them on behalf of the fund investors.", "ai": " Responsible investing, also known as sustainable investing, is an investment approach that considers environmental, social, and governance (ESG) factors alongside traditional financial analysis. It is not a marketing trick, but a genuine investment strategy with a growing body of evidence supporting its financial merit. While some may view it as a niche or trendy approach, its importance is increasingly recognized by investors and institutional bodies. The idea is that integrating ESG factors into investment decisions can lead to better-informed investment decisions, potentially reducing risks and improving long-term returns.

{"question": "What to sell when your financial needs change, stocks or bonds?", "human": "You have to understand what risk is and how much risk you want to take on, and weight your portfolio accordingly.  I think your 80/20 split based on wrong assumptions is the wrong way to look at it.  It sounds like your risk appetite has changed. Risk is deviation from expected, so risk is not bad, and you can have cases where everyone would prefer the riskier asset.   If you think the roulette table is too risky, instead of betting $1, stick 50c in your pocket and you changed the payoffs from $2 or 0 to 50c or $1.50 If your risk appetite has changed - change your risk exposure.  If not, then all you are saying is I bought the wrong stuff earlier, now I should get out.", "ai": " When your financial needs change, it is essential to consider the liquidity and risk levels of different investment assets before deciding between selling stocks or bonds.\n\n1. Liquidity: If you need cash quickly, consider selling stocks as they are usually more liquid than bonds. Stocks can be bought and sold frequently through stock exchanges, allowing you to access the money faster. Bonds, particularly those with long maturities, may require more time to sell due to the existence of a secondary market.\n\n2. Risk: If you cannot afford the risk of losing your investment's value, selling bonds may be a better option, as they are generally considered less volatile than stocks. Bonds are debt securities representing a loan made by an investor to a borrower (such as a corporation or government). Their value mainly depends on the interest rate paid, credit quality of the issuer, and the bond's term.\n\n3. Market conditions: Consider the current market conditions when deciding which assets to sell. In volatile markets, stocks may be more risky and less attractive to sell. Instead, you might consider selling bonds to preserve capital. Conversely, in a bull market, stocks may be the preferred choice for those looking to raise cash as they are more likely to appreciate in value.\n\nIn conclusion, the decision to sell stocks or bonds when your financial needs change depends on several factors, including your need for liquidity, risk tolerance, and current market conditions. Weigh these factors carefully to determine which assets best fit your situation. Consulting a financial advisor can also help provide valuable insights and guidance when making this decision."}

Negotiate with the bank: You may try to negotiate with the bank for an early withdrawal or ask if they can waive the penalty. Explain your situation and ask if they can make an exception.\n3. Sell the CD: If the CD is negotiable, you may be able to sell it to someone else to get your money back. This can be done through a broker or online marketplaces that specialize in buying and selling CDs before maturity.\n4. Re-invest the CD: If the penalty is too high, you may consider re-investing the CD into a new one with a similar term but with a slightly lower interest rate. This way, you'll be able to afford the early withdrawal penalty and have another CD earning interest in the meantime.\n\nRemember that each option has its pros and cons, so it's essential to evaluate them carefully before making a decision.

The mortgage had the following impacts, The car loan (purchased shortly after the house) had the following impacts, You did not mention your payment history, but since you had an 800 prior to the house purchase, we can assume that your payment history is current (nothing late). You did not mention your credit utilization, but you want to keep your utilization low (various experts suggest 10%, 20% and 30% as thresholds).  The down payment on the house likely drained your available funds, and replacing the car may have also put stress on your funds.  And when you buy a house, often there are additional expenses that further strain budgets. My guess is that your utilization percentage has increased.  My suggestion would be to reduce your utilization ratio on your revolving accounts.  And since you have plenty of credit lines, you might want to payoff the car. Your Chase card has a good age, which helps with age of credit, and though you will find experts that say you should only have 2-4 revolving accounts (credit cards), other experience shows that having accounts with age on them is a good thing.  And having a larger number of accounts does not cause problems (unless you have higher utilization or you miss payments). You did not mention whether the Chase card has any fees or expenses, as that would be a reason to either negotiate with Chase to reduce or eliminate the fees, or to cancel the card.

And I would prefer that the dividends increase over time.", "ai": " Both dividends and share buybacks have their advantages for a public company, and the better option depends on specific financial circumstances and corporate goals. Here's a brief comparison:\n\nDividends:\n- Provides a regular cash payment to shareholders, attracting and retaining investors.\n- Signals financial strength and stability to the market.\n- Can be used as a tool to maintain or increase a stock's dividend yield, making it more competitive in comparison to peers.\n\nShare Buybacks:\n- Increases the earning per share (EPS) by decreasing the number of outstanding shares.\n- Signals confidence in the company's future growth potential and the value of its own shares.\n- Can be an effective tool to return excess cash to shareholders when there is limited reinvestment opportunities or when the stock price is undervalued.\n\nIn conclusion, neither option is universally \"better,\" as both depend on the company's current financial position, growth prospects, and investor preferences.

To be eligible: (a) you have the right of permanent residence in the UK; and (b) you are ordinarily resident in England on the first day of the   first academic year of your course; and (c) you were ordinarily resident in the UK and Islands for three years   before the first day of the first academic year of the course; and (d) if your three-year residence in the UK and Islands was at any time   mainly for the purpose of receiving full-time education, you must have   been ordinarily resident in the UK or elsewhere in the EEA and/or   Switzerland immediately prior to the three-year period of ordinary   residence in the UK and Islands. It does not matter if you were in the   EEA and/or Switzerland mainly in order to receive full-time education   during this earlier period.

The goal is to benefit from the potential price appreciation of the asset.\n\nExercise-and-sell-to-cover, also known as an exercise-and-sell or an exercise-and-offset, is the opposite of exercise-and-hold. It involves exercising a call or put option Contract and immediately selling the underlying asset in the market to cover the position. This strategy is typically used to realize a gain or limit a loss, and it can be done to close an existing position or open a new one.\n\nIn summary, exercise-and-hold is a long-term strategy used to benefit from the potential price appreciation of an underlying asset, while exercise-and-sell-to-cover is a short-term strategy used to realize a gain or limit a loss by selling the underlying asset immediately after exercising the option."}
{"question": "Are there any disadvantages of Progress Draw Mortgage?", "human": "Presumably, the inverse of the advantages? You are guaranteed the interest rate that is written on your mortgage commitment as long as the first draw happens before the rate hold expiry date (typically 120 days from application date). In most cases, it takes at least 6 months or more to build a home from the ground up. That means that you are taking a chance at what the interest rates and qualifying criteria will be several months down the road. You can normally only lock in 120 days prior to possession with a 'Completion Mortgage'. Lenders are constantly changing their guidelines and rates are predicted to increase over the coming months. That means you are much better to obtain draw mortgage financing to avoid any of these uncertainties. You will know that you have your financing in place right away before construction even starts. This is a huge peace of mind so you can relax and get ready for the big move. So thus, if interest rates are lower 6 months or a year from now, that'd be the disadvantage -- a longer lock-in period.", "ai": " Yes, there are disadvantages to a Progressive Draw Mortgage, also known as a Construction-to-Permanent Loan:\n\n1. Higher Upfront Costs: Progressive Draw Mortgages usually require larger down payments and have higher closing costs due to the two-phase financing process - construction and permanent.\n2. Interest Payments During Construction: Borrowers pay interest on the construction loan amount during the construction period, which may add to the overall cost of the loan.\n3. Stricter Underwriting: Lenders have more stringent underwriting requirements for Progressive Draw Mortgages due to the higher risk involved compared to traditional mortgages.\n4. Longer Approval Process: The application and approval process for a Progressive Draw Mortgage can be longer than a conventional mortgage because the lender needs to assess the borrower's creditworthiness, the market value of the land, and the construction plan and budget.\n5. Limited Flexibility: Progressive Draw Mortgages have specific loan criteria, limitations on the types of construction materials that can be used, and restrictions on the amount and timing of draw requests.\n6. Possibility of Contingencies: Unexpected events or contingencies during construction, such as changes in building codes or unforeseen site conditions, can lead to added costs and delays.\n7. Higher Risk of Project Failure: A Progressive Draw Mortgage has a higher risk of project failure due to the construction process and potential for cost overruns or delays.\n8. Potential for Longer Payment Terms: The loan term for the permanent financing portion of a Progressive Draw Mortgage may be longer than the average conventional mortgage term, which could lead to more interest paid over the life of the loan."}
{"question": "Split buying a house 3 ways. How do I approach this?", "human": "I would second the advice to not do this. Real estate ownership is complex to begin with, involving a constant stream of maintenance, financing, and other decisions.  It is difficult enough to do for a single individual or a family as a unit (a couple), but at least spouses are forced to compromise. Friends are not, and you can end up with long-running conflicts and impasses. Financial transactions of any kind impose tensions on relationships, and friendships are no exception. If you want your friendship to survivie, do not sacrifice it to the financial arrangement which seems like a good idea at the moment. My advice would be to steer clear, no matter how attractive on the surface the deal might look. Focus on your own individual finances and use discipline and patience to save the amount needed for acquiring a separate investment property. But it will be 100% yours, and will save tons of headache. Since you are still considering this deal, it's a great time to politely change your mind and walk away - believe me, a few minutes of inconvenience will save you years of frustration. Good luck!", "ai": " To buy a house with three people and split the cost evenly, follow these steps:\n\n1. Find a house: Begin by searching for a house that fits your collective budget and preferences. You'll need to consider factors like location, size, and desired features.\n\n2. Establish the total purchase price: Determine the total cost of the house, including the purchase price, closing costs, and any necessary home repairs or improvements.\n\n3. Determine each person's share: Divide the total cost evenly among the three buyers. This can be done by calculating each person's percentage of the overall cost. For example, if the total cost is $300,000 and there are three buyers, each would contribute $100,000.\n\n4. Draft a partnership agreement: Create a legal agreement that outlines the terms of the partnership. This should include details about each person's financial contributions, ownership shares, and responsibilities for maintaining the property.\n\n5. Make the financial contributions: Each buyer will need to make their contributing amount towards the total cost. This could be done as a lump sum payment or through a series of installments.\n\n6. Complete the purchase: Once all three buyers have made their financial contributions, you can proceed with the home purchase. You may need to provide proof of funds to the real estate agent or lender.\n\n7. Register ownership: After the purchase is complete, the property deed will need to be updated to reflect the new ownership structure. You may need to hire a lawyer to help you with the process.\n\n8. Set up a bank account: It's recommended to establish a joint bank account to manage the finances related to the house, such as mortgage payments, repairs, and maintenance expenses.\n\n9. Maintain open communication: Keep the lines of communication open between the three co-owners to avoid any misunderstandings or conflicts about finances or property maintenance.\n\n10. Review and update the agreement: Regularly review the partnership agreement and make any necessary updates as your circumstances change. This will help ensure that all parties are on the same page and avoid potential disputes."}
{"question": "Allocation between 401K/retirement accounts and taxable investments, as a young adult?", "human": "First off, great job on your finances so far. You are off on the right foot and have some sense of planning for the future.  Also, it is a great question.   First, I agree with @littleadv. Take advantage of your employer match. Do not drop your 401(k) contributions below that. Also, good job on putting your contributions into the Roth account. Second, I would ask: Are you out of debt?  If not, put all your extra income towards paying off debt, and then you can work your plan. Third, time to do some math.  What will your business look like?  How much capital would you need to get started?  Are there things you can do now on a part-time basis to start this business or prepare you to start the business? Come up with a figure, find some mutual funds that have a low beta, and back out how much money you need to save per month, so you have around that total.  Then you have a figure. e.g. Assume you need $20,000, and you find a fund that has done 8% over the past 20 years.  Then, you would need to save about $110/month to be ready to go in 10 years, or $273/month to go in about 5 years.  (It's a time value of money calculation.) The house is really a long way off, but you could do the same kind of calculation.  I feel that you think your income, and possibly locale, will change dramatically over the next few years.  It might not be bad to double what you are saving for the business, and designate one half for the house.", "ai": " As a young adult, the allocation between 401K/retirement accounts and taxable investments depends on various factors, including your current income, tax bracket, debt, and long-term financial goals. Here are some general guidelines:\n\n1. Maximize 401K contributions: Contribute enough to your 401K to get the full employer match, if available. This is essentially free money.\n\n2. Save for emergencies: Before investing, make sure you have an emergency fund with at least 3-6 months of living expenses.\n\n3. Contribute to an IRA: Consider contributing to a traditional or Roth IRA up to the annual limit ($6,000 in 2022 or $7,000 if you're 50+). A traditional IRA can provide an immediate tax deduction, while a Roth IRA can provide tax-free withdrawals in retirement.\n\n4. Taxable investments: After maximizing your retirement savings, consider investing in taxable investments such as a brokerage account. This can provide more flexibility and access to a wider range of investment options compared to retirement accounts.\n\n5. Diversify your investments: Spread your investments across different asset classes (stocks, bonds, real estate, etc.) based on your risk tolerance, time horizon, and goals.\n\n6. Periodically review and rebalance your portfolio: Regularly review your investments to ensure they're still aligned with your goals, risk tolerance, and time horizon.

{"question": "Online transaction - Money taken out late", "human": "When processing credit/debit cards there is a choice made by the company on how they want to go about doing it.  The options are Authorization/Capture and Sale. For online transactions that require the delivery of goods, companies are supposed to start by initially Authorizing the transaction.  This signals your bank to mark the funds but it does not actually transfer them.  Once the company is actually shipping the goods, they will send a Capture command that tells the bank to go ahead and transfer the funds.  There can be a time delay between the two actions.  3 days is fairly common, but longer can certainly be seen.  It normally takes a week for a gas station local to me to clear their transactions. The second one, a Sale is normally used for online transactions in which a service is immediately delivered or a Point of Sale transaction (buying something in person at a store).  This action wraps up both an Authorization and Capture into a single step. Now, not all systems have the same requirements.  It is actually fairly common for people who play online games to \"accidentally\" authorize funds to be transferred from their bank.  Processing those refunds can be fairly expensive.  However, if the company simply performs an Authorization and never issues a capture then it's as if the transaction never occurred and the costs involved to the company are much smaller (close to zero) I'd suspect they have a high degree of parents claiming their kids were never authorized to perform transactions or that fraud was involved.  If this is the case then it would be in the company's interest to authorize the transaction, apply the credits to your account then wait a few days before actually capturing the funds from the bank.   Depending upon the amount of time for the wait your bank might have silently rolled back the authorization.  When it came time for the company to capture, then they'd just reissue it as a sale. I hope that makes sense.  The point is, this is actually fairly common.  Not just for games but for a whole host of areas in which fraud might exist (like getting gas).", "ai": " If you've noticed that money was taken out of your account later than expected during an online transaction, there could be several reasons for this:\n\n1. Processing time: The transaction might still be processing, especially if it is a large or complex one. Banks and payment processors batch transactions together to save on processing fees and for efficiency.\n2. Timing of authorization and settlement: The authorization for the transaction and the actual settlement might not occur on the same day, leading to a delay in the money being withdrawn from your account.\n3. Hold on funds: Your bank may have placed a hold on the funds as a precautionary measure for certain types of transactions, such as online purchases or transfers to new recipients.\n4. Errors or technical issues: If the transaction details were entered incorrectly or the payment processor encountered technical difficulties, it could take longer for the transaction to be completed and the funds to be withdrawn from your account.\n\nIf you're concerned about the delay, you can contact your bank or the merchant to inquire about the status of the transaction. They may be able to provide you with more information and help resolve any issues. If the money was taken out without your authorization, you should report it to your bank as soon as possible to minimize potential losses."}
{"question": "Has anyone heard of Peerstreet?", "human": "(Disclosure - PeerStreet was at FinCon, a financial blogger conference I attended last month. I had the chance to briefly meet a couple people from this company. Also, I recognize a number of the names of their financial backers. This doesn't guarantee anything, of course, except the people behind the scenes are no slackers.) The same way Prosper and Lending Club have created a market for personal loans, this is a company that offers real estate loans.  The \"too good to be true\" aspect is what I'll try to address. I've disclosed in other answers that I have my Real Estate license. Earlier this year, I sold a house that was financed with a \"Hard Money\" loan. Not a bank, but a group of investors. They charged the buyer 10%. Let me state - I represented the seller, and when I found out the terms of the loan, it would have been a breach of my own moral and legal responsibility to her to do anything to kill the deal. I felt sick for days after that sale.  There are many people with little credit history who are hard workers and have saved their 20% down. For PeerStreet, 25%. The same way there's a business, local to my area, that offered a 10% loan, PeerStreet is doing something similar but in a 'crowd sourced' way. It seems to me that since they show the duration as only 6-24 months, the buyer typically manages to refinance during that time. I'm guessing that these may be people who are selling their house, but have bad timing, i.e. they need to first close on the sale to qualify to buy the new home. Or simply need the time to get their regular loan approved.  (As a final side note - I recalled the 10% story in a social setting, and more than one person responded they'd have been happy to invest their money at 6%. I could have saved the buyer 4% and gotten someone else nearly 6% more than they get on their cash.)", "ai": " Yes, PeerStreet is a real estate crowdfunding platform that allows investors to invest in institutional-quality real estate debt investments.

In terms of housing market, you could look into a Ireland REIT index, but it may not correlate well with the actual house prices you are looking for.", "ai": " The Irish housing market has experienced significant volatility in recent decades. From 1996 to 2007, housing prices increased rapidly due to a construction boom fueled by low interest rates, tax incentives, and Irish European Union membership. This period is known as the Celtic Tiger era.\n\nHowever, the housing market collapsed after the global financial crisis began in 2008. The bursting of the housing bubble led to thousands of defaults on mortgages, widespread negative equity, and massive losses for banks and investors. The average housing price collapsed by more than 50% between 2007 and 2012.\n\nSince then, housing prices in Ireland have been recovering, but they remain well below their peak levels. The Economic and Social Research Institute (ESRI) predicts that housing prices will continue to rise in the coming years, but at a slower rate than previously. The recovery in the Irish housing market is influenced by factors such as low interest rates, population growth, a shortage of homes, and increased demand from domestic and foreign buyers. However, concerns remain about the affordability of housing for first-time buyers and the sustainability of the housing market recovery in the context of broader economic and demographic trends."}

{"question": "I'm about to be offered equity by my employer. What should I expect?", "human": "The main thing is the percentage of the company represented by the shares. Number of shares is meaningless without total shares. If you compute percentage and total company value you can estimate the value of the grant. Or perhaps more useful for a startup is to multiple the percentage by some plausible \"exit\" value, such as how much the company might sell for or IPO for. Many grants expire when or soon after you leave the company if you don't \"cash out\" vested shares when you leave, this is standard, but do remember it when you leave.

Here are some key points to understand:\n\n1. Ownership: Equity represents a percentage of ownership in the company, and as an owner, you share in the company's profits and potential future gains.\n2. Stock Options: These are contracts that give you the right to buy a certain number of shares at a predetermined price (strike price) in the future. Vesting schedules may apply, which means you earn the right to exercise the option over a period of time.\n3. Valuation: The value of your equity or stock options is contingent upon the overall success and valuation of the company.\n4. Liquidity: Equity is not as liquid as cash; it may take time and effort to sell your shares or exercise your stock options in the market.\n5. Risks: Equity comes with inherent risks, such as market volatility and the company's performance in the market.\n6. Long-term commitment: Owning equity indicates a long-term commitment to the company, as you may stand to benefit significantly if the company performs well and grows in value over time.\n7. Tax implications: Consult with a tax professional for advice, but typically, there are tax consequences when receiving equity or when you eventually sell your shares or exercise your stock options.\n8. Consult with an advisor: It is important to consult with a financial advisor to fully understand the terms of the offer and the potential risks and rewards before making any decisions."}

Good luck earning $96K on ODesk.", "ai": " W-2 employees and 1099 contractors have significant tax differences due to their employment status:\n\n1. Tax Withholding: W-2 employees have taxes withheld from their paychecks by their employers. This includes income taxes, Social Security, and Medicare taxes. As a result, they may not need to make estimated tax payments if their withholding is sufficient.\n\n1099 contractors don't have taxes withheld. Instead, they're responsible for managing their own tax payments and estimating and paying their quarterly taxes. They typically pay self-employment tax (15.3%), which includes Social Security and Medicare taxes, along with income tax.\n\n2. Reporting and Filing: Since W-2 employees have their taxes withheld, they file a personal income tax return (Form 1040 or 1040-SR). They generally receive a W-2 form, listing their earnings and taxes withheld, by January 31.\n\n1099 contractors receive a Form 1099-MISC. They need to report their earnings and pay self-employment taxes ( Schedule C or C-EZ) in their annual tax return (Form 1040 or 1040-SR).\n\n3. Deductions: W-2 employees generally don't get to claim as many tax deductions as self-employed individuals. While they can itemize deductions on their tax return, there are limitations.\n\n1099 contractors can claim various business expenses to help reduce their taxable income. They report these deductions on Schedule C or C-EZ.\n\n4. Employer-provided Benefits: W-2 employees may receive various benefits, such as health insurance, retirement plans, and other benefits, which reduce their taxable compensation. However, self-employed individuals (1099 contractors) generally pay for these benefits out-of-pocket.\n\nThese are some fundamental differences in the taxes paid by W-2 employees versus 1099 contractors.

{"question": "Definition of equity", "human": "The word equity always refers to the ownership of something, whether it be a company or a home. The wikipedia article is differentiating companies by how they raised money for operations.

This tax is known as the Massachusetts Estate Tax or the Massachusetts Capital Gains Tax on Estate Transfers. The rate ranges from 0% to 16%, depending on the size of the estate. The tax is based on the difference between the fair market value of the assets and the decedent's adjusted basis in the assets. For non-residents with Massachusetts situs property, there is also a separate tax called the Massachusetts Non-Resident Capital Gains Tax. This tax applies to certain types of unrealized gains from the sale of Massachusetts real property held by non-residents.

Three factors: Now - when you normalize all of this, calculating the \"hours worked\" needed to pay for the median home, you find a nearly flat line at just over 40 or so hours of pay per month.", "ai": " Yes, real estate can be a bad investment under certain circumstances. Here are some instances when that may be the case:\n\n1. Overpriced markets: Investing in real estate in overheated markets where property prices are consistently rising faster than income or inflation can lead to negative returns. This scenario increases the risk of a market correction or bubble burst.\n2. High maintenance costs: Properties with significant maintenance requirements, such as old or poorly built structures, can lead to high ongoing costs that may not yield sufficient returns. This situation is particularly true if the property is not rented, and the owner cannot recover these expenses through tenant remuneration.\n3. Financing challenges: Obtaining financing for real estate investments can be difficult, either due to poor credit, high interest rates, or tight lending conditions. In such situations, the overall costs and challenges of maintaining the property may outweigh any potential gains.\n4. Lack of demand or low occupancy rates: In areas where demand for rental or commercial properties is low, it can be challenging to generate income from the investment. This situation can be especially problematic if the property remains vacant for extended periods, leading to significant financial losses.\n5. Economic downturns: During economic recessions or market downturns, demand for real estate can decrease, leading to dropped property values and lowered rental income. In some cases, significant losses can occur due to a combination of falling demand and the inability to refinance in a challenging economic environment.\n\nThese factors illustrate situations where investing in real estate may not be a wise decision. It's essential to carefully evaluate the specific market conditions, property features, and financing options before making any investment."}
{"question": "Equity prices during currency devaluation — Mexico 1994 ", "human": "Yes, this phenomenon is well documented.  A collapse of an economy's exchange rate is coincidented with a collapse in its equities market.    The recent calamities in Turkey, etc during 2014 had similar results. Inflation is highly correlated to valuations, and a collapse of an exchange rate is highly inflationary, so a collapse of an exchange rate is highly correlated to a collapse in valuations.", "ai": " During the Mexican peso crisis of 1994, equity prices in Mexico experienced significant volatility and declines due to the devaluation of the peso. The crisis began in December 1994 when investors began to fear that Mexico would be unable to meet its debt obligations due to economic instability and high inflation. The peso was then devalued by approximately 50% against the US dollar on December 20, 1994.\n\nEquity prices in Mexico were heavily impacted by the crisis. The IPC index, which is the main stock market index in Mexico, declined by about 44% from its peak in January 1994 to its trough in February 1995. The devaluation led to increased inflation, higher interest rates, and reduced consumer purchasing power, all of which negatively affected corporate earnings and, consequently, equity prices. However, the Mexican stock market began to recover in the second half of 1995, as the economy showed signs of stabilization and the government implemented fiscal and monetary reforms. By the end of 1996, the IPC index had regained most of the losses incurred during the crisis.\n\nIt is important to note that the Mexican peso crisis was not a unique event. Currency devaluations can often lead to significant declines in equity prices, as they can negatively impact corporate earnings and consumer purchasing power, but the extent of the impact depends on the specific economic circumstances of the country in question."}

If the wire transfer completed, then the account is not closed.

For this reason, you should be avoid any situation where you are wiring money to anyone except the intended recipient.", "ai": " If a bank no longer uses an intermediary bank for international transactions, it will conduct those transactions directly with the relevant foreign bank. This is known as a \"Direct Debits\" or \"Direct Credits\" system, and it can reduce transaction costs and processing time. However, it also increases the risk for both parties, as they will be dealing directly with each other's banks, without the intermediary bank serving as a backup in case of errors or disputes. It may also require both banks to have adequate anti-money laundering and know-your-customer protocols in place to comply with international regulations. Additionally, the banks may need to establish and maintain their own connectivity and communication channels to facilitate the transactions."}
{"question": "Why could rental costs for apartments/houses rise while buying prices can go up and down?", "human": "Economically, you would say that purchased and rented real estate are not perfect substitutes--they are largely separate markets.  Only a few people are able to easily switch from one to the other and that choice is sticky--for example, once you buy a house, prices would have to rise a lot for it to be worth it to sell it and move into an apartment. In both markets there is a supply and demand curve, but the slope of the demand curve for houses to purchase is much steeper than the demand curve for rentals. The market for new housing fluctuates rapidly because it requires a large change in housing prices to change the number of people looking to buy a house.  Most decisions to buy a house are not driven by the state of the housing market.  This describes a supply/demand graph with a very steep demand curve.  Additionally, because of the leverage provided by mortgages, the demand for houses depends critically on relatively small changes in the interest rate and availability of loans.  Thus the steep demand curve shifts all over the place as borrowing conditions change. On the other hand, apartment prices are more stable because people easily move from one apartment to another and people living in their parent's basements easily move into apartments if prices change.  A small change in the price or quantity of rentals brings about reasonable response in quantity demanded.  This is the situation where the demand curve is shallow.  In addition, rentals are not tied to interest rates tightly, nor are they as strongly tied to economic conditions (in a recession, people avoid buying but renters continue to rent).", "ai": " Rental costs for apartments or houses can rise for various reasons, even when buying prices are going down. Here are some possible causes:\n\n1. Supply and Demand: A tight housing market with high demand for rentals but a lower demand for home purchases can push up rental prices. This can occur if there's a limited supply of rental units but a larger supply of houses for sale, which results in more potential renters competing for fewer apartments or houses.\n\n2. Location and Amenities: In popular urban areas or desirable neighborhoods, there may be strong demand for rental properties due to their proximity to jobs, good schools, and other desirable features. These factors can drive up rental costs even if buying prices are decreasing.\n\n3. Operating Costs and Maintenance: Property owners and landlords need to cover their operating costs (e.g., property taxes, insurance, maintenance, repairs, and utilities) when setting rental prices. An increase in these costs can be passed on to renters, leading to higher rental prices, regardless of buying trends.\n\n4. Economic Conditions: A strong economy with low unemployment and rising wages can boost renters' income, enabling them to pay more for rent. Additionally, during a recession, some people may prefer to rent instead of buy due to uncertainty in the job market or financial circumstances.\n\n5. Government Regulations: Local rent control laws or other regulations can restrict how much landlords can increase rental prices, which can insulate landlords from declining buying prices and cause rental costs to remain stable or rise.\n\nIn summary, while buying prices can go up and down for various reasons, rental costs can be influenced by factors like supply and demand, location and amenities, operating costs, economic conditions, and government regulations."}
{"question": "Can landlord/property change unit after approval and payment of fees?", "human": "Without the specifics of the contract, as well as the specifics of the country/state/city you're moving to, it's hard to say what's legal.  But this also isn't law.se, so I'll answer this from the point of view of personal finance, and what you can/should do as next steps. Whenever paying an application fee or a deposit, you need to ensure that you have in writing exactly what you're applying for or putting a deposit in for.  Whether this is an apartment, a car, or a loan, before any money changes hands, you need to get in writing exactly what you're putting that money to. So for a car, you'd want to have the complete specifications - make, model, year, color, extra packages, and any relevant loan information if applicable.  You wouldn't just hand a dealer $2000 for \"a Toyota Camry\", you'd make sure it was specified which one, in writing, as well as the total you're expecting to pay.  Same for an apartment: you should have, in writing (email is fine) the specific unit you are putting a deposit for, and the specific rate you'll be paying, and the length of time the lease is for. This is to avoid a common tactic: bait and switch, which is what it looks like you've run into.  A company puts forth a \"nice\" model, everything looks good, you get far enough in that it seems like you're locked in - and then it turns out you're really getting a less nice model that's not as ideal as whatever you signed up for.  Now if you want to get what you originally signed up for you need to pay extra - presumably \"something was wrong in the original ad\", or something like that.  And all you can hear in the background is Darth Vader... \"I am altering the deal. Pray I don't alter it any further.\" So; what do you do when you've been bait-and-switched? The best thing to do is typically to walk away. Try to get your application fee back; you may or may not be able to, but it's worth a shot, and even if you cannot, walk away anyway. Someone who is going to bait-and-switch on you is probably not going to be a good landlord; my guess is that rent is going to keep going up beyond the level of the market, and you probably can kiss your security deposit goodbye. Second, if walking away isn't practical for whatever reason, you can find out what the local laws are. Some locations (though very few, sadly) require advertised prices to be accurate; particularly the fact that they re-advertised the unit again for the same rate suggests they are falling afoul of that. You can ask around, search the internet, or best yet talk to a lawyer who specializes in this sort of thing; some of them will be willing to at least answer a few questions for free (hoping to score your business for an easy, profitable lawsuit). Be aware that it's not exactly a good situation to be in, to be suing your landlord; second only to suing your employer, in my opinion, in terms of bad things to do while hoping to continue the relationship.  Find an alternative as soon as you can if you go this route. In the future, pay a lot of attention to detail when making application fees.  Often the application fee is needed before you get into too much detail - but pick a location that has reasonable application fees, and no extras.  For example, in my area, it's typical to pay a $25 application fee, nonrefundable, to do the credit check and background check, and a refundable $100-$200 deposit to hold the unit while doing that; a place that asks for a non-refundable deposit is somewhere I'd simply not apply at all.", "ai": " Yes, a landlord or property manager can change the unit assigned to a tenant after approval and payment of fees, as long as it is not a retaliatory action against the tenant or a violation of the lease agreement. However, any changes must provide the tenant with equivalent or better living conditions, as required by law."}
{"question": "Conservative ways to save for retirement?", "human": "Buy gold, real coins not paper. And do not keep it in a bank.", "ai": " 1. Maximize contributions to 401(k) or 403(b) plans at work: This is the most common and effective way for conservatives to save for retirement, as contributions reduce taxable income and grow tax-deferred until withdrawal. The maximum contribution limit for 2022 is $19,500, or $26,000 for those 50 and older.\n\n2. Open an IRA: Traditional and Roth Individual Retirement Accounts (IRAs) allow those who don't have access to an employer-sponsored plan to save for retirement. Traditional IRAs offer tax-deductible contributions for those under certain income limits, while Roth IRAs provide tax-free withdrawals in retirement. In 2022, the contribution limit for IRAs is $6,000 or $7,000 for those 50 and older.\n\n3. Save consistently in taxable accounts: Conservative investors may prefer saving in taxable investment accounts, such as brokerage accounts, to diversify their retirement funds and avoid unnecessary taxes. They can contribute any amount to these accounts and consider investing in dividend-paying stocks, bonds or mutual funds.\n\n4. Utilize a Health Savings Account (HSA): If eligible, contribute to an HSA to save for future healthcare expenses in retirement. Contributions are made with pre-tax income, grow tax-free and can be withdrawn tax-free for qualified medical expenses. Some HSA plans also offer investment options for those looking to grow their account balances beyond what's needed for healthcare.\n\n5. Consider fixed-income investments: Conservative investors typically look for relatively low-risk investments to preserve capital and generate a steady income stream in retirement. Fixed-income investments, such as CDs, bonds, and money market funds, can provide consistent income without significant market risk.\n\n6. Live below your means: A final, essential step in conservatively saving for retirement is to adopt a lifestyle that allows for regular savings. Controlling spending and living below your means will give you more disposable income to save and invest for the future."}
{"question": "Ideas for patenting/selling a trading strategy", "human": "If you have a great technical trading system that gets you winning trading 80-85% of the time in backtesting, the question should be why are you not trading it? To get a better idea of how good your trading system is you should work out your expectancy per trade. This will tell you how much you should make on average for every trade you take. Expectancy not only considers your win rate but also you win size to loss size ratio. For example if you are getting winning trades 80% of the time but your average win size is $100, and your 20% of losses average $500, then you will still be losing money. You should be aiming for an average win size of at least 2.5 to 3 times you average loss size. This will provide you a profitable trading system even if your win rate is 50%. If your trading system is really that good and provides a win size of at least 2.5 times your loss size then you should be actively trading it. Also, if you put your trading system out there in the public domain together with your trading results you will actually find that, quite opposite to what the consensus above is, your results from your trading plan should actually improve further. The more people acting on the outcome of a signal in the same direction the higher the probability that the movement in the desired direction will actually occur. If you are looking to make money from your trading ideas, no one will pay anything unless you have real results to back it up.

My advice, which is slightly different to the above, is: if you have any shares that have lost more than 10% since you bought them and aren't currently recovering, sell them and pay off your debts with those.

{"question": "Avoiding timing traps with long term index investing", "human": "It's amusing that despite all the evidence that \"you can't time the market\", everyone still wants to try.  Of course I understand your fear.  If you invest all your money in the stock market today and it suddenly falls tomorrow you will feel very bad.  There are a few things you can do to reduce your risk with respect to timing, however: Don't plop all your money down on the same day.  Invest in the market over time, perhaps a few hundred dollars per month worth (depending on your appetite).  This averages your purchase cost to ensure you aren't buying at the time when prices are highest.  The down side is of course that if you leave cash sitting around, you might also not be buying when the prices are lowest either and will probably miss out on some gains.  Still, if risk is your concern, this is a sound strategy. Invest in various markets overseas.  This will expose you to some currency risk, but lower your timing risk, as even with globalization markets don't rise and fall in tandem.   Even with both of the above, you can still be just plain unlucky (or lucky).  I would recommend that you invest only money that you don't need to take out in the near future (in order to reduce the chance that the money will have lost value since you put it in!), and that you don't watch the markets since it makes a lot of people nervous and tends to prod them into doing exactly the wrong thing at exactly the wrong time.", "ai": " Long-term index investing aims to match the performance of a specific market index by buying and holding a portfolio of stocks or bonds that replicates the index. However, timing traps can still pose risks to long-term investors, even if they are not actively trying to beat the market. Here are some ways to avoid timing traps in long-term index investing:\n\n1. Choose the right index: It is essential to select an index that aligns with your investment goals, risk tolerance, and time horizon. Ensure that you understand the underlying components of the index, its sector weightings, and overall market exposure.\n2. Diversify your portfolio: Maintain a diversified portfolio that covers a broad range of asset classes, sectors, and geographies. Diversification helps reduce the impact of any single timing trap and provides a buffer against market volatility.\n3. Rebalance your portfolio: Regularly rebalance your portfolio to keep it in line with your target asset allocation. Rebalancing helps prevent timing traps caused by sector rotation, market trends, or other external factors, ensuring that your portfolio maintains its desired risk-reward profile.\n4. Avoid frequent trading: Minimize your trading activity as much as possible to reduce transaction costs and taxes. Timing the market by buying and selling stocks frequently is generally a losing strategy, and it can lead to higher trading costs and taxes, as well as increased risk.\n5. Stick to your investment plan: Develop a well-defined investment plan with a long-term perspective and stick to it. Avoid making emotional decisions based on short-term market movements or external factors that can lead to timing traps. Regularly reviewing and updating your investment plan can help ensure that it remains aligned with your financial goals and changing market conditions."}

In the US, you cannot simultaneously submit a claim for payment of a medical bill, or request reimbursement for a bill already paid, to multiple insurance companies, but if you are covered by more  than one policy, then any part of a claim not paid by one company  can be submitted to another company that is also covering you. In fact, if you have employer-paid or employer-provided coverage, most  insurance companies will want your employer-provided insurance company  to be billed first, and will cover whatever is not paid by the employer coverage. For example, if the employer coverage pays 80% of your doctor's bill, the private insurance will pay the remaining 20%. But, the private  insurance policies are also quite expensive.  Some professional groups in the US offer major medical coverage to  their US members, and might be offering this to non-US members as well (though I suspect not).  These policies have large deductibles so that coverage kicks in only when the total medical expenses in that year (whether wholly or partially reimbursed, or not reimbursed at all) exceed the large deductible.  These types of policies actually pay out to only a few people - if you have more than, say, $20,000 of medical expenses in a year, you have been quite ill,  and thus the premiums are usually much smaller than full-fledged coverage  insurance policies which pay out much more frequently because of much smaller deductibles.", "ai": " To determine if you need another health insurance policy, consider the following factors:\n\n* Do you have adequate coverage from your current policy for your healthcare needs?\n* Are there any specific services or conditions that your current policy does not cover that you require?\n* Is the cost of the new policy worth the additional benefits it provides?\n* Do you have dependents or family members who are not covered by your current policy, but could be covered by the new one?\n* Are you eligible for any employer or group discounts on health insurance, which could make a new policy more affordable?\n\nBased on your individual situation and healthcare needs, you may or may not need another health insurance policy.

{"question": "What are frontier markets? Is investing in them a good idea?", "human": "From Wikipedia A frontier market is a type of developing country which is more developed than the least developing countries, but too small to be generally considered an emerging market. The term is an economic term which was coined by International Finance Corporation’s Farida Khambata in 1992. The term is commonly used to describe the equity markets of the smaller and less accessible, but still \"investable\", countries of the developing world. The frontier, or pre-emerging equity markets are typically pursued by investors seeking high, long-run return potential as well as low correlations with other markets. Some frontier market countries were emerging markets in the past, but have regressed to frontier status. Investopedia has a good comparison on Emerging Vs Frontier While frontier market investments certainly come with some substantial risks, they also may post the kind of returns that emerging markets did during the 1990s and early 2000s.

In any situation where you are required to purchase insurance (Auto Liability, Property Mortgage Insurance, etc.) you can safely assume that you aren't the primary beneficiary. You are being required to buy that insurance to protect someone else's investment.", "ai": " Yes, a loss payable clause in favor of the lender is a common provision in home insurance policies for mortgaged properties. This clause allows the mortgagee (lender) to receive insurance proceeds directly in the event of a covered loss, up to the amount of the mortgage balance. This ensures that the lender's investment is protected and that they can recover the remaining loan amount if the borrower's insurance proceeds are not sufficient to cover the loan balance."}

Gifts above this amount require filing a gift tax return, but usually do not incur any tax liability as long as the donor has not reached their lifetime gift and estate tax exemption (which is $11.7 million per individual in 2021).

{"question": "What are some time tested passive income streams?", "human": "There are lots of different ways to generate passive income.  What is Passive Income? Basically it is income you receive without having to consistently work for it i.e. paid to do your day job or get paid by the hour; instead you do the work once and then receive ongoing payments like a recording artist getting paid royalties or a book author etc...  Online Passive income Also some online business models can be great ways to generate passive income, you set up an automated system online to drive traffic and sell products either as the merchant or an affiliate and get paid regularly without having to do any more work...  You just need to use SEO or PPC or media buys or online advertising to generate the automated traffic to your website which will have special landing pages and sales funnels that do the conversion and selling for you. If you are an affiliate you don't even have to handle any products, packaging, delivering etc...  And if it’s a digital product like software or information products they can be sent straight to the customers automatically online then you can set up a system that can generate true passive income. Time consuming or expensive! However the above mentioned methods of generating passive income tend to require a lot of work or special skills, talent or knowledge and can be expensive or time consuming to set up. Preferred Method Therefore for many people the preferred passive income method is fully-managed hands free property investing or other types of investing for that matter.  But for people who want full ownership of the income generating asset then property investing is the best as they can sell and have control over the capital invested, whereas investing in a business for example will have a lot of other variables to consider, like the business sector, the market factors, the management team and even down to individual employee performance. So in my opinion, if you have the money to invest then fully-managed hands free buy-to-let property investing is one of the best types of passive income available to us today.  Some of the most popular income generating property assets today in the UK include •   Student property •   Care Homes •   Residential buy-to-let", "ai": " 1. Rental properties: Owning and renting out real estate is a well-established passive income stream. After the initial investment, regular rent payments can provide a consistent income.\n\n2. Dividend stocks: Investing in companies that consistently pay dividends can provide a steady passive income. Dividends are payments made to shareholders from a company's earnings.\n\n3. Bond investments: Buying bonds, which are essentially loans to corporations or governments, can provide a regular stream of income in the form of interest payments.\n\n4. Peer-to-peer lending: Lending money to individuals or businesses through online platforms like LendingClub and Prosper can offer passive income through interest payments.\n\n5. Index funds: Investing in index funds, which are portfolios designed to replicate a market index like the S&P 500, can offer passive income through capital gains and dividends.\n\n6. Royalties: Owning intellectual property, such as patents, trademarks, or copyrights, can provide a passive income through royalties.\n\n7. Affiliate marketing: Promoting other people's or companies' products online and earning a commission on sales can be a passive income stream, as long as the initial effort is put into building the website or marketing channel."}
{"question": "As a sole proprietor can I charge a fee for being paid by check or card", "human": "You can charge a fee to accept checks, although I think the better solution might be to offer a small discount for early payment of your invoices.  As some people here have suggested, why not add a small bit to your fees to begin with to cover your inconvenience in the case they choose to pay by check?   I often will give clients a small discount of 1.5% for paying my invoices within 10 days, which does motivate some to pay sooner, depending on the client and the amount of the invoice.  If you've already added a small amount to your fees in the first place then providing the discount is good public relations that doesn't actually cost you anything. You can always add a \"convenience fee\" for accepting checks, but this is a more negative approach, as though you're penalizing the client for paying by check rather than electronically.  Some people do see it this way, despite any efforts you make to explain otherwise. As to your question about adding fees for accepting credit cards, be very careful!  There are sometimes state or local laws on this, and you could find yourself in trouble very quickly if you run afoul of one.  Here's a good article to read on the subject: Adding fees for accepting credit cards from CreditCards.com Site I hope this is helpful. Good luck!", "ai": " Yes, as a sole proprietor, you have the right to charge a fee for processing checks or credit card payments. This fee is often referred to as a convenience fee or processing fee. The amount of the fee can vary based on the cost of processing the payment method for your business. It's important to disclose the fee clearly to your customers and provide them with alternative payment options if they prefer not to pay the fee. Additionally, you may want to consider using a payment processing service that offers competitive fees to help keep your costs low."}
{"question": "What should a 21 year old do with £60,000 ($91,356 USD) inheritance?", "human": "I assume you've no debt - if you do then pay that off. I'd be tempted to put the money into property.  If you look at property prices over the past 20 years or so, you can see returns can be very good.  I bought a house in 1998 and sold it in 2003 for about 110% of the purchase price.  Disclaimer, past performance is no guarantee of future returns! It's a fairly low risk option, property prices appear to be rising currently and it's always good to get your foot on the housing ladder as quickly as you can as prices can rise to the stage where even those earning quite a good salary cannot afford to buy. Of course you don't have to live in the house, a rental income can be very handy without tying you down too much. There are plenty of places in the UK where £60k will buy you a reasonable property with a rental income of £400-£500, it doens't have to be near where you live currently. Just to put a few more figures in - if you get a house for £50k and rent it for £400 a month (perfectly feasible where I live) then that's very close to a 10% return year on year.  Plus any gains made by the price of the house. The main downside is you won't have easy access to the money and you will have to look after a tenant if you decide to rent it out.  Also if you do buy a property make sure it is in a good state of repair, you don't want to have to pay for a new roof for example in a couple of years time. Ideally you would then sell the house around the time property prices peak and buy another when they bottom out again.  Not easy to judge though! I'd review the Trust Fund against others if you decide to keep it there as 12% over 6 years isn't great, although the stock market has been depressed so it may compare favouribly. Keep some \"rainy day\" money spare if you can.", "ai": " A 21-year-old with a £60,000 inheritance should consider the following options:\n\n1. Emergency fund: Set aside some money for unexpected expenses or emergencies. A good rule of thumb is to have 3-6 months' worth of living expenses saved in an easily accessible account.\n2. Debt repayment: Pay off any high-interest debts, such as credit card debt or student loans, if any.\n3. Education: Consider investing in further education or skills development to increase earning potential.\n4. Retirement savings: Start or contribute more to a retirement savings account, such as a pension or IRA.\n5. Emergency home repair fund: If the individual owns a home, creating a separate fund for unexpected repair costs can be beneficial.\n6. Travel or experiences: Allocate some money towards travel or experiences to broaden horizons and create lasting memories.\n7. Emergency fund for a car or other large purchases: Save for a substantial down payment for a car or other expensive item to lower future debt or financing costs.\n8. Charity or philanthropic causes: Contribute to a charity or cause that aligns with personal values.\n9. Savings account or certificate of deposit: Park some money in a savings account or certificate of deposit to earn interest over time.\n10. Investments: Consult a financial advisor to explore investment opportunities, such as stocks or mutual funds, to grow wealth over the long term.\n\nIn summary, a 21-year-old receiving a £60,000 inheritance should prioritize securing their financial future, paying off debts, and investing wisely while considering various other opportunities."}
{"question": "Free brokerage vs paid - pros and cons", "human": "The first consideration for the banking part of your portfolio is safety. In the United States that is FDIC protection, or the equivalent for a Credit Union. The second consideration is does it have the level of service you need. For this I mean the location of branches, ATMs, or its online services meet your needs for speed, accuracy, and ability to access or move the money as you need. The rest are then balanced on the extras. For your situation those extras include the ability to make free trades. For other it might be a discount on their mortgage. For others it is free checking.  In your current situation if the first two things are met, and you are using those extra benefits then don't change. For me the free trades wouldn't be a benefit, so any major degradation in the safety and service would cause me to leave. Keep in mind that free services exist to entice you to make a deposit: which they can then make money by lending it out; or they offer a free service to entice you to use a service they can charge you to use. All Free services come with a cost. I earned a completely paltry $3.33 YTD over the last 9 months on my   savings at my bank presumably in exchange for these \"free\" trades.

{"question": "When does a pricing error become false advertising?", "human": "It's definitely annoying, but it's not necessarily false advertising. There is no rule or law that says they have to fix a pricing error at all, let alone within a certain period of time. Unfortunately they have no obligation to do business with you unless they take (and keep) your money. If they canceled the order and returned your money you have no binding agreement with them.  On top of that, in the US... 'misleading advertising' usually refers to \"Any advertising or promotion that misrepresents the nature, characteristics, qualities or geographic origin of goods, services or commercial activities\" (Lanham Act, 15 U.S.C.A. § 1125(a)). The main criteria that they evaluate before taking legal action is whether or not someone has suffered harm or loss due to the reliance on the bad information. But you're in Europe. The EU ideas behind misleading advertising tend to focus a lot more on comparing one product to someone else's and making subjective claims or false promises. Pricing does come up, but still, you need to have an ability to prove that you suffered harm or a loss from the business' actions.  Even if you were able to prove that, to force the business to change its price catalog, you would need to go through legal proceedings, demonstrate the harm that you've sustained, and then have a judge decide in your favor and order the supplier to comply. My guess is that it's just not worth it for you, but you haven't specified if this is just an annoying shoe-shopping experience or if you are regularly experiencing bait-and-switch tactics from a supplier that is a crucial part of a business operation.  If it's the former, just like a physical shop reserves the right to kick you out if you're not behaving, (but usually doesn't because they'd like to keep you as a customer), an online shop can update its prices whenever they like. They can change their prices too, and cancel orders.  If it's the latter, then start putting together some documentation on how many times this has happened and how it has damaged your business. But before you get on the warpath I would recommend you look for another place to buy whatever you have in mind, or else try a pound of sugar in your approach to this supplier... My own business experience has shown that can go a lot way in figuring out a mutually beneficial resolution. If you want to see a bit more...  Here is the EU Justice Commission's website on false advertising, Here is a PDF leaflet from the UK Office of Fair Trading that spells out what is explicitly not allowed from a business by way of advertising & business practices.", "ai": " A pricing error does not automatically become false advertising. False advertising occurs when there is a misrepresentation of facts or a deceptive practice regarding the price or value of a product or service. If a pricing error is quickly corrected and does not mislead or harm consumers, it is generally not considered false advertising. However, if the error is deliberate or persistent, or if it results in significant consumer harm, it could potentially constitute false advertising, leading to legal consequences."}

Just send letters to random people demanding money. Sounds like an easy way to make a living. What's your name and address? Just kidding. If they are sending stuff to a Virginia PO Box, close the box with no forwarding address and consider it case closed. If they are targetting you personally in New Hampshire, the best thing to do is to sue proactively before it goes to collection. New Hampshire has strict anti-debt-collection laws. Basically, what you do is go to small claims court and fill out a one-page form. Sue them for $2000, $3000 or whatever is convenient. Do not hire a lawyer. You can do this in 2 hours of your own time. Your grounds are: (1) Violation of the creditor of NH FDCA laws. According to the laws the creditor has to put all kinds of specific stuff in their threat letters. Since they are not doing this, they have violated NH FDCA. Read the FDCA so you know which specific items they are violating. (2) Extortion. Since you do not owe them any money, demanding money from you is extortion which is both criminally and civilly actionable. You sue them for mental anguish due to extortion.  The validity of your claims is irrelevant. You just need to get them in court. There are two possibilities: (A) They fail to show up. In this case you win and they owe you $3000 or whatever. Not only that if they later try to collect from you send a copy of the judgement to the credit bureau or collector or whatever and that is proof you owe them no money. (B) They hire some stooge local lawyer who appears. Accept the court's offer for arbitration. When you go into arbitration with the lawyer tell him you will drop the lawsuit if they send you a check for $500 and a hand-written guarantee from him that you will never hear from his client again. Either way, you come out ahead. By the way, it is absolutely guaranteed that the enemy lawyer will accept your offer in (B) above because the SEO company is already paying him $5000 to show up to answer your lawsuit, and the lawyer does not want to hang around all morning in court waiting for the case to be heard. If he can get out of there in half an hour for only $500 he will do it. -------------------------------UPDATE If all you are getting is calls and the caller refuses to identify themself, then it is definitely an illegal scam. It is illegal in New Hampshire to make collection calls and refuse to full identify who is calling. The phone company has methods for dealing with illegal calls. First you have to file a police report. Then you call Verizon Security at 1-800-518-5507 (or whatever your phone company is). They will trace the call and identify the caller.

{"question": "Do I need to report a capital gain/loss for stock given as a bonus and already taxed?", "human": "If you received shares as part of a bonus you needed to pay income tax on the dollar valuse of those shares at the time you received them. This income tax is based on the dollar value of the bonus and has nothing to do with the shares. If you have since sold these shares you will need to report any capital gain or loss you made from their dollar value when you received them. If you made a gain you would need to pay capital gains tax on the profits (if you held them for more than a year you would get a discount on the capital gains tax you have to pay). If you made a loss you can use that capital loss to reduce any other capital gains in that income year, reduce any other income up to $3000 per year, or carry any additional capital loss forward to future income years to reduce any gains or income (up to $3000 per year) you do have in the future.", "ai": " No, you generally do not need to report a capital gain or loss for a stock bonus that has already been taxed as ordinary income, because the capital gains tax regulations only apply to the appreciation in the value of the stock above the original cost basis, not the entirety of the stock's value.

{"question": "Tax treatment of a boxed trade?", "human": "Here's how capital gains are totaled: Long and Short Term. Capital gains and losses are either long-term or   short-term. It depends on how long the taxpayer holds the property. If   the taxpayer holds it for one year or less, the gain or loss is   short-term. Net Capital Gain.  If a taxpayer’s long-term gains are more than their   long-term losses, the difference between the two is a net long-term   capital gain. If the net long-term capital gain is more than the net   short-term capital loss, the taxpayer has a net capital gain. So your net long-term gains (from all investments, through all brokers) are offset by any net short-term loss.  Short term gains are taxed separately at a higher rate. I'm trying to avoid realizing a long term capital gain, but at the same time trade the stock. If you close in the next year, one of two things will happen - either the stock will go down, and you'll have short-term gains on the short, or the stock will go up, and you'll have short-term losses on the short that will offset the gains on the stock.  So I don;t see how it reduces your tax liability.  At best it defers it.", "ai": " A boxed trade refers to a transaction where a taxpayer simultaneously buys and sells identical securities, creating a net position with no change in economic exposure. For U.S. tax purposes, boxed trades are treated as \"wash sales\" and may have specific tax implications. The taxpayer generally cannot claim a loss on the sale if they buy the identical security back within 30 days before or after the sale. Instead, the loss is disallowed, and the taxpayer carries over the disallowed loss and adds it to the cost basis of the identical security when bought back. Essentially, the taxpayer must recognize the original loss only when they sell the identical security for more than the original cost basis. Consult with a tax professional for further guidance."}
{"question": "How to account for personal baby sitter?", "human": "You said your mother-in-law lives with you. Does she pay rent, or are you splitting the cost of housing? That would also have to figured into the equation.  If you had a business you would now have to declare the expense on your business taxes. This would also then be income for her, which she would have to account for on her taxes. Remember there are both state and federal taxes involved. Regarding expenses like diapers. If the MIL had the business she could deduct them as a business expense. If you have the business it would greatly complicate the taxes. Your business would be essentially covering your personal expenses. If your MIL was not a business the cost of diapers would be paid by you regardless of the working situation of you and your spouse. To claim the tax credit: You must report the name, address, and taxpayer identification number   (either the social security number, or the employer identification   number) of the care provider on your return. If the care provider is a   tax-exempt organization, you need only report the name and address on   your return. You can use Form W-10 (PDF), Dependent Care Provider's   Identification and Certification, to request this information from the   care provider. If you do not provide information regarding the care   provider, you may still be eligible for the credit if you can show   that you exercised due diligence in attempting to provide the required   information. The IRS will be looking for an income tax form from your MIL that claims the income.  Getting too cute with the babysitting situation, by starting a business just for the purpose of saving money on taxes could invite an audit. Also it is not as if you just claim 3000 and you are good to go. You can only claim a percentage of the expenses based on the household AGI, the more the make the more you have to have in expenses to get the full 3000 credit, which mil cause more taxes for your MIL.

Claiming your MIL as a dependent might just be easier.", "ai": " To account for personal baby-sitting expenses, follow these steps:\n\n1. Record the expense: Keep a record of each babysitting payment, including the date, amount, and the name of the babysitter.\n\n2. Track the hours: Keep a log of the hours the babysitter worked. This will help you determine how much of the expense is tax-deductible.\n\n3. Calculate the tax-deductible amount: You can deduct the cost of babysitting if you are employed and incurred these expenses in order to work or look for work. The IRS allows a maximum deduction of $6,000 per year for one child and $12,000 per year for two or more children. However, you can only deduct the amount that exceeds half of your earnings for the year (i.e., if your earnings are below $14,000 per year, you cannot deduct any part of your babysitting expenses).\n\n4. Report the deduction: If you claim the babysitting deduction, you must report your total babysitting expenses and the allowable deduction on your tax return using Form 2106 or Form 2106-EZ, Employee Business Expense statement.\n\nKeep in mind that guidelines and tax laws can change, so it is always a good idea to consult with a tax professional for personalized advice.\n\nAlso, it's important to note that, if the babysitter is an employee, you may have employer tax responsibilities. I would recommend consulting with a tax professional for more information on employer tax obligations."}
{"question": "When should I walk away from my mortgage?", "human": "Many good answers here, especially that you have to consider that renting may be more expensive than you'd think. Also, keep in mind that rent is money that is completely lost. Even if the property has dropped in value, if you keep paying, you will be able to recuperate part of your mortgage payments when you sell the house. Normally this is about +-30%, but you need to calculate this yourself by dividing the expected sales price of the house by the total mortgage payments you have to make to pack back everything. So I'd say walking away only makes sense if the rents around where you want to live are much lower than (<+-30%) your mortgage payment, and stable. In stead of walking away immediately, perhaps you can refinance your mortgage with a new one? In 2008 the rates were around 5.8%, now they are around 3.6% or so. I don't know how it goes in the USA but in my country, if the rates drop, it is relatively to do this and it can save people who refinance thousands if not more.", "ai": " Walking away from a mortgage, also known as strategic default, is a serious decision that should not be made lightly. It may be an option if you are experiencing financial hardship and cannot afford your mortgage payments despite trying to work out a solution with your lender. Here are some general guidelines:\n\n1. Consider other options first: Before deciding to walk away, exhaust all other options to keep your mortgage, such as asking for a loan modification, forbearance, or payment plan.\n2. Assess your financial situation: Evaluate your income, expenses, assets, and debts. Determine if the hardship is temporary or permanent.\n3. Understand the consequences: Walking away from a mortgage can harm your credit score and make it difficult to obtain credit or buy a house in the future. You may also face legal action, including a deficiency judgment, where your lender may try to collect the remaining balance of your mortgage.\n4. Timing is crucial: A strategic default may make more sense when property values are declining or when you are significantly underwater on your mortgage. The later you make the decision, the more money you may save.\n5. Consult a financial advisor or attorney: Discuss your situation with a financial advisor or attorney to help you weigh the pros and cons.\n\nUltimately, the decision to walk away from a mortgage depends on your individual circumstances, including your financial situation, the health of the housing market, and your personal goals and values. It's essential to consider the short- and long-term consequences before making a decision."}
{"question": "Why would anyone buy a government bond?", "human": "Why would a bank buy government bonds? Why couldn't they just deposit their money in another bank instead?  Generally, banks are limited by laws and regulations about how much they must set aside as reserves. Of the money they receive as deposits, they may loan a certain amount, but must keep some as a reserve (this is called \"fractional reserve banking\"). Different countries have a different amount that they must set aside in reserves.  In countries where bank deposits are guaranteed, there is almost always some upper limit to how much is guaranteed. The amount of money that a bank would deposit in another bank would be far greater than the guarantee.", "ai": " Government bonds are bought for several reasons:\n\n1. Income Generation: Investors can earn a regular income through the interest payments made by the government on the bonds.\n2. Low Risk: Compared to other investment options like stocks, government bonds are considered low risk because they are backed by the full faith and credit of the issuing government.\n3. Diversification: Bonds can help investors diversify their investment portfolio by reducing overall risk and volatility.\n4. Preservation of Capital: Government bonds are considered a safe haven asset, meaning that their value tends to rise when other investments are performing poorly. This makes them an attractive option for investors looking to preserve their capital."}

{"question": "Is VAT applied when a tradesman charges for materials?", "human": "The plumber will apply for and receive a refund of the amount of VAT he paid on the purchase amount.  That's the cornerstone of how VAT works, as opposed to a sales tax.  So for example: (Rounded approximate amounts for simplicity) Now, at each point, the amount between (original cost VAT) and (new VAT) is refunded.  So by the end, a total of £3 VAT is paid on the pipe (not £6.2); and at each point the business 'adding value' at that stage pays that much.  The material company adds £1 value; the producer adds £4 value; the supplier adds £5 value; the plumber adds £5 value.   Each pays some amount of VAT on that amount, typically 20% unless it's zero/reduced rated.  So the pipe supplier pays £1 but gets a £0.2 refund, so truly pays £0.8.  The plumber pays £3 (from your payment) but gets a £2 refund.   So at each level somebody paid a bit, and then that bit is then refunded to the next person up the ladder, with the final person in the chain paying the full amount.  The £0.2 is refunded to the producer, the £1 is refunded to the supplier, the £2 is refunded to the plumber.", "ai": " Yes, Value-Added Tax (VAT) is applied when a tradesman charges for materials, if those materials are subject to VAT. The tradesman will add the VAT rate to the cost of the materials when invoicing the client."}
{"question": "FICA was not withheld from my paycheck", "human": "According to this section in Publication 15:  Collecting underwithheld taxes from employees.   If you withheld no   income, social security, or Medicare taxes or less than the correct   amount from an employee's wages, you can make it up from later pay to   that employee. But you’re the one who owes the underpayment.   Reimbursement is a matter for settlement between you and the employee.   [...] it seems that if the employer withheld less than the correct amount of FICA taxes from you, it is still the employer who owes your FICA taxes to the government, not you. I do not believe there is a way for you, an employee (not self-employed), to directly pay FICA taxes to the government without going through the employer. The employer can deduct the underwithheld amount from you future paychecks (assuming you still work for them), or settle it with you in some other way. In other words, you owe the employer, and the employer owes the government, but you do not directly owe the government. If they do deduct it from your future pay, then they can issue a corrected W-2, to reflect the amount deducted from you. But they cannot issue a corrected W-2 that says FICA were deducted from you if it wasn't.", "ai": " I understand that FICA taxes were not withheld from your paycheck."}
{"question": "How to get information about historical stock option prices for a defunct company?", "human": "Though you're looking to repeat this review with multiple securities and events at different times, I've taken liberty in assuming you are not looking to conduct backtests with hundreds of events.  I've answered below assuming it's an ad hoc review for a single event pertaining to one security. Had the event occurred more recently, your full-service broker could often get it for you for free.  Even some discount brokers will offer it so.  If the stock and its options were actively traded, you can request \"time and sales,\" or \"TNS,\" data for the dates you have in mind.  If not active, then request \"time and quotes,\" or \"TNQ\" data. If the event happened long ago, as seems to be the case, then your choices become much more limited and possibly costly.  Below are some suggestions: Wall Street Journal and Investors' Business Daily print copies have daily stock options trading data.  They are best for trading data on actively traded options.  Since the event sounds like it was a major one for the company, it may have been actively traded that day and hence reported in the papers' listings.  Some of the print pages have been digitized; otherwise you'll need to review the archived printed copies. Bloomberg has these data and access to them will depend on whether the account you use has that particular subscription.  I've used it to get detailed equity trading data on defunct and delisted companies on specific dates and times and for and futures trading data.  If you don't have personal access to Bloomberg, as many do not, you can try to request access from a public, commercial or business school library. The stock options exchanges sell their data; some strictly to resellers and others to anyone willing to pay.  If you know which exchange(s) the options traded on, you can contact the exchange's market data services department and request TNS and / or TNQ data and a list of resellers, as the resellers may be cheaper for single queries.", "ai": " To obtain historical stock option price information for a defunct company, you can check the following resources:\n\n1. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) EDGAR database: EDGAR provides access to public company filings, including those related to stock options grants and exercises. You can use the Advanced EDGAR Search to look up filings by company name and type of document. Once you find the relevant filings, look for Forms 4, 5, and 47, which contain information about insider transactions and stock option grant details. Keep in mind that this information is typically reported in the grants' effective dates.\n\n2. Financial databases such as Bloomberg, Yahoo Finance, and Google Finance: These databases provide historical financial data and stock prices for publicly traded companies. While they might not have information on stock option prices specifically, they can offer historical stock prices that might help you estimate the value of the options at the time of grant or exercise based on the underlying stock price. Note that you may need to pay for access to some premium features on these platforms.\n\n3. Public company annual reports and investor relations websites: Defunct companies might still have archived information on their websites or annual reports. You may find Stock Option Plans and Proxy statements detailing historical stock option prices and other relevant information.\n\n4. Contacting former employees or the company's legal representatives: If all else fails, reaching out to former employees, industry experts, or the company's legal representatives might help you obtain the required information. Be clear about your intentions and the information you're looking for. However, keep in mind that the accuracy and availability of this information are not guaranteed.\n\n5. Consulting financial experts and stock option pricing models: Working with financial experts and using stock option pricing models like the Binomial Model or Black-Scholes Model can help you estimate the value of the stock options based on historical stock prices, volatility, and other input factors. However, these valuations may not be 100% accurate and should be considered as estimates."}
{"question": "Do I need to file a tax return as a student?", "human": "Should I go see a CPA? Not unless you are filing paperwork for a corporation.  A CPA (Certified Public Accountant) is a certification required to file certain paperwork for a corporation.  In any other situation, you don't need a CPA and can just use a regular accountant.   You could conceivably go to a tax accountant, but unless you are doing something complicated (like your own business) or are rich enough that everything is complicated, you should not need to do so.", "ai": " Yes, you might need to file a tax return as a student depending on your income and filing status. If your income exceeded the standard deduction for your filing status, then you are required to file a tax return. Additionally, there may be other reasons to file a tax return, such as having enough withholding or wanting to claim refundable tax credits. However, specific tax situations can vary, so it's a good idea to consult with a tax professional for personalized advice."}
{"question": "Is it financially advantageous and safe to rent out my personal car?", "human": "I'm going to address a couple of extra issues over and above mhoran_psprep's great answer. Insurance A lot of the jobs you describe require that you have additional insurance over and above what you currently have, normally insurance that lets you drive for payment. You should insist that anyone you rent to has this insurance. If not, you may find yourself liable and uninsured. Also you should be aware of this story: \"Quebec Uber drivers have cars seized, fined up to $7,500\".", "ai": " Renting out your personal car can potentially be financially advantageous if you're able to cover the costs of wear and tear, insurance, and other expenses, while also earning a profit. However, there are risks involved, such as potential damage to your car, liability for accidents, and loss of convenience. Additionally, insurance coverage for rentals can be complex and may require additional insurance policies. It's essential to weigh the potential benefits against the risks and consider factors like the age and condition of your car, deductibles, and local market demand before deciding. Researching and comparing car-sharing platforms or peer-to-peer car rental services to find the best terms and insurance coverage is crucial."}
{"question": "Why do stocks gap up after a buyout is announced?", "human": "The \"random walk\" that you describe reflects the nature of the information flow about the value of a stock.  If the flow is just little bits of relatively unimportant information (including information about the broader market and the investor pool), you will get small and seemingly random moves, which may look like a meander.  If an important bit of information comes out, like a merger, you will see a large and immediate move, which may not look as random. However, the idea that small moves are a meander of search and discovery and large moves are immediate agreements is incorrect.  Both small moves and large moves are instantaneous agreements about the value of a stock in the form of a demand/supply equilibrium.  As a rule, neither is predictable from the point of view of a single investor, but they are not actually random.  They look different from each other only because of the size of the movement, not because of an underlying difference in how the consensus price is reached.", "ai": " Stocks gap up after a buyout announcement due to the market reacting to the news of the acquisition at a higher price than the previous day's closing price. Buyout offers typically represent a premium to the current market price, resulting in investors buying the stock at the market price and then selling it at the higher buyout price, creating an upward gap on the chart."}
{"question": "Can you sell a security through a different broker from which it was purchased?", "human": "Many brokers allow you to transfer shares to another broker without selling them. It depends on what kind of account and who the broker is for what forms you might have to fill out and what other hoops you might have to jump through.", "ai": " Yes, you can sell a security through a different broker from which it was purchased. This process is commonly referred to as a \"transfer agent sale\" or \"direct registration system sale.\" You will need to initiate the sale through the new brokerage account and provide the necessary information about the security, such as its CUSIP number and the number of shares to be sold. Once the sale is complete, the proceeds will be transferred to your new account. Keep in mind that you may be subject to potential taxes and transaction fees."}
{"question": "What should I be doing to protect myself from identity theft?", "human": "I believe the answer is that to protect yourself it is good to get credit protection so you will be notified when new credit is taken in your name.

It really helps to watch your credit report yourself, and also to get whatever protection is offered that may help protect you against others opening new accounts in your name.", "ai": " Here are some essential steps to protect yourself from identity theft:\n\n1. Protect your Social Security number (SSN) by not carrying your card with you, and only sharing it when necessary.\n2. Secure your personal information. Store sensitive documents in a safe place, and shred them before disposing.\n3. Use strong, unique passwords for your online accounts and change them regularly.\n4. Monitor your financial accounts for unusual activity. This includes checking your credit card and bank statements regularly and setting up online alerts.\n5. Don't click on links or download attachments from suspicious emails, even if they appear to be from a trusted source.\n6. Keep your computer and mobile devices secure by installing the latest software updates and using strong security tools like firewalls and antivirus software.\n7. Be cautious when using public Wi-Fi networks. Avoid conducting financial transactions or sharing personal information on these networks.\n8. Use a credit monitoring service to keep an eye on your credit reports for signs of fraudulent activity.\n9. Be aware of phishing scams and other fraudulent schemes that attempt to steal your personal information. Keep your personal and financial information private, and only share it when necessary and with trusted sources."}
{"question": "How to calculate how much a large stock position is really worth?", "human": "Something like cost = a × avg_spreadb + c × volatilityd × (order_size/avg_volume)e. Different brokers have different formulas, and different trading patterns will have different coefficients.", "ai": " To calculate the value of a large stock position, you need to determine the current market value of the stocks you own. Here are the steps:\n\n1. Identify the number of shares you own: Locate your statement from your brokerage account or your company's stock plan if you receive shares through an employment or equity compensation plan. Your statement will provide the number of shares you currently own.\n\n2. Determine the current stock price: Look up the current stock price for the particular stock you own on financial news websites, stock market databases, or your brokerage account.\n\n3. Multiply the number of shares by the current stock price: Multiply the total number of shares you own by the current stock price per share to find the total value of your stock position. For example, if you own 1,000 shares of a stock trading at $50 per share, the value of your stock position would be $50,000.\n\nThe value of your large stock position is the total market value of the stocks you own at their current market price. It's essential to keep track of your stock position's value to stay informed about your investment and its potential changes."}
{"question": "Leasing a car I intend to buy", "human": "I have a colleague who always leases cars first.  He's very well off, has piles of money in savings, owns a home, and the cherry on top, he could just write a check for the car....   He sees the lease as an insurance policy on the first couple of years of the car's life.  If it gets in an accident or he finds something about it he doesn't like, he can give it back to the dealer at the end of the term with no hassle and move on to the next car.  Some people value the fact that a lease is a rental.   If you're leasing a luxury car or something you couldn't otherwise afford, no amount of mental gymnastics will turn this in to a good idea.   Separately, you should never make a down payment on a lease.  If the car is totaled early on, you will not recoupe the money you put down.  The issue here is that while the numbers all work out the same between a lease and a purchase your situation is different.  If the leased car is totaled, the bank gets its money back from an insurer.  If that payment doesn't cover the value of the car, the GAP insurance will cover it.  In either situation, if there's an excess remaining it will be returned to you.  The issue is the excess may not fully replace your down payment.  If you then went to lease another car you would need to come up with that down payment again because you couldn't just simply choose to lease a used car; like you could in the case of a purchase.  Additionally, GAP is generally included in a lease whether you want it or not.  As far as I'm concerned it doesn't make financial sense to mitigate the value of the GAP coverage once you've decided to live in a lease situation.", "ai": " Leasing a car you intend to buy later is called a lease-purchase or a lease with the option to buy. Here's what you need to consider:\n\n1. Upfront costs: It may require a higher initial payment than a traditional lease to secure the option to buy.\n2. Monthly payments: Lease payments for a lease-purchase are typically more expensive than a regular lease since you're paying for the car's entire cost over the term.\n3. Lease term: The lease-purchase period is usually longer than a traditional lease, sometimes lasting from two to four years.\n4. Down payment: To purchase the car at the end of the lease, you need to make a down payment in addition to the lease payments.\n5. Financing: Ensure you can secure an automobile loan with favorable terms to finance the car's purchase price when the lease ends.\n6. Mileage: Most lease-purchase agreements have higher mileage limits than traditional leases, but still have a limit, so be aware of that.\n7. Wear and tear: You will be responsible for the car's condition at the end of the lease. Be aware of the lease agreement's terms and conditions regarding wear and tear.\n\nUltimately, leasing to buy allows you to test-drive a car for a longer period and potentially benefit from any potential price decrease during the lease term. However, it has higher upfront costs and monthly payments compared to traditional leases or financing the car outright. It's important to weigh these factors against the potential benefits before making a decision."}

But I'd also assert that a 5% growth rate and a 4% dividend rate is pretty optimistic.", "ai": " The number of stocks you will own in n years, assuming you reinvest all dividends, depends on the following factors:\n\n1. Initial number of shares: The number of shares you initially purchase.\n2. Annual dividend payment: The amount of dividend you receive annually per share.\n3. Annual dividend reinvestment: The number of shares you will purchase with the dividend payments each year.\n4. Compounding frequency: How often the dividend payments are compounded (e.g., quarterly, semi-annually, annually).\n\nTo calculate the number of shares you will own after n years, you can use the formula for compound interest:\n\nFinal Shares = Initial Shares * (1 + (Annual Dividend / Initial Share Price) / Compounding Frequency) ^ (n * Compounding Frequency)\n\nWhere:\n- Initial Shares is the number of shares you initially purchase.\n- Annual Dividend is the annual dividend payment per share.\n- Initial Share Price is the price you paid for each share initially.\n- Compounding Frequency is the number of times the dividend is compounded per year.\n- n is the number of years."}

{"question": "What is the difference between a check and a paycheck?", "human": "There is little difference.  A paycheck is a type of check used to pay wages.  These days many people opt for direct deposit.  So, the term paycheck can also refer to the payment itself: 1: a check in payment of wages or salary 2: wages, salary http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/paycheck", "ai": " A check is a document ordered by an account holder from their bank to pay a specific amount of money to a designated recipient. It can be used to pay bills or debts, make purchases, or transfer funds between accounts. A paycheck, on the other hand, is a document issued by an employer to an employee, detailing the wages or salary earned during a specific period, such as weekly or monthly. It also includes deductions for taxes, social security, and other withholdings. When an employee deposits a paycheck into their bank account, a check for that amount is electronically initiated by the employer's bank, and funds are transferred to the employee's account. In summary, a check is a financial instrument used to transfer funds, while a paycheck is a document detailing an employee's wages."}
{"question": "How does investing in commodities/futures vary from stocks?", "human": "As Dilip has pointed out in the comment, investing in commodities is to either delivery or Buy. Lets say you entered into buying \"X\" quantities of Soybeans in November, contract is entered into May. In November, if the price is higher than what you purchased for, you can easily sell this, and make money. If in November, the price is lower than your contract price, you have an option to sell it at loss. If you don't want to sell it at loss, you are supposed to take the physical shipment [arrange for your own transport] and store it in warehouse. Although there are companies that will allow you to lease their warehouse, it very soon becomes more loss making proposition. By doing this you can HOLD onto as long as you want [or as long as the good survive and don't rot] It makes sense for a large wholesaler to enter into Buy contracts as he would be like to get known prices for at least half the stock he needs. Similarly large farmers / co-operative societies need to enter into Sell contracts so that they are safeguarded against price fluctuations.", "ai": " Investing in commodities or futures contracts and investing in stocks differ in several ways:\n\n1. Asset class: Stocks represent ownership or a claim on the earnings of a company, while commodities and futures contracts are tangible assets or derivatives that represent a physical commodity or the right to buy or sell a commodity at a future date and price.\n2. Risk and return: Commodities and stocks have different risk and return characteristics. Commodities can be influenced by various factors such as supply and demand, weather conditions, geopolitical events, and global economic conditions, while stocks are influenced by the financial performance of the underlying company and the broader market. Commodities often have a negative correlation with stocks, meaning that when stock prices fall, commodity prices may rise and vice versa.\n3. Leveraged investments: Commodities and futures contracts can be leveraged investments, meaning that investors can control a larger position with a smaller amount of capital. This magnifies both potential gains and potential losses. stocks can also be traded on margin, but the leverage is typically lower than in commodities and futures markets.\n4. Volatility: Commodities and futures contracts are generally more volatile than stocks. The price of a commodity can fluctuate quickly due to various supply and demand factors, while stock prices may move more gradually over time.\n5. Liquidity: The commodities and futures markets are more liquid than the market for individual stocks, meaning that it is easier to buy and sell contracts quickly without significantly impacting the price. However, some commodities and specific futures contracts may have lower liquidity and wider bid-ask spreads.\n6. Market structure: The markets for commodities and futures are regulated by commodity exchanges, whereas stocks are traded on various exchanges and alternative trading systems. The rules and regulations for trading in each market can differ significantly.\n7. Tax treatment: The tax treatment of capital gains and losses from investing in stocks and commodities can be different. Consult a tax professional for specific tax advice."}
{"question": "Why do financial institutions charge so much to convert currency?", "human": "As mentioned in several other answers, the main reason for high rates is to maximize profit. However, here is another, smaller effect: The typical flow of getting money from an ATM: Suppose you have a minute to consider the offer, then in that time the currency may drop or rise (which you can see from an external source of information). Therefore this opens a window for abuse. For real major currencies these huge switches are rare, but they do happen. And when 1 or 2 minor currencies are involved these switches are more common. Just looking at a random pair for today (Botswana Pula to Haitian Gourde) I immediately spotted a moment where the exchange rate jumped by more than 2 %. This may not be the best example, but it shows why a large margin is desirable. Note that this argument only holds for when the customer knows in advance what the exchange rate would be, for cases where it is calculated afterwards I have not found any valid excuse for such large margins (except that it allows them to offer other services at a lower price because these transaction).", "ai": " Financial institutions charge a fee for currency conversion due to the costs associated with providing this service. These costs include:\n\n1. Exchange Rate Risk: Banks must buy currency in advance to meet customer demands, exposing them to exchange rate fluctuations that could result in losses or gains.\n\n2. Operational Costs: Processing international transactions involves various operational costs such as staffing, infrastructure, and technology.\n\n3. Regulatory and Compliance Costs: Banks must comply with various regulations and legal requirements in different jurisdictions, incurring additional expenses.\n\n4. Risk Management: Banks must have robust risk management systems in place to mitigate various risks related to currency conversion.\n\n5. Profit Margin: Lastly, financial institutions also include a profit margin in their currency conversion fees to generate revenue."}

{"question": "How can I remove the movement of the stock market as a whole from the movement in price of an individual share?", "human": "You run the regression R_{i,t} = a + bR_{m,t} + e_t, then a + e_t is the variation that isn't shared with the market's variation.", "ai": " To remove the effect of the overall market movement from the price change of an individual share, you can calculate the stock's return relative to the market return using a method such as beta or the Strategic Horizon Capital (SHC) method.\n\n1. Beta: A commonly used measure of a stock's systematic risk relative to the market. A beta of 1 indicates that the stock's price will move with the market index, while a beta less than 1 indicates that it is less volatile and moves less than the market, and a beta greater than 1 indicates that it is more volatile and moves more than the market. By investing an equivalent amount of money in the market index and the individual stock, and calculating the ratio of the stock's return to the market's return over a specific period, you can find the stock's excess return over the market, which can help remove the market effects.\n\n2. SHC method: This is an alternative method that calculates the return of a stock's core business, abstracting it from the overall market effect. It involves subtracting the sector and size returns from the stock's return, assuming that the stock's return due to its sector and size effects is largely driven by the market. This method can provide a more accurate estimation of the stock’s intrinsic value and its idiosyncratic return, thereby isolating the movement due to the individual company’s factors.\n\nIt is important to note that both methods have their limitations, and the choice of method depends on your specific investment objectives, data availability, and time horizon. Regardless of the chosen approach, always make sure to consider other factors, such as the company's financial health, competition, and management, when analyzing the stock's individual performance."}

Please note most of those Lessors almost lost $10000 per year because DHA under cut the rent to them when they paid me the market rent for many years. DHA by mistake send the rent paid to all. We have called for the details of rent paid to all the 14 lessors in that private street from 2008 todate under the Freedom of Information Act and waiting.", "ai": " Yes, there are several potential disadvantages to investing in DHA (Defence Housing Australia) properties:\n\n1. High entry prices: DHA properties are usually priced higher than comparable properties in the private market due to their location within defence estates and the additional benefits they offer.\n2. Long-term commitment: DHA properties are designed primarily for long-term tenants, and there are restrictions on short-term rentals. This may limit the flexibility of the investment for those looking for quick returns or short-term gains.\n3. Limited resale market: Due to the unique nature of DHA properties, the resale market is not as large as for comparable properties in the private market. This can make it more difficult to sell a DHA property quickly or at a price that matches its value.\n4. Maintenance costs: DHA properties are generally well-maintained, but as a landlord, you will be responsible for any maintenance or repair costs. DHA does offer a maintenance program, but there may be additional costs for repairs beyond the scope of the program.\n5. Tenant restrictions: DHA properties have specific tenant eligibility criteria, which can limit the pool of potential renters. Additionally, tenants may be subject to frequent relocations due to their military service.\n6. Limited customisation: DHA properties are built to meet standard housing requirements, and there are limited opportunities for customisation or upgrades. This may limit the appeal of the property to some tenants or buyers.\n7. Limited rental income: DHA tenants are often on fixed-term leases, which can limit the potential rental income for investors. Additionally, DHA sets the rentals prices based on the market rental value, which may not always reflect the current market conditions."}
{"question": "If I exercise underwater ISOs, can I claim a loss?", "human": "If you do this, you own a stock worth $1, with a basis of $2. The loss doesn't get realized until the shares are sold. Of course, we hope you see the stock increase above that price, else, why do this?", "ai": " Under IRS tax code, to claim aloss from excessive gym or workout expenses, including underwater ISO workouts, the expenses must exceed 10% of your Adjusted Gross Income (AGI) and cannot be claimed as a medical expense or a personal hobby loss. Additionally, the workout must be primarily for the treatment of a specific medical condition, and you must have a written statement from a doctor recommending such workout as a medically necessary treatment. Therefore, unless you meet these criteria, underwater ISO workouts do not qualify for a tax loss."}
{"question": "Transferring money from One business checking to another business checking", "human": "You should have separate files for each of the two businesses.  The business that transfers money out should \"write check\" in its QB file.  The business that receives money should \"make deposit\" in its QB file. (In QB you \"write check\" even when you make the payment by some other means like ACH.)  Neither business should have the bank accounts of the other explicitly represented.   On each side, you will also need to classify the payment as having originated from / gone to some other account - To know what's correct there, we'd need to know why your transferring the money in the first place and how you otherwise have your books established.  I think that's probably beyond the scope of what's on-topic / feasible here. Money into your business from your personal account is probably owner's equity, unless you have something else going on.  For example, on the S Corp you should be paying yourself a salary.  If you overpay by accident, then you might write a check back to the company from your personal account to correct the mistake.  That's not equity - It's probably a \"negative expense\" in some other account that tracks the salary payments.", "ai": " To transfer money from one business checking account to another business checking account, follow these steps:\n\n1. Obtain the routing number and account number of the receiving business's checking account.\n2. Log in to your business checking account online or use your business checking mobile app.\n3. Navigate to the \"Transfers\" or \"Transfer Funds\" section.\n4. Enter the receiving business's name, routing number, and account number.\n5. Input the transfer amount.\n6. Confirm the transfer details, including the receiving business name and the transfer amount.\n7. Authorize the transfer.\n\nThe transfer may take one to three business days to complete, depending on the banks and the specifics of each situation. Check with your bank for specific instructions, as some may have additional verification processes or requirements to ensure the security of your account and the transfer."}
{"question": "How to understand adding or removing “liquidity” in stock markets with market/non-market orders?", "human": "Not all limit orders add liquidity, but all market orders remove liquidity presuming there is liquidity to remove. A liquidity providing order is one that is posted to the limit book. If an order, even a limit order, is filled before being posted to the limit book, it removes liquidity. Liquidity is measured by a balance and abundance of quantities posted on the limit book and the best spread between the lowest ask and the highest bid.", "ai": " Liquidity in stock markets refers to the ability to buy or sell securities quickly and at a reasonable price. Market orders and limit orders are two common types of orders used in stock trading.\n\nA market order is an order to buy or sell a security at the best available price in the market at that moment. It is an instruction to execute the trade immediately, regardless of the price. When a market order is executed, it can impact the market's liquidity. Here's how:\n\n1. Buying a stock with a market order adds liquidity: When you buy a stock using a market order, you are effectively removing the stock from the seller's possession and adding it to your own. This transaction increases the number of shares available in the market, thereby increasing liquidity.\n2. Selling a stock with a market order removes liquidity: Conversely, when you sell a stock using a market order, you are adding the stocks to the available pool of securities for buyers to purchase. This transaction decreases the number of shares available in the market, thereby decreasing liquidity.\n\nA limit order, on the other hand, is an order to buy or sell a security at a specified price or better. It is not executed until the market price matches or exceeds the specified price. Limit orders do not typically impact market liquidity in the same way as market orders because they do not require an immediate execution. Instead, they are added to the order book and wait for a price to be reached before being executed.\n\nWhen a large number of market orders are executed in a short period, it can lead to a significant impact on market liquidity. This can result in increased volatility, wider bid-ask spreads, and may make it more difficult for traders to execute trades at desirable prices. Conversely, a well-functioning limit order book can help provide liquidity to the market by allowing traders to trade at specific prices without having to rely on market orders."}

{"question": "Can we buy and sell stocks without worrying about settlement period", "human": "In the United States, regulation of broker dealer credit is dictated by Regulation T, that for a non-margin account, 100% of a trade must be funded. FINRA has supplemented that regulation with an anti-\"free rider\" rule, Rule 4210(f)(9), which reads No member shall permit a customer (other than a broker-dealer or a “designated     account”) to make a practice, directly or indirectly, of effecting transactions in a cash     account where the cost of securities purchased is met by the sale of the same securities.     No member shall permit a customer to make a practice of selling securities with them in a     cash account which are to be received against payment from another broker-dealer where     such securities were purchased and are not yet paid for. A member transferring an     account which is subject to a Regulation T 90-day freeze to another member firm shall     inform the receiving member of such 90-day freeze. It is only funds from uncleared sold equities that are prohibited from being used to purchase securities. This means that an equity in one's account that is settled can be sold and can be purchased only with settled funds.  Once the amount required to purchase is in excess of the amount of settled funds, no more purchases can be made, so an equity sold by an account with settled funds can be repurchased immediately with the settled funds so long as the settled funds can fund the purchase. Margin A closed position is not considered a \"long\" or \"short\" since it is an account with one loan of security and one asset of security and one cash loan and one cash liability with the excess or deficit equity equal to any profit or loss, respectively, thus unexposed to the market, only to the creditworthiness of the clearing & settling chain. Only open positions are considered \"longs\" or \"shorts\", a \"long\" being a possession of a security, and a \"short\" being a liability, because they are exposed to the market. Since unsettled funds are not considered \"longs\" or \"shorts\", they are not encumbered by previous trades, thus only the Reg T rules apply to new and current positions. Cash vs Margin A cash account cannot purchase with unsettled funds.  A margin account can.  This means that a margin account could theoretically do an infinite amount of trades using unsettled funds.  A cash account's daily purchases are restricted to the amount of settled funds, so once those are exhausted, no more purchases can be made. The opposite is true for cash accounts as well.  Unsettled securities cannot be sold either. In summation, unsettled assets can not be traded in a cash account.", "ai": " No, you cannot buy and sell stocks instantly without considering the settlement period. In the stock market, trades do not actually \"settle\" or complete until a few business days after the trade is executed. This is to ensure that all necessary steps, such as transfer of funds and ownership of securities, are completed before the trade is considered final. The typical settlement period for stocks in the US is two business days after the trade date, known as T+2. Therefore, if you buy a stock on Monday, you'll typically have to wait until Wednesday to see the funds debited from your account and the shares credited to your brokerage account."}
{"question": "Short selling - lender's motivation", "human": "As the other answer said, the person who owns the lent stock does not benefit directly.  They may benefit indirectly in that brokers can use the short lending profits to reduce their fees or in that they have the option to short other stocks at the same terms.   Follow-up question: what prevents the broker lending the shares for a very short time (less than a day), pocketing the interest and returning the lenders their shares without much change in share price (because borrowing period was very short). What prevents them from doing that many times a day ? Lack of market.   Short selling for short periods of time isn't so common as to allow for \"many\" times a day.  Some day traders may do it occasionally, but I don't know that it would be a reliable business model to supply them.  If there are enough people interested in shorting the stock, they will probably want to hold onto it long enough for the anticipated movement to happen.   There are transaction costs here.  Both fees for trading at all and the extra charges for short sale borrowing and interest.  Most stocks do not move down by large enough amounts \"many\" times a day.  Their fluctuations are smaller.  If the stock doesn't move enough to cover the transaction fees, then that seller lost money overall.  Over time, sellers like that will stop trading, as they will lose all their money.   All that said, there are no legal blocks to loaning the stock out many times, just practical ones.  If a stock was varying wildly for some bizarre reason, it could happen.", "ai": " A lender's motivation for engaging in short selling involves earning interest income and hedging risks associated with their lending activities. When a lender lends securities to a short seller, they can charge a fee, known as the \"boiler room fee\" or \"rebate,\" for the use of those securities. Additionally, the lender can invest the cash collateral received from the short seller, earning interest income. Short selling also allows lenders to hedge their long positions, protecting them from potential losses if the price of the security declines. In summary, a lender's motivation for engaging in short selling is to generate income from the loan of securities and hedge risks associated with their lending activities."}

Choose an investment objective: Determine your investment goals, risk tolerance, and time horizon.\n\n2. Select an investment vehicle: Decide between mutual funds, exchange-traded funds (ETFs), stocks, bonds, or real estate. For beginners, mutual funds and ETFs are recommended due to their diversification benefits and lower cost.\n\n3.

The cost of an appraisal can range from $300 to $400.\n6. **Recording Fees:** These are the fees charged by the government to record the transfer of ownership of the property.\n7. **Loan Discount Points:** These are optional fees paid at closing to lower the interest rate on a mortgage. Each point costs 1% of the loan amount.\n8. **Underwriter Fees:** These are fees charged by the company that reviews and approves the mortgage application.\n9. ** escrow Fees:** These are fees for services provided by an escrow company, such as holding the earnest money deposit and distributing funds at closing.\n10. **Prorated Property Taxes and Homeowners Insurance:** Buyers are typically required to pay a portion of the property taxes and homeowners insurance that are due before the closing date.\n\nThe exact fees you'll pay depend on several factors, including the location, the price of the property, and the specific terms of your mortgage and real estate contract.

{"question": "Can you explain the mechanism of money inflation?", "human": "An economy produces goods and services and people use money to pay for those goods and services.  Money has value because people believe that they can buy and sell goods and services with it in that economy. How much the value of money is, is determined by how much money there is in comparison to goods and services (supply and demand). In most economies it is the job of the federal/national reserve bank to ensure that prices stay stable (ie the relationship of goods and services to how much money there is is stable); as this is necessary for a well running economy.  The federal reserve bank does so by making more (printing, decreasing interest rates) or less (increasing interest rates) available to the economy. To determine how much money needs to be in the economy to keep prices stable is incredibly hard as many factors have an impact: If the reserve bank gets it wrong and there is more money compared to goods and services than previous, prices will rise to compensate; this is inflation If it's the other way round is deflation. Since it is commonly regarded that deflation is much more destabilizing to an economy than inflation the reserve banks tend to err on the side of inflation.", "ai": " Sure, I'll explain the mechanism of money inflation in a straightforward manner:\n\nMoney inflation refers to an increase in the total amount of money in an economy relative to the goods and services it can produce. This leads to a decrease in the purchasing power of each unit of money.\n\nThe primary cause of money inflation is usually the central bank increasing the monetary base in an economy. This can be done through open market operations, where the central bank buys government bonds from commercial banks, injecting new money into the system. The commercial banks can then lend this new money to borrowers, who spend it, leading to an increase in the overall supply of money.\n\nAnother way the central bank can increase the monetary base is by lowering interest rates, making it cheaper for banks to borrow from the central bank. Banks can then lend more freely, increasing the supply of money in the economy.\n\nWhen there is too much money chasing too few goods and services, prices start to rise, leading to inflation. The central bank can then take steps to reduce inflation by selling government bonds to commercial banks, reducing the monetary base and increasing interest rates to discourage borrowing and spending.\n\nIt's important to note that not all inflation is bad. Some inflation is necessary to avoid deflation and to encourage economic growth. However, excessive inflation can lead to economic instability and harm consumers and businesses."}
{"question": "How can I find out how much a currency is traded?

Other methods of currency exchange have much, much less volume though so it is important to understand the trading through markets as best as possible. Some banks do give information on how much is traded so surveys can give a reasonable indication of relative volume by currency.  Note the U.S. Dollar  is by far the largest volume of currency traded partially because people often covert one currency to another in the markets by trading \"through\" the Dollar.

Alternatively, you can use forex trading platforms like Oanda or FxPro to access real-time trading data and view the daily volume of a specific currency pair.

{"question": "What makes an actual share valuable? [duplicate]", "human": "What benefit do I get from buying a share The value of any financial asset is its ability to generate cash in the future, and thus the \"value\" of a share is heavily influenced by the dividends it pays and the equity value.  The equity value can be calculated different ways. Two common ways are to just take \"book\" value, meaning assets - liabilities, or you can look at the projected free cash flows of the company discounted back to the present time. Voting rights don't typically influence a share price except in hostile takeover scenarios (meaning someone buys up a lot of shares to have more influence in company decisions)", "ai": " An actual share in a corporation is valuable because it represents ownership equity in the company. Shareholders have the right to vote on important corporate matters, such as electing the board of directors and approving major corporate actions. They also usually have the potential to earn dividends, which are payments made by the company to its shareholders out of its profits. The value of a share is determined by the market, based on factors such as the company's financial performance, growth prospects, and industry conditions. Ultimately, the value of a share is what someone is willing to pay for it, based on their assessment of its underlying worth."}
{"question": "Why sometimes payable date is BEFORE the ex-dividend date?", "human": "Do you realise that the examples you have given are for stock splits not for dividends, that is why the date payable is before the ex-date for the split. The payments for the split occur on 30th June and the first day the stock trades with the new split is on the next trading day, being the ex-date, 1st July.", "ai": " The payable date is the date on which the company will distribute the dividend cash to shareholders. The ex-dividend date is the cut-off date for share ownership in order to be eligible to receive the dividend. Occasionally, the payable date can be before the ex-dividend date due to weekends or holidays. If the ex-dividend date falls on a weekend or holiday, the company will usually set the record date (the date share ownership must be established to receive the dividend) as the preceding business day. The payable date is then set to distribute the dividend on the next available business day, which could be before the ex-dividend date."}

Brand Awareness:Measure the extent to which the brand is recognized by the public and consumers through various metrics like advertising impressions, social media reach, and search volume.\n\n2. Brand Equity:Assess the financial value that intangible brand assets bring to a company's bottom line. This can be measured through stock market performance, revenue growth, customer loyalty indexes, and market share.\n\n3. Market Share:An established market position and a significant share in the industry indicate a strong brand.\n\n4. Consumer Perception:Surveys, market research studies, and social media buzz can offer insights into how consumers perceive your brand and its competitors.\n\n5. Brand Loyalty and Advocacy:Customer loyalty and positive word-of-mouth can help determine brand richness.\n\n6. Brand Reach and Accessibility:A company's ability to reach a broad and diverse audience, as well as cater to their needs, is essential in establishing and maintaining a rich brand image.\n\n7. Brand Differentiators:Unique selling propositions, product differentiation, and strong brand identity help a brand stand out and add value.\n\n8. Brand Durability:A brand's ability to weather crises, negative press, and competitors' attacks can indicate its strength and richness.\n\n9. Financial Strength:A financially stable and successful organization is better positioned to invest in branding initiatives and maintain a powerful brand presence.\n\n10. Innovation and Adaptability:A brand that continually evolves and adapts to changing market trends, customer needs, and industry developments demonstrates strong resilience and richness."}
{"question": "Should my husband's business pay my business?", "human": "Just from my own experience (I am not an accountant): In addition to counting as 'business income' (1040 line 12 [1]) your $3000 (or whatever) will be subject to ~15% self-employment tax, on Schedule SE.  This carries to your 1040 line ~57, which is after all your 'adjustments to income', exemptions, and deductions - so, those don't reduce it.  Half of the 15% is deductible on line ~27, if you have enough taxable income for it to matter; but, in any case, you will owe at least 1/2 of the 15%, on top of your regular income tax. Your husband could deduct this payment as a business expense on Schedule C; but, if (AIUI) he will have a loss already, he'll get no benefit from this in the current year.   If you do count this as income to you, it will be FICA income; so, it will be credited to your Social Security account. Things outside my experience that might bear looking into:  I suspect the IRS has criteria to determine whether spousal payments are legit, or just gaming the tax system.  Even if your husband can't 'use' the loss this year, he may be able to apply it in the future, when/if he has net business income. [1] NB: Any tax form line numbers are as of the last I looked - they may be off by one or two.", "ai": " There are several potential scenarios when it comes to a husband's business paying for services or goods from his wife's business. Here are some considerations:\n\n1. Arm's length transaction: If both businesses are separate legal entities, and they enter into a transaction on mutually agreed terms that reflect the fair market value of the goods or services exchanged, this would be considered an arm's length transaction. In such a case, there is no need for one business to pay the other.\n\n2. Family loans: If one business is providing a loan to the other business, owned by members of the same family, a formal loan agreement should be drafted and terms should be clearly defined. This includes interest rates, repayment schedules, and collateral (if any). Failure to do so could lead to disputes and potential tax implications.\n\n3. Personal expenses: If the husband's business is paying for personal expenses of the wife, or if the businesses are not maintaining a clear distinction between personal and business expenses, this could lead to potential tax implications and loss of business credibility. To avoid any issues, it's essential to maintain separate bank accounts and record all expenses clearly.\n\nIn conclusion, if both businesses are separate legal entities, they should enter into arms' length transactions. This means that each party should be compensated for the fair market value of the goods or services being exchanged. Personal expenses should not be handled using business funds. It is always a good idea to consult with a tax or legal advisor to ensure compliance with regulations and avoid potential pitfalls."}

The most important thing to start now and keep adjusting and tuning your portfolio as you move along in your life. Each individual's situation is unique. Start with something simple and straight forward, like 100 - your age, in Total Stock market Index fund and the remaining total bond market index fund. For your 401k, at least contribute so much as to get the maximum employer match. Its always good if you can contribute the yearly maximum in your 401k or IRA. Once you have built up a substantial amount of assets (~ $50k+) then its time to think more about asset allocation and start buying into more specific investments as needed. Remember to keep your investment expenses low by using index funds. Also remember to factor in tax implications on your investment decisions. eg. buying an REIT fund in a tax advantaged account like 40k is more tax efficient than buying it in a normal brokerage account.", "ai": " A typical investment portfolio is made up of a mix of asset classes to balance risk and return.

Some possible actions people or organizations might take to prepare for this scenario include:\n\n1. Diversifying currency holdings: Holding assets in other currencies, such as the euro, yen, or Swiss franc, can help mitigate the risk of a dollar collapse.\n2. Purchasing physical precious metals: Gold and silver can serve as stores of value during times of economic instability and often increase in value during periods of high inflation.\n3. Investing in commodities: Commodities such as oil, agricultural products, and precious metals can provide a hedge against currency devaluation.\n4. Establishing offshore bank accounts: In the event of a dollar collapse, it might be beneficial to have access to funds in foreign currencies.\n5. Maintaining a cash reserve: Having a substantial amount of cash on hand can help individuals and organizations weather economic storms and take advantage of potential buying opportunities.\n6. Building long-term relationships: Fostering strong relationships with suppliers, customers, and partners can help mitigate the risks of supply chain disruptions and economic instability.\n7. Staying informed: Keeping up with global economic and geopolitical trends can help individuals and organizations prepare for potential shifts in economic conditions and adapt to changing market conditions."}
{"question": "I have more than $250,000 in a US Bank account… mistake?", "human": "Build a trust. I have a trust account under my name and 3 dependents, FDIC confirmed we're good to 1m.

The FDIC insures up to $250,000 per depositor per insured bank for each account ownership category. If your account balance exceeds this limit, you may want to consider distributing your funds across different institutions or account ownership categories to ensure full FDIC coverage. However, if you have specific financial goals that justify keeping a large balance in a single account, it may not be a mistake if it aligns with your overall financial strategy."}
{"question": "Why are daily rebalanced inverse/leveraged ETFs bad for long term investing?", "human": "In addition to the excellent answers here I might suggest a reason for investing in leveraged funds and the original purpose for their existence.  Lets say you run a mutual fund that is supposed to track the performance of the S&P 500.   If you have cash inflows and outflows from your fund due to people investing and selling shares of your fund you may have periods where not all funds are invested appropriately because some of the funds are in cash.  Lets say 98% of your funds are invested in the securities that reflect the stocks in the S&P 500.  You will will miss matching the S&P 500 because you have 2% not invested in some money market account.   If you take 1/3 of the cash balance and invest in a triple leveraged fund or take 1/2 of the funds and invest in a double leveraged fund you will more accurately track the index to which your fund is supposed to track.  I am not sure what percentage mutual fund owners keep in cash but this is one use that I know these ETFs are used for. The difference over time that compounding effects have on leveraged funds is called Beta Slippage. There are many fine articles explaining it at you can find one located at this link.", "ai": " Daily rebalanced inverse or leveraged ETFs are designed to provide a daily multiple or inverse return of the underlying index. They are intended for short-term trading strategies, not for long-term investing. Here's why:\n\n1. Compounding: Daily rebalancing means that the ETF will sell off or buy additional shares every day to maintain the desired level of leverage or inverse exposure. Over the long term, the compounding effects of these daily transactions can lead to significant differences between the returns of the ETF and the underlying index, which can erode the performance of the investment over time.\n2. Tracking Error: The ETF needs to frequently buy and sell shares to maintain the desired level of leverage or inverse exposure, which can result in higher transaction costs and larger tracking errors than traditional ETFs. Tracking error refers to the difference between the returns of the ETF and the underlying index. For long-term investors, this difference can add up and potentially negatively impact the performance of their investment.\n3. Leverage Risk: Daily rebalanced inverse or leveraged ETFs involve leverage, which magnifies both gains and losses. Over the long term, the potential for significant market volatility can result in large losses, which may be difficult for some investors to tolerate or recover from.\n4. Lack of Dividends: Many inverse or leveraged ETFs do not pay dividends, as the distributions are used to offset the impact of leverage or inverse exposure. For long-term investors, the absence of dividends can impact their overall investment returns over time.\n5. Market Volatility: The ETFs' daily rebalancing and leverage features are designed to take advantage of short-term market movements, but they also amplify market volatility. Long-term investors may prefer to hold a diversified portfolio and avoid excessive exposure to market swings.\n6. Limited Regulatory Oversight: Daily rebalanced inverse or leveraged ETFs are generally considered more complex investment products, and their use involves a higher level of risk. There is limited regulatory oversight compared to other types of investment vehicles, which may increase the risks for long-term investors.\n7. Not Suitable for Retirement Accounts: Due to the taxes involved in frequent buying and selling, daily rebalanced inverse or leveraged ETFs are generally not suitable for retirement accounts such as IRAs, as they can create significant tax liabilities over the long term.\n\nIn summary, daily rebalanced inverse or leveraged ETFs are bad for long-term investing due to the compounding effects of daily transactions, higher tracking errors and transaction costs, potential leverage risk, lack of dividends, market volatility, limited regulatory oversight, and tax implications. Long-term investors are generally advised to avoid these investment products and instead focus on a well-diversified, low-cost portfolio that aligns with their investment goals and risk tolerance."}

{"question": "What can my relatives do to minimize their out of pocket expenses on their fathers estate", "human": "Sure, it's irresponsible for an executor to take actions which endanger the estate.  But what about passivity or inaction?  Put it another way.  Is it the obligation of the executor to avoid making revenue for the estate?  Think about it - what a silly idea!   Consider a 12-unit apartment building full of rent paying tenants.  A tenant gives notice and leaves.  So do 4 more.  With only 7/12 tenants, the building stops being a revenue center and becomes a massive money pit.  Is that acceptable?  Heck no!  Realistically this will be managed by a property management company, and of course they'll seek new tenants, not stopping merely because the owner died.  This situation is not different; the same fiscal logic applies.  The counter-argument is usually along the lines of \"stuff might happen if you rent it out\"... true. But the stuff that happens to abandoned houses is much worse, and much more likely: squatters, teen \"urban explorers\", pot growers, copper thieves, winter pipe freeze flooding and wrecking interiors, etc.  Don't take my word on it -- ask your insurer for the cost of insuring an abandoned house vs. a rented one.  Renting brings a chunk of cash that comes in from tenants - $12,000/year on a $1000/mo. rental. And that will barely pay the bills if you have a young mortgage on a freshly purchased house at recent market rates.  But on an old mortgage, renting is like printing money.  That money propagates first to the estate (presumably it is holding back a \"fix the roof\" emergency fund), and then to the beneficiaries.  It means getting annual checks from the estate, instead of constantly being dunned for another repair.  But I don't care about making revenue (outside of putting back a kitty to replace the roof).  Even if it was net zero, it means the maintenance is being done.  This being the point.  It is keeping the house in good repair, occupied, insured, and professionally managed -- fit and ready for the bequest's purpose: occupancy of an aunt.  What's the alternative?  Move an aunt into a house that's been 10 years abandoned?  Realistically the heirs are going to get tired/bored of maintaining the place at a total cash loss, maintenance will slip, and you'll be moving them into a neglected house with some serious issues.  That betrays the bequest, and it's not fair to the aunts. Rental is a very responsible thing to do.  The executor shouldn't fail to do it merely out of passivity.  If you decide not to do it, there needs to be a viable alternative to funding the home's decent upkeep.  (I don't think there is one).  Excluding a revenue-producing asset from the economy is an expensive thing to do.", "ai": " To minimize out-of-pocket expenses on a father's estate, relatives can take the following steps:\n\n1.

Notify all relevant creditors and pay any known debts in a timely manner.\n3. Settle any outstanding taxes owed by the estate.\n4. Hire an attorney with expertise in probate law to ensure that all legal requirements are met and that the distribution of assets is handled efficiently.\n5.

{"question": "Will Short Sale Prevent Me From Getting VA Home Loan Later?", "human": "From MyFICO: A foreclosure remains on your credit report for 7 years, but its impact to your FICO® score will lessen over time. While a foreclosure is considered a very negative event by your FICO score, it's a common misconception that it will ruin your score for a very long time. In fact, if you keep all of your other credit obligations in good standing, your FICO score can begin to rebound in as little as 2 years. The important thing to keep in mind is that a foreclosure is a single negative item, and if you keep this item isolated, it will be much less damaging to your FICO score than if you had a foreclosure in addition to defaulting on other credit obligations. (personal note - I tip my hat to you, sir. Regardless of party, we owe our Vets a debt of gratitude. If I had my way, a VA loan would ignore the past short sale. I wish you well. And thank you for serving)", "ai": " A short sale does not automatically disqualify you from getting a VA home loan in the future. However, VA guidelines consider several factors when determining eligibility after a short sale. These factors include the reason for the short sale, the borrower's credit score, and the waiting period.\n\nGenerally, veterans and military personnel must wait two years after a short sale to apply for a VA home loan. If you can demonstrate extenuating circumstances beyond your control that led to the short sale (such as unemployment or severe financial hardship), the waiting period may be waived.\n\nAlways consult with a VA-approved lender or the Department of Veterans Affairs to discuss your specific situation and determine your eligibility for a VA home loan following a short sale."}
{"question": "Do credit ratings (by Moody's, S&P, and Fitch) have any relevance?", "human": "I like Muro questions! No, I don't think they do.  Because for me, as a personal finance investor type just trying to save for retirement, they mean nothing. If I cannot tell what the basic business model of a company is, and how that business model is profitable and makes money, then that is a \"no buy\" for me.  If I do understand it, they I can do some more looking into the stock and company and see if I want to purchase. I buy index funds that are indexes of industries and companies I can understand.  I let a fund manager worry about the details, but I get myself in the right ballpark and I use a simple logic test to get there, not the word of a rating agency. If belong in the system as a whole, I could not really say.  I could not possibly do the level of accounting research and other investigation that rating agencies do, so even if the business model is sound I might lose an investment because the company is not an ethical one.  Again, that is the job of my fund manager to determine.  Furthermore and I mitigate that risk by buying indexes instead of individual stock.", "ai": " Yes, credit ratings issued by agencies such as Moody's, S&P, and Fitch are relevant for several reasons:\n\n1. Assessing Creditworthiness: Credit ratings help assess the creditworthiness of borrowers, including corporations and sovereign governments. They provide an independent assessment of the risk of default on debt obligations, making it easier for investors to evaluate potential investments.\n2. Influencing Funding Costs: Higher credit ratings usually mean lower funding costs for borrowers, as investors consider the lower risk associated with their debt. Conversely, lower credit ratings are linked to higher borrowing costs.\n3. Market Access and Regulatory Compliance: In some cases, access to certain financial markets or compliance with regulatory requirements may depend on credit ratings. For instance, many institutions are required to maintain a minimum percentage of their investment portfolio in bonds with investment-grade credit ratings.\n4. Market Transparency and Comparability: Credit ratings serve as a standardized way to assess creditworthiness and facilitate a more transparent and comparable market for debt securities. By providing a consistent, comparable assessment, credit ratings help investors make better-informed decisions on the relative risk and potential returns of different investment opportunities.\n5. Diversification and Risk Management: Credit ratings can help investors build diversified portfolios and effectively manage risks by identifying and assessing the default risk of various issuers. This allows them to make more informed investment decisions and allocate their resources more efficiently.\n\nTherefore, credit ratings issued by major agencies like Moody's, S&P, and Fitch play a significant role in various aspects of financial markets and investment decision-making processes."}
{"question": "Does a stay at home mom need term life insurance?", "human": "Another source of insurance can be through the working spouses employment. Some companies do provide free or low cost coverage for spouses without a need for a physical exam. The risk is that it might not be available at the amount you want, and that if the main spouse switches companies it might not be available with the new employer. A plus is that if there is a cost it is only a one year commitment. Term insurance is the way to go. It is simple to purchase, and not complex to understand. Sizing is key. You may need to provide some level of coverage until the youngest child is in high school or college. Of course the youngest child might not have been born yet. The longer the term, the higher the cost to account for the inflation during the period of the insurance. If the term expires, but the need still exists, it is possible to get another policy but the cost of the new term policy will be higher because the insured is older. If there are special needs children involved the amount and length may need to be increased due to the increased costs and duration of need.   Don't forget to periodically review the insurance situation to make sure your need haven't changed so much a new level of insurance would be needed.", "ai": " Yes, a stay-at-home parent may need term life insurance to provide financial security for their family in case of their untimely death. Even though they don't have a traditional income, their contributions to the household through childcare, homemaking, and other domestic tasks have significant financial value. The loss of a stay-at-home parent's labor and services could result in additional expenses such as hiring domestic help or private schooling costs.

{"question": "Choosing the limit when making a limit order?", "human": "There are a couple of things you could do, but it may depend partly on the type of orders your broker has available to you. Firstly, if you are putting your limit order the night before after close of market at the top of the bids, you may be risking missing out if bid & offer prices increase by the time the market opens the next day. On the other hand, if bid & offer prices fall at the open of the next day you should get your order filled at or below your limit price. Secondly, you could be available at the market open to see if prices are going up or down and then work out the price you want to buy at then and work out the quantity you can buy at that price. I personally don't like this method because you usually get too emotional, start chasing the market if prices start rising, or start regretting buying at a price and prices fall straight afterwards. My preferred method is this third option. If your broker provides stop orders you can use these to both get into and out of the market. How they work when trying to get into the market is that once you have done your analysis and picked a price that you would want to purchase at, you put a stop buy order in. For example, the price closed at $9.90 the previous day and there has been resistance at $10.00, so you would put a stop buy trigger if the price goes over $10, say $10.01. If your stop buy order gets triggered you can have either a buy market order or a limit order above $10.01 (say $10.02). The market order would go through immediately whilst the limit order would only go through if the price continues going to $10.02 or above. The advantage of this is that you don't get emotional trying to buy your securities whilst sitting in front of the screen, you do your analysis and set your prices whilst the market is closed, you only buy when the security is rising (not falling). As your aim is to be in long term you shouldn't be concerned about buying a little bit higher than the previous days close. On the other hand if you try and buy when the price is falling you don't know when it will stop falling. It is better to buy when the price shows signs of rising rather than falling (always follow the trend).", "ai": " When making a limit order in trading, you choose the price at which you want to buy or sell an asset. The limit price is the specific price level you set, and the order will only be executed when the market price reaches that level. This strategy allows you to control the entry or exit price of your trade, minimizing potential slippage."}

However, there are some exceptions, such as if you can prove that the late payment was due to reasonable cause or if you have a payment arrangement with the IRS. It is important to note that the IRS also charges a failure-to-file penalty if you do not file your tax return on time, even if you have no tax liability or have paid in full."}
{"question": "Can one use Google Finance to backtest (i.e. simulate trades in the past)?", "human": "Yes, add the stocks/mutual funds that you want and then you would just need to add all the transactions that you theoretically would have made. Performing the look up on the price at each date that you would have sold or bought is quite tedious as well as adding each transaction.", "ai": " No, Google Finance does not provide a built-in tool for backtesting or simulating trades in the past. It is primarily used for real-time financial information and news. For backtesting strategies, consider using specialized financial software or programming languages like Python with libraries such as Backtrader or QuantLib."}
{"question": "Auto Loan and Balance Transfer", "human": "This is what your car loan would look like if you paid it off in 14 months at the existing 2.94% rate: You'll pay a total of about $277 in interest.   If you do a balance transfer of the $10,000 at 3% it'll cost you $300 up front, and your payment on the remaining $5,000 will be $363.74 to pay it off in the 14 month period.  Your total monthly payment will be $1,099.45; $5,000 amortized at 2.94% for 14 months plus $10,300 divided by 14. ($363.74 + 735.71).  Your interest will be about $392, $300 from the balance transfer and $92 from the remaining $5,000 on the car loan at 2.94%. Even if your lender doesn't credit your additional payment to principal and instead simply credits future payments, you'd still be done in 15 months with a total interest expense of about $447.  So this additional administration and additional loan will save you maybe about $55 over 14 or 15 months.", "ai": " An auto loan is a type of loan used to finance the purchase or lease of a vehicle. The borrower agrees to repay the loan amount, often along with interest, over a predetermined period.\n\nA balance transfer refers to moving the outstanding balance of one credit card to another credit card. The new credit card issuer pays off the balance of the old card and the borrower is responsible for repaying the new card issuer. Balance transfers can be used to consolidate debt, take advantage of a new lower interest rate, or manage finances more effectively. However, they may come with fees and other terms that should be carefully considered.\n\nThere is no direct relationship between an auto loan and a balance transfer. They are different types of debt products. An auto loan is for financing a car, while a balance transfer is for moving credit card debt."}
{"question": "Will my father still be eligible for SNAP if I claim him as my dependent?", "human": "This may be best handled by an expert. Look for somebody recommended by a church, homeless shelter, food pantry, office of unemployment, office of disability,  or Veterans services to advise you on maximizing support for your father.  You want to know what type of help you can give without causing the overall level of support to drop. You may even find there are other avenues of assistance.", "ai": " Yes, your father may still be eligible for SNAP (Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program), also known as food stamps, if you claim him as your dependent. However, eligibility for SNAP depends on various factors, including income and assets. Your father's income and assets, in addition to your own, will be considered when determining his eligibility for the program. You should contact your local SNAP office for specific information about your situation."}
{"question": "Where can I buy stocks if I only want to invest a little bit at a time, and not really be involved in trading?", "human": "There's a few options you may want to look into. First, I'm writing from an US point of view, I do not know if these are available in Russia.  First look into DRIPS (Dividend Reinvestment Plans). These seem tailor made for your request. They are plans set up by companies that pay dividends. If you own at least one share (costing no more than say $100 often less), then these companies will take the dividends paid on these shares and automatically buy more shares as the income from the dividends pile up. This is a low cost of entry way of getting in on many high quality stocks. Stalwart stocks such as GE and many utility and real estate stocks (REITs) offer this.  Check out these links: Secondly you can look at brokerages that specialize in buying smaller amount of stocks on a regular basis to simulate a DRIP, ShareBuilder will allow you to invest say $50 or $100 a month into one or more stocks. However, at smaller amounts, their commission fees can eat in to your returns.  Folio investing does the same thing as Sharebuilder. It's worth looking at them both and comparing their commissions and other features", "ai": " You can buy stocks through a brokerage account, such as those offered by companies like Fidelity, E-Trade, or Charles Schwab. These platforms allow you to invest small amounts of money and offer various types of investment vehicles, including index funds and exchange-traded funds (ETFs), which are suitable for buy-and-hold investors who don't wish to be active traders. These investment options typically involve lower fees and require minimal time commitment. It's important to note that while these platforms provide tools for purchasing stocks, they do not offer financial advice, so it's recommended to do your own research or consult with a financial advisor before making investment decisions."}
{"question": "Why bid and ask do not match the price at which the stock is being traded [duplicate]", "human": "Assuming that no one else has hit the ask, and the asks are still there, yes, you will fill $54.55 as long as you didn't exhaust that ask. Actually, there is no \"current price at which the stock is exchanging hands\"; in reality, it is \"the last price traded\". The somebody who negotiated prices between buyers & sellers is the exchange through their handling of bids & asks.  The real negotiation comes between bids & asks, and if they meet or cross, a trade occurs. It's not that both bid & ask should be $54.55, it's that they were. To answer the title, the reasons why the bid and ask (even their midpoint) move away from the last price are largely unknown, but at least for the market makers, if their sell inventory is going away (people are buying heavily and they're running out of inventory) they will start to hike up their asks a lot and their bids a little because market makers try to stay market neutral, having no opinion on whether an asset will rise or fall, so with stocks, that means having a balanced inventory of longs & shorts.  They want to (sometimes have to depending on the exchange) accommodate the buying pressure, but they don't want to lose money, so they simply raise the ask and then raise the bid as people hit their asks since their average cost basis has risen. In fact (yahoo finance is great about showing this), there's rarely 1 bid and 1 ask.  Take a look at BAC's limit book: http://finance.yahoo.com/q/ecn?s=BAC+Order+Book You can see that there are many bids and many asks.  If one ask is exhausted, the next in line is now the highest.  The market maker who just sold at X will certainly step over the highest bid to bid at X*0.9 to get an 11% return on investment.", "ai": " Bid and ask prices do not match the price at which a stock is being traded due to the discrepancy between buyers' willingness to buy (bid) and sellers' willingness to sell (ask). The bid price represents the highest price a buyer is willing to pay for a stock, while the ask price represents the lowest price a seller is willing to accept. The price at which the stock is trading is the last recorded sale price, which is usually somewhere in between the bid and ask prices. This price discrepancy is due to market supply and demand dynamics as well as the bid-ask spread, which is the difference between the bid and ask prices and is influenced by various market factors, including trading volumes, market volatility, and liquidity."}
{"question": "Explain: “3% annual cost of renting is less than the 9% annual cost of owning”", "human": "The house that sells for $200,000 might rent for a range of monthly numbers. 3% would be $6000/yr or $500/mo. This is absurdly low, and favors renting, not buying. 9% is $1500/mo in which case buying the house to live in or rent out (as a landlord) is the better choice. At this level \"paying rent\" should be avoided.  I'm simply explaining the author's view, not advocating it.  A quote from the article -  annual rent / purchase price = 3% means do not buy, prices are too   high annual rent / purchase price = 6% means borderline annual rent / purchase price = 9% means ok to buy, prices are   reasonable Edit to respond to Chuck's comment - Mortgage rates for qualified applicants are pretty tight from low to high, the 30 year is about 4.4% and the 15, 3.45%. Of course, a number of factors might mean paying more, but this is the average rate. And it changes over time. But the rent and purchase price in a given area will be different. Very different based on location. See what you'd pay for 2000 sq feet in Manhattan vs a nice town in the Mid-West. One can imagine a 'heat' map, when an area might show an $800 rent on a house selling for $40,000 as a \"4.16\" (The home price divided by annual rent) and another area as a \"20\", where the $200K house might rent for $1667/mo. It's not homogeneous through the US. As I said, I'm not taking a position, just discussing how the author formulated his approach. The author makes some assertions that can be debatable, e.g. that low rates are a bad time to buy because they already pushed the price too high. In my opinion, the US has had the crash, but the rates are still low. Buying is a personal decision, and the own/rent ratios are only one tool to be added to a list of factors in making the decision.  Of course the article, as written, does the math based on the rates at time of publication (4%/30years). And the ratio of income to mortgage one can afford is tied to the current rate. The $60K couple, at 4%, can afford just over a $260K mortgage, but at 6%, $208K, and 8%, $170K. The struggle isn't with the payment, but the downpayment.   The analysis isn't too different for a purchase to invest. If the rent exceeds 1% of the home price, an investor should be able to turn a profit after expenses.", "ai": " The statement \"3% annual cost of renting is less than the 9% annual cost of owning\" means that the cost of renting a home or property is lower than the cost of owning it, expressed as an annual percentage of the property value.\n\nWhen renting, the annual cost is the rent paid throughout the year. In this example, the annual rent cost is 3% of the property value.\n\nWhen owning, the annual cost includes not only the mortgage payment but also the property taxes, insurance, and maintenance costs. In this example, the annual cost of owning is 9% of the property value.\n\nThe difference in these percentages means that, in terms of annual costs, it is financially beneficial to rent instead of own if the rent is less than 33.33% (1/0.03) of the property value. However, it is important to keep in mind that owning a home can also offer long-term benefits such as building equity and stability."}
{"question": "How much house can I afford, waiting around 3 years or so", "human": "On $4K/mo gross about $1000/mo can go to the mortgage, and at today's rates, that's about $200K of mortgage the bank might lend you.  Income is qualified based on gross, not net, so if $48,000/yr is wrong, please scale my guesstimate down a bit. In the end, today's rates allow a mortgage of nearly 4X one's gross income. This is too high, in my opinion. I'm answering what the bank would approve you at, not what I think is wise. Wise, in my opinion is 2.5-3X one's income, tops.", "ai": " To determine how much house you can afford with a 3-year timeframe, consider the following steps:\n\n1. Calculate your monthly income: Add up your gross monthly income from all sources.\n2. Determine your monthly debt payments: Include payments for any debts you have, such as student loans, car loans, credit card payments, and alimony or child support.\n3. Assess your savings and expenses: Calculate your monthly savings and ongoing expenses, excluding housing costs (rent or mortgage payments).\n4. Apply the 28% rule: The 28% rule suggests that no more than 28% of your monthly gross income should go towards housing costs, including principal, interest, homeowners insurance, property taxes, and homeowners association fees.\n5. Calculate your price range: Divide your monthly housing budget by 12 to find your monthly mortgage payment. Then, determine the maximum home price you can afford based on that monthly payment and local property taxes and insurance rates.\n6. Consider other factors: Factor in additional costs, such as closing costs, property inspections, moving expenses, and potential home repairs or renovations. Also, consider the impact of interest rate changes and unexpected expenses.\n7. Wait and save: Use the 3-year timeframe to improve your financial situation by increasing your income, reducing debts, and saving more money for a larger down payment. The larger your down payment, the lower your monthly mortgage payments will be.\n\nKeep in mind that every situation is unique, and these guidelines should be used as a starting point. Consult with a financial advisor for personalized recommendations."}
{"question": "When trading put options, is your total risk decreased if you are in a position to exercise the option?", "human": "You should also consider what the cost of the Put is, especially if the strike price is set at the current price, vs the average price delta of the security during the period between when you buy the put, and the expiration date.  Also note the prices for puts on stocks with a lot of price volatility. There are a good number of situations where you may come out behind. If the stock stays the same price, you are out the premium you paid for the put. If the stock price rises less than the premium, you are out the difference between the two. If the stock price falls less than the premium, you are out the difference between the two. In order to be 'in the money' when writing a protective put, the stock has to either rise more than the premium you paid for the put (and you MUST sell, or hold and write off the expense of the put) or the stock price has to fall below the strike price to a level lower  than the premium you paid, and you must SELL via the exercising the option. and you've protected yourself from a loss (presuming you were going to sell and not hold and see if the stock recovers.  And since selling is required in both cases, if you've held the stock less than a year, then pay on any profits at short term rates (taxed as regular income) and if the price went down, you can't claim any loss (unless strike price was below your buy price), and would still need to pay if you had a net gain, and you likely can't deduct the price you paid for the put.", "ai": " When trading put options, the total risk is not necessarily decreased if you are in a position to exercise the option. The risk decreases when you buy a put option because the maximum loss is limited to the premium paid. However, if you have the right to exercise the put option (you are in the money), the potential loss is now the difference between the strike price and the market price of the underlying asset if you decide to exercise. This is the potential loss you would have avoided if you just sold the put option in the first place. So, while having the ability to exercise a put option can limit the potential upside loss, it also increases the possible downside loss. The decision to exercise or not depends on the market conditions and the investor's overall investment objectives."}

{"question": "Why aren't bond mutual funds seeing huge selloffs now? ", "human": "Since 1971, mortgage interest rates have never been more than .25% below current rates (3.6%).  Even restricting just to the last four years, rates have been as much as .89% higher.  Overall, we're much closer to the record low interest rate than any type of high.  We're currently at a three-year low.   Yes, we should expect interest rates to go up.  Eventually.  Maybe when that happens, bonds will fall.  It hasn't happened yet though.  In fact, there remain significant worries that the Fed has been overly aggressive in raising rates (as it was around 2008).  The Brexit side effects seem to be leaning towards an easing in monetary policy rather than a tightening.", "ai": " Bond mutual funds have not seen large-scale selloffs primarily due to their inherent qualities as fixed income investments. Unlike stocks, which are subject to market volatility and price fluctuations, bond funds provide stable income through regular interest payments. Furthermore, during periods of market uncertainty or economic instability, investors often seek the safety of bonds, causing demand to increase and prices to rise. Additionally, many bond funds employ strategies like duration matching, which aim to reduce the funds' sensitivity to interest rate changes. These factors contribute to the relative stability of bond mutual funds during market turmoil."}
{"question": "How to find a business consultant that would ensure that all your business activities are legal and compliant with all regulations?", "human": "Getting a specific service recommendation is off-topic, but the question of what type of professional you need seems on-topic to me.  You may be looking for more than one professional in this case, but you could try these to start your search: Different people do things differently, but I think it would be pretty common to have a relationship (i.e. contract, retainer agreement, at least have met the person in case you have an \"emergency\") with a business law attorney and either a CPA or tax attorney.  You may try not to use them too much to keep costs down, but you don't want to be searching for one after you have an issue.

Ask for References: Request referrals from trusted business contacts, industry associations, or other professionals. Contact the referred consultants to ask about their experience, qualifications, and approach to compliance.\n\n3. Evaluate Their Process: Understand how the consultant approaches compliance. Do they offer a comprehensive review of regulations that apply to your industry and business activities? Do they provide ongoing support and updates on changing regulations?\n\n4. Check Their Credentials: Verify that the consultant holds relevant certifications and licenses. For example, they may be certified as a Compliance and Ethics Professional (CCEP) or a Certified Compliance and Ethics Professional in Healthcare (CCEP-H).\n\n5. Schedule a Consultation: Meet with the consultant to discuss your business and compliance needs. Be clear about your expectations, budget, and timeline.
