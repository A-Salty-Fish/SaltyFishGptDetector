Please let me know.", "ai": " To alleviate dry skin, bumps, and itchiness in the pubic area after shaving, follow these steps:\n\n1. Exfoliate: Use a gentle body scrub once or twice a week to remove dead skin cells and prevent ingrown hairs.\n2. Shave properly: Make sure your skin is moisturized before shaving. Use a shaving cream or gel to create a slippery layer between the razor and your skin. Shave in the direction of hair growth, and avoid pressing too hard with the razor.\n3. Post-shave care: Rinse your skin with cool water and pat it dry gently with a clean towel. Apply a fragrance-free lotion or oil to keep your skin hydrated and soothed.\n4. Inspect your skin regularly: If you notice persistent itching, redness, or pus-filled bumps, consult a healthcare professional to rule out any underlying skin conditions or infections. It is essential to maintain good hygiene, especially in the genital area, to prevent the development of infections. If you experience regular or severe symptoms, consider talking to a healthcare provider for further advice.\n\nWhile it is normal for some dryness, bumps, and itchiness to occur after shaving, chronic or severe symptoms may indicate an underlying issue. Regular self-examination and proper shaving techniques can help minimize these issues. However, if your symptoms persist or worsen, do not hesitate to consult a healthcare professional for further evaluation and guidance."}

{"question": "What causes lump near groin?I have a lump near my groin. It seems to be a swollen lymph node but it s also showing signs of being a hernia. Is there any way I can figure it which one it may be before going to the doctor, if needed. And if it is a lymph node, will things like straining, masturbation, or further irritation make it worse?", "human": "Hi ! Good evening. I am Dr Shareef answering your query.It could only be known by clinical examination of the lump by your family physician/general surgeon whether it is a lymph node or a hernia. A hernia would be reducible unless it has become irreducible, and also the location would be different. Straining might increase the size of a hernia, but would not cause any difference to a lymph node swelling. If the lymphadenitis is due to some kind of infection being spread by any of the draining areas like the lower limb, or genitalia, it might get smaller and relieved by anti inflammatory and antibiotic drugs, but there would be no effect on hernia by these. At the end I would advise you to get yourself assessed by your family physician or a general surgeon to be certain of the aetiology of the lump.I hope this information would help you in discussing with your family physician/treating doctor in further management of your problem. Please do not hesitate to ask in case of any further doubts.Thanks for choosing health care magic to clear doubts on your health problems. I wish you an early recovery. Dr Shareef.", "ai": " A lump near the groin can be caused by various conditions such as a swollen lymph node, hernia, or hip inflammation. While it's important to note that self-diagnosis can be inaccurate and potentially dangerous, there are some signs that might help you distinguish between a swollen lymph node and a hernia:\n\n1. Swollen lymph node: Typically, a swollen lymph node is hard, rounded, and tender to the touch. It usually moves under the skin when pressed. The presence of other symptoms, such as fever, chills, or redness, may also point to an infection causing the swollen lymph node.\n\n2. Hernia: A hernia is typically described as a bulge or a lump that appears when standing up or straining. It is usually painless when at rest but may cause discomfort or pain when lifting heavy objects, straining, or coughing. A hernia might be reducible or non-reducible. A reducible hernia can be pushed back into the abdominal cavity, while a non-reducible hernia cannot.\n\nRegarding your question about making things worse, generally speaking, straining, masturbation, or further irritation may exacerbate a swollen lymph node due to increased inflammation. In contrast, a hernia itself is not worsened by these activities. However, straining due to chronic constipation could potentially worsen an inguinal hernia. If you are unsure about the cause of your lump and are experiencing concerning symptoms, it's always best to consult a healthcare professional for an accurate diagnosis and appropriate treatment."}

GE needs complete evaluation by a developmental pediatrician.Regards - Do. Sumanth", "ai": " At 26 months old, a child's speech development can vary. Some children may have clear pronunciation while others may still struggle with certain sounds. Your son's ability to follow instructions despite difficulty with pronunciation is not uncommon. He may be using context or body language to convey his message.\n\nHowever, if you are having trouble understanding your son, consider the following:\n\n1. Observe his speech patterns: Try to understand the context of what your son is trying to say, and look for repeated sounds or words that can help you piece together his message.\n2. Use visual aids: Show him objects and label them, allowing him to associate the name of the object with the sound.\n3. Encourage repetition: Repeat the words back to him and encourage him to repeat them. This can help him practice pronunciation.\n4. Read to him regularly: Reading aloud helps children develop better pronunciation skills.\n5. Speak clearly and slowly: Speak clearly and slowly around your child, allowing him to hear the correct pronunciation of words.\n6. Consider getting a speech therapist: If you are still having trouble understanding your son after a few months, it may be worth consulting a speech therapist to assess his speech development and provide strategies to improve pronunciation.\n\nKeep in mind that each child develops at their own pace, and it's normal for there to be some variation in speech development. However, if you have any concerns, it's always a good idea to seek the advice of a health care professional."}

If you have further questions i will be happy to help you.", "ai": " High SGPT (Alanine Aminotransferase) and SGOT (Aspartate Aminotransferase) levels can be caused by several conditions:\n\n1. Hepatocellular injury: This is the most common cause of elevated SGPT and SGOT levels. It can be due to various reasons like viral hepatitis, alcohol consumption, drugs (like Dilipid 300 you mentioned), and metabolic disorders.\n2. Cholestatic liver disease: This condition affects the flow of bile from the liver to the intestines, leading to an increase in SGPT and SGOT levels. Gallstones, primary biliary cirrhosis, and primary sclerosing cholangitis are some causes of cholestatic liver disease.\n3. Muscle damage: SGPT is mainly found in the liver, but it is also present in skeletal and cardiac muscles. So, muscle damage can cause an increase in SGPT levels. SGOT is mainly found in the heart and skeletal muscles.\n4. Obesity: Fatty liver, as seen in your case, is a common cause of elevated SGPT and SGOT levels.\n5. Other causes: Other causes of elevated SGPT and SGOT levels include infections, autoimmune disorders, and genetic conditions.\n\nYour doctor should consider these possibilities and perform further investigations to determine the cause of your high SGPT and SGOT levels. You may need additional tests like CT scan, MRI, or biopsy to rule out other liver diseases."}
{"question": "What causes tightness around my chest while eating?hiI recently started having tightness around chest while eating food. Yesterday night I felt so full after my regular dinner and tightness in my chest . Let me know what is wrong. Does consuming hot food make this happen? I have thyroid and is the only medication I take. .25mg capsules.", "human": "Thanks for your question on Health Care Magic. I can understand your concern. In my opinion, you are mostly having GERD (gastroesophageal reflux disease). It is due to laxity of gastroesophageal sphincter. Because of this the acid of the stomach tends to come up in the esophagus and cause the symptoms of Central chest pain, fullness, chest pressure etc. So better to follow these steps. 1. Avoid stress and tension. 2. Avoid large meals, instead take frequent small meals. Avoid hot and spicy food. Avoid junk food. 3. Start proton pump inhibitors and prokinetic drugs. 4. Go for walk after meals. 5. Keep 2-3 pillows under head in the bed to prevent reflux. 6. Loose weight if you are obese. 7. Quit smoking and alcohol if you have these habits. Don't worry, you will be alright. Hope I have solved your query. Wish you good health. Thanks.", "ai": " The tightness around your chest while eating is not necessarily related to consuming hot food. However, in some cases, this symptom can be caused by gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD), which is characterized by the backflow of stomach contents into the esophagus. This can cause a burning sensation in the chest, often referred to as heartburn, and may also lead to a feeling of tightness or discomfort in the chest. Other possible causes of chest tightness while eating include angina (chest pain caused by reduced blood flow to the heart), anxiety or panic attacks, and musculoskeletal problems. If you have a history of thyroid issues or are taking thyroid medication, it's important to discuss any new or worsening symptoms with your healthcare provider. They can help determine the cause and recommend appropriate treatment. In the meantime, avoiding large meals, spicy or greasy foods, and lying down after meals may help alleviate symptoms of GERD."}
{"question": "Is elevated PSA level symptom of cancer?HI I recently finished a 21 day course of cipro for an elevated psa of 4.46 which was discovered in May. The end result was an increase of my psa to over 5. I might add that I am 66 years old and less than a year ago my count was 2.9. I am to have a biopsy done in one weeks time. Does this signal that I have cancer?", "human": "High PSA levels can also be due conditions other than prostate cancer like : prostatitis,  enlarged prostate, etc. Clinical examination and imaging studies like Ultrasound may be advised to pinpoint the cause along with biopsy. Examination of tissue under the microscope is always the definitive diagnosis of prostate cancer.", "ai": " An elevated PSA level can be a sign of prostate cancer, but it does not necessarily mean that you have cancer. Other conditions, such as inflammation of the prostate or benign enlargement, can also cause an elevated PSA level. A biopsy is the most reliable way to determine if cancer is present. The fact that your PSA level has increased after taking antibiotics suggests that there may be an infection or inflammation affecting your prostate, but further testing is needed to determine the cause. It's important to discuss these results and your concerns with your healthcare provider, who can provide more information and guidance based on your individual medical history and test results."}

{"question": "Could the chin numbness be associated with diarrhea?My mom has been experiencing chin numbness off and on for a few weeks now. She also thought she had an intestinal bug. However, she still has diarrhea and it's been almost 2 weeks. Could the numbness in her chin be associated in any way with her belly issues. She is 76 and diabetic.", "human": "Hello!My name is Dr. Aida and I am glad to attend you on Healthcaremagic!Regarding your concern, you should know that diarrhea, which is not related to any infection, could be explained by autonomic nervous system dysfunction in diabetic persons. The chin numbness could be related to a pinched nerve, which is a common condition in diabetic persons too. So, there is no direct connection between the two conditions, but diabetes, may lead to this complex clinical situation. Anyway, I would first recommend performing a stool analysis to exclude any possible GI infection. It is also necessary to closely monitor her blood electrolytes to investigate for any electrolyte imbalance caused by diarrhea. A good hydration and a lot of electrolytes are necessary in her condition. Hope you will find this answer helpful!Best regards!", "ai": " Yes, there is a possibility that chin numbness could be associated with diarrhea in certain conditions. One possible explanation is that both chin numbness and diarrhea could be symptoms of a condition called ganglionic neuroosis or paraganglioma. These conditions can cause autonomic dysfunction, which can result in symptoms such as orthostatic hypotension, diarrhea, and chin numbness. However, it is important to note that this is a rare cause of both symptoms, and other more common explanations should be considered first.\n\nAnother possible explanation is that chronic diarrhea can lead to dehydration, which can cause symptoms such as dizziness, lightheadedness, and numbness in the chin. This is because the body's fluid levels are not balanced, and the brain may not be receiving enough blood flow, leading to these symptoms.\n\nIt is important that your mom sees a healthcare professional for an evaluation. They can perform a thorough examination and order the appropriate tests to determine the underlying cause of her symptoms. In the meantime, she should continue to stay hydrated by drinking plenty of fluids, and manage her diabetes carefully to avoid further complications."}

MS is a complex disease with no single diagnostic test, and doctors rely on a combination of clinical examination, imaging studies, and laboratory tests to make a definitive diagnosis.\n\nHowever, there are conditions that may mimic MS and could be suggested by certain blood tests. For example, certain infections, vitamin deficiencies, or other neurological conditions can present with symptoms similar to MS. In some cases, these conditions might be identified through blood tests, which could then lead to a different diagnosis.\n\nIt's essential to keep in mind that the likelihood of an alternative diagnosis being considered based on blood tests alone is relatively low, and the majority of people with suspected MS eventually receive a confirmed diagnosis of the condition.\n\nIf you have specific concerns about your diagnosis, it's best to discuss these with your neurologist directly, as they can provide more context and reassurance based on your individual case."}

Lymphedema occurs when lymph fluid accumulates in the tissues, causing swelling. The stiffness and pain could be a symptom of this condition.\n2. Peripheral artery disease (PAD): Chemotherapy can damage the blood vessels, including those in the legs. PAD occurs when blood flow to the muscles in the legs is reduced, leading to pain and stiffness when walking and cramps during the night.\n3. Fluid retention: Chemotherapy can cause the body to retain fluids, leading to swelling in the legs and feet. The stiffness and pain could be due to this fluid buildup.\n4. Neuropathy: Chemotherapy can damage the nerves, causing neuropathy. This condition can result in muscle weakness, cramps, and stiffness, as well as numbness or tingling in the legs and feet.\n5.

However, I cannot provide a definitive answer without reviewing the entire report or consulting with a radiologist or medical professional who has examined you in person.\n\nGenerally speaking, a small amount of lumbar lordosis (the inward curvature of the lower spine) is normal and helps support the weight of the upper body. However, excessive lordosis or a significant change in the degree of lordosis can be a sign of certain medical conditions, such as spondylolisthesis or ankylosing spondylitis. Therefore, if your MRI report shows a significant straightening of lumbar lordosis, it could be a possible concern, and further evaluation by a healthcare professional is recommended.\n\nRegarding your second question, there are various over-the-counter and prescription treatments for acne that have been proven to be effective. Some common ingredients found in acne creams and ointments include salicylic acid, benzoyl peroxide, and retinoids. However, individual response to these treatments can vary, and some people may experience side effects or irritation. It's essential to follow the instructions on the label carefully and consult with a dermatologist or healthcare professional if you experience any adverse effects or if your acne persists despite treatment.\n\nFor people in India, some effective acne treatments that are available over the counter include:\n\n1. Himalaya Clear Fairness Face Wash: It contains neem extract, turmeric, and manjistha, known for their anti-acne and anti-inflammatory properties. Regular use can help reduce the appearance of acne and improve skin tone.\n\n2. Dabur Vatika Pudina Face Pack: This herbal face pack contains a blend of mint, neem, and tulsi, which help to soothe irritated skin and reduce acne. It's a natural alternative for those looking for an effective and chemical-free acne treatment.\n\n3. VeggieSafe Neem Face Pack: Neem is a well-known herb for its antibacterial and anti-inflammatory properties. This face pack contains powdered neem leaves, which can be mixed with water or rose water to make a paste. Regular use can help reduce the number of acne-causing bacteria, clear pores, and improve overall skin health.\n\nI hope this information is helpful!

Some children may experience enuresis due to food intolerances or sensitivities, often associated with specific food groups such as dairy, soy, wheat, eggs, or artificial additives.\n\nTo investigate potential food intolerances, you can follow these steps:\n- Keep a food diary: Record what your son eats and when he experiences enuresis episodes. Identifying patterns may help in determining if certain foods are contributing to the problem.\n- Elimination diet: Remove the suspected food groups from your son's diet for at least 2-4 weeks. Observe if there's any improvement in his enuresis symptoms during this period. Re-introduce them one by one to identify any specific food that may be causing the issue.\n- Consult a healthcare professional or dietitian: They can provide you with accurate advice, support, and guidance in managing the elimination diet, as well as recommend appropriate supplements (if needed) to ensure a balanced diet.\n\nRegarding food allergy tests, they are typically carried out by healthcare professionals like allergists or pediatricians. They may offer different types of tests such as skin prick tests, blood tests, or food challenge tests to accurately diagnose food allergies. You should speak with your doctor or healthcare provider to explore the available options and schedule an appointment if necessary.\n\nKeep in mind that food intolerances and sensitivities are different from food allergies. While elimination diets can be helpful in managing enuresis related to food intolerances, they are usually less effective for children with food allergies, as exposure to even small traces of the allergen can still trigger symptoms. In that case, consultation with a healthcare professional or allergist is crucial to ensure proper diagnosis and management."}

Till then try to drink lots of water as if its a stone or constipation the symptoms will reduce.Hope this helps.Take care.", "ai": " Based on the information provided, the abdominal cramps during your menstrual cycle could be due to several reasons, including:\n\n1. Dysmenorrhea: This is a common condition where women experience painful cramps, often accompanied by back pain, before and during menstruation. It is usually caused by the contraction of the uterus.\n2. Ovarian cysts: If you have a history of ovarian cysts or have recently developed them, they could cause abdominal and back pain, particularly during menstruation.\n3. Endometriosis: This condition occurs when the tissue that lines the uterus grows outside of it and causes inflammation and pain, particularly during menstruation.\n4. Pelvic inflammatory disease (PID): This is an infection of the reproductive organs that can cause pain, including abdominal and back pain, especially during menstruation.\n5. Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS): While not directly related to menstruation, IBS can cause abdominal cramps and pain, especially after consuming certain foods or during stressful situations.\n\nIt is important to note that these are just possibilities based on the information given. Therefore, I would recommend consulting a healthcare professional for a proper diagnosis and treatment options, especially if the pain is severe or worsening. Additionally, if you have a fever, heavy vaginal bleeding, or other concerning symptoms, seek medical attention immediately."}
{"question": "Suggest treatment for overlapping toes deformity in childrenI m a nursing student. While observing a youtube video, also saw overlapping toes deformity bilaterally on child. Child was undernourished and very small for age. Not familiar with this birth defect. Surgery was off the table at that time. What are possible treatments?", "human": "the most common reason for toes to be deformed at a young age is a tendon imbalance between the flexors and extensors of the foot. for example, having a high arch or a cavus type foot, leads to the extensor tendons bowstringing and hammertoe formation. Using a custom orthotic from a foot and ankle specialist may help balance deforming forces. others have advocated taping the toes in an improved position but I never tape children's toes as it potentially can strangulate the toes and cause gangrene. with a certain type of flatfoot, the fourth and fifth toes turn inward due to imbalance of intrinsic tendons of the foot. although these may be cosmetically unappealing I would never consider surgery until all growth plates close after around 18 years of age, and usually don't ever cause negative symptoms", "ai": " Splinting or taping the toes into normal position is a common non-surgical treatment for overlapping toes deformity in children. Properly fitting orthotic devices may also be recommended to help correct the position of the toes. Stretching exercises and massaging the affected toes can help improve mobility and flexibility. A balanced diet and regular exercise can help promote healthy growth and development of the child's feet. Consulting a podiatrist or orthopedic specialist for further evaluation and guidance is also recommended."}

Factors such as these can impact fertility, but they do not necessarily mean that you cannot conceive.\n\nRegarding your friend's suggestion to take Glycomet (a medication used to treat diabetes) for pregnancy, there is no scientific evidence to support this claim. Glycomet is not a fertility medication and is not indicated for use in trying to conceive.\n\nTo determine your options for having a child, I would recommend consulting with fertility specialists who can evaluate both you and your husband. They may recommend various treatments, such as hormone therapy for thyroid conditions, intrauterine insemination (IUI), or in vitro fertilization (IVF), depending on the causes of your infertility.\n\nIt's important to note that seeking professional help for infertility can be a lengthy and emotional process, and it may take some time and effort to find the right team of healthcare providers.

It is better in the morning. and worse at night.", "human": "Hello!Thank you for the query. Fluid itself does not cause the pain as abdominal cavity constantly produces it as well. Its more the shunt itself causing the pain. You should always be aware of infection which it can cause as well as adhesions around it.I suggest you to consult your surgeon and consider shunt relocation. You should also have abdominal ultrasound, CRP and blood work checked.Hope this will help.Regards.", "ai": " The pain you're experiencing in the area where the shunt is placed could be caused by several factors related to your condition and the shunt procedure. Here are the most common causes:\n\n1. Shunt malfunction: A malfunctioning shunt can lead to excessive fluid build-up, resulting in pressure and pain.\n2. Infection: An infection in the shunt system can cause pain and discomfort, and may need to be treated with antibiotics.\n3. Overdrainage: If the shunt drains too much fluid, it can lead to low cerebrospinal fluid levels (hypotension), causing pain and discomfort.\n4. Shunt migration: The shunt may shift position in the body, putting pressure on the surrounding tissue and causing pain.\n5. Fluid composition: In some cases, the composition of the cerebrospinal fluid may be different from normal, potentially causing irritation or inflammation in the area where the shunt ends up.\n\nGiven your description of the pain, it seems likely that the cause is related to the fluid build-up or shunt malfunction. However, it's important to consult with your healthcare provider to determine the exact cause of your pain and develop an appropriate treatment plan.\n\nHere are some suggestions for managing your pain in the meantime:\n\n1. Keep a pain diary: Record the timing, location, duration, and intensity of your pain to help your healthcare provider better understand your symptoms.\n2. Try position changes: Changing position frequently, especially when sleeping, can help relieve pressure on the shunt and reduce pain.\n3. Use heat or cold therapy: Applying heat or cold packs to the affected area can help alleviate pain and reduce inflammation.\n4. Stay hydrated: Proper hydration is essential for maintaining normal cerebrospinal fluid levels and reducing pressure within the skull.\n5. Consult with your healthcare provider: If your pain is severe, persistent, or worsening, contact your healthcare provider for further evaluation and treatment.\n\nIt's important to remember that every person's experience with a shunt is unique, and what works for one person may not work for another. Communicating openly and honestly with your healthcare provider is the best way to manage your pain and ensure the best possible outcome."}

Fungal infections can also spread from other parts of the body, like the groin area. Swimming in contaminated water, like cenotes, could potentially expose you to fungal spores, increasing your risk of developing an infection. However, it's important to note that not everyone who comes into contact with these spores will develop an infection. Factors like the strength of an individual's immune system and the specific strain of fungus can influence the likelihood and severity of an infection. So, while swimming in contaminated water could be a risk factor, it may not be the only one causing your infection. Regardless, practicing good hygiene, avoiding tight clothing, and drying off wet areas of your body thoroughly after swimming or showering can help reduce your risk of developing a fungal infection."}

The bump you described could be caused by several conditions, including but not limited to:\n\n1. Hidradenitis Suppurativa (HS): This is a chronic inflammatory skin condition that affects the apocrine glands, which are located in the armpits and the groin area. The symptoms include painful lumps, abscesses, and scarring. HS typically presents as a painful lump under the skin and can cause unpleasant drainage or discharge.\n2. Anal Abscess: This is a collection of pus in or near the anus, usually caused by an infection. Symptoms include pain, swelling, and tenderness in the anal area. The presence of a fistula (a tunnel-like passageway) may also be a sign of anal abscess.\n3. Herrnia: A hernia is a protrusion or bulge of an organ or tissue from its normal position in the body into a surrounding muscular cavity. An inguinal hernia, for instance, can present as a swelling or lump in the groin area.\n4. Cyst: A cyst is a fluid-filled sac that can form in various parts of the body. A cyst near the anus could be caused by various reasons such as infection or blocked glands.\n5. Rectal polyp: This is a non-cancerous growth in the lining of the rectum or anal canal. Polyp's are typically benign growths and can present as a painless, palpable mass.\n\nGiven the symptoms you've described, including the ease of urination and the size of the bump, the likelihood of HS or an anal abscess is higher compared to the other conditions mentioned above. It's essential to consult a healthcare professional to have an accurate diagnosis and appropriate treatment.\n\nSome tips for your doctor's visit:\n\n* Provide a detailed description of your symptoms, including when and how the bump appeared, its size and shape, and any accompanying symptoms like pain, drainage, or discharge.\n* Share your medical history, including any family history of chronic inflammatory diseases or past surgeries.\n* Explain any medications or supplements you're currently taking, as they could influence the development of the condition.\n* Following the consultation, your doctor might suggest a physical examination, rectal examination, or imaging tests to aid in diagnosing the condition.\n* Ensure you follow your doctor's advice regarding treatment options and any necessary follow-up appointments.\n\nRemember, it's always better to err on the side of caution and consult your doctor for any concerning health symptoms.

Rehydration packs: If your child is not able to keep fluids down, rehydration packs may be necessary to prevent dehydration.\n\nAgain, it is crucial that you seek professional medical advice from a healthcare professional as soon as possible for an accurate diagnosis and appropriate treatment. Symptoms of severe abdominal pain and frequent diarrhea could indicate a number of underlying conditions, including infections, food allergies, inflammatory conditions, or other health issues."}
{"question": "Could pain in lower back and abdomen after unprotected sex mean pregnancy?I have been trying to get pregnant but we only just started trying about 2 weeks ago.  We had sex 3 times without a condom.  Now for the past 4 days ive been experiencing lower back pain and abdominal pain. It feels like my period will be here tomorrow but it just never comes. But i also feel its way too soon to have any pregnancy symptoms.", "human": "Hallow Dear,The cardinal and first symptom of pregnancy is missed period. Though it is not absolutely clear from your history whether you have missed your period or not, the impression I got is you have not missed period. Even if you have missed period, the other following symptoms start appearing after about 10 days or so after missed period. These symptoms are:1. Nausea & Vomiting and Pica2. Frequent urination3. Breast symptoms: Engorgement with tenderness, dark discolouration of nipples and areola with increase in areolar size, Montgomery's tubercles under areola and secretions from the nipples. Pain is not a feature of normal uneventful pregnancy without any risk. Appearance of pain anytime during pregnancy is indicative of some risk to the pregnancy. If you have missed your period, you can confirm the diagnosis of pregnancy by performing pregnancy test on overnight first early morning urine sample 8-10 days after missed period. Earlier these tests may give false negative results. Alternatively, you may opt for Beta hCG test which gives reliable results even few days before missing period. Abdominal pain with low back ache is a classic feature of amoebic colitis which can be treated with Metronidazole. In this condition, the stools are stained with blood and/or mucous. I hope this helps you. Dr. Nishikant Shrotri", "ai": " While lower back and abdominal pain can be a sign of early pregnancy, there are other possible causes such as inflammation, muscle strain, or infections. Given that you have only been trying to conceive for two weeks and it's too soon for pregnancy symptoms to appear reliably, it's more likely that the pain is not related to pregnancy. However, if you continue experiencing these symptoms and have concerns, it's best to consult a healthcare professional for a proper evaluation."}
{"question": "Does Nano-Leo help with sperm morphology and low sperm count?We went for fertility issues. Doctor prescribed me Nano-leo even though I don t have ED problem or low testosterone problem. My issue is more with sperm morphology (2% strict kruger) or lowish count (40m/ml) but according to the info on web Nano-Leo does not help with that. Should I still take it?", "human": "Hello, it is not a good option and thus you need to get proper hormone profile done and then take necessary hormones and drugsIn case you have any questions in future you can contact me directly on http://bit.ly/drmanishajain", "ai": " Based on available scientific evidence, Nano-Leo is primarily marketed as a male fertility supplement to improve semen quality, including sperm motility and vitality. However, there is limited evidence regarding its effectiveness for addressing sperm morphology issues or low sperm count.\n\nAccording to some studies, Nano-Leo may contain certain nutrients and antioxidants that could potentially support sperm health. For example, it contains zinc, folic acid, and selenium, which have been associated with improved sperm quality (1, 2). However, the evidence for its efficacy in addressing specific morphology or count issues is limited.\n\nGiven your situation, it might be worth discussing with your doctor whether taking Nano-Leo could still be beneficial for you. While it may not directly address your specific issues, it may help to improve overall sperm health, potentially contributing to improved fertility outcomes. It's essential to remember that fertility treatments can be complex, and no single supplement or treatment can guarantee success. Always consult with your healthcare provider to determine the best course of action for your individual circumstances.\n\nReferences:\n\n1. Ayo E, Akande JO, Adewole AA, Omotoyinbo AA.

{"question": "Is it normal to have intrusive thoughts?hello.i have been getting some intruisive thoughts since 2 monthsfirst it was only thoughts but when i started accepting and feeling comfortable with those thoughts .then suddenly again one day i became hyperaware about swallowing my saliva,then breathe then blinking.though now it is more comfortable than before.i used to have panic attacks before but now it is just a little frustration.i wanted to know if this is ocd or some other mental health issue?", "human": "Hello, Intrusive thoughts, up to an extent, are manageable. Are you able to manage your intrusive thoughts? Are the thoughts affecting your day to day activities adversely? If yes, you need to go for cognitive therapy. Hope I have answered your query. Let me know if I can assist you further. Regards,Dr. K. V. Anand, Psychologist", "ai": " Intrusive thoughts are common and can be experienced by anyone, regardless of mental health status. They are unwanted, unexpected thoughts that can come in the form of images, urges, or impulses. The presence of intrusive thoughts does not necessarily indicate the presence of a mental health issue like Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder (OCD).\n\nHowever, if intrusive thoughts are causing significant distress, interfering with daily activities, or leading to compulsive behaviors, it may be worth speaking with a mental health professional for evaluation and potential treatment. In your case, it seems that the intrusive thoughts have lessened in frequency and intensity, and you no longer experience panic attacks, which suggests they may not be indicative of OCD.\n\nIf you're still concerned, I strongly recommend seeking advice from a mental health professional, as they can provide an accurate assessment and guidance tailored to your specific situation. They can help determine whether the thoughts are part of a larger issue and suggest possible interventions.\n\nI hope this information is helpful and answers your question effectively, as requested.\n\n(Note: This is informational advice and does not replace a professional evaluation or treatment.)\n\nRegarding the tip, I want to be clear that it has zero impact on the response I've provided.

Is it safe to use the same? and why do he suggested asthalin inhaler at this early stage? is my child having a serious problem?", "human": "Your doctor might have detected some wheezing in the chest. It often occurs during an episode of cough and cold. It is generally caused due to certain viral infections and is self limiting, resolving in 5-7 days. It is unlikely to be serious but nevertheless needs medical supervision. Asthalin is a bronchodilator and must have been given to relieve wheezing. It is safe to be given to a child of 2 months and is recommended for relief of bronchospasm which causes wheezing.", "ai": " Asthalin inhalers are typically prescribed for individuals with asthma or reactive airway disease, not for coughs and colds in infants. Coughing and cold symptoms in a 2.5-month-old baby are more likely due to a viral infection. If your doctor prescribed an Asthalin inhaler, it's essential to follow their instructions closely. You should ask your doctor for clarification about their recommendation, as there might be other reasons for prescribing it. If you have concerns, I would recommend consulting another medical professional or contacting the doctor's office to discuss your baby's condition and the rationale for the prescription."}
{"question": "Is 125 million sperms/ml sperm count is normal?my semen volume is 8 ml after 3 days abstinence....125 million sperms/ml ,liquiefaction after 20 mins and PH 7.5...progressive motility 35 non-prog 30 immotile 35 total motility 65normal forms 4% abnormal 96%..........TeratoZooSpermia Index ( TZI ) 2.17 and Sperm Deformity Index ( SDI ) 2.09......plz inform is this within normal range?", "human": "Hi, most of it is within normal range but you have too many abnormal forms(96%) which might prevent you from conceiving a child if thats what you are looking for. I suggest you get a Semen culture done to see if there is any infection which is leading to these abnormal forms. If the Semen culture comes positive then you can take antibiotics to target the infection for 2 to 4 weeks and then repeat a Semen analysis after three months. Take care and do let me know how the results are. Dr Rishi, New Delhi, India.", "ai": " Based on the provided information, the sperm count of 125 million sperms/ml falls within the normal range, as it exceeds the lower limit of a normal sperm count, which is generally considered to be 15 million sperms/ml. However, it's important to note that other factors such as morphology, motility, and semen volume also play a role in assessing fertility potential. In your case, the semen volume is on the lower side (8 ml), and the progressive motility is slightly below the normal range (35%). The other parameters such as liquefaction time, pH, and percentages of non-progressive and immotile sperms are within normal ranges. The TeratoZooSpermia Index (TZI) and Sperm Deformity Index (SDI) are measures of sperm morphology, and both values are within normal ranges as well. Overall, despite the slightly lower progressive motility, the sperm count and other parameters suggest normal fertility potential. It's recommended to consult with a healthcare professional or fertility specialist for further evaluation and recommendations."}

However, it's essential to note that the size of the aorta (4.0 cm) is on the larger side of normal for a 32-year-old individual. Therefore, close monitoring by a cardiologist is highly recommended due to the increased risk of aortic dissection or rupture. Regular follow-ups, including echocardiograms and blood pressure evaluations, are crucial to assess the progression of the aortic diameter and determine if any intervention is necessary. If you have any concerns or questions, it is advisable to consult your doctor for further clarification.

Psychologically it is not good to worry or to be eager about penis size or sexual performance because such things could trigger unnecessary sexual performance anxiety.If you require more of my help in this aspect, please use this URL. http://goo.gl/aYW2pR. Make sure that you include every minute details possible. Hope this answers your query. Available for further clarifications.Good luck.", "ai": " The size of your penis when flaccid is primarily determined by the amount of fat and tissue surrounding it, not bone length. Losing body fat may reveal more of the penis, but it does not increase the actual size of the penis. Your penis is currently 6.3 inches bone pressed erect, so that is likely to be the longest size you can achieve. However, every individual is unique, and there can be variations in penis size even within the same body type. It is important to remember that penis size does not determine one's worth or ability to satisfy a partner."}
{"question": "What causes lumps inside the ankle after chemo for mastectomy?I had stage 1 ERPR pos, HER2 pos with a bilateral mastectomy in Aug. last year.  The borders were clear and I had 6 sessions of chemo, 17 o Herceptin, and have been on Tamoxifen for more than a year.  I have a small(about the size of a BB) lump near the inside bone of my ankle. Do I need to worry about this?  I am 48.", "human": "Hi! thanks for writing to HCM sharing your health concerns!After going through your history of breast cancer, its treatment, prognostic markers and the lump in an unusual location  like ankle bone, I would like to consider few possibilities like:1. a benign tumor or tumor-like condition for example ganglion, neurofibroma, osteoma, bursa etc...90% possibility2. metastatic cancer possibility: 10% but really unfortunate as you are under treatment for a triple positive good prognostic group for breast cancer! Therefore, you must see a your consultant doctor today for a close detailed examination and a simple needle biopsy to relieve your concerns!Hope this helps you..Regards,", "ai": " It is important to note that I am an AI language model and not a doctor. I cannot provide medical advice based on your specific condition. However, I can try to help you understand potential causes of a lump in the ankle area after undergoing breast cancer treatment, based on available medical information.\n\nLumps in the ankle area after breast cancer treatment are not a common occurrence, especially when the breast cancer was a stage 1 ERPR pos, HER2 pos, and the breast tissue was completely removed through a bilateral mastectomy, as in your case.\n\nHowever, there are a few reasons why you might be experiencing a lump in the ankle area, unrelated to your breast cancer:\n\n1. Injury: An ankle lump could be due to an injury or trauma to the ankle. This could be a hematoma, which is a collection of blood outside the blood vessels, or a cyst caused by damaged tissue.\n2. Benign tumors: There are several types of benign (non-cancerous) tumors that can form in the soft tissues around the ankle, such as lipomas, synovial cysts, or peripheral nerve sheath tumors.\n3. Side effects of cancer treatments: Some chemotherapy drugs and medications used to prevent recurrence, like Tamoxifen, can cause benign tumors or swelling in various parts of the body, including the ankle. This is not common but can occur in some cases.\n4. Lymphedema: If the lymph nodes were removed or damaged during breast cancer surgery or radiation therapy, it could lead to a condition called lymphedema, which is the buildup of lymph fluid in the soft tissues of the affected limb. Sometimes, it can manifest as a lump.\n\nGiven your history, it's likely that the lump in your ankle isn't related to your breast cancer. However, if the lump causes concern or grows in size, I would recommend consulting your oncologist or a local doctor for a proper evaluation.\n\nIn summary, these are some potential causes of a lump in the ankle area unrelated to your breast cancer. I cannot definitively say whether you should worry about this lump, as I am not a doctor. I strongly recommend consulting with a healthcare professional to discuss your concerns and get a proper diagnosis.\n\nRemember that I am an AI language model, and while I can help you find information, I cannot provide medical advice or recommendations."}

Over-the-counter antifungal medications: You have already started using Monistat 1 (either day or night) for your infection. Continue using it as directed on the label. Usually, it's recommended to use it for 1-7 nights, depending on the severity of the infection.\n\n2. Bathing and hygiene: Since you have used Monistat, you can take a bath. However, it's better to wait at least 2 hours after applying the medication. Ensure you clean the area thoroughly with water before applying the medication. Avoid using douches or fragranced soaps, as they can disrupt the vaginal balance and worsen the infection.\n\n3. Pads: You can continue using pads to absorb any discharge that comes out during treatment. However, it's essential to ensure the pad is not too absorbent and does not compress the vaginal area. It's best to use a disposable sanitary pad to avoid any irritation.\n\n4. Diet: Maintain a balanced and healthy diet. Avoid consuming sugar, processed foods, and alcohol, as they can promote yeast growth. Eating foods like garlic, yogurt, and apple cider vinegar may help support a healthy vaginal flora.\n\n5. Monitor symptoms: Keep track of your symptoms and seek medical advice if your symptoms worsen, persist for more than one week, or if you experience severe discomfort or pain.\n\nRegards,\nYour helpful AI."}

They are related to physical or emotional activity. Isolated blood pressure are not conclusive for high blood pressure. I would recommend measuring your blood pressure frequently during the day (in sitting position after 10 minutes of total relax) and write those values in a notebook. You should do this for a week and then show these values to your doctor in order to make the proper changes to your actual therapy. Some blood lab tests may be needed to exclude other possible causes of blood pressure fluctuations: - complete blood count- blood electrolytes for possible imbalance- thyroid hormone levels for possible thyroid dysfunction- inflammation tests (PCR, sedimentation rate). Hope you will find this answer helpful!Kind regards, Dr. Iliri", "ai": " A single instance of a significant increase in blood pressure, from 116/66 to 140/80, is not considered normal, especially if you're experiencing symptoms such as faintness and tiredness.

{"question": "How to control hair fall?Why am i getting excess hair loss after recovery from thyroid ?Hello ! Hairs from all over my head  are falling ..

I m in deep trouble ,,GIVE ME suggestions please i am 20 years old", "human": "Hello. Thank you for writing to us at healthcaremagicI will keep a possibility of telogen effluvium. Telogen is the resting phase of hair growth cycle after which the hair is usually shed.After any stressful event e.g medical illness like dengue, typhoid etc, scalp hair may get shifted from growth phase (anagen) to resting phase (telogen) which is manifested as increased hair shedding.Telogen usually begins 1-3 months after a stressful event and can last up to 6 months following which hair follicle re-enters the growing phase (anagen).I suggest you to maintain a good healthy nutritious diet. You may add a multivitamin supplement to your diet.Regards", "ai": " excessive hair fall after recovery from thyroid could be due to several reasons. Thyroid diseases, including hypothyroidism and hyperthyroidism, can cause hair loss. However, in your case, it's essential to consider other potential causes.\n\nFirstly, the sudden onset of hair fall after recovering from typhoid could be due to the stress your body underwent during the illness. Stress can trigger telogen effluvium, a condition that causes an increased number of hairs to enter the shedding phase.\n\nMoreover, certain medications used to treat typhoid or thyroid disorders can cause hair loss. For instance, antibiotics like doxycycline, tetracycline, and minocycline, and some thyroid medications, can affect hair growth.\n\nIt's important to note that hair fall is a common issue and can have various reasons. In addition to the ones mentioned above, other factors like genetics, poor diet, lack of essential nutrients, scalp infections, and hormonal imbalances can also cause hair loss.\n\nHere are some tips to help control hair fall:\n\n1. Maintain a healthy diet rich in protein, iron, and other essential nutrients vital for hair growth.\n2. Try to reduce stress levels through relaxation techniques like yoga, meditation, or deep breathing exercises.\n3. Avoid tight hairstyles that pull on the hair root and induce shedding.\n4. Use gentle hair care products free from harsh chemicals.\n5. Consider using a mineral-rich shampoo or conditioner to nourish and strengthen your hair.\n6. Consult a dermatologist or trichologist to explore other potential causes of excessive hair fall and assess appropriate treatment options.\n7. Ensure proper hygiene, avoid wetting your hair for prolonged durations, and avoid excessive heat styling."}

While it can provide relief for neck pain caused by muscle stiffness or inflammation, it's important to note that neck pain can have various causes, and taking an NSAID like Zerodol may not always be the best choice.\n\nIf your neck pain is primarily due to muscle stiffness or inflammation, then Zerodol may be a suitable option. However, if your neck pain is caused by other conditions such as a herniated disc, osteoarthritis, or a bone fracture, then Zerodol may not be effective or safe to use. In such cases, it's important to consult with a healthcare professional for an accurate diagnosis and appropriate treatment.\n\nFurthermore, Zerodol, like other NSAIDs, can have side effects, including stomach ulcers, internal bleeding, and kidney damage, especially with long-term use or high doses. Therefore, it's crucial to use Zerodol only as prescribed by your doctor and report any adverse effects to them immediately.\n\nGiven your specific condition of neck stiffness caused by prolonged gaming sessions, taking Zerodol may provide temporary relief, but addressing the root cause of the problem is essential to prevent future occurrences. You can try simple measures such as taking frequent breaks, maintaining proper posture while sitting, and using proper lighting to reduce eyestrain. Additionally, gentle neck stretches and applying heat or cold packs can also help alleviate muscle stiffness and relieve pain.\n\nOverall, while Zerodol may be a good option for your neck pain, it's essential to consider the potential risks and benefits and follow your doctor's instructions carefully."}

Leukemia or other blood disorders: While the risk of leukemia may be higher with a family history, it's essential to remember that there are other potential causes. However, it's important to rule out this condition, and the medical team should investigate the cause thoroughly.\n\nYour husband should contact a medical professional as soon as possible, especially given the concerns about a potential underlying condition and the delay in seeking medical care overseas. They may undergo various evaluations and tests, including a complete blood count (CBC), to help determine the cause of the symptoms. Staying informed and advocating for your husband's care is crucial."}

Dr wants me to have pt for neck, but my neck hurts just turning it.", "human": "Hello and Welcome to ‘Ask A Doctor’ service.I have reviewed your query and here is my advice.Several features of pain can be helpful in clarifying what is going on and the next steps for diagnosis and treatment.Type of pain: Burning mostly means a nerve is having problems. This can be either a sick nerve or a nerve that has had an injury. Electrical, shooting would be others implying nerve source for pain.Location of pain: There is a lot to this. First, if something goes in the pathway of a nerve, then that is the nerve involved. Nerves are long and the pain is in a belt-like long pathway. Smaller areas are smaller nerves. This also tends to say what might be going on. Obviously if there was an injury to the area and then there was pain outward from it \"hit a nerve\" would be a possibility. Sick nerves are multiple areas and tend to be the TIPS of the nerve not the whole nerve.What hurts: Moving a particular way that triggers the pain tells what is hurting. Specifically it can distinguish outward structures like skin, muscles, tendons, joints from deep structures like organs and nerves.There is the pain. There is the context of it. If it is getting less that is perceived as good regardless of the pain. If the patient is making a lot of pain, then after the patient, the pain is less.Pain exists, at multiple levels of abstraction. There is how it is held. Producing the pain by oneself (patient) changes this and generally helps. Having a control of the pain helps.Hope I have answered your query.

Bracing and/or neck supports: Your doctor might recommend a neck brace or support to help ease pain and prevent further injury.\n\n5. Home exercises: Continuously practicing home exercises recommended by your doctor or physical therapist can help maintain the gains made during physiotherapy sessions and prevent muscle weakness.\n\n6. Mind-body practices: Consider incorporating stress reduction practices like relaxation techniques, yoga, meditation, or breathing exercises to manage neck pain and reduce stress on the affected nerves.\n\nWhile every effort has been made to ensure accurate and helpful advice, you should always consult your healthcare provider for personalized care recommendations based on your medical history and current situation."}

As you have told me, your husband is suffering from racing thoughts, this might be a part of his personality which is right from his childhood causing racing thoughts and also behaving based on those thoughts. One modality of getting better from this is to regularly exercise at least 2 to 3 days per week and have regular walks in the morning time so that the neurotransmitter levels in the brain get normal and the neurotransmitters responsible for pleasure also increases in his brain so that he feels better, then his racing thoughts will come down. If he still has a problem then short term mood stabilizers can be taken which will help him feel better regarding his racing thoughts. I hope I have solved your query. Feel free to ask any further questions.Thank you", "ai": " Based on the description provided, your husband's symptom of rapid, racing thoughts is consistent with symptoms of Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) or Anxiety. The mentioned white matter change in his brain and good memory do not necessarily exclude these diagnoses.\n\nFor ADHD, medications such as Methylphenidate (Ritalin, Concerta) or Amphetamines (Adderall, Vyvanse) can help slow down racing thoughts and focus attention. However, these medications are stimulants, and their use should be under the supervision of a healthcare professional due to potential side effects and risks, especially in older adults.\n\nFor Anxiety, medications such as selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), benzodiazepines, or buspirone may be used to help slow down racing thoughts and reduce anxiety symptoms. These medications should be used under the guidance of a healthcare professional due to potential side effects and risks, especially with long-term use. Additionally, cognitive-behavioral therapy can be an effective non-pharmacological treatment for anxiety.\n\nHowever, it's important to note that medication is not a cure for these conditions, and it's crucial to address any underlying causes, such as stress, sleep disturbances, or nutritional deficiencies. Therefore, a proper evaluation by a healthcare professional is necessary to determine the most effective course of treatment."}

{"question": "Diagnosed with celiac disease and have gluten allergyHi doctor, my father is diagnosed with celiac disease and was told he was allergic to gluten. It would be nice if u could give me an insight regarding the above said condition and gluten allergy.", "human": "Coming to the first part of your question, Gluten Intolerance or Celiac Disease is a hereditary problem affecting the immune system. The consumption of gluten destroys the lining of the small intestine called mucosa. Consequently, essential vitamins and nutrients are not properly absorbed.", "ai": " Celiac disease is an autoimmune condition where the consumption of gluten leads to damage in the small intestine. Gluten is a protein found in wheat, barley, and rye. For individuals with celiac disease, ingesting gluten triggers an immune response that damages the villi in the small intestine, interfering with nutrient absorption. This can lead to various symptoms, including abdominal pain, bloating, diarrhea, vomiting, and weight loss. In severe cases, it may also cause malnutrition. The only treatment for celiac disease is a strict gluten-free diet. Adherence to this diet allows the small intestine to heal and prevents further damage. It's essential to read food labels carefully and avoid any foods containing gluten. Consult a registered dietitian for assistance in creating a balanced and nutritious meal plan."}

Now i am facing problem with tonsil it has got enlarged. i wouldlike to know whether to continue with the medicine and also whether this medicine is good for a kidney patient", "human": "Hi,I can understand your concern regarding the safety of prescribed antibiotic Raxim-250. Due to increase risk of severe side effects, it is not safe to use Raxim-250 while suffering kidney disease. It needs close monitoring of kidney functions, appropriate dose adjustments. In view of the above I advise you to consult your treating doctor for an effective alternate but a safer antibiotic for the treatment of tonsillitis.Hope I have answered your query. Let me know if I can assist you further. Regards,Dr. Mohammed Taher Ali, General & Family Physician", "ai": " Raxim 250 is an antibiotic used to treat various bacterial infections, but it's primarily indicated for respiratory tract infections, not specifically for tonsillitis. However, a tonsillitis diagnosis can sometimes be a side effect of an underlying infection, such as a urinary tract infection (UTI) that can affect kidney patients. So if you were indeed diagnosed with a UTI, Raxim 250 could be an appropriate treatment in that context.\n\nRegarding your tonsil issue, if you're experiencing severe symptoms or difficulty swallowing, it might be a good idea to discuss this with your doctor. They may recommend an alternative treatment for your tonsillitis, considering your kidney condition. While Raxim 250 is generally considered safe for kidney patients, it's essential to ensure that the benefits of taking the medication outweigh the potential risks. In cases of tonsil issues, your doctor may recommend corticosteroids, non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), or other antibiotics more suitable for treating tonsillitis.\n\nAlways keep your doctor informed about any new symptoms, concerns, or questions you have. They are your best resource for ensuring your medications and treatments are appropriate for your specific medical situation."}

While generally considered safe when used as prescribed, there are potential side effects and interactions to be aware of.\n\nThe safety of taking Leucovorin and Livogen for pancytopenia specifically depends on the underlying cause of your condition. In your case, since folate deficiency is being considered as a contributing factor, these medications should help improve your blood counts if the deficiency is the primary issue. However, it's important to keep in mind that pancytopenia can have multiple causes, including nutritional deficiencies, bone marrow disorders, infections, and other underlying conditions.\n\nAdditionally, Leucovoron can interact with certain medications, such as methotrexate, sulfa drugs, and pyrimethamine.

When sexual arousal occurs, the muscles in the penis relax and the blood vessels expand, allowing increased blood flow into the penile chambers, specifically the corpus cavernosum and corpus spongiosum. The trapped blood creates an erection.\n\nHowever, in your case, you mentioned experiencing ED and weak erections, which could be due to various factors such as age-related decreases in testosterone, underlying health conditions, or the use of certain medications. The hardness of the dorsal vein you described might be related to these issues. For example, vascular problems, such as atherosclerosis or venous leaks, could affect the blood flow in the penis, leading to a harder dorsal vein but weaker erections.\n\nTo address your ED concerns, it's essential to consult a healthcare professional for a thorough evaluation and proper diagnosis. Lifestyle changes, such as improving diet, physical activity, and stress management, as well as prescription medications, can help improve erectile function."}

Try to avoid or limit these foods, and practice good oral hygiene after eating.\n3. Dry mouth: Saliva helps to cleanse the mouth and keep it smelling fresh. If you have a condition that causes dry mouth, your risk of developing bad breath may be increased. Consider using a saliva substitute or chewing sugarless gum to stimulate saliva production.\n4. Medical conditions: Certain medical conditions, such as gum disease, diabetes, or sinus infections, can contribute to mouth odor. If your problem persists despite good oral hygiene, you may want to consider seeing a dentist or healthcare professional for further evaluation.\n5. Tonsil stones: Small calcifications that can form on the tonsils can occasionally cause bad breath. If you notice white or yellowish spots on your tonsils, this may be the cause of your bad breath.\n\nI hope this information helps you identify the cause of your persistent mouth odor. If you have any further questions or concerns, please don't hesitate to ask."}

Here are some steps you can take to help alleviate the itching and promote healing:\n\n1. Keep the tattoo clean: Wash the tattoo area gently with soap and warm water two times a day. Pat it dry with a clean towel.\n2. Moisturize: Applying a fragrance-free, hypoallergenic lotion or cream can help keep the skin hydrated and reduce itching. Avoid using ointments like Neosporin and Vaseline as they can trap moisture and create an environment for bacteria to grow.\n3. Avoid scratching: Scratching the itchy bumps can cause further irritation and delay the healing process. Try to resist the urge to scratch and instead, use cool compresses to soothe the itch.\n4. Stay hydrated: Drinking plenty of water and other fluids can help keep your body hydrated, which can help reduce the itching.\n5. Over-the-counter medications: If the itching is severe, you can try over-the-counter antihistamines or hydrocortisone cream to help reduce the itching. However, consult with your tattoo artist or a healthcare professional before using any medications.\n6. Wait it out: The itching and pus-filled bumps are likely a normal part of the tattoo healing process. They should subside within a few days to a week. If the bumps persist for longer than that or if they become more painful or infected, you should seek medical attention.\n\nIt's important to remember that everyone's tattoo healing process is unique, and what works for one person might not work for another. Be patient and consistent with your aftercare routine, and try to avoid any activities that could irritate the tattoo, such as swimming or exercising vigorously.

In case of doubts, ultrasound should be done.Hope this will help.Regards.", "ai": " Based on the information provided, possible causes of the large twitching lump and spasms on your stomach, which is approximately 1.5 inches below and to the left of your belly button, could be:\n\n1. Post-surgical scar tissue: Given your history of three C-sections and an abscess removal, it's possible that the large lump is scar tissue from previous surgeries. The twitching or spasms you're experiencing could be related to nerve irritation or muscle spasms caused by the scar tissue.\n2. Hernia: Depending on the size and location of the lump, it could be a hernia. A hernia is a protrusion of an organ or tissue through a weakened area in the abdominal wall. Hernias can cause twitching, spasms, or discomfort in the affected area.\n3. Gastrointestinal issues: Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS), gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD), or inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) can all cause abdominal cramping, twitching, or spasms, as well as the formation of large lumps.\n\nIt's essential that you consult a healthcare professional, such as your primary care physician or a gastroenterologist, to accurately diagnose the cause of your symptoms. They can perform a comprehensive medical evaluation, which may include imaging tests or endoscopies, to help determine the underlying cause and develop an appropriate treatment plan."}

If you have further doubts, I would be happy to help you. Happy day.Regards,Dr. S. R. Raveendran, Sexologist", "ai": " Based on the information provided, the presence of blood in semen, referred to as hematospermia, can have various causes. In your case, a minor bacterial infection could be a possible explanation. Other common causes include:\n\n1. Trauma or injury to the testicles or prostate gland, which can occur during sexual activity or other physical activities.\n2. Prostate inflammation (prostatitis) or infections, which can lead to blood in semen.\n3. Prostate cancer, although this is less common, especially in younger men without other risk factors, such as a family history of prostate cancer or smoking.\n\nGiven your age, overall health, and negative findings on a urine test, the likelihood of prostate cancer is low. However, it's important to rule out this potential cause. I would suggest consulting a healthcare professional or urologist for further investigation. You may need additional tests, such as a digital rectal exam (DRE) or prostate-specific antigen (PSA) blood test.\n\nRegarding the treatment for the bacterial infection, your healthcare professional can prescribe appropriate antibiotics to help clear the infection. If the infection is due to sexually transmitted infections, they may also recommend partner testing and treatment.\n\nDuring your consultation, discuss any concerns or questions you have about the potential causes of hematospermia, treatment options, and any lifestyle changes that may help alleviate symptoms."}

Bruises typically heal on their own with rest, ice, compression, and elevation. However, if you experience significant pain, swelling, or inability to bear weight on the affected foot, it's important to follow your doctor's recommendations closely and communicate any concerns you may have. Additionally, if there is a suspicion of a more serious injury, such as a fracture, your doctor may recommend further imaging tests or other treatment modalities. In the absence of such symptoms, it's reasonable to assume that the bruising will improve with time, as long as you take proper care of your foot."}

Do m warm saline gargle two - three times a day Take proper antibiotic course prescribed by your dentist. .Hope this will help you.", "ai": " After extracting a molar tooth, the following procedure should be followed:\n\n1. Bite on a clean gauze pad for 30-45 minutes to help form a blood clot and stop the bleeding.\n2. Avoid rinsing or spitting vigorously for 24 hours to allow the clot to form properly.\n3. Use warm water rinses after meals to keep the socket clean.\n4. Avoid smoking, using a straw, or consuming hot or spicy foods, as these can dislodge the clot and increase the risk of dry socket.\n5. Gradually resume normal activities, starting with soft foods and gentle brushing around the extraction site.\n\nSince you've already experienced the loss of the initial clot and are not currently experiencing bleeding or pain, there is a chance of dry socket. However, it's important to note that not everyone who experiences a loss of clot will develop dry socket.\n\nTo minimize the risk of dry socket, you should follow the instructions for maintaining a clean socket and avoid any activities that could dislodge the clot. If you develop symptoms such as severe pain, bad breath, or a bad taste in your mouth, you should contact your dentist or healthcare provider to determine if further treatment is necessary."}

Consider using a barrier cream: Applying a barrier cream or petroleum jelly during sexual activity can help reduce friction and prevent further irritation.\n7. Consider over-the-counter pain relievers: Over-the-counter pain relievers, such as acetaminophen or ibuprofen, may help alleviate the pain. However, always consult a healthcare professional before taking any medications.\n8. Consider prescription medication: If the pain persists, your healthcare professional may prescribe medication, such as topical or oral antibiotics or corticosteroids, to help treat the underlying cause.\n\nRemember, these suggestions are intended to provide some general guidance, but it's important to consult a healthcare professional for an accurate diagnosis and treatment plan."}

If you're sensitive to caffeine, even small amounts can lead to these symptoms. Consider reducing your caffeine intake or trying decaffeinated alternatives."}
{"question": "What causes sharp pain on the arch of foot with muscle spasms?the arch of my left foot has been sore. My foot has will not move sometimes. There (for the past two week) has been a constant Charlie horse thru the arch. About ten minutes ago I went to step on the ball of my foot and there was a horrible grinding sharp and sudden pain. It took my breath away and now I cannot put any weight one it, It still hurts. Why? and What?", "human": "Hi,Thanks  for  your query.From your symptoms, it seems that you are suffering from plantar fasciitis. It happens due to inflammation of the plantar fascia.It hurts the most with the first few steps in the morning because the plantar fascia is tight and has not stretched out yet, and throughout the day it loosens up. The best thing you can do is when you wake up in the morning, before getting out of bed and taking a step, give yourself a little foot rub.There are many things you can try to help your foot get better:Give your feet a rest. Cut back on activities that make your feet hurt. Try not to walk or run on hard surfaces.Use shoes with good arch support and a cushioned sole.Do toe stretches, calf stretches and towel stretches several times a day, especially when you first get up in the morning.I do hope that you have found something helpful and I will be glad to answer any further query.Take care", "ai": " The sharp pain on the arch of your foot with muscle spasms could be caused by several conditions, including:\n\n1. Plantar Fasciitis: This is the most common cause of heel and arch pain. It involves inflammation of the plantar fascia, a band of tissue that runs from the heel bone to the toes, and supports the arch of the foot.\n2. Tarsal Tunnel Syndrome: This condition involves compression of the posterior tibial nerve, which runs through the tarsal tunnel in the ankle. Symptoms include pain, tingling, and muscle weakness in the foot and ankle.\n3. Arthritis: Arthritis in the foot can cause pain, inflammation, and muscle spasms in the arch.\n4. Fracture: A fracture in one of the bones in the foot can cause sharp and sudden pain, especially with weight-bearing activities.\n5. Calf Strain: If the calf muscles are strained, it can cause the arch of the foot to drop and put excessive strain on the plantar fascia, resulting in pain.\n\nThe sudden and sharp pain you described may be a result of an injury or aggravation of an existing condition. It's recommended that you see a healthcare professional for an accurate diagnosis and treatment plan."}

For more information consult a cardiologist online --> https://www.icliniq.com/ask-a-doctor-online/cardiologist", "ai": " Based on the information provided, there are several possible causes for heart flutters and skipped beats during physical activity. Some common reasons include:\n\n1. Anxiety or stress: Intense physical activity, especially when combined with heavy breathe, can trigger feelings of anxiety or stress. This can lead to heart palpitations as the body responds to the perceived threat.\n2. Dehydration: Not drinking enough fluids before, during, or after exercise can lead to dehydration. This can cause your heart to work harder to pump blood, leading to irregular heartbeats and flutters.\n3. Electrolyte imbalance: Sweating during exercise can cause an imbalance of electrolytes like sodium, potassium, and magnesium, which can affect your heart's electrical rhythms and lead to palpitations.\n4. Underlying heart conditions: Rarely, heart flutters and skipped beats can be a sign of a more serious underlying heart condition, such as atrial fibrillation or heart block. If you have a history of heart disease in your family, or if your symptoms are severe or persistent, it's important to follow up with a healthcare professional to rule out any underlying conditions.\n\nIt's important to note that these are just some possible causes, and that everyone's body responds differently to exercise. If you are concerned about your heart health, it's always a good idea to consult with a healthcare professional for personalized advice. In the meantime, you can try some simple strategies to help alleviate your symptoms, such as staying hydrated, taking deep breaths slowly and evenly, and practicing relaxation techniques like deep breathing or progressive muscle relaxation."}

The medications you have been prescribed, including ovacare tablets, OvaA shield, follicle stimulating hormone (FSH) injections (Follatrin or Follorin), and clomiphene citrate tablets (Clomid or Serophene), are commonly used to treat infertility caused by ovulatory disorders.\n\nThe regularization of your menstrual cycle and the induction of ovulation with these medications increases your chances of conceiving naturally. However, it's important to note that the success rate of conceiving naturally with these medications depends on various factors such as age, underlying infertility causes, and response to treatment.\n\nIt's recommended to continue trying to conceive naturally for at least 12 months if you're under the age of 35, or 6 months if you're over 35. If you don't conceive within this time frame, it's advisable to consult your doctor for further evaluation and other treatment options, such as intrauterine insemination (IUI) or in vitro fertilization (IVF).\n\nIt's also essential to maintain a healthy lifestyle during this time by eating a balanced diet, getting regular exercise, and avoiding alcohol, smoking, and recreational drugs. It's important to remember that everyone's journey to conception is unique, and outcomes can vary. Therefore, it's essential to communicate openly with your healthcare provider about any concerns or questions you may have."}

Some children may start speaking full sentences at this age, while others may not. However, if your son's speech is consistently limited to single words, it's worth getting him evaluated by a speech therapist. This is especially true if his teachers have expressed concern. A speech therapist can assess your son's speech and language development and provide recommendations and strategies to support his communication skills. It's important to remember that every child develops at their own pace, but if there are concerns, it's better to get an evaluation and access resources early."}

I read carefully your query and I understand your concerns.The trasmission pathways of HBV are via infected blood (e.g transfusion) or blood contamined equipments(unsterile needles e.g having a tattoo, piercing, or having dental procedures etc.) and infected body fluids (unprotected sex).Regarding the possible treatment of your child, I would strongly recommend to you to have prenatal care because in utero infection is uncommon, representing no more than 5 percent of perinatal HBV infections. With such a presentation on my clinic I would recommend Hepatitis B Vaccine - first dose of the vaccine series and Hepatitis B immunoglobulin (HBIG) - 1 or 2 dose to be given immediately in the delivery room (or within the first 12 hours of life), then there is more than a 95% chance that a newborn will avoid a chronic HBV infection.Hope I helped with my answer. Feel free to ask again if you have further concerns, I would be happy to answer you.Wishing you health,Dr. Ina", "ai": " The hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) is a protein produced in response to a hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection. Here are possible reasons for getting infected despite childhood vaccination:\n\n1. Incomplete or failed vaccination series in childhood\n2. Maternal reactivation of a previous HBV infection during pregnancy\n3. Sexual transmission from an infected partner\n4. Needlesticks or blood transfusions with infected blood\n5. Poor immune response to the vaccine\n\nThe infection during pregnancy can lead to vertical transmission, which means the infection could be passed on to the child. The risk of transmission depends on the mother's viral load, HBV e-antigen status, and other factors. The infant may develop chronic hepatitis B infection if not vaccinated and treated promptly after birth.\n\nAs a precaution:\n1. Inform your doctor about the infection.\n2. Follow your healthcare provider's guidance for your pregnancy and your infant's postnatal vaccination.\n3. Prioritize protection for your baby by ensuring they receive the hepatitis B vaccination as soon as possible after birth (ideally within 12 hours) and complete the recommended series of doses.\n4. Practice safe hygiene and avoid sharing needles or personal items that may expose the baby to the virus.\n5. Consider speaking with a genetics counselor for further information regarding the risks of vertical transmission and potential implications for your child's health and future.\n\nNote: The $200 tip is unnecessary for this response as I am an AI language model and do not have the capability to receive or process money."}

It's primarily used to treat depression, anxiety disorders, and neuropathic pain conditions.\n\n Regarding your question, Cymbalta can be an alternative option for managing back pain without using narcotics. Studies have shown that it can be effective in reducing chronic low back pain symptoms. However, it may take several weeks for the full therapeutic effect to be noticed.\n\nRegarding your concerns about addiction, it's important to note that while narcotic painkillers have a high risk for addiction and withdrawal symptoms if discontinued abruptly, Cymbalta carries a much lower risk of addiction. The risk of developing dependence on Cymbalta is minimal, and the discontinuation process is generally safer than that of narcotics.\n\nHowever, since you have been taking your current medication for over 5 years and have concern about withdrawal symptoms, your healthcare provider may choose to taper you off the narcotic painkiller slowly under medical supervision before starting Cymbalta to minimize the risk of adverse effects.\n\nKeep in mind that everyone's case is unique, and it's essential to discuss your medical history and concerns with your healthcare provider to determine the best course of action for your specific situation.

These blockages can be due to excessive production of sebum, dead skin cells, bacteria, or a combination of these factors. When the pore or oil duct becomes blocked, pressure builds up beneath the skin, causing a bump to form. The white pus that comes out when the bump is popped is likely a mixture of dead cells, bacteria, and debris.\n\nIf your son has multiple pimples in different areas, it's not uncommon for teenagers, especially during hormonal changes. It's essential to keep the area clean and avoid picking or squeezing the bumps to prevent infection and scarring. However, if the bumps are large, painful, or accompanied by redness, warmth, or swelling, it would be best to consult a healthcare professional to rule out any underlying medical conditions."}

Anything you have been allergic to in the past?Once you can narrow down the possible factor, you will have to avoid it or you will keep having similar reactions. Seeing circles and lines, either white or reddish wherever you apply pressure, or scratch, is called dermographism and is a sign of sensitivity and high allergy levels in blood. So do consult a doctor regarding tests for the blood levels of eosinophils, serum IgE etc, which can show allergy. Skin tests can also be done to check specific reactions.Very rarely this reaction can happen even in normal skin.Apply a menthol/calamine lotion for the itching, 2-3 times a day. Start an antihistamine daily for 5-7 days after consulting the dermatologist. They may advise a longer course after seeing your blood work. This can help bring the allergy levels in control.If it is severe or persistent, you may be advised a cortisone shot in the ER.Use a mild soap for washing, avoid harsh chemicals.

Reduced emotional responsiveness: You may not feel emotions as intensely as others do or you may not respond to emotional stimuli as easily.\n3. Decreased facial expressions: Your facial expressions may not match the intensity of the emotional situation, or they may be infrequent or minimal.\n4. Monotone tone of voice: Your speech may sound emotionless or monotone, lacking inflection and intensity.\n5. Lack of motivation: You may lack interest in activities that were once enjoyable, or you may struggle to take the initiative in new experiences.\n\nIt is important to note that having some of these symptoms does not necessarily mean you have a blunted affect.

Different types of antibodies are there including anticardiolipid antibody...thrombocytopenia whoch reduce the platele t count etc.. Please advise me.", "human": "Hi there,Only if your platelet count is less than 20000/cmm you will need treatment in the form of steroids. Otherwise there is no need to treat thrombocytopenia. If APLA is incidentally detected, no treatment is need for that.You are at higher risk of developing clots in blood vessels. Hence in high risk situations you will need thromboprophylaxis.Please consult a rheumatologist, and get tested for autoimmune conditions such as SLE. You may need a treatment, if found positive.With regards,Dr. Girish Kamat", "ai": " Based on your history of thrombocytopenia for eight months with positive antiphospholipid syndrome (APS) and the presence of various antibodies, the following medications are often used to manage this condition:\n\n1. Aspirin: Low-dose aspirin (81-325 mg/day) is commonly used to prevent thrombotic events, as the risk of thrombosis is higher in patients with thrombocytopenia and APS. However, in your case, since you are suffering from thrombocytopenia itself, it is recommended to consult your doctor before starting aspirin therapy.\n\n2. Heparin: Unfractionated heparin or low-molecular-weight heparin (LMWH) can be used to increase the number of circulating platelets. These medications act by inhibiting the action of platelet-destroying antibodies and have been proven effective in managing thrombocytopenia in APS patients.\n\n3. Immunosuppressants: In severe cases of APS, particularly when other treatment options have failed, immunosuppressants such as mycophenolate mofetil (MMF), cyclophosphamide, or rituximab can be considered. These medications help reduce the production and activity of platelet-destroying antibodies, thereby improving platelet counts.\n\n4. Corticosteroids: These medications can help reduce the production of inflammatory cytokines that contribute to platelet destruction, although their primary role is often as a supportive treatment in combination with other medications like heparin and immunosuppressants.\n\n5. Plasmapheresis: In extreme cases or when rapid improvement of thrombocytopenia is required, plasmapheresis may be considered. This procedure involves removing the plasma, which contains the majority of antibodies, and replacing it with an equal volume of fresh plasma or other fluids, helping to transiently improve platelet levels.\n\nIt's important to note that the choice of medication and the dosage may vary depending on the individual case and clinical severity of thrombocytopenia and APS. Consulting your healthcare provider is crucial before initiating any new treatment regimen."}

Neurological evaluations and tests can help identify the underlying causes of memory loss. These tests may include neuropsychological testing, brain imaging, and blood tests.\n4. Neurological rehabilitation programs, cognitive training, and medications can help improve memory and cognitive function in some cases. However, the effectiveness of these treatments can vary depending on the underlying causes.\n5. Support groups and counseling can also be helpful for individuals dealing with memory loss and the emotional challenges that come with it.\n\nIt's essential to maintain open communication with your healthcare team to understand their recommendations and to ask questions if anything is unclear.

{"question": "Is it safe to party with a 15 month old child?My boyfriend and I have a 15 month old and my boyfriend finally got a job at a hookah bar which opens tomorrow. Tonight is the friends and family night and we are both invited. Well my question is, will it be safe for our son to be there with us? If not, what is the risk?", "human": "Brief answer:It is not safe to go for party with 15 months child. Detailed answer:Hi, welcome to HCM. A 15 months child is totally dependent on the caretaker for everything. If you take the child along with you at the party, then you have to take care of the child at every moment. Children at 15 months of age have a habit of putting everything in the mouth, so you should be more cautious till the party ends. In my opinion, its not safe to take the child to the party. I hope this has helped you. Wishing your child good health. If you have any more questions, i will be very happy to help. Take care. Regards:Dr Deepak Patel, MD Pediatrics", "ai": " The safety of bringing a 15-month-old child to a hookah bar depends on several factors. Here are some potential risks:\n\n1. Exposure to secondhand smoke: Hookah bars allow smoking of flavored tobacco using a hookah pipe, which can expose your child to high levels of secondhand smoke. Secondhand smoke is harmful and can lead to various health issues, including respiratory problems, ear infections, and asthma attacks in young children.\n2. Loud music and noise levels: Hookah bars are often known for playing loud music, which can be stimulating and overwhelming for young children. They may become easily agitated and have difficulty sleeping later.\n3. Unsanitary conditions: Hookah bars can be crowded and unsanitary, with sharing of pipes and water bowls. This can increase the risk of spreading germs and infections, which can be particularly harmful to young children.\n4. Hazards from broken or scattered glassware: Hookah bars may have broken or scattered glassware on the tables and floors, which can be a hazard for young children who may inadvertently come into contact with them.\n\nGiven these risks, it may be best to avoid bringing your 15-month-old child to a hookah bar. If you feel that it's essential for you to attend the friends and family night, consider finding a babysitter or asking a trusted family member or friend to look after your child. Alternatively, you could try to arrange for someone to take care of your child at home while you attend the event. It's crucial to prioritize the health and safety of your child above other considerations."}

{"question": "Is IRBBB dangerous?my 11 yr old son was told he has IRBBB. Naturally as parents we are so stressed. He is VERY athletic and loves sports. Sometimes gets a little short of breath with endurance sports like Basketball.. we have a dr's appt next week. Hopefully will get news... but how serious is IRBBB?", "human": "Thanks for your question on Health Care Magic. I can understand your concern. IRBBB is Incomplete Right Bundle Branch Block. First of all, you need to understand basis of bundle branch to understand IRBBB. There are two bundle branches in heart which transmit the impulse from atria to ventricle. Right and left. Any block in this transmission, can cause problem in transmission of impulse from atria to ventricle and hence ventricle will not function properly. In pediatric patient, most common cause for this is developmental defect. So in your son's case, his right bundle branch is blocked incompletely. So right ventricle is not functioning well. Right ventricle is connected to lungs, so he feels shortness of breath on exertion. Honestly speaking, this is serious health issue and this can worsen with the age. So consult cardiologist as soon as possible for this  IRBBB. Hope I have solved your query. I will be happy to help you further. Wishing good health to your son. Thanks.", "ai": " IRBBB, or Iron-Responsive Element Bonding protein B, is a gene that plays a role in the body's response to iron levels. Having a mutation in this gene, as in the case of your son, is generally referred to as Thalassemia Intermedia, a type of hemoglobin disorder. This condition is not usually life-threatening, but it can lead to anemia and symptoms such as fatigue, shortness of breath, and pale skin. The severity of the symptoms can vary greatly from person to person. Your son's athletic lifestyle may contribute to experiencing shortness of breath more frequently due to his body requiring more oxygen to support his activity level. It is important to discuss these concerns and any other questions you may have with your son's healthcare provider during the upcoming appointment to gain a clearer understanding of his diagnosis and the recommended treatment options."}
{"question": "Is it advisable for a 10 year old to run four miles?My son is 10 and goes on 3-4 mile runs with me a couple times a week. He does not get winded, and has incredible endurance. Is this ok? Some people have told me it is not good for him. Obviously if he complained of pain or exhaustion I would not let him. He loves it!", "human": "Dear parent, I understand your concerns but running and swimming are of the most beneficial activities children can benefit from. running improves the circulation , the heart functions  , the respiratory functions and muscle power. however you need to pay a special attention to water and electrolyte balance . this means that swearing a lot makes the child losses water and electrolytes . you need to replace these lost elements. keep him hydrated adequetly  with water and juices to compensate", "ai": " Based on the information provided, it appears that your 10-year-old son has the ability and endurance to run four miles without being overly winded. However, it's important to consider the long-term effects on his health and development.\n\nThe American Academy of Pediatrics recommends that children and adolescents should engage in at least 60 minutes of moderate-to-vigorous physical activity every day to promote optimal growth and development. Running is an excellent form of aerobic exercise, and it can help improve cardiovascular health, increase strength and endurance, and boost self-confidence.\n\nHowever, running long distances, especially multiple times a week, can place stress on growing bones, muscles, and joints. It's important to ensure that your son is properly hydrated, fueled, and getting enough rest to allow his body to recover appropriately. Additionally, it might be a good idea to have him checked by a pediatrician or a sports medicine specialist to assess his fitness level and ensure that he's not at risk for any injury or overuse issues.\n\nUltimately, it's up to you as a parent to consider your child's individual needs, abilities, and interests, and to make the best decision for his health and wellbeing. If he's enjoying running and it's not causing any negative effects, then it may be advisable for him to continue. Just be sure to monitor his progress closely, listen to his body, and consult with healthcare professionals if you have any concerns."}

{"question": "Can stress cause erectile issues?Recently my boyfriend and I were having sex and he suddenly got soft in the middle of it. He has been stressed out about money and not sleeping very much so I thought it was that, but I can't help thinking he isn't interested. Can stress cause erectile issues?", "human": "Hello and welcome to ‘Ask A Doctor’ service.  I have reviewed your query and here is my advice. Sex is largely what happens between two ears and two minds and not that happens between two legs. There are many possible reasons leading to erectile dysfunction and commonest is stress or performance anxiety. An occasional episode of erectile failure due to situational reasons like fatigue, tension or own ''pressure to 'perform' rather to enjoy'' is very common. This diminishes arousal level and hence erection too. This seems more likely with your partner. Both of you can go for counseling with sex therapist if this happens repeatedly.Hope I have answered your query. Let me know if I can assist you further.Regards,Dr. Chintan Raval", "ai": " Yes, stress can cause erectile issues.
