This process takes place in the stroma of the chloroplasts, where carbon dioxide (CO2) is fixed into organic compounds (primarily glucose) through a series of enzyme-catalyzed steps. The primary objective is to produce organic molecules using CO2, water (H2O), and ATP and NADPH generated from the light-dependent reactions. The light-independent reactions are essential for the net assimilation of carbon and the production of energy-rich organic compounds in the form of carbohydrates in plants."}
