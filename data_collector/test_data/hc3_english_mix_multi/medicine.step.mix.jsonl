If it is due to anatomical issue, surgery can be done.Hope I have answered your question. Let me know if I can assist you further. Regards,Dr. S. R. Raveendran, Sexologist", "ai": " A nil sperm count, also known as azerospermia, is a rare condition where the male reproductive system does not produce any sperm. In some cases, this condition may be curable with medical treatments.\n\nThe causes of azerospermia can be various, including genetic factors, infections, injuries, and certain medical conditions. For instance, varicocele, a condition where the veins in the testicles become enlarged, can lead to decreased sperm production and eventually azerospermia.\n\nSeveral medical treatments can help improve sperm count and potentially cure azerospermia, such as:\n\n1. Surgery: Certain surgical procedures, like varicocele repair, may help improve sperm production and improve the quality and quantity of sperm.\n2. Hormone replacement therapy: Hormone deficiencies can affect sperm production. Hormone replacement therapy can help restore the proper balance of hormones and improve sperm count.\n3. Medications: The use of specific medications, like clomiphene citrate or gonadotropins, can stimulate the production of sperm.\n4. Lifestyle changes: Quitting smoking, losing weight, reducing stress, and other lifestyle changes can positively impact sperm production and quality.\n\nIt's essential to consult a healthcare professional for a proper diagnosis and determine the underlying cause of the nil sperm count condition. Depending on the specific diagnosis, therapy and treatment plans can be developed to address the condition and potentially improve the chances of conceiving.\n\nKeep in mind that every individual is unique and that the chances of cure and success will depend on several factors, including the cause and severity of the condition, personal health status, and individual responses to treatments.\n\nTo summarize:\n\nThe answer to the question is that, in some cases, a nil sperm count condition can be curable with medical treatments, but the individual's success will depend on the underlying cause of the condition and the response to the therapy. It is vital to consult a healthcare professional for a proper diagnosis and treatment plan."}

Better to take help of a psychiatrist for proper diagnosis and management. In case, you need further help, you can ask.Thanka", "ai": " Eating ice regularly may have potential health consequences beyond just damaging your teeth. Here are some potential health-related concerns:\n\n1. Dental problems: Prolonged consumption of ice can lead to toothaches, tooth sensitivity, and dental caries or cavities due to repeated exposure to freezing temperatures and the hard texture of ice.\n\n2. Esophageal damage: Chewing and swallowing large quantities of ice can cause damage to the esophagus, which may lead to pain, inflammation, or even bleeding in severe cases.\n\n3. Nutritional deficiencies: Consuming large amounts of ice may lead to a decrease in appetite, potentially leading to nutritional deficiencies if you're not getting enough calories and essential nutrients from other food sources.\n\n4. Stomach issues: Eating ice can lead to stomach cramps, bloating, or diarrhea due to the rapid temperature change and the expansion of gas in your stomach as the ice melts.\n\n5. Increased calorie intake: Eating ice continually can lead to unintentional weight gain because its ingestion adds calories to your daily intake, which can compromise your overall nutritional balance.\n\n6. Hydration: While eating ice can be quenching in the short term, it does not provide the same long-term hydration that water does. Additionally, the constant desire to eat ice can lead to decreased water intake, which can contribute to various health issues.\n\n7. Psychological concerns: Regularly turning to ice as a means to manage stress, anxiety, or other emotional issues can potentially lead to unhealthy coping mechanisms and exacerbate underlying mental health concerns.\n\nTo address these potential health issues, consider seeking professional help if you are unable to control your addiction to ice or if it is causing significant distress in your daily life. Additionally, maintaining a balanced diet, staying hydrated, and finding alternative ways to manage anxiety or stress can help mitigate the potential negative consequences of regularly consuming ice."}

Infection: The most common cause of diarrhea in children is an infection in the gut, often caused by bacteria, viruses, or parasites.\n2. Food intolerance: Lactose intolerance, as mentioned in your case, can cause diarrhea in children. Soy formula is often used as a substitute for cow's milk formula for children who are lactose intolerant.\n3. Allergies: Food allergies can also cause diarrhea in children. This can be caused by an allergic reaction to specific foods, such as cow's milk, eggs, soy, or wheat.\n4. Malabsorption: As mentioned in your son's case, malabsorption can be a cause of diarrhea. This can be due to various causes, such as celiac disease, pancreatic insufficiency, or bile acid malabsorption.\n5. Gastrointestinal disorders: Certain gastrointestinal disorders, such as inflammatory bowel disease or gastroesophageal reflux disease, can cause diarrhea.\n6. Medications: Some medications, especially antibiotics, can cause diarrhea as a side effect.\n\nYour son's case appears to be one of malabsorption, which may be caused by an underlying condition such as celiac disease or pancreatic insufficiency. The fact that he has not responded to lactose-free milk and that soya formula is being recommended suggests that the problem may be related to malabsorption rather than lactose intolerance. It is important that your son continues to see his healthcare provider to determine the underlying cause of his diarrhea and to receive appropriate treatment."}
{"question": "What causes skin peeling on hands and feet of a child?my 14 year old son has skin peeling on his hands and feet. especially between his toes. He says it doesnt itch. It is not red or irritated yet. He said it has been going on for a couple of weeks before I noticed. Do you recommend a cream or is this something serious. He is in football and my concern is also germs from the locker room...could he have caught something.", "human": "Hi...by what you quote I feel that your son might be having a post viral skin peeling or dry skin (idiopathic). I suggest using emollient ointment or creams for this. If still not better - I suggest you to upload photographs of the same on this website, so that I can guide you scientifically.  Skin conditions are best diagnosed only after seeing directly. Regards - Dr. Sumanth", "ai": " Based on the information provided, the most likely cause of your son's skin peeling on his hands and feet is a common condition called pedicium xerosis or dry skin. This condition is more common in children who frequently have their feet immersed in water, such as during bathing or swimming, or in hot and dry environments. It can also be aggravated by frequent hand washing or exposure to harsh soaps or chemicals.\n\nPeeling skin from dryness is usually not itchy or irritated, and the color of the skin is typically normal. However, in some cases, it can become red or inflamed if the skin becomes cracked or broken, leading to secondary infection.\n\nIf your son's skin peeling is due to dryness, then using a moisturizing cream or lotion specific for feet may help alleviate the symptoms. Make sure your son applies the cream or lotion after bathing or showering, while the skin is still damp to help lock in moisture. He should also avoid prolonged baths or showers and dry his feet thoroughly but gently to prevent cracking.\n\nYou can also consider using gloves or socks to keep his feet moisturized during the day, especially when he spends long hours in the locker room or in the sun.\n\nIf you notice any signs of infection, such as redness, swelling, or pus, then it's important to consult your healthcare provider to rule out any other underlying causes, such as fungal or bacterial infections. Other symptoms, such as fever or fatigue, may also indicate a more serious condition.\n\nRegardless of the cause, it's important to remind your son to wash his hands frequently and thoroughly to prevent the spread of germs from the locker room or other sources."}

No fever or any other symptoms but, I am a little dizzy ... The coughing happens in little fits ... Mostly clear a little but of red-streaks sometimes Otherwise, I feel great .... When should the coughing go away?", "human": "Thanks for your question on Health Care Magic. I can understand your concern. Coughing out red streaked sputum is known as hemoptysis. And this can be seen in pneumonia, tuberculosis, bronchitis etc. So better to consult pulmonologist and get done chest x ray and PFT (Pulmonary Function Test) to rule out above mentioned causes. If both are normal then no need to worry much. You should start antihistamine drugs for relief in cough. Since it is prescribed drug, you need doctor 's prescription for this. So consult pulmonologist and discuss all these. Hope I have solved your query. Wish you good health. Thanks.", "ai": " The symptoms you described, a productive cough with little red streaks in the sputum and dizziness, could be caused by various conditions, including:\n\n1. Postnasal drip: This condition occurs when mucus from the nose drains down the back of the throat, causing a cough and sometimes streaks of blood. Postnasal drip can be caused by allergies, infections, or environmental factors.\n2. Bronchitis: This condition inflames the bronchial tubes, leading to a productive cough with phlegm. Bronchitis can be viral or bacterial and may cause dizziness due to dehydration or fever.\n3. Allergies: Allergies to pollen, pets, or other environmental factors can cause a productive cough with reddish streaks in the mucus due to inflammation. Allergies can also cause dizziness due to a drop in blood pressure or histamine release.\n4. Heart conditions: A productive cough with red-streaked sputum and dizziness could be a sign of heart failure or other cardiovascular conditions. This is less common but should be ruled out, especially if you have any risk factors.\n\nThe duration of the coughing depends on the underlying cause. Viral infections, such as bronchitis or postnasal drip, usually improve within 1-2 weeks. However, if your symptoms persist or worsen, or if you experience other concerning symptoms, you should consult a healthcare professional for further evaluation."}

So once operation is done part of brain tissue would be removed.Like any wound in body which when heals will left with scar ,it is the same thing in brain which is called as gliosis. Gliosis is a process of scarring in the central nervous system. It results from the proliferation of astrocytes in an injured or diseased part of the brain, causing the formation of a fibrous glial scar. Although they are a necessary element to injury recovery, both the accumulation of glial cells and subsequent scarring are important markers of neurological damage.Scar cannot be removed ,it produce headache and seizure", "ai": " Based on the information provided, it appears that you had a surgical procedure to remove a mass related to TB meningitis in the left fronto-temporo-parietal region of your brain. The medications you are taking are antibiotics to treat the TB meningitis.\n\nThe recent CT scan report mentions \"I11 defined CSF density in the left temporal region,\" which is suggestive of gliosis. Gliosis refers to the scarring or thickening of the glial cells, which are supportive cells in the brain. This condition can occur as a result of various injuries or diseases, including brain infections like meningitis.\n\nThe presence of gliosis on the scan does not necessarily mean that the condition is worsening or that the treatment is not working. However, it does suggest that there is some degree of scarring in the brain. The significance of this finding depends on other factors, such as the size and location of the gliosis, your clinical symptoms, and the overall course of your treatment.\n\nIt's important to discuss the scan results with your healthcare provider, who can interpret the findings in the context of your specific situation and provide you with more detailed information and guidance."}

However, in your case, the fact that you're experiencing this symptom after your period and without other typical infection symptoms (such as frequent urination, pain or burning during urination, or strong-smelling urine) could indicate other possible causes. These may include:\n\n1. A kidney infection: If the infection has spread from the bladder to the kidneys, it can cause blood in the urine.\n2. Uterine or vaginal issues: Hormonal changes during menstruation or other conditions, such as endometriosis or uterine fibroids, can cause blood in the urine.\n3. Age-related factors: The thinning of the urethral lining with age can result in small amounts of blood in the urine, especially after menopause, a phenomenon known as hematuria senilis.\n4. Certain medications: Certain drugs, such as antibiotics, diuretics, and nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), can cause temporary hematuria as a side effect.\n\nTo determine the cause of your symptoms, it's recommended that you consult a healthcare professional. They may perform a urine analysis, urine culture, and other tests to determine the underlying condition causing the blood in your urine. It is essential not to ignore this symptom, as it could indicate an underlying medical issue that needs treatment."}

While some doctors may suggest that surgery is not necessary if the tumor is not causing significant symptoms or distress, it is essential to consider the specific circumstances of your case.\n\nThe presence of severe pain persisting for over 10 years is a crucial factor that needs to be examined further. The fact that the pain worsens with stress, fatigue, or heat could indicate that the tumor is compressing or irritating the brachial plexus, leading to nerve damage and pain.\n\nAdditionally, while surgery comes with risks, the potential benefits, such as the relief of pain and the avoidance of future complications, should be carefully considered. It might be helpful to obtain a second opinion from a specialist, such as a neurosurgeon or a thoracic surgeon, to discuss the risks and benefits of surgery in your particular case. Ultimately, the decision should be based on a thorough evaluation of your medical history, current symptoms, and the expertise of your healthcare team."}
{"question": "Do i have PTB if my chest x-ray shows minimal PTB?I had 6 months treatment for my ptb and the last result of my sputum test is already negative, yesterday i  went to the hospital for xray as requested by my employer and the result is still the same ptb minimal.  Do i still have ptb and is it again contagious after 6 months of treatment", "human": "Thanks for your question on Health Care Magic. I can understand your concern. At present, you are mostly having old, healed, fibrotic lesion on chest x ray. After six months of treatment, active tb lesions on chest x ray heal. Healing takes place mostly in the form of fibrosis, calcification or both (fibro calcification). Complete resolution is rare in tuberculosis. So these healed areas appear as scar lesion on chest x ray. They will be seen as it is for lifetime. So presence of this fibrotic lesion is not suggestive of tuberculosis. Your sputum report is also negative. So you are mostly having healed lesion and not having active tb lesion. But if you really want to rule out active tuberculosis then get done CT thorax and bronchoscopy with BAL (bronchoalveolar lavage) analysis. If both these are negative for TB then you are not having active tuberculosis fir sure.Hope I have solved your query. I will be happy to help you further. Wish you good health. Thanks.", "ai": " Based on the information provided, the minimal PTB (tuberculosis) seen on your chest x-ray does not necessarily mean that you still have active PTB. A chest x-ray can show old scars or healed lesions from past infections, even if you are no longer contagious. Your negative sputum test result indicates that you are currently non-infectious. Therefore, it is less likely that you are still contagious after completing 6 months of PTB treatment.

Chiropractic adjustments have helped a bit but after 5 of them in 6 days I usually would feel better. What else can I do to heal or put the joint back in place?", "human": "hiYou should be consulting an orthopedic surgeon and have an MRI done for exact diagnosis and position of sacro-iliac joint.Dislocation is rare but happens mainly after severe trauma.This should be diagnosed as early as possible and treatment depends on exact finding on MRIthanks", "ai": " While I cannot provide a definitive diagnosis or treatment plan without examining you in person, I can suggest some additional steps you can take to help alleviate your sacroiliac joint dislocation symptoms. These suggestions may complement your chiropractic adjustments:\n\n1. Rest and Ice: Give your body a chance to heal by avoiding activities that aggravate the pain, such as prolonged sitting or standing. Apply ice packs to the affected area for 15-20 minutes at a time, multiple times a day, to reduce inflammation.\n\n2. Gentle Exercises: Perform gentle exercises designed to strengthen your core muscles and improve the stability of your pelvis. Consult your chiropractor, physical therapist, or healthcare professional for guidance on which exercises are most appropriate for your condition.\n\n3. Posture and Body Mechanics: Pay attention to your posture and body mechanics during daily activities, such as sitting, standing, and lifting objects. Make sure to keep your pelvis neutral and avoid putting excessive pressure on the affected side.\n\n4. Heat Therapy: Apply heat to the affected area for relief of muscle tension and discomfort. Use a heating pad, warm towel, or hot water bottle for 10-15 minutes at a time.\n\n5. Medications: Over-the-counter pain relievers, such as acetaminophen or nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), can help manage the pain and reduce inflammation. Consult your healthcare professional before taking any medications, especially if you have a history of gastrointestinal issues or other health concerns.\n\n6. Sleeping Position: Experiment with different sleeping positions to find one that allows your body to relax and reduces pressure on the affected sacroiliac joint. Some people find relief by sleeping on their unaffected side or using a body pillow to support their spine and pelvis.\n\n7. Nutrition: Eating a healthy diet rich in anti-inflammatory foods, such as fruits, vegetables, lean proteins, and whole grains, can help support the healing process and reduce inflammation in your body. Avoid processed foods, sugary drinks, and unhealthy fats.\n\n8. Stress Management: Stress can aggravate symptoms and make it more difficult for your body to heal. Practice stress-reducing techniques, such as deep breathing, yoga, meditation, or progressive muscle relaxation, to help manage your stress levels and improve your overall well-being.\n\nIn addition to these suggestions, consider discussing other treatment options, such as corticosteroid injections or surgery, with your healthcare professional if your symptoms persist despite conservative measures. Remember, it's always a good idea to consult with a healthcare professional for personalized advice and guidance for your specific condition."}

Or is it normal as he s started his solid food?", "human": "Hi...in this age the kids keep whatever they find in the mouth and it is normal phenomenon to get diarrhea like this and it is most probably viral in origin. Once it starts it will take 5-7 days to completely get better. Unless the kid's having low urine output or very dull or excessively sleepy or blood in motion or green bilious vomiting...you need not worry. Regards - Dr. Sumanth", "ai": " Watery stools in a child on Dumex Dupro Step 2 can have various causes. Here are some possible explanations:\n\n1. Transitioning to solid foods: As your son starts solid foods, he may experience changes in his bowel movements. Diarrhea or watery stools can be a normal part of this process, as his digestive system adjusts to new foods.\n2. Lactose intolerance: Some children may have difficulty digesting the lactose in formula, leading to watery stools. Dumex Dupro Step 2 contains lactose, so if your son is unable to digest it properly, he may experience diarrhea.\n3. Allergy or sensitivity: An allergy or sensitivity to a component of Dumex Dupro Step 2 could cause watery stools. Possible allergens include proteins in the cow's milk or soy (if your son is on Dumex Dupro Step 2 Soy).\n4. Infection: A bacterial or viral infection can cause watery stools, which may be particularly frequent after feeds.\n\nTo determine the cause, consider the following steps:\n\n1. Observe for any other symptoms, such as vomiting, fever, or rash. These symptoms may indicate an infection.\n2. Monitor your son's stools for consistency, frequency, color, and odor. Normal stools are usually yellow or brown, have a semi-formed consistency, and are infrequent.\n3. Consider any recent changes in your son's diet, such as new solid foods or a change in formula.\n4. If you suspect an allergy, keep a dietary log to help identify potential allergens.\n5. If concerns persist, consult your pediatrician for advice and further testing, if needed. Your doctor may recommend a trial of a lactose-free formula or hypoallergenic formula to determine if an allergy or sensitivity is the cause."}

{"question": "Pigmentation on neck. Turned brownish after cosmopeel.

It is normal for the skin to look darker after taking this peel.It is unlike the other peels where you do not see any peeling of skin.Here you will gradually see the darker part of the skin come out in the next few days.You should take care to apply a good sunscreen and a moisturizer in the next few days very strictly for best results.In case there is irritation/redness increases/ scab formation occurs, you may consult your dermatologist for the needful.Hope this is helpful.Take care!", "ai": " CosmoPeel is a type of chemical peel that aims to improve the appearance of pigmentation, sun damage, and fine lines by exfoliating the outer layers of the skin. Reactions after a chemical peel may vary from person to person, and it's normal to experience redness, swelling, and pigmentation changes, particularly with deeper peels like CosmoPeel.\n\nThe brownish discoloration of your neck might be a result of the pigmentation reactioning to the peel or the skin's natural response to the treatment. This brownish appearance could also be due to the inflammation that occurs during the healing process. It may take some time for the pigmentation to settle down and the skin to recover fully.\n\nGenerally, the brownish color will fade as the peel heals and new, healthier skin regenerates, but this can take anywhere from several days to a few weeks. In the meantime, avoiding sun exposure, using a broad-spectrum sunscreen, and applying a post-treatment balm or cream recommended by your healthcare provider can help support the recovery process.\n\nIt's important to remember that chemical peels can come with some risks, including increased pigmentation, scarring, and infections. If you notice any worsening of the pigmentation, increased redness, swelling, or any signs of infection (such as pus, increased warmth, or raised red areas), it's essential to contact your healthcare provider as soon as possible.\n\nMost people experience a satisfactory improvement in their pigmentation after undergoing a CosmoPeel, but the outcome varies from person to person. It's important to avoid expectations of perfection and understand that individual results will vary.\n\nAlso, if you have a history of persistent pigmentation or sensitive skin, multiple peels or deeper peels may not be the best solution for your condition. In these cases, other options, such as light-based therapies, topical creams or lasers, might be recommended.\n\nIn summary, experiencing redness, swelling, and brownish pigmentation changes on your neck after a CosmoPeel is common, and these symptoms should gradually improve as the skin heals. However, if you notice any sign of worsening pigmentation or other complications, consult your healthcare provider to ensure the best possible outcome."}

Ductal ectasia - a condition where the breasts' milk ducts become blocked or dilated, leading to discomfort, pain, and the formation of lumps.\n2. Breast cancer - although rare in older men, it can cause a painless lump and nipple discharge, but pain or tenderness in the nipple can also be an early symptom.\n3. Gynecomastia - an enlargement of breast tissue in men caused by hormonal imbalances. It can lead to tender, painful, or swollen breasts.\n4. Referred pain - pain felt in an area other than the actual source, where nerves originating from the affected area branch out and cause pain somewhere else.\n5.

It can be caused by various factors, some of the most common include:\n\n1. Ejaculatory Duct Obstruction: Particularly, when one or both ejaculatory ducts are obstructed, the semen may appear watery due to the absence of a significant volume of seminal fluid produced by the seminal vesicles. This condition typically does not impact fertility, as sperm still mix with the thin fluids from accessory glands, allowing for normal sperm transport.\n\n2. Hyperproduction of Prostate Gland Fluid: An overactive prostate gland might produce an excessively large amount of clear fluid, diluting or even displacing seminal fluid in the ejaculate. Fertility is typically not affected, as long as there are still enough viable sperm present in the ejaculate.\n\n3. Infections: Sexually transmitted infections (STIs), such as Chlamydia, Gonorrhea, or Ureaplasma may cause inflammation in the reproductive tract leading to watery semen. However, if left untreated, these infections can damage sperm and hinder fertility. Regular testing for STIs is recommended for both partners and appropriate treatment should be followed if an infection is detected.\n\n4. Other Medical Conditions: Some medical conditions, such as diabetes, multiple sclerosis, kidney diseases, thyroid disorders, and even some cancers or their treatments may lead to watery semen. Regular screenings and consultations with a doctor should help determine if there is an underlying condition that needs to be addressed.\n\n5. Psychological Factors: Anxiety or stress can cause changes in the body's hormonal balance which can lead to watery semen. Consider seeking professional help via counseling or therapy if these issues are thought to be contributing factors.\n\n6. Medications: Several medications, such as those used for treatment of high blood pressure, depression, and anxiety disorders, may impact semen appearance. Consult your doctor to discuss alternative medications or dosages if you suspect your medication could be the cause.\n\nFor couples trying to conceive, it is important to consider other factors that might be affecting fertility, such as irregular ovulation or blocked fallopian tubes. If you have concerns about your ability to conceive, it would be advisable to consult a healthcare professional (such as a fertility specialist or your primary care physician) who can assess your individual situation, determine the underlying causes, and recommend appropriate treatments, if necessary."}

{"question": "What does this chest X-ray indicate?I have a copy of chest x-ray that I had to check for Pneumonia The doctor said no Pneumonia but rather asthmatic bronchitis. I had asthma when I was very young but had outgrown it. The finding said no acute infiltrations slight coarsening of the bronchovascular markings. The costophrenic angles are sharp heart not enlarged aorta is uncoiled. Can you tell me what all this means", "human": "Thanks for your question on Healthcare Magic.I can understand your concern. I have gone through the x ray report you have mentioned. This x ray report is normal. No need to worry for pneumonia or tuberculosis. Asthmatic bronchitis is diagnosed by PFT (Pulmonary Function Test). Chest x ray is almost always normal in asthmatic bronchitis.So better to consult pulmonologist and get done clinical examination of respiratory system and PFT (Pulmonary Function Test).If PFT is showing obstructive defect then asthmatic bronchitis is likely. Hope I have solved your query. I will be happy to help you further. Wish you good health. Thanks.", "ai": " Based on the information provided, the chest X-ray suggests the following:\n\n1. No acute infiltrations: This means there is no evidence of pneumonia or an acute infection in the lungs.\n2. Slight coarsening of the bronchovascular markings: This is a subtle thickening of the blood vessels and bronchial walls, which could indicate mild inflammation or fibrosis, such as that seen in asthma or bronchitis.\n3. Sharp costophrenic angles: The costophrenic angles are normal, indicating that there is no fluid buildup in the pleural spaces.\n4. Heart not enlarged: The heart size is within normal limits.\n5. Aorta is uncoiled: The aorta, the large artery that carries blood from the heart to the rest of the body, is in its normal position and shape.\n\nOverall, the chest X-ray is consistent with a diagnosis of asthmatic bronchitis rather than pneumonia. Asthmatic bronchitis is a condition characterized by chronic bronchitis and asthma-like symptoms. The findings suggest mild inflammation in the bronchial walls and blood vessels, which is common in asthma and bronchitis. The absence of acute infiltrations, fluid buildup, heart enlargement, and abnormalities of the aorta further support the diagnosis."}

It is important to remember that topical creams are most effective when used in conjunction with good skin hygiene, including regularly washing your face and avoiding picking at pimples.

So we need to rule out lung infection ( pneumonia ) first. Pneumonia can cause pleurisy ( inflammation of pleura ) and chest pain with coughing is characteristic feature of pleurisy. And pneumonia is the most common cause for pleurisy. So get done chest x ray first to rule pneumonia. Also get done stool microscopic examination to rule out blood in stool because he is having dark stool.So consult pulmonologist and discuss all these. First diagnose himself and then start appropriate treatment. He may need antibiotic drugs.", "ai": " Based on the information provided, it's important to rule out serious conditions such as lung cancer, heart disease, or gastrointestinal bleeding. Here are some suggestions for your boyfriend to consider, but it's important that he consult a healthcare professional for proper diagnosis and treatment:\n\n1. Persistent cough with chest pain and dark stools could be a sign of gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD), especially if there's no mucus in the cough. GERD is a condition where acid from the stomach flows back up into the esophagus, causing heartburn, coughing, and chest pain.\n2. Another possibility is bronchitis or chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), which can cause a persistent cough with chest pain. These conditions may not be life-threatening but can make it difficult to breathe.\n3. If your boyfriend is a smoker, or if he has been exposed to secondhand smoke, he may have developed chronic bronchitis or COPD.\n4. If the pain in the chest is severe or worsening, your boyfriend should seek immediate medical attention, as it could be a sign of a heart condition or other serious issue.\n5. Dark stools could be a sign of internal bleeding or gastrointestinal problems. A healthcare professional may recommend further testing, such as a colonoscopy, to investigate the cause.\n\nIn the meantime, here are some things that your boyfriend can try at home to alleviate his symptoms:\n\n1. Avoid spicy, greasy, or acidic foods, as these can aggravate GERD.\n2. Avoid caffeine and alcohol, as these can irritate the esophagus and worsen heartburn.\n3. Elevate the head of the bed by a few inches to prevent acid reflux while sleeping.\n4. Take antacids or over-the-counter heartburn medications to relieve heartburn and chest pain.\n5. Use a humidifier to help keep the air moist, which can make coughing more comfortable.\n6. Drink plenty of fluids to help soothe the throat and stay hydrated.\n7. Avoid deep, forceful coughing, which can worsen chest pain.\n\nIt's important to remember that while these suggestions may help relieve symptoms, they should not be considered a substitute for professional medical advice. Your boyfriend should consult with a healthcare professional to determine the underlying cause of his symptoms and receive appropriate treatment."}

Any advice?", "human": "Hello, By what you say this seems to be a medical emergency to me. The baby's respiratory rate requires hospitalization and evaluation. It could be acute bronchiolitis, please take her to the nearest Emergency Room as soon as possible. Hope I have answered your query. Let me know if I can assist you further. Regards,Dr. Sumanth Amperayani, Pediatrician, Pulmonology", "ai": " Excessive breathing in a baby, also known as tachypnea, can be caused by various underlying conditions. Some common causes include:\n\n1. Respiratory infections, such as pneumonia or bronchiolitis.\n2. Congenital heart disease.\n3. Anemia.\n4. Gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD).\n5. Prematurity or low birth weight.\n6. Fever.\n7. Pain, anxiety, or stress.\n\nGiven that your baby was a twin, born at 38 weeks, and small at birth with normal growth and development, it is less likely that her excessive breathing is due to congenital heart disease or prematurity. However, it's essential to rule out any respiratory infections or other underlying conditions, especially considering your older child's medical history.\n\nI would recommend consulting your pediatrician for an evaluation. They may perform a physical examination, observe your baby's breathing patterns, and consider ordering additional tests or imaging if necessary. In the meantime, ensure your baby remains hydrated and monitor for any signs of distress, such as increased work of breathing, retraction of the chest or ribcage when inhaling, and grunting sounds during exhalation."}

Sex is largely what happens between two ears and two minds and not that happens between two legs. There are many possible reasons leading to erectile dysfunction and commonest is stress or performance anxiety. An occasional episode of erectile failure due to situational reasons like fatigue, tension or own ''pressure to 'perform' rather to enjoy'' is very common. This diminishes arousal level and hence erection too. This seems more likely with your partner. Both of you can go for counseling with sex therapist if this happens repeatedly.Hope I have answered your query.

Stress can affect the body's ability to produce the necessary blood flow for an erection.

However, the sudden onset of intense pain, especially if accompanied by other symptoms such as nausea, vomiting, or fever, suggests appendicitis as a likely cause.

The tic began in October 2016, and it worsened after switching to Invega Sustenna in December 2016.\n\nWhile it's important to note that every individual's response to medication can vary, there is some evidence to suggest that antipsychotic medications, including Invega Sustenna, can cause vocal tics as a side effect. However, the exact prevalence and risk factors for developing this symptom are not fully understood.\n\nTherefore, it's possible that the vocal tic could be related to the antipsychotic medication in general, rather than specifically to Invega Sustenna. If your brother's symptoms are significant and bothersome, it may be worth discussing the option of trying a different medication class with his healthcare provider. Alternative medications for treating psychosis include mood stabilizers, atypical antidepressants, and anticholinergic agents.\n\nIt's also important to note that vocal tics can have various causes, including underlying medical conditions, neurological disorders, or environmental factors. Your brother's healthcare provider may want to rule out these possibilities as well before making any medication adjustments.\n\nIn summary, based on the information provided, there is a possibility that Invega Sustenna may cause vocal tics as a side effect, but it's also important to consider the possibility that your brother's symptoms could be related to the class of antipsychotic medication in general. If your brother's symptoms are significant and bothersome, it may be worth discussing the option of trying a different medication class with his healthcare provider."}

{"question": "What causes runny and painful bowel movement in a baby?my 4 month old baby is always screaming in pain when he has a bowel movement, he goes every day, sometimes a few times a day, they are soft stools, often very soft and runny, he also spends the whole day in pain trying to go. I have just started weaning him, this has made no difference, its as though he is constantly constipated without actually being constipated?", "human": "yes , your child is constipated , and the loose motions you see sometimes is due to the Fermentation of the stool by his bowel bacteria .children around the age of 4-6 months usually have these symptoms because of the change in bowel mucosa and it's beneficial bacteria , the constipation may resolve but the pain is still there because of a minor Anal fissure developed due to the straining. breastfed babies rarely can have this problem, so I recommend you to try shifting the milk towards breast milk and cut down the cows milk .the use of lactulose 2.5 ml twice daily is very helpful to loosen his stool , you can decrease the dose when you feel he is passing a lot of stool .I hope this helps", "ai": " The symptoms you described in your 4-month-old baby - frequent, painful, and runny bowel movements - may indicate a condition called infantile colic or functional constipation. Both conditions can cause significant discomfort and distress for the baby.\n\nInfantile colic is a common condition in infants under 5 months old, characterized by crying and abdominal pain, often linked to feeding or passing stools. Its causes are not fully understood, but it's thought that gastrointestinal sensitivity, irritability, or overactivity play a role. Runny stools can also be part of the picture, as the baby may not be able to properly coordinate or control their bowel movements due to discomfort.\n\nFunctional constipation, on the other hand, is characterized by hard, difficult-to-pass stools, along with straining, pain, and infrequent bowel movements. However, in your baby's case, it might not fit the typical definition due to the soft and runny stools. This can make the diagnosis challenging. Other factors that may contribute to your baby's symptoms are food sensitivities, intolerances, or unstable digestion.\n\nIt's important to remember that it's not always possible to pinpoint a clear cause or solution for the symptoms you're describing without a thorough evaluation by a healthcare professional. If you have concerns about your baby's symptoms, speak to their pediatrician for guidance. They may recommend additional tests, such as a thorough physical exam, dietary evaluation, or other diagnostic procedures, to help determine the root cause and provide appropriate treatment options. If your baby seems especially uncomfortable and inconsolable during bowel movements, it might be helpful to try various positions, such as the frog position or over your knee, to make the experience less painful for them. Also, consult your pediatrician regarding any modifications to your weaning process that may help ease your baby's symptoms."}

However, I can provide some common medications that are often used to manage shoulder pain:\n\n1. Nonsteroidal Anti-Inflammatory Drugs (NSAIDs): These medications, such as ibuprofen or naproxen, can help reduce pain and inflammation.\n2. Acetaminophen: This medication can help relieve pain without reducing inflammation.\n3. Muscle relaxants: These medications, such as cyclobenzaprine or metaxalone, can help relax muscles and reduce pain caused by muscle spasms.\n4. Corticosteroids: These medications, which can be taken orally or injected into the affected area, can help reduce inflammation and pain.\n5. Opioid pain medications: These medications, such as oxycodone or hydrocodone, can be prescribed for severe pain. However, they are typically used as a last resort due to their potential for addiction and other side effects.\n\nIt is important to note that medication should not be the only form of treatment for shoulder pain.

{"question": "Is numbness in the left leg an early sign of heart disease?Hi. At times I feel a strange sensation, like a numbing vibration that goes down my left leg. Sometimes these are constant and lasts a while and other times I feel this only a few times and always when relaxing. Since it is on my left side I m worried it may have something to do with my heart. Have you heard of this before? It is not painful, just very strange.", "human": "Hello and Welcome to ‘Ask A Doctor’ service. I have reviewed your query and here is my advice. I would explain that the numbness on your left leg does not seem to be related to any cardiac disorders. It could be related to a pinched nerve or partial epilepsy seizures. For this reason, I would recommend consulting with a neurologist for a physical exam and some tests:- a resting ECG- a lumbar spine X-ray study for possible bulging disc in this region- nerve conduction studies. If suspicions of seizures are raised, an EEG may be needed. You should discuss with your doctor on the above tests. Hope to have been helpful! Kind regards, Dr. Iliri", "ai": " While numbness or tingling in the left leg can sometimes be a symptom of heart disease, it is important to note that this is not a definitive sign. This sensation could be caused by various conditions, including nerve damage or peripheral artery disease, which is a condition that narrows or blocks the blood vessels supplying blood to your limbs. Heart disease can also cause numbness or tingling in the legs, particularly in advanced stages or when there is reduced blood flow to the muscles due to conditions like peripheral artery disease or heart failure. However, other symptoms of heart disease, such as chest pain, shortness of breath, and palpitations, are more common and may be more reliable indicators of heart disease. It is important to consult a healthcare professional for a thorough evaluation to determine the underlying cause of your symptoms. They may recommend tests such as an electrocardiogram (ECG), echocardiogram, or blood tests to evaluate your heart health."}

Your child's ability to say a few words like \"mummy\" and \"papa\" is a positive sign, and it's normal for children at this age to use single words and short phrases. However, if a child's speech remains largely unintelligible or if they continue to use only single words by the age of 3, it may be a cause for concern. Your child's teacher's recommendation to consult a speech therapist is a good first step. This professional can evaluate your child's speech and language skills and provide recommendations or interventions to support their development. It's important to remember that every child develops at their own pace, but it's also essential to ensure that they have the necessary support to help them reach their full potential."}

I would recommend consulting a pediatrician or a neurologist for a complete evaluation, including a physical exam, medical history, and potentially diagnostic tests such as imaging or lab work.\n\nIn the meantime, you can try to alleviate your child's symptoms by encouraging them to stay hydrated, avoiding any known triggers for nosebleeds, such as nose picking or dry environments, and providing a calm and supportive environment to help managed any temper tantrums or outbursts."}

{"question": "Q. I took tablet Metronidazole 5 hours after I had taken 20 ml of red wine. What can I do now?Hello Doctor,I took tablet Metronidazole 5 hours after I had taken 20 ml of red wine. What can I do now?", "human": "Hi, Metronidazole and alcohol interaction causes disulfiram-like reaction. This leads to nausea, vomiting, tachycardia (increased heartbeat), shortness of breath, etc. If you had consumed red wine 5 hours before the drug intake, then it is all right. There is nothing much to fear. You may have nausea and vomiting, but that would be minimal and temporary. 5 hours is ample time for the wine to be metabolized in the body. For further follow up, consult a family physician online --> https://www.icliniq.com/ask-a-doctor-online/family-physician", "ai": " Metronidazole and alcohol should not be consumed together. The interaction between Metronidazole and alcohol can cause unpleasant side effects such as flushing, headache, and abdominal discomfort. If you have already taken Metronidazole with red wine, it's best to avoid consuming any more alcohol for at least 24 hours. Instead, focus on staying hydrated and ensuring that you have enough food in your stomach to minimize any potential discomfort. If you experience severe symptoms such as chest pain, shortness of breath, or difficulty breathing, seek medical attention immediately."}

Hope this may help you. Contact further if follow up needed.Best regards,Dr. Sagar", "ai": " Duphaston (dupastatin sodium) is a medication used to treat secondary infertility caused by luteal phase defect (LPD). LPD is a condition where the corpus luteum does not produce enough progesterone to maintain the pregnancy after ovulation. Duphaston helps to thicken the endometrium lining and improve the function of the corpus luteum, which may increase the chances of pregnancy.\n\nHowever, Duphaston alone does not cause pregnancy. It is usually prescribed in combination with ovulation induction agents or intrauterine insemination (IUI) or in vitro fertilization (IVF) treatments. Taking Duphaston for 16 days since your last menstrual period (LMP) does not guarantee pregnancy, and you may still experience your next menstrual cycle if you are not pregnant.\n\nThe timing of your next period depends on the duration of your menstrual cycle. If your menstrual cycle is typically 28 days long, you may expect your period around day 28. However, menstrual cycle lengths can vary, and it is essential to listen to your body and monitor your menstrual symptoms to determine when your period is due. If you take pregnancy tests, it is recommended to wait at least one week after the expected start of your period before taking them to ensure accurate results.\n\nRemember, each person's situation is unique, and it is important to consult with your healthcare provider for personalized medical advice. If you have concerns about your fertility treatments or menstrual cycle, it is essential to discuss these with your healthcare provider for guidance."}

Three weeks is generally considered an appropriate length of time for this regimen. However, every case is unique, and your husband's healthcare provider may have considered his specific situation when making this decision. They may have determined that a shorter course of antibiotics would be sufficient based on factors such as the early stage of the disease and your husband's overall health.\n\nRegarding the use of supplements, there is some evidence that curcumin, the active ingredient in turmeric, and probiotics can support a healthy immune response and improve gut health, which may aid in the treatment of Lyme disease. However, it's essential to keep in mind that these supplements should not be considered a replacement for the prescribed antibiotics. Instead, they can be used adjunctively as part of an overall treatment plan. Always consult with your husband's healthcare provider for guidance on any additional treatments or complementary therapies."}

Hydration: Encourage the child to drink plenty of fluids to keep their mucous membranes hydrated.\n2. Nasal saline irrigation: Use a bulb syringe or a nasal irrigator to gently irrse the nostrils with salt water solution to help keep them moist and reduce crusting.\n3. Cold compression: Apply a cold compress to the affected nostril to help reduce bleeding and swelling.\n4. Avoid nose blowing: Advise the child not to blow their nose forcefully to avoid aggravating the nosebleed.\n5. Hyaluronic acid nasal gel: Consider using a hyaluronic acid nasal gel to help reduce nosebleeds by keeping the mucous membranes moist.\n6. Vasoconstrictor drops: In some cases, a doctor may prescribe topical nasal decongestants or vasoconstrictor drops to help reduce the size of blood vessels and decrease the frequency of nosebleeds.\n7. Allergy medication: If the child's nosebleeds are triggered by allergies, an allergist may recommend allergy medication to help manage the symptoms.\n8. Cautery: In severe cases, a child may require cautery or other medical intervention to stop the nosebleed, but this is usually a last resort.\n\nAs for the question of how long the nosebleeds may continue, it is difficult to say definitively as each child's case is unique. Some children may grow out of the condition as they age, while others may continue to experience nosebleeds into adolescence or even adulthood.

Wish you a very good health.", "ai": " I'm an AI language model and not a doctor, but I can try to help you understand the general perspective on the possibility of a complete cure for bone cancer based on available information.\n\nThe prognosis for bone cancer varies widely depending on several factors, including the stage of the cancer at diagnosis, the type of bone cancer, and the patient's overall health. According to the American Cancer Society, the five-year relative survival rate for all types of bone cancer combined is around 68%, which means that about two out of three people diagnosed with bone cancer will survive for at least five years.\n\nHowever, this statistic does not apply directly to your uncle's case, as his cancer has already spread to major bones and involves the femur. The prognosis for bone cancer that has spread beyond the original site is generally poorer than for bone cancer that is localized.\n\nYour uncle's first cycle of chemotherapy and radiotherapy is just the beginning of his treatment. The effects of these treatments become more evident as he undergoes more cycles. Doctors will monitor his response to treatment and adjust the plan accordingly.\n\nThe possibility of a complete cure for your uncle will depend on several factors, including the type of bone cancer, the extent of its spread, and his response to treatment. This information, along with regular evaluations by his healthcare team, will help determine the best course of action and his prognosis.\n\nUltimately, only your uncle's healthcare team can provide an accurate assessment of his chances for a complete cure based on his unique situation.

The joints of my middle right finger are extremely stiff for a while and I cannot move my fingers smoothly - they seem to pop when I open and close my hand. I am only 25.", "human": "Hi, As this may be nerve root entrapment in the cervical spine it needs an assistance of the MRI to look for. because any injury to the nerve root will affect the distal joint of the upper limbs.

Hope I have answered your query. Let me know if I can assist you further. Regards,Jay Indravadan Patel,Physical Therapist or Physiotherapist", "ai": " The causes of numbness and stiffness in your hand, particularly in the mornings and affecting multiple fingers, can be attributed to several conditions. Here are some possible explanations, listed in no particular order:\n\n1. Carpal Tunnel Syndrome: This condition causes pressure on the median nerve, which runs through the wrist and into the hand. Frequent activities like typing, driving, or using tools can irritate the nerve, leading to numbness, tingling, and stiffness in the fingers.\n\n2. Arthritis: Different types of arthritis such as rheumatoid arthritis or osteoarthritis may affect the hand and cause stiffness, pain, and numbness. This condition can occur due to aging or an inflammatory response in the body.\n\n3. Peripheral Neuropathy: Nerve damage located away from the brain and spinal cord, called peripheral neuropathy, can also result in numbness, tingling, and stiffness in the hands. Underlying conditions, like diabetes or vitamin deficiencies, can cause this condition.\n\n4. Thyroid Issues: Hypothyroidism, a condition caused by an underactive thyroid gland, can contribute to hand numbness, stiffness, and sensitivity to cold.\n\n5. Vitamin Deficiency: A deficiency in certain vitamins, particularly B12 and B6, can cause symptoms of numbness, tingling, and weakness in the hands and other parts of the body.\n\nTo determine the underlying cause of your symptoms, consult with your healthcare professional, who may perform a thorough examination, medical tests, or refer you to a specialist for further evaluation. Your doctor will be able to develop an appropriate treatment plan based on the specific diagnosis."}
{"question": "What does a hole in the gum indicate?My daughter age 5.5 just came to me with a piece of what looks like a tooth from her 6 year molar area. She doesn't have her 6 year molars yet. Did her molar break off or is this something like an enamel pearl? There is a hole from where this tooth piece emerged.", "human": "Hello and Welcome to ‘Ask A Doctor’ service.I have reviewed your query and here is my advice.A hole on the gum from where a tooth like small piece came off can be due to any portion of milk tooth. It can be any supernumerary tooth also.A small hole can be due to tear in the gum from where the permanent molar will erupt.In case if there is no other problem and her teeth had proper milestones then you need not to worry.You can also consult a Pedodontist and get her checked and an x-ray can be done to see the condition of underlying permanent teeth.It does not look like broken piece of permanent molar, so do not worry.However, an x-ray is more appropriate to rule out the exact condition of the permanent tooth.Hope I have answered your query. Let me know if I can assist you further.Regards,Dr. Honey Arora", "ai": " Based on the information provided, it's unlikely that your daughter's 6-year molar has come in yet and she has lost a piece of it, as 6-year molars typically erupt between the ages of 5-7. The hole and tooth fragment might be an enamel pearl, which is a small, mineralized nodule found on the developing tooth surface. This occurrence is relatively common and not a cause for concern. However, it's crucial to monitor for signs of tooth decay or any irregularities in your daughter's dental development. An enamel pearl itself isn't harmful, but it may be a sign of a weak tooth enamel, which could lead to dental problems in the future. Schedule a dental appointment to confirm the diagnosis and ensure your daughter's oral health."}

{"question": "Q. What are the chances of HIV transmission through mosquitoes?Hello doctor,Regarding the transmission of HIV by mosquitoes, I have following query. I know the virus does not survive in insects, but what if some mosquito bites a very high viral load HIV-infected person and then bites an uninfected person on his wound, who crushes it on his wound. If the above situation happens at three or four places on his body simultaneously by an HIV-infected mosquito, what is the possibility of HIV transmission by this method?", "human": "Hi. It is good that you have an interest in HIV transmission. Hope your query is answered, but if you have any other question, please do not hesitate to ask or call anytime. For more information consult an HIV AIDS specialist online --> https://icliniq.com./ask-a-doctor-online/HIV-AIDS-specialist", "ai": " The chances of HIV transmission through mosquitoes are extremely low. HIV requires human or primate cells to replicate, and mosquitoes do not have these types of cells.\n\nHIV transmission occurs through direct contact with infected body fluids, such as blood, semen, or breast milk. Even in the scenario you described, where a mosquito bites an HIV-infected person with a high viral load and then bites an uninfected person at multiple wound sites, the risk of transmission is negligible.\n\nAccording to the World Health Organization (WHO), there is no evidence that mosquitoes can transmit HIV. Mosquitoes transmit diseases such as malaria, dengue, Zika virus, and others by injecting their saliva into the skin during a bite. However, HIV is not present in saliva or the digestive tract of mosquitoes, and it cannot survive in the mosquito's body. There have been no documented cases of HIV transmission via mosquitoes in medical literature.\n\nTherefore, the probability of HIV transmission through the method you described is close to zero. Maintaining safe behaviors to prevent the spread of HIV, such as using condoms during sexual activity, avoiding sharing needles, and getting tested for HIV regularly, remain the most effective ways to prevent HIV transmission."}

Lymph node enlargement can be due to Tuberculosis/local infection/gen viral infection etc. So, as your doctor is investigating the cause, be patient till then and follow your doctor's advise. All the best.", "ai": " Based on the information provided, it is important to note that I cannot definitively diagnose your son's condition, as I am an AI language model and do not have the ability to examine him or obtain his complete medical history. However, I can suggest some steps based on the given symptoms and test results.\n\nGiven your son's persistent high-grade fever despite antibiotic treatment and enlarged mesenteric lymph nodes as seen on ultrasound, there are several possible infectious causes that should be considered. One possibility is tuberculosis (TB), which can cause prolonged fever, weight loss, and enlarged lymph nodes. An ELISA test for Koch's bacillus (the bacterium that causes TB) and IgG and IgE antibodies will help confirm or rule out TB.\n\nHowever, there are other infections that can also present with similar symptoms, such as typhoid fever, intestinal parasites, and viral infections. Your doctor may also consider testing for these conditions based on the clinical presentation and response to treatment.\n\nIn the meantime, it is important to ensure that your son receives adequate fluids to prevent dehydration due to his fever. Acetaminophen (paracetamol) or ibuprofen can be used to manage the fever, but it is important to follow your doctor's instructions regarding dosing and frequency. If your son becomes lethargic, has decreased urine output, or develops other concerning symptoms, you should seek immediate medical attention.\n\nI would strongly advise against self-diagnosing or treating your son based on information Found on the internet and recommend that you continue to follow your doctor's recommendations and consult with them for any questions or concerns you may have."}

However, it's not a common early symptom. Other symptoms of Hepatitis C may include fatigue, loss of appetite, nausea, abdominal pain, dark urine, and yellowing of the skin and eyes (jaundice).\n\nGiven your son's history of being diagnosed with Hepatitis C five years ago and experiencing food poisoning more recently, it's more likely that his vomiting is related to the food poisoning.

Your primary doctor has suggested the possibility of fibromyalgia, which is a condition characterized by chronic widespread pain, tenderness, and fatigue. However, other conditions such as costochondritis, herniated disc, or muscle strains in the upper back and neck could also cause similar pain. Given your medical history of IBS, headaches, and the normal results from your EKG, chest x-ray, and echocardiogram, fibromyalgia appears to be a reasonable suspicion. However, it would be important to rule out other potential causes, such as a nerve root compression or an underlying inflammatory condition. You may want to consider consulting a rheumatologist for further evaluation. In the meantime, you may try managing your symptoms with physical therapy, pain management techniques such as heat therapy or massage, and medications as recommended by your doctor."}
{"question": "What causes recurring throbbing pain in wrists?I have been getting an on and off severe throbbing pain in my wrists (usually right but sometimes left) and it feels like the pain is in my veins. It has been happening multiple times a day lately but used to come and go over a few days. What is this?", "human": "Hello,Your symptoms are suggestive of a pinched nerve (possible carpal tunnel syndrome). I would recommend consulting with a neurologist for a physical exam. Performing nerve conduction studies may be needed. You should discuss with your doctor on the above test.Hope I have answered your question. Let me know if I can assist you further. Regards,Dr. Ilir Sharka, Cardiologist", "ai": " Recurring throbbing pain in the wrists, which feels like it's in the veins, could be a sign of Carpal Tunnel Syndrome or Wrist Arteriosclerosis. Here are brief explanations of both conditions:\n\n1. Carpal Tunnel Syndrome: It's a common condition caused by compression of the median nerve as it passes through the carpal tunnel, a narrow passageway situated on the wrist's palm side. Common symptoms include numbness, tingling, and pain in the thumb, index, middle, and half of the ring finger. The pain may worsen during the night or with activities that require prolonged wrist bending or forceful gripping.\n\n2. Wrist Arteriosclerosis: It's a less common condition where the arteries in the wrist become thickened and hardened due to a buildup of plaque, which reduces blood flow. The condition can cause throbbing pain, cramping, or numbness in the hand and wrist. It's more common in older adults and those with a history of cardiovascular disease.\n\nPlease consult a healthcare professional for a proper diagnosis and appropriate treatment options. If you suspect you might have Carpal Tunnel Syndrome, consider wearing a wrist brace to provide some support and relieve symptoms. For Wrist Arteriosclerosis, lifestyle modifications like regular exercise, quitting smoking, and maintaining a healthy diet can be beneficial. In severe cases, surgical intervention might be necessary."}
{"question": "What does this renal scan report signify?May I know if there should be any concern when a report mentions a 0.3cm echogenic focus in the right mid renal mid pole, suspected to be calculus or calcification.Patient is a chronic UTI patient, 72 years old, with 3 cases of bladder stones removed. Will the stone at the renal move the the bladder and cause bladder infection again? what are the few causes of calcification or stone/cysts in various organs? thank you. Ms Lee", "human": "Hi,nothing has to be done for the stone, stones less then 5 mm generally come out by itself. stones do not cause bladder infection. bladder infection is due to bacteria entering the urine system from blood or from urinary opening.", "ai": " The mention of a 0.3cm echogenic focus in the right mid renal mid pole, suspected to be calculus or calcification, on a renal scan report indicates the potential presence of a small renal calcular (renal stone) or calcification in the right kidney. Renal calculi are common, especially in chronic UTI patients, as mineralization occurs in response to infection. While there is a possibility that a renal stone can migrate down to the urinary tract and cause a bladder infection again (known as ascending urinary tract infection), it is not a given. The likelihood of this occurring depends on various factors such as the size and location of the stone, as well as the patient's individual health conditions.\n\nNon-renal causes of calcification or the presence of stone/cysts in various organs include:\n\n1. Calcification due to chronic inflammatory conditions such as tuberculosis, sarcoidosis, or calciphylaxis.\n2. Calcification associated with certain medications or metabolic disorders like hyperparathyroidism.\n3. Hepatic calcification, which can be related to hemolytic anemia, chronic infections, or drug-induced cholestasis.\n4. Cardiac calcification, which is typically a deposition of calcium in the wall of the heart, indicating atherosclerosis.\n5. Calcification in the lungs, which can be related to inflammatory processes like tuberculosis or silicosis, or from the presence of lung cysts.\n\nGiven your patient's history of chronic UTIs and multiple bladder stone removals, it appears that the observed focus is most likely renal in origin. The impact on the patient's health and the need for further evaluation would depend on the size, location, and stability of the lesion, the patient's overall health status, and additional clinical information. Consultation with a nephrologist and/or radiologist is advised for a definitive interpretation and determination of the next steps."}

Other potential causes of hematuria include bladder infections, stones in the urinary tract, or certain medications.\n\nHowever, based on the symptoms you provided, it is essential to consider the possibility of an underlying cardiovascular condition, given the previous chest pain and high blood pressure. The kidney pain and blood in the urine should be evaluated in the context of these symptoms.\n\nThe following steps should be taken:\n\n1. Consult a healthcare professional: The symptoms described should be evaluated by a medical professional as soon as possible. Depending on the severity and assessment of the symptoms, they may recommend further testing, such as a urinalysis, blood tests, kidney function tests, an ultrasound, or other imaging tests to determine the underlying cause.\n2. Consideration of cardiovascular conditions: Given the symptoms of chest pain and high blood pressure, the healthcare professional will likely want to investigate potential cardiovascular conditions. This may include an electrocardiogram (ECG), echocardiogram, or other cardiac tests to assess heart function and rule out conditions such as coronary artery disease or aortic aneurysm.\n3. Monitor blood pressure and pulse: Continuous monitoring and management of blood pressure and pulse is crucial as high blood pressure can exacerbate kidney damage and further complicate the situation.\n4. Management of kidney pain and blood in the urine: Depending on the cause of the kidney pain and blood in the urine, treatment options may vary, ranging from pain management and hydration to antibiotics for infections or surgery for kidney stones.\n5. Follow-up care: Regular follow-up care with the healthcare professional is necessary to monitor the progression of symptoms and the resolution of any underlying conditions.\n\nWhile it's important to remain informed about potential health concerns, it's crucial to trust the advice and expertise of medical professionals to accurately diagnose and treat any health conditions."}

{"question": "How many times can contraceptive pills be taken?i had unprotected sex on the 23rd December 2013 and i used the emergency contraceptive and again on the 1st of January 2014 ihad unprotectd sex before my period starts. My question is can i use the emergency contraceptive gain while i did not get period? i am very afraid i will fall pregnant", "human": "Hello,I have gone through your query and understood the concern. There is no need to use an emergency contraceptive pill around the menstrual period because this is the safe period. Ovulation occurs two weeks prior to the onset of the next period and this is the fertile period. So, in the manner you have described, you cannot get pregnant and hence, there is no need to worry. Also, restrict the use of emergency contraceptive pills to once or twice a year since they have a high hormone content and hence disturb the hormone milieu of the body badly. Hope this helps.", "ai": " Based on the information you provided, you used emergency contraception (EC) on two occasions: once on January 1, 2014, and once on an uncertain date before getting your period. It is important to note that EC works primarily by preventing ovulation, but it can also prevent fertilization if ovulation has already occurred.\n\nEC does not protect against sexually transmitted infections. If you had unprotected sex before your menstrual period started, it's possible that ovulation had already occurred, and the EC might not have been effective in preventing pregnancy.\n\nRegarding your question about taking contraceptive pills, the use of EC should not interfere with the use of combined oral contraceptive pills (COCs), as long as you start taking COCs as soon as possible, typically on the following day after using EC. In your case, since you took EC on January 1 and your period is not yet here, it's recommended to start taking COCs immediately to prevent another potential pregnancy.\n\nYou should consult a healthcare professional for accurate information and advice regarding your contraceptive options based on your personal medical history and needs. Always remember that the use of reliable contraception is essential for preventing unintended pregnancies and protecting against sexually transmitted infections."}

This can occur due to various reasons, including hormonal changes, age, or lifestyle factors. If you have any other symptoms such as abdominal pain, cramping, mood swings, or irregular cycles, it may indicate an underlying medical condition, and you should consult your healthcare provider for further evaluation.\n\nIt is essential to remember that spotting or light bleeding in between periods can still be normal, but you may find it helpful to track your menstrual cycle using a calendar or a menstrual cycle tracking app to monitor the frequency, duration, and amount of bleeding to better understand your body's changes.

You can try dissolution treament provided the stones are soft and do not exhibit post acoustic shadowing which your report does not mention. If this fails then the treatment in symptomatic cases is cholecystectomy.Regards", "ai": " Based on the information provided, the gallbladder appears normal in size and configuration with no thickening of the walls. The presence of mobile echoes, which are moving bright spots within the lumen (cavity) of the gallbladder, is a common finding in bile sludge or cholesterol crystalls. This is not a significant finding in itself and does not indicate the need for treatment unless other symptoms such as abdominal pain, jaundice, or elevated liver enzymes are present.\n\nThere is no mention of gallstones in the Ultrasound report. If the main concern is related to the mobile echoes, there is no specific medication to dissolve them. These mobile echoes are likely caused by cholesterol crystals within the bile. However, if the gallbladder function is affected or if there are other signs of gallbladder disease, then consideration for further evaluation such as a HIDA scan or cholescintigraphy may be required.\n\nLifestyle modifications such as a healthy diet rich in fruits, vegetables, and lean protein can help to reduce the risk of gallstones and cholesterol crystal formation. Adequate hydration and regular exercise are also essential for maintaining gallbladder health.\n\nIt is important to discuss any concerns or questions with your healthcare provider to determine the best course of action based on your individual situation."}

Follow-up at after a month.", "ai": " The darkening of the skin in the area between the thighs and the buttocks, often referred to as the \"buttocks cleft\" or \"intergluteal fold,\" is a common condition called acanthosis nigricans. This condition results in hyperpigmentation, or the darkening of the skin due to an overproduction and accumulation of melanin and certain other substances.\n\nAcanthosis nigricans can be caused by various factors, including:\n\n1. Insulin resistance: This is the most common cause of acanthosis nigricans. Insulin resistance occurs when the body's cells do not respond appropriately to insulin, leading to high insulin levels and the production of excess melanin.\n2. Obesity: Being overweight or obese is a significant risk factor for acanthosis nigricans. The condition is more common in people who are overweight, and losing weight can often improve the appearance of the affected areas.\n3. Certain medical conditions: Certain medical conditions, such as type 2 diabetes, polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS), and Cushing's syndrome, can cause acanthosis nigricans.\n4. Certain medications: Certain medications, such as birth control pills, niacin, and steroids, can cause acanthosis nigricans.\n\nTreatment for acanthosis nigricans depends on the underlying cause. If the cause is insulin resistance or obesity, weight loss and lifestyle changes, such as a healthy diet and regular physical activity, may be recommended. In some cases, medications such as metformin or topical retinoids may be prescribed to help improve the appearance of the skin. If the cause is a medical condition, treating the underlying condition may help improve the appearance of the skin.\n\nIt is important to note that darkened skin in these areas is a common condition, and treatment is often not necessary for medical reasons. However, if you are concerned about the appearance of the skin or if the condition is causing you distress, it is important to speak with your healthcare provider for an evaluation and appropriate treatment options."}

Up to now there are no known interactions between Rabipur and alcohol. However you should be very careful and cautious for any signs and symptoms!", "ai": " I am not a doctor, but I can try to help you find an answer to your question. Alcohol can have interactions with certain medications, and rabies vaccines like Rabipur are no exception. However, the specific interaction between Rabipur and alcohol is not well-studied.\n\nThe Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) recommends avoiding alcohol consumption for at least 72 hours after receiving a rabies vaccine. This recommendation is based on the possibility of alcohol enhancing the risk of local reactions, such as pain and swelling at the injection site, and potentially reducing the effectiveness of the vaccine.\n\nYour headache after receiving the initial Rabipur shots may not necessarily be related to alcohol consumption. Rabies vaccines can cause side effects such as headache, fever, muscle pain, and soreness at the injection site. If your symptoms persist or worsen after receiving the second shot, you should consult your healthcare provider.\n\nRegarding your question about taking three more shots of Rabipur and alcohol consumption, it's essential to follow your healthcare provider's instructions carefully. They can provide you with accurate information based on your medical history and current situation. If you have concerns or questions, you should discuss them with your provider before proceeding with the additional shots.\n\nIn summary, while there is no definitive answer about alcohol consumption and Rabipur shots, it's best to avoid alcohol for at least 72 hours after receiving the vaccine, as recommended by the CDC.

{"question": "What causes tightening sensation in the pelvic area during pregnancy?Hi I m 6 week and 2 day pregnant I m getting this thighting feeling at my pelvis area is quite discomfort special when I need to go to toilet I m really worried because I had two miscarrieges already this one quite different pregnancy to my others pregnancy is it normal.", "human": "HI,    Thanks for the query. I understand your concern.  -  IT's natural for you to be worried following two miscarriages. But in my view, when you already know that your pregnancy is normal.. you should not be psychologically stressed... taking care is needed, but stress & tension can have adverse effect of pregnancy.   * Actually frequency of urination& frequent urge ( may be taken as tightening .. is normal in early pregnancy, due to pressure of growing fetus presses on  the urinary bladder. .. as a result there is no complete empting of bladder & the symptoms.   - Try to pass urine in  forward bendsng position with hands resting on knee. This relieves pressure on bladder.. it empties completely & there is no frequent urge& stretching!   *  If you are not relieved with this -    Please consult your treating doctor, tell about your tightening before urination. he will advise you-     - Get urine checked for any infection/ HSG/ Progesterone  assessment to determine hormonal sufficiency  & will prescribe needful medicines .   * Actually you had 2 abortions in past.. routinely such patients are given Progesterone supplements ( as a preventive measure ) till 12-14 weeks are completed.    You can discuss with your doctor about the supplements ( actually you must be already been prescribed  ).. . As the hormone supports pregnancy , your tension would be relieved.   Thanks.", "ai": " During pregnancy, especially in the early stages, normal physiological changes can cause sensations of pelvic pressure or tightening. This is due to the growth and expansion of the uterus as it accommodates the developing fetus. In your case, these symptoms could be related to the early stages of your pregnancy, and are generally considered normal. However, if the discomfort is severe or persistent, or if you are experiencing other symptoms such as vaginal bleeding or severe abdominal pain, you should contact your healthcare provider for evaluation. Incontinence or difficulty emptying your bladder could also be associated with other conditions, and it is important to discuss these issues with your healthcare provider. If your symptoms significantly impact your daily activities or cause excessive worry, it is advisable to seek medical advice to help alleviate your concerns. Remember, each pregnancy is unique and it's important to trust your body and keep open lines of communication with your healthcare provider."}
{"question": "Will i get pregnant with 'follicle size of 1.33*1.00 cm' on follicular study?sir i am undergoing treatment for polycystic ovaries my utrerus measures 6.5*3.0cm endometrium 4.2mm on D9 my follicle study report was both right and left ovary showed msf and on D11 left ovary there is single gf seen,measuring 1.33*1.00cm and on right ovary there is no dominant follicle seen i am much worried about whether i have chances to get pregnent or not", "human": "Hi.You of course have chances to get pregnant, you just need a little help from your doctor with a few medications. Make sure you lose weight, and also work with your doctor to help regularise your menstrual cycle. After this your doctor will prescribe fertility medication through which your chances of pregnancy will increase.Best wishes.", "ai": " Based on the information provided, it is difficult to definitively answer your question about the chances of getting pregnant with a follicle size of 1.33*1.00 cm. The presence of multiple follicles and a single growing follicle (GF) suggests that you are responding to ovulation induction treatment. However, the size of the GF alone does not guarantee successful pregnancy.\n\nSize of the follicle at the time of ovulation is just one factor that contributes to a successful pregnancy. Other important factors include the quality and number of follicles, the thickness and receptivity of the endometrium, and the quality of the sperm. In your case, since you have polycystic ovaries, the number and quality of your follicles may be impacted, which could affect your chances of getting pregnant.\n\nYour healthcare provider is the best person to discuss this with, as they can interpret the full results of your follicular study and consider other factors that may impact your fertility. They may also recommend additional tests or treatments based on your individual situation.\n\nIt's important to keep in mind that every woman's body is different, and even with the same size follicle, some women may get pregnant while others may not. It's natural to feel worried, but keeping an open line of communication with your healthcare provider can help alleviate some of the uncertainty and provide you with the best possible care and advice."}
{"question": "Is heart palpitation interconnected to blood in stool?I have been suffering from heart palpitations for more than 3 years, but now they have gotten worse i-e 120-140 bpm with a simplest activity (standing,walking etc). Recently, i noticed blood in my stool.My question is, are these symptoms interconnected?", "human": "Dear Patient,      Thank you very much for your question. According to American heart association, normal healthy heart rate is 60-100 beats per minute when you are relaxed and not engaged in a physical activity. If your heart rate is 100 bpm or above while you are resting and relaxed it is called as tachycardia. However, If you engage in any physical activity your heart rate can race up. That is normal.  Subtracting your age from 220 you can find out your maximum heart rate. For instance, If you are 50 years old, your maximum heart rate is 220-50= 170 bpm. Anyway in your condition, I would recommend that you consult your family doctor for a physical examination and proper consultation. I am sure your family doctor will direct you to a  normal ECG test and stress ECG or exercise ECG test to rule out some pathologies appearing during physical activities. Also he or she may direct you to a holter monitor test if necessary to rule out some arrhythmias.  Conditions like atrial fibrillation, atrial flutter can cause very high pulse rate like yours and sometimes for that cause is hyperthyroidism. Therefore, you might need to check your thyroid function too.               Concerning your blood in stool, I think it might be as a result of gastrointestinal pathology and I hardly believe it is  related to your high pulse rate.Also I want to ask you the color of blood you noticed on your stool. Red color fresh blood on stool can be due to hemorrhoids or due to hard stool passage  while black stool can be as a result of hemorrhage due to ulcer disease, ulcerative colitis etc.  In order to diagnose these conditions, again you have to do a stool test and explain all other symptoms you have. You may need to undergo an endoscopy if your physician wants to rule out above mentioned diseases.  I think your blood in stool may be related to a gastrointestinal pathology.Therefore, I will highly recommend that you consult your family doctor for proper consultation,diagnosis and treatment.  I hope that I've answered your question. If you have any further questions,please let me know.Good luck!Dr. Dinesh Nuwan Weerasinghe. MD", "ai": " Heart palpitations and blood in stool are generally considered separate health conditions. Heart palpitations refer to feelings of an irregular or rapid heartbeat, while passing stool with blood is a symptom of gastrointestinal issues, such as hemorrhoids, inflammatory bowel disease, or even colorectal cancer. While both conditions can cause anxiety and distress, there is no established link between heart palpitations and blood in stool, and one does not typically cause the other. If you have concerns about either of these conditions, it's important to speak with your healthcare provider for a proper evaluation and diagnosis."}

Drying the feet thoroughly and using a quality foot powder can also help prevent athlete's foot.Hope you are happy with the answer.Thank you", "ai": " Based on the symptoms you've described, it's more likely that you have a condition called dyshidrotic eczema or toxic epidermal necrolysis rather than athlete's foot. Both conditions can cause itchiness, dryness, and flakiness on the toes.\n\nSimple home treatments can help alleviate the symptoms:\n\n1. Keep your feet clean and dry: Wash your feet with warm water and gentle soap daily, then pat them dry completely with a towel. Avoid wearing socks or shoes that restrict airflow to your feet.\n\n2. Moisturize your feet: Apply a fragrance-free, hypoallergenic lotion or thick cream to the affected areas before going to bed. This will help soothe and hydrate the dry skin.\n\n3. Avoid irritants or triggers: Avoid wearing tight-fitting shoes, woolen socks, or synthetic materials that may irritate your skin. Also, avoid using harsh soaps, detergents, or hot water when washing your feet.\n\n4. Soak your feet: Soak your feet in a warm bath with Epsom salts for about 15 minutes daily. The magnesium in Epsom salts can help soothe itchy skin and reduce inflammation.\n\nIf your symptoms persist after trying these home treatments, consider seeing a healthcare professional or a dermatologist for further examination. They may prescribe topical or oral medication, especially if the condition is severe or causes significant discomfort. In rare cases, a fungal or bacterial infection may be present, and your healthcare provider might recommend medications to treat it. However, in your case, throwing away your shoes is generally not necessary unless they are the sole cause of your symptoms (e.g., they have not been dried properly after use)."}
{"question": "What causes swollen ankle and a lump in the groin area?My mom had 2 heart stents on Monday and came home Tuesday evening. She is having swelling in her right ankle and foot. It is the side that they attempted to do the stent in , but it wouldn t go , she has a slight knot at the groin area. Could she have a blood clot?", "human": "Respected user , HiThanks for using Healthcaremagic.comI have evaluated your query thoroughly .*  This seems more of hematoma formation following vene puncture for the angiography procedure .*  Ultrasound doppler will reveal  the  exact  condition .Thanks .Regards .", "ai": " According to the information provided, your mom's symptoms could be related to a few possible conditions, including:\n\n1. Peripheral edema (swelling in the leg): This is a common side effect of heart failure or other cardiac conditions, which can occur as a result of fluid build-up in the body. Swelling in the ankle and foot, especially after a cardiac procedure such as heart stenting, can be a sign of this condition.\n2. Hematoma (lump in the groin area): A hematoma is a collection of blood outside of the blood vessels, often forming a lump. It can occur after a medical procedure, such as a heart stenting, due to bleeding in the affected area. This is a common complication and can cause discomfort and swelling in the area.\n\nRegarding the possibility of a blood clot, it's important to note that the symptoms described (swelling and a lump in the groin area) could be consistent with a hematoma rather than a blood clot. However, both conditions warrant medical attention, as they can pose potential complications if left untreated.\n\nYour mom should follow up with her healthcare provider to assess the underlying cause of her symptoms. If there are concerns about a blood clot, further diagnostic tests, such as ultrasound or blood tests, may be required. In the meantime, encouraging her to rest, elevate her leg, and avoid putting pressure on the affected area may help alleviate any discomfort and reduce swelling.\n\nAlways consult with a healthcare professional for accurate information.

But don't soap-wash more than once a day. Doing so can increase dryness.Always wipe from front to back after having a bowel movement.Wear cotton panties (no synthetic fabrics), and change your underwear every day.Stay away from hot bath tubs and avoid whirlpool baths.No swimming until you get better.Do not douche. Douching removes the healthy and normal bacteria in the vagina that actually protect you from infections.Wear loose clothes; and, no pantyhose.Use condoms during sexual intercourse to prevent sexually transmitted diseases.If you are experiencing vaginal dryness, use a vaginal moisturizer. Apply a water-based lubricant (K-Y, Astroglide) before having sex.Avoid sexual intercourse until your symptoms improve.Limit the number of sexual-partner.Don't scratch -- you can further irritate the area.Apply Clotrimazole/Hydrocortisone vaginal cream for prompt relief. Get yourself checked for any STDs. Take Loratadine by mouth if you also have got itching around the genitals.May you get very well soon and have a wonderful time ahead.

HANIFUSA", "ai": " Based on your symptoms, it's crucial to consult a healthcare professional for proper diagnosis and treatment. Severe yeast infections, also known as candidiasis, may require prescription medication. Over-the-counter treatments might not be effective against the more complex infections. The symptoms you're experiencing can be indicative of other conditions, so it's important to rule out any possibilities through medical examination.\n\nFor both you and your boyfriend:\n1. Schedule appointments with your healthcare providers for proper diagnosis.\n2. Continue practicing good hygiene, including washing genital areas with soap and water.\n3. Do not use scented products, as they can aggravate symptoms.\n4. Maintain open communication with your partners about symptoms and concerns.\n5. Re-evaluate and modify lifestyle factors that could contribute to recurrent infections, such as excessive sugars or alcohol in the diet, stress, or tight-fitting clothing.\n6. Follow the treatment plan recommended by your healthcare provider carefully.\n\nKeep in mind that it's important to refrain from making assumptions about each other's conditions based on symptoms, as the various factors contributing to these symptoms could be diverse.

I dont think this is related to your previous cancer treatment¸altough sometime radiation may cause mucositis but only if stomach is radiates. If you ask me, this may be separrated disorder and usually is seen in stomach ulcer, gastritis or ulcerations and erosions so you should definitely do gastroscopy to evaluate this more accurately. It may be treated endoscopically as well. If there is active bleeding then iron supplements wont be sufficient to treat the cause. You should also take pantoprasol and avoid irritative food such as coffee, alcohol, smoking and spicy food.I hope I have answered you query. If you have any further questions you can contact us in every time.", "ai": " I cannot provide definitive treatment recommendations without consulting a healthcare professional, as your case requires a detailed assessment by a medical expert. However, I can suggest some general steps that may help manage upper gastrointestinal (UGI) bleeding along with cervical cancer treatment:\n\n1. Consult your healthcare team: Share your symptoms and concerns with your doctor or oncologist, who can evaluate your condition and determine the cause of the UGI bleeding.\n\n2. Monitor blood loss: Your healthcare team should monitor your hemoglobin and hematocrit levels to assess the extent of blood loss, and may recommend blood transfusions if necessary.\n\n3. Medications to manage symptoms and prevent further bleeding: Your doctor may prescribe medications such as proton pump inhibitors (PPIs) or histamine-2-receptor antagonists (H2RAs) to help reduce stomach acid and protect the stomach lining. These medications can help reduce the amount of bleeding and prevent subsequent episodes.\n\n4. Diet modifications: Your doctor may recommend a BRAT diet (bananas, rice, applesauce, and toast) or a low-residue diet to help minimize gastric irritation and the risk of further bleeding.\n\n5. Endoscopy: Depending on the cause and severity of the UGI bleeding, your healthcare team may recommend an endoscopy to examine the stomach and esophagus, identify the source of bleeding, and perform any necessary interventions, such as clipping or banding of bleeding vessels.\n\n6. Addressing complications: If you develop complications during cancer treatment (e.g., delayed gastric emptying or severe gastrointestinal toxicity), you may benefit from additional supportive measures, such as antiemetics, nutritional support, or intravenous fluids, to help manage symptoms and prevent further complications.\n\n7. Communication with your healthcare team: Continue to openly communicate with your healthcare team about your symptoms, concerns, and treatment goals, so they can adjust your treatment plan as needed to optimize your care and improve your quality of life."}

However many times it is seen that a person bites unknowingly over an area that is probably a lump due to an evolving tumor. If you have a habit of biting your cheek from a long time then there in no concern.Getting a biopsy might help to give you peace of mind and confirm it to be a benign lesion. White patches in the cheeks might be observed for sometime but if you have decided to get a biopsy done then that is better for you. However, biting cheek does not cause cancer. Please do not worry.", "ai": " While biting the cheek repeatedly can cause trauma, leading to conditions such as ulcers or benign growths like a fibroma or a pyogenic granuloma, there is currently no scientific evidence to suggest that biting the cheek can directly cause cancer. Therefore, it is important to wait for the results of the biopsy to determine the nature of the growth. If you have concerns or anxiety about the procedure or the results, consider speaking with your doctor or dentist to address your fears and receive accurate information."}
{"question": "Are Carob products safe to eat after gall bladder removal?Hello,      I'm curious to know if carob products are safe to eat after gallbladder removal since that I'm aware that chocolate is to be avoided after gall bladder surgery even though that a person might eat it sparingly ? Thanks!Michelle Thacker", "human": "hi.thanks for posting query at HCM yes, you may eat carbs.no harm.avoid fatty meals.and have small meals.wish you good healthregardsDr Malik", "ai": " Carob and chocolate are different foods. Chocolate contains caffeine and theobromine, which can cause complications for the liver after gallbladder removal due to their metabolization by the liver. Carob, on the other hand, does not contain caffeine or theobromine.\n\nTherefore, carob products are generally considered safe to eat after gallbladder removal. However, consuming large quantities of carob products, like any other food, may cause digestive discomfort. It's still recommended to eat carob in moderation, as overeating any food can lead to bloating, gas, and other digestive issues. Additionally, some people may be allergic or sensitive to carob, so it's always a good idea to speak with your healthcare provider if you have any concerns."}

My pressure today was 116/66 then within an hour was up to 140/80 then later dropped again. Is this normal?", "human": "Hello!Welcome and thank you for asking on HCM!Regarding your concern, I would explain that these blood pressure fluctuations are quite normal during the day. They are related to physical or emotional activity. Isolated blood pressure are not conclusive for high blood pressure. I would recommend measuring your blood pressure frequently during the day (in sitting position after 10 minutes of total relax) and write those values in a notebook. You should do this for a week and then show these values to your doctor in order to make the proper changes to your actual therapy. Some blood lab tests may be needed to exclude other possible causes of blood pressure fluctuations: - complete blood count- blood electrolytes for possible imbalance- thyroid hormone levels for possible thyroid dysfunction- inflammation tests (PCR, sedimentation rate).

It is essential to monitor your blood pressure regularly and report any concerning readings, along with symptoms such as dizziness, to your healthcare professional. They can then assess your condition and provide appropriate recommendations based on your medical history and current treatments.\n\nIt's also crucial to maintain a consistent dosing schedule for your Lisinopril medication, as sudden dosage changes can affect your blood pressure and lead to related symptoms like fatigue and dizziness.

No follicular fluid was present in either ovary on either day.\n\nGiven your diagnosis of polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS), the small right ovary and the presence of many antral follicles in the left ovary (despite their small size) are consistent with the characteristic findings of PCOS.\n\nThe absence of follicular fluid on both days could be due to several reasons, including:\n\n1. Ovulation may have already occurred, and the follicles have ruptured and released an egg, leaving no evidence of fluid on ultrasound.\n2. The follicle may not have reached maturity, and no fluid has accumulated yet.\n3. The presence of PCOS may affect the normal production of follicular fluid.\n\nHowever, it's essential to note that the presence of antral follicles, even if small and without fluid, is a sign of ovulatory activity, indicating that the ovaries are functioning to some degree.\n\nGiven your goal of trying to conceive a second child, these findings do not necessarily mean that you cannot achieve a pregnancy. However, they suggest that your ovulation may not be regular, and intercourse timed with ovulation may be necessary to increase your chances of conception.\n\nYou may consider consulting with a reproductive endocrinologist or fertility specialist to discuss further diagnostic testing and potential treatment options, such as ovulation induction medications, intrauterine insemination (IUI), or in vitro fertilization (IVF), depending on the severity of your PCOS and its impact on your fertility."}
{"question": "Does nadoxin gel have side effects?Hi doctor! I recently took treatment for acne (sotret 20mg for 4 months, nadoxin gel, faceclin and cosglo gel). I am now only using the tubes. I noticed a few days back some tiny bumps on my skin, mainly on nose and cheeks. They aren t red but sometimes the bumps on my nose inflame and become really itchy. Is it some kind of skin infection because of the tubes I am using?", "human": "Hi, During the treatment some patients may develop some adverse effects predominantly of the skin and subcutaneous tissue: burning and itching (in absolute the most common side effect), contact dermatitis, dryness and skin irritation. Hope I have answered your query. Let me know if I can assist you further. Regards,Dr. Ajeet Singh, General & Family Physician", "ai": " Nadoxin gel, also known as sodium sulfacetamide, can have side effects. Common side effects include:\n\n1. Dryness or peeling of the skin\n2. Stinging or burning sensation upon application\n3. Redness or irritation\n4. Rash\n\nSeveral days after stopping the use of Nadoxin gel, developing tiny bumps or pimples, especially on the nose and cheeks, could be a sign of a skin reaction or an infection. It's essential to differentiate between a possible allergic reaction to the gel or a new infection, such as a bacterial or fungal infection.\n\nTo determine the cause, consider the following steps:\n\n1. Examine the bumps: Do they have a distinct redness, pus, or crust? These are indicative of infection.\n2. Stop using all skincare products: Quit using cosglo gel, faceclin, and Nadoxin gel to isolate any potential irritants or allergens.\n3. Wash your face gently: Use a mild, non-foaming cleanser and lukewarm water to clean your face twice a day to minimize irritation. Remember to thoroughly dry your face.\n4. Wear sunscreen daily: Applying a UVA/UVB broad-spectrum sunscreen with an SPF of at least 30 helps protect the skin from the sun and may aid in the healing process.\n5. Observe the progress: Monitor the condition of your skin for a few weeks without applying any topical treatments. If the bumps worsen, it might be a sign of an infection that requires medical attention.\n6. Consult a healthcare provider: If you suspect an infection or an allergic reaction, contact your healthcare provider for a proper diagnosis and treatment recommendations.\n\nRemember that various factors may influence your skin, such as diet, stress, and environmental factors, which could aggravate symptoms. By following the steps above, you can minimize potential irritants and determine the underlying cause."}

Hope I have answered your query.Let me know if I can assist you further. Regards,Dr. Parth Goswami,General & Family Physician", "ai": " Your bilirubin level being elevated to 7.4 may be related to several reasons given your medical history:\n\n1. Fatty liver: Fatty liver, also known as steatosis, can sometimes cause a mild elevation of bilirubin levels. This may be due to the liver being less effective in processing and excreting bilirubin.\n2. Exercise: Starting an intense exercise regimen can cause damage to the liver, leading to a temporary increase in bilirubin levels. This condition is known as exercise-induced hepatotoxicity.\n3. High cholesterol and borderline high blood sugar: Both high cholesterol and borderline high blood sugar can put additional stress on the liver, making it work harder to process and excrete bilirubin.\n4. Gilbert's syndrome: Although you haven't mentioned it, the symptoms you describe could also be suggestive of Gilbert's syndrome, a relatively common genetic disorder that affects bilirubin metabolism, causing intermittent and mild elevations in bilirubin levels.\n\nIt's important to remember that a single elevated bilirubin level doesn't necessarily mean there's something seriously wrong, especially in the absence of other symptoms. Your healthcare provider is planning to recheck your bilirubin levels in two weeks, so the best course of action is to wait for the results, stay calm, and maintain open communication with them about any concerns or symptoms you have.\n\nAlso, continue to monitor your diet, ensure you're staying hydrated, and continue with your exercise routine if it's not causing significant discomfort. If you experience any new symptoms, such as abdominal pain or jaundice, contact your healthcare provider right away."}

However, there are several medications that can help manage some of the symptoms associated with Autism, such as:\n\n1. Selective Serotonin Reuptake Inhibitors (SSRIs): These medications can be used to treat anxiety, depression, and obsessive-compulsive behaviors in children with Autism. Fluoxetine (Prozac) and Sertraline (Zoloft) are commonly prescribed.\n2. Methylphenidate: This medication can be used to help with attention and focus. It is often prescribed for children with Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD), but it can also be helpful for some children with Autism.\n3. Antipsychotics: These medications can be used to help manage aggressive or self-injurious behavior. Risperidone (Risperdal) and Haloperidol (Haldol) are common choices.\n4. Antidepressants: Tricyclic antidepressants, such as Imipramine (Tofranil), can be used to help manage repetitive or compulsive behaviors. Selective serotonin-norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs), such as Venlafaxine (Effexor), can also be used for this purpose.\n5. Speak with your doctor about the possibility of trying a medication called N-acetylcysteine (NAC). NAC is an antioxidant that has shown some promise in reducing repetitive behaviors and improving social communication in children with Autism.\n\nRegarding the pink circles around your son's eyes, it could be a sign of an allergy or an infection. It's recommended that you consult with your doctor to determine the cause and appropriate treatment. In the meantime, to help reduce the likelihood of potential food allergens coming into contact with your son, consider consulting with a pediatrician or a nutritionist to help design a balanced and nutritious diet that meets his needs, while avoiding tree nuts and any other known allergens."}

Some time back i saw some small types of insect near my penis.Is it any serious problem. Please help me.", "human": "Hi,You should see a Dermatologist for proper advice on what treatment to be started.It could very well be an insect bite and I usually prescribe Tab Fexofenadine 120mg twice daily for 5 to 7 days along with some ointment to soothe the itching. But an examination by the Dermatologist would be best.Take care,Dr Rishi, New Delhi, India.", "ai": " Based on the symptoms you've described, it is likely that you have a common condition called jock itch or fungal balanitis. This is caused by a fungus and can cause itching, redness, and the development of small, raised, red or brown patches on the skin.\n\nHere are some steps you can take to help alleviate the symptoms:\n\n1. Keep the area clean: Wash the area gently with soap and water, rinse thoroughly, and dry the area well. Avoid harsh soaps or rubbing the area rough with a towel.\n2. Wear breathable clothing: Wear loose-fitting, breathable underwear and pants to allow air circulation and prevent moisture build-up.\n3. Avoid sharing towels or bedding: To prevent the spread of the fungus, don't share towels or bedding with others.\n4. Apply an over-the-counter antifungal cream: You can purchase an antifungal cream without a prescription from a pharmacy or supermarket. Follow the instructions on the label, applying a thin layer to the affected area and surrounding skin once or twice a day.\n5. Consider a prescription medication: If the condition does not improve after a few weeks of using over-the-counter medication, you may need to see a doctor for a prescription-strength antifungal medication.\n\nAs for the insects you saw near your penis, it's unlikely that they are the cause of your itching. However, if you continue to notice insects or other unusual symptoms, such as a thick, white discharge or a rash that spreads beyond the genital area, you should see a doctor to rule out other possibilities.\n\nAlso, it's important to practice good hygiene to prevent the recurrence of jock itch. This includes regular bathing, avoiding tight clothing, and practicing good sexual hygiene."}

The sperm motility of your husband is less. Minimum it should be 30 %. It is cause of infertility.  There are no drugs which have dramatic effect on sperm motility.  Multivitamins with zinc combination drugs are used which have shown some improvements . So I suggest your husband to start them.Also do some life style modifications like -avoid caffeine , reduce weight.-stop alcohol and smoking. -healthy diet.With your existing report there are very less chance to conceive.  Get repeat semen analysis after 3 months.  You can discuss the need for IUI.  Here healthy sperms are selected and placed in uterus. This increase chances of pregnancy.Hope I have been helpful .RegardsDr.Deepika Patil", "ai": " based on the information provided, it seems that the husband's low sperm count could be contributing to infertility. The chance of conceiving with a sperm count of 2% is low, but not impossible. Treatment options for male infertility with low sperm count include:\n\n1. Lifestyle modifications: encouraging a healthy diet, avoiding alcohol and tobacco, and reducing stress.\n2. Medications: Clomiphene citrate or letrozole can be used to stimulate the wife's ovaries to produce more eggs, increasing the chances of conception.\n3. Intrauterine Insemination (IUI): this involves placing the husband's sperm directly into the womb during ovulation, bypassing any obstacles in the male reproductive system.\n4. In Vitro Fertilization (IVF): this involves fertilizing an egg with the husband's sperm in a laboratory, and then transferring the resulting embryo into the wife's uterus. IVF is more complex and expensive than IUI but has a higher success rate.\n\nA consultation with a fertility specialist can help determine the best course of treatment based on individual circumstances."}

Pain related to kidneys is usually felt in the 'subcostal angle' which is just below the rib cage and on one side of the midline in back. A tenderness elicited by pressing deep in this region would indicate kidneys as a likely cause.

I would recommend if the pain persists for a long time or symptoms worsen, you will need to see a doctor to find out the cause of your pain.Hope this is helpful. I would be happy to answer any questions you may have.", "ai": " While I'm an AI language model and not a doctor, I can suggest some possible causes for your lower back pain based on the information you've provided. However, please keep in mind that this should not be considered medical advice. You should consult with a healthcare professional for an accurate diagnosis.\n\nYour symptoms of sharp pain in the lower left back could be related to kidney issues. Kidneys are located in the lower back, so pain in that area might come from kidney problems. However, there are other potential sources of lower back pain as well, such as muscle strains, herniated discs in the spine, or even infections.\n\nHere are a few possible reasons why your pain could be related to your kidneys:\n\n1. Kidney stones: Kidney stones are tiny, pebble-like structures that form in your kidneys. When they move around in your urinary tract, they can cause sharp, cramping pain. The left side pain you're experiencing could be a sign of a kidney stone.\n\n2. Renal colic: This condition is caused by kidney stones, often accompanied by severe pain in the side or back.\n\n3. Pyelonephritis: This is a kidney infection, which can cause pain in the side, back, and abdomen, along with other symptoms like fever and chills.\n\nHowever, there are also other causes of lower back pain, including muscle or ligament strains from heavy lifting or physical exertion. If your pain is accompanied by redness, swelling, or fever, it might indicate a more serious condition.

Continue wearing compression bandages: Ace bandages or compression stockings can help reduce swelling by applying pressure to the limb and preventing fluid build-up. Make sure the bandages or stockings are correctly fitted and not too tight or too loose.\n2. Keep the leg elevated: Elevating the leg above the level of your heart can help reduce swelling by allowing gravity to drain excess fluid from the leg. Prop up the operated leg on pillows while sitting or lying down.\n3. Maintain adequate hydration: Dehydration can contribute to swelling. Drink plenty of water and other fluids to help ensure proper hydration. Avoid caffeine, alcohol, and diuretics, which can dehydrate you and make swelling worse.\n4. Avoid prolonged standing or sitting: Prolonged periods of standing or sitting can increase swelling. Try to avoid these activities as much as possible.

Try to stick to a low-sodium diet and avoid processed foods, sugar, and alcohol.\n7. Avoid excessive heat: Heat can increase swelling. Avoid hot baths, saunas, and warm compresses. Instead, use cold compresses to help reduce swelling.\n8. Stay active: Regular physical activity, such as walking or gentle stretching, can help improve circulation and reduce swelling.

Rehabilitation Exercises: Working with a physical therapist to develop concentration exercises and fine motor skills training can help minimize tremors.\n\n2. Occupational Therapy: Adapting tools and modifying tasks can help your friend perform activities more effectively, such as using adaptive utensils or enlarging buttons on clothing.\n\n3. Medication: Although not a cure, medications like levodopa and dopamine agonists can help alleviate tremors in Parkinson's disease.\n\n4. Deep Brain Stimulation (DBS): A surgical procedure that involves implanting electrodes in specific areas of the brain to regulate abnormal impulses and reduce tremors. DBS may be an option for severe cases that do not respond to medications.\n\n5.

{"question": "Is constant crying by an infant at night a cause for concern?hi ! my baby girl is 3 month old she is crying a lot i hold her all the time but she does nt stop some time she play but at evening she start crying all night i am worried about her mostly her head is warm but she have no fever . plz tell me something . thanku", "human": "Hi,Nothing to worry, this is infantile colic which is common upto 3-6 months.Another reason is that baby is not hungry so give her enough feeding.Give her colicarmin or colicaid drops as and when required.Ok and take care.", "ai": " Based on the information provided, constant crying by a 3-month-old infant at night is a cause for concern. Here are some possible explanations and suggestions:\n\n1. Feeding issues: The baby might not be getting enough milk during the day, causing her to be hungry at night. Try offering more frequent feedings or exploring breastfeeding techniques if nursing. If you're formula-feeding, make sure the preparation and feeding method are correct.\n\n2. Developmental needs: At this age, infants often wake up during the night due to their developing sense of separation anxiety. They may need comfort from their caregivers to fall back asleep. Swaddling, rocking, or offering a pacifier can help soothe them.\n\n3. Discomfort or pain: Dental teething, ear infections, or other discomforts could cause excessive crying. Check the baby's ears, mouth, and diaper area for any signs of infection or irritation.\n\n4. Growth spurts: During growth spurts, babies may become more demanding in terms of feeding and overall care. If your baby is going through a growth spurt, trying to feed her more regularly might help alleviate some of her nighttime crying.\n\n5. Temperature and other environmental factors: Make sure your baby's room is at a comfortable temperature and that she is dressed appropriately for the environment. A consistent sleep environment can also help her develop good sleep habits.\n\nIn this particular situation, if there are no signs of a fever but your baby has been crying persistently at night and her head feels warm, it's worth monitoring her temperature more closely for a few days and paying attention to any other symptoms. An excessive amount of warmth or sweating could be a sign of an underlying issue, such as an infection. If you're concerned about your baby's crying or any other symptoms, contact your healthcare provider for advice and guidance."}

It's important to follow their recommendations and to continue having regular check-ups to monitor your blood pressure and adjust your treatment plan as needed."}

Dilute the oil with water (5 drops to 10 ml) and apply with a cotton swab.\n\n3. Hydrocolloid dressings: Such dressings, like Comfeel+ Hydrocolloid Wound Dressing, can be used to protect the crack from friction and keep it moist while healing.\n\n4. Vitamin E oil: This can help soothe dry and damaged skin. You can apply it directly to the area using a dropper or your fingers.\n\n5.

Take care Regards,Dr. AJEET SINGH, General & Family Physician", "ai": " Metformin XL 25mg, like any medication, can cause side effects, although not everyone who takes this medication will experience them. Common side effects of metformin include:\n\n1. Gastrointestinal issues, such as diarrhea, nausea, vomiting, and abdominal discomfort or bloating.\n2. Lactic acidosis, but this is rare, and it usually occurs in people with kidney or liver disease, severe infections, or who consume large amounts of alcohol.\n3. Hypoglycemia (low blood sugar) may occasionally occur, especially when combining metformin with other blood sugar-lowering medications or when fasting.\n\nMost side effects are temporary and decrease with continued use. If they persist or become bothersome, consult your doctor for advice.\n\nRegarding discontinuing metformin, since you've been taking it for five years and have controlled hypertension, it's generally not recommended to stop taking the medication without your doctor's advice. Hypertension is a chronic condition, and it's important to continue managing the condition to prevent potential health complications, such as heart attack or stroke. Therefore, discuss your concerns with your doctor before making any decisions regarding medication discontinuation. Your healthcare provider may recommend lifestyle modifications, such as diet and exercise, or alternative treatments if you can't tolerate the side effects or have other contraindications."}

Thank you,Dr. Arun TankIf you are satisfied with my answer rate me as five star and close the answer", "ai": " The unpleasant odor from a healing tattoo can be caused by a few things. It could be due to the release of hormones and other fluids during the healing process, or it could be caused by bacteria that are breaking down the tattoo ink or other organic matter. It is not necessarily a cause for concern if the tattoo appears to be healing well and there is no sign of infection. However, if the odor becomes increasingly strong or foul, or if there are other signs of infection such as redness, swelling, or pus, you should consult a healthcare professional or the tattoo artist who performed the tattoo for further evaluation.\n\nIn the meantime, you can take some steps to help the tattoo heal and reduce the scabbing:\n\n1. Keep the tattoo clean: Use a gentle soap and warm water to clean the tattoo daily. Gently pat it dry with a clean towel. Do not scrub the tattoo, as this can damage the skin and delay healing.\n2. Moisturize the tattoo: Apply a light moisturizer or aftercare lotion to the tattoo several times a day to help keep the skin hydrated and prevent excess scabbing.\n3. Avoid picking or scratching the scabs: Although it may be tempting, resist the urge to pick or scratch the scabs. This can lead to scarring or infection. Instead, let the scabs come off on their own as the tattoo heals.\n4. Avoid exposure to the sun: Sunlight can slow down the healing process and can cause the tattoo to fade. Avoid prolonged sun exposure and apply a sunscreen with at least SPF 30 if you must be in the sun for extended periods of time.\n5. Stay hydrated: Drinking plenty of water can help keep your body hydrated and promote faster healing. Avoid alcohol and caffeinated beverages, as they can dehydrate you.\n6. Get plenty of rest: Healing takes energy, so make sure you are getting enough rest to allow your body to focus on healing the tattoo.\n\nIf the odor persists or if you have any concerns about the healing process, do not hesitate to contact your tattoo artist or a healthcare professional for further guidance."}

The primary goal of using Ovosure in PCOS patients is to facilitate the maturation and release of a dominant follicle and ovulation, enhancing the chances of pregnancy.\n\nHowever, it's essential to note that Ovosure does not directly treat PCOS symptoms, such as insulin resistance, irregular menstrual cycles, or enlarged ovarian cysts. These symptoms can impact the success of pregnancy with the use of Ovosure or any other ovulation-inducing medication.\n\nTo optimize your chances of getting pregnant with PCOS while undergoing Ovosure treatment, consider the following steps in collaboration with your healthcare provider:\n\n1. Address underlying PCOS symptoms: Maintain a healthy diet, ensure adequate weight loss if necessary, and initiate metformin therapy as prescribed by your doctor to improve insulin sensitivity.\n\n2. Regular monitoring: Maintain consistent follow-up appointments with your healthcare provider and ultrasounds to accurately time the use of Ovosure and determine if ovulation occurs.\n\n3. Timed intercourse or intrauterine insemination (IUI): Utilize timed intercourse during your fertile window or IUIs following Ovosure medication administration to maximize your chances of getting pregnant.\n\nBe aware that the success rate of getting pregnant using Ovosure with PCOS may be lower than in women without PCOS, and multiple treatment attempts might be necessary. Thus, it is crucial to discuss your goals and expectations with your healthcare provider to establish an appropriate treatment plan tailored to your individual circumstances."}

However, based on the information you provided, it's most likely they have viral gastroenteritis, also known as the stomach flu. This condition can cause nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, abdominal cramps, and sometimes fever and lightheadedness, even without an actual fever.\n\nYou mentioned they haven't improved in three hours. If their symptoms persist and they show signs of dehydration (infrequent urination, dry mouth, dark urine, sunken eyes), you should offer them fluids such as clear broth, diluted fruit juice, or pediatric oral rehydration solutions to prevent dehydration. Keep them at home to rest and recover. If their condition worsens, or if they have severe symptoms such as high fever, severe abdominal pain, or difficulty breathing, consult a healthcare professional.\n\nRemember that it's essential to maintain good hygiene practices to prevent the spread of the virus, especially proper hand washing, especially before eating or preparing food for others, and disinfecting frequently touched surfaces."}
{"question": "What are the chances of pregnancy in HBV negative wife & HBV positive husband?I have been TTC from past 1.5 years. The blood test resulted all normal for me and for my husband, it is Hepatitis - B positive. Will this is the cause for not getting conceived (Wife being HBV - negative and Husband being HBV - positive) ? What is the solution if we want to conceive?", "human": "Hi, Hepatitis B positivity doesn't have any effect on conceiving. What you can do is to go for a IUI with washed sperms because chances of transmission of hepatitis B is high by normal intercourse. Also get yourself evaluated at intervals for hepatitis B. You can try ovulation induction in which you will receive medicines for growth of your eggs and when egg matures, injection will be given for rupture and IUI will be done that means after processing semen of your husband it will be directly put into your uterus.Hope I have answered your query. Let me know if I can assist you further. Regards,Dr. Khushboo Priya", "ai": " The chances of pregnancy for a HBV negative wife and a HBV positive husband are the same as that for any other couple, assuming no other fertility issues exist. Hepatitis B does not affect a man's fertility, and while it can potentially affect a woman's fertility, there is no definitive evidence that this is the cause in your case, given that your tests have been normal.\n\nIf you wish to conceive, you can do so without any additional risks. However, it is recommended that during pregnancy, the HBV positive partner's viral load be monitored to ensure that the mother does not contract the virus. Your healthcare provider can advise you on how best to manage this situation. Additionally, consider consulting with a fertility specialist for further evaluation and guidance if you have continued to experience difficulty conceiving after 1.5 years of trying."}

I can suggest some general steps you can take, but they should not replace professional medical advice.\n\n1. Encourage your husband to seek medical attention: The presence of blood clots in the brain is a serious condition and requires immediate medical attention. Encourage your husband to see a doctor as soon as possible for a proper diagnosis and treatment.\n2. Manage stress: Anger outbursts can be a sign of stress. Help your husband identify and manage his stressors. Encourage him to practice relaxation techniques such as deep breathing, meditation, or progressive muscle relaxation.\n3. Communicate effectively: Make sure your husband understands that you are there to support him and that you value his feelings. Use \"I\" statements instead of \"you\" statements when expressing concerns. For example, instead of saying \"You get angry too easily,\" say \"I feel frightened when you get angry.\"\n4. Encourage positive coping mechanisms: Encourage your husband to find healthy ways to cope with stress and anger, such as exercise, hobbies, or talking to a therapist.\n5. Create a safe environment: Make sure your home is a safe place for your husband. Remove any objects that could be used as weapons during an anger outburst.\n6.

{"question": "Tooth pain in lower left side of jaw. X-ray shows severe cavity. RCT suggested. Alternative treatment options?Hi, I have pain in some tooth in lower left side of my jaw. I met a dentist today and she performed an xray . Although clinically there is no evidence of any severe cavity, she says that xrays shows a cavity and RCT is the only option. I want to know if there can be some other measures before going for RCT. ALso, please recommend a competent and honest doctor in XXXXX", "human": "hello and welcome to HCM forum,as you stated, you are experiencing pain in your lower left tooth, but have not mentioned whether the pain is intermittent or continuous, does it radiate or not, what are the aggravating or relieving factors.therefore, i assume that the pain might be quite intolerable and that must be the reason why your dentist suggested root canal treatment.RCT is performed when the nerves and vessels of your teeth get infected, in such a case, RCT is the only treatment or in severe cases extraction of the concerned tooth.i would suggest you go for RCT quite soon before the pain becomes severe., delay in the treatment can cause spreading of infection to the sorrounding tissue(gums,jaw,etc) also.kindly visit a dentist who is specialized in RCT's.i wish you good health.take care.", "ai": " Based on the information provided, here are some alternative options to consider before a root canal treatment (RCT) for a severe cavity in the lower left side of your jaw:\n\n1. Silver Diamine Fluoride (SDF): SDF is a liquid form of fluoride that can be applied directly on the tooth to stop tooth decay and kill bacteria. A study published in the Journal of the Academy of General Dentistry shows that SDF is effective in preventing the progression of cavities in children. However, it might not be an ideal solution for large cavities. You can ask your dentist if SDF is an option for your case.\n2. Minimally Invasive Dental Techniques: There are some minimally invasive dental techniques like air abrasion and ozone therapy that can help to repair small cavities without drilling. These procedures are less invasive and might cause less discomfort compared to traditional RCT. You can ask your dentist if these techniques are suitable for your situation.\n3. Calcium Hydroxide (Ca(OH)2) Therapy: Calcium hydroxide is a material that can be placed into a tooth to stimulate the production of dentin, thereby helping to heal the tooth. This treatment can be used when the pulp is injured but not necrotic (dead). Your dentist might consider this option if the cavity is not too deep.\n4. Dental Crowns: If the cavity is too large for Filling, your dentist might suggest a dental crown. A dental crown is a cap placed over a damaged tooth to restore its shape, size, and appearance. A crown can also strengthen the tooth and prevent further damage.\n\nAs for the recommendation of a competent and honest doctor in XXXXX, I'd recommend checking online reviews or asking for referrals from trusted sources. Websites like Google Reviews, Yelp, and Healthgrades can provide valuable information about a dentist's reputation and patient reviews. Additionally, you can ask for referrals from your current dentist, family dentist, or primary care physician. Make sure to ask about the dentist's experience, credentials, and philosophy of care to ensure a good fit."}

Herpes (Herpes Simplex Virus): Herpes can cause sores or blisters on the skin or mucous membranes. In infants, herpes can manifest as:\n   - Blisters or ulcers inside the mouth\n   - Redness or swelling of the gums\n   - Fever\n   - Irritability\n   - Loss of appetite\n   - Diaper rash\n   Herpes infection in infants can be more severe and potentially life-threatening if it affects the brain, eyes, or other organs. If you suspect herpes, contact your healthcare provider right away.\n\n2. Strep (Streptococcal Infection): Strep infection typically presents as a sore throat, fever, and red and white patches on the tongue and roof of the mouth. However, it's uncommon for these symptoms to appear in children under the age of two. Strep infections in infants can cause irritability, loss of appetite, fever, and red rash (called scarlet fever).\n\nGiven your son's symptoms of red spots on the roof of his mouth, a creamy white residue, and red spots on his tongue, both herpes and strep are possible causes. Considering the doctor's suggestion of strep, you should mention this possibility to your healthcare provider for further evaluation. Your provider may consider performing a throat swab or other diagnostic tests to determine the exact cause of the symptoms.\n\nRegardless of the diagnosis, it's essential to follow the prescribed treatment plan to alleviate your child's discomfort and prevent any potential complications."}

Otherwise he needs only follow up and infection prophylaxis.Take careCome back if you have any further questions", "ai": " Based on the provided echocardiogram measurements, a bicuspid aortic valve with a normal-sized left atrium and left ventricular chamber size, as well as a normal ejection fraction, suggests a relatively mild case. However, a bicuspid aortic valve increases the risk of developing aortic root dilation and aortic insufficiency over time. In your husband's case, an aortic diameter of 4.0 cm is borderline enlarged for his age, but the actual risk of complications depends on several factors, including family history, presence of aortic insufficiency, and symptoms.\n\nThe decision to undergo surgery for a bicuspid aortic valve depends on several factors:\n\n1. Valve function: Asymptomatic patients with normal valve function and no aortic dilation typically do not require surgery.\n2. Aortic root dilation: Aortic root dilation greater than 4.5 cm in diameter is generally considered an indication for valve replacement, especially if there is evidence of increased aortic wall stress or a leaking valve.\n3. Symptoms: Severe aortic insufficiency, heart failure symptoms, or severe chest pain are indications for surgery.\n\nGiven your husband's relatively young age, borderline aortic diameter, and mild valve dysfunction, it is essential to discuss these findings with a cardiologist specializing in valve disorders. They can provide a more accurate assessment of his risk and recommend appropriate management, which may include close monitoring and lifestyle modifications to minimize the risk of complications. In some cases, surgery may be recommended earlier due to specific risk factors, such as a family history of complications or rapidly increasing aortic root size.\n\nIt is important to remember that the information provided here is a general guideline and should not replace the advice of a qualified medical professional. Your husband should consult a cardiologist for a thorough evaluation and personalized treatment recommendations based on his individual situation."}

These areas are important for motor control and sensoryProcessing. The generalized cerebral atrophy means that there is overall shrinkage of the brain tissue, which can be a normal aging process but can also be a sign of various neurodegenerative conditions. The periventricular chromic ischemic changes refer to small areas of damage in the deep white matter surrounding the ventricles, which are commonly seen in chronic ischemic conditions such as small vessel disease or Alzheimer's disease.\n\nThe presence of these findings does not necessarily mean that there is an immediate cause for concern, but they do suggest that your father may be at increased risk for further strokes or cognitive decline. It is important for him to closely follow up with his healthcare provider to discuss management strategies for reducing the risk of future stroke, such as controlling blood pressure, managing cholesterol, and addressing any other modifiable risk factors. Lifestyle changes, such as regular physical activity, a healthy diet, and quitting smoking, can also be helpful. The healthcare provider may also recommend additional testing, such as an MRI or cognitive evaluation, to further assess the extent of the damage and monitor for any progression."}

This condition is known as a rectal or pelvic floor straining. Chronic constipation may lead to this type of discomfort and also to the passage of thick, white, stringy mucus with stools.

There are many other things which need to be ascertained to make this diagnosis. There are good medications available for treatment and you must visit the doctor for evaluation. They will talk to you in more detail, assess the level of anxiety in you and accordingly will prescribe you  a treatment plan.Good luck.", "ai": " Based on your description, it is possible that you may be experiencing symptoms of Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder (OCD). OCD is a mental health condition characterized by recurring unwanted thoughts (obsessions) and repetitive behaviors (compulsions) that you feel the urge to repeat over and over.\n\nRegarding your specific situation, the compulsive behavior you described, such as the need to keep your house clean and everything in its place, is common in individuals with OCD. However, it's essential to note that these behaviors are not a guarantee of a diagnosis, as many people without OCD also prioritize cleanliness.\n\nIf you suspect you have OCD, it's essential to speak with a mental health professional for a proper evaluation. Here are some treatment options that may help if you are diagnosed with OCD:\n\n1. Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT): This type of therapy can help you understand the thought patterns that trigger your obsessions and compulsions, and teach you strategies to manage them. A therapist may teach you techniques such as Exposure and Response Prevention (ERP) to help reduce your anxiety in response to obsessive thoughts and resist compulsions.\n2. Medications: In some cases, your doctor may recommend selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) to help manage symptoms of OCD. These medications can help reduce anxiety and obsessive thoughts, making it easier to engage in CBT.\n3. Self-Help: There are several things you can do on your own to help manage symptoms of OCD, such as practicing relaxation techniques, setting realistic goals for yourself, and breaking tasks into smaller, manageable steps. Many resources, such as books, websites, and support groups, can help you learn more about OCD and strategies for managing it.\n\nIt's important to remember that everyone is different, and what works for one person may not work for another. The most effective treatment plan will depend on the individual's specific situation and the severity of their symptoms. If you're concerned about OCD or any other mental health condition, I encourage you to speak with a healthcare professional for personalized guidance."}
