{"question": "What causes tiny holes on outside of both ears?My son has tiny holes on outside of both ears, when he was born, the Dr got an x-ray to make sure his kidneys were fine. Since then no one has said anything about the holes. I asked our pediatrician and she said as long as they don t get infected. Should I be worried, sometimes a substance does come out, but it s not frequent.", "human": "preauricular ear pits , or holes are defects in the outer ear during fetal development , most of them are about 1 inch depth and sometimes they are connected to sinuses .  it's important to exclude any other anomalies that the child may have , which commonly is abnormality of the kidneys, that's why a renal ultrasound is done in the newborn period. if these pits have discharge it may indicate an infection , so the use of topical antibiotics is warranted, if there is fever then your child must be checked at his pediatrician. I hope this answers your question", "ai": " The tiny holes you're describing on the outside of your son's ears could be caused by a condition called a perforated ear drum or a canal wall downturn. These conditions can allow for the escape of earwax, fluids, or other substances from the ear canal. While the condition itself is usually harmless, repeated infections or frequent discharge may indicate an underlying issue that should be evaluated by a medical professional. It's important to keep the ears clean and dry to prevent infections and maintain ear health. Regular checks by a healthcare provider can help monitor the condition and ensure any necessary intervention is taken if needed. Your pediatrician's assessment and recommendation that the condition doesn't require further medical attention if it doesn't cause frequent infections or persistent discharge, is generally in line with current medical understanding. However, if there are concerns, it is always a good idea to consult an audiologist or ear, nose, and throat specialist for additional guidance."}
{"question": "What causes hives, trouble for breathing and swollen tongue after removing mirena?I had my mirena removed on thursday, and that night had some hives, next day hives spread, trouble breathing, swollen tongue...had to go to urgent care. I have never had allergies to food or insects, could there a be relation to removal and allergic reaction?", "human": "Hello,Your symptoms definitely suggest severe allergic reaction and the possibility of the chemicals used during the process of removal of the Mirena causing the allergy has to be considered, since you cannot be allergic to the IUD which you had been carrying in your body for so long. A definite conclusion can be arrived at only after a thorough evaluation by an allergy specialist and please make sure that you always avoid the allergen in future. Also, inform those who live with you about the allergy and what causes it. Hope you find this information useful. Wish you good health.", "ai": " Yes, an allergic reaction is a possible cause of hives, trouble breathing, and a swollen tongue after having a Mirena IUD removed. While it's uncommon, some people may develop an allergic reaction to the silicone or other components of the IUD. If you have no history of allergies, this could be a new development. It's important to discuss this with your healthcare provider to determine if further testing or follow-up is necessary."}
{"question": "Can intake of yasmin cause side effects like thrush/yeast infection?hello ever since I started taking yasmin the contraceptive pill (3months) ive had thrush/yeast infection. Ive never suffered with it before. I have also given it to my boyfriend and his penis is red and sore. im using canestan cream however there doesnt seem to be progress could this be because im taking yasmin?", "human": "Hi, Yes, the birth control pill 'yasmin' can cause thrush/yeast infection. Yasmin is a combined oral contraceptive pill that contains two different hormones viz. estrogen and progesterone. Taking these pills can cause hormonal balance which helps the yeast to grow. It is believed that the estrogen in birth control pills can cause the vagina to produce more sugars. These sugars feed the yeast already living in the vagina causing overgrowth and thus infection (vaginal thrush or candidiasis). It is a similar effect to that seen in pregnancy when estrogen levels rise naturally. If the infection bothers you too much you could be switched to a different kind of contraceptive pill with a stronger progesterone component and a weaker estrogen component or consider going on the mini-pill which only contains progesterone. Hope I have answered your query. Let me know if I can assist you further. Take care Regards,Dr. Mohammed Taher Ali, General & Family Physician", "ai": " Yes, Yasmin, like othercombination hormonal contraceptives, can increase the risk of developing thrush (Candida albicans) infections. The exact reason is not clear, but hormonal changes caused by the pill may create an environment where Candida thrives. If your symptoms persist despite treatment, it may be worth discussing your concerns with your healthcare provider. They might consider switching you to a different type of contraceptive pill or discussing other contraceptive options with you. Additionally, if your boyfriend's symptoms are similar to yours, they could also be due to a yeast infection. He should be advised to see a healthcare provider for evaluation and treatment, as men can also develop yeast infections, although it is less common."}

{"question": "Suggest treatment to increase the heightHello I have a 7 yr old girl Brook my Doc said that she is at the height she should be for her age, but I dont think so other kids in her school her age are taller. Is there something wrong with her bones? and I can i give her something to help her grow better and faster?", "human": "Hi, If the doctors who examined her told you not to worry means she is in the right growth velocity. No need to worry. growth will occur up to 18 years so no need to worry. You can give protein-rich food to help her grow. Hope I have answered your query. Let me know if I can assist you further. Regards,Dr. Rajmohan, Pediatrician", "ai": " Based on the information provided, it's important to note that individual growth patterns can vary significantly among children. While it's understandable that you may be concerned about your daughter's height, it's essential to remember that height is just one aspect of health and development.\n\nYour daughter's doctor has already assessed her height and determined that it falls within the normal range for her age. If you continue to have concerns, you may want to consider arranging for a follow-up appointment with her healthcare provider. They may be able to provide additional reassurance or perform further evaluations if necessary.\n\nRegarding your question about treatments to help your daughter grow faster or taller, it's important to know that there are no proven interventions that can significantly accelerate linear growth. Factors that influence height, such as genetics and nutrition, are largely fixed during childhood.\n\nThat being said, ensuring that your daughter has a balanced diet and adequate nutrition is essential for her overall health and development. A diet rich in fruits, vegetables, whole grains, lean proteins, and calcium-rich foods can support healthy growth and development. In some cases, your healthcare provider may recommend consulting a dietitian or nutritionist for personalized advice on your daughter's dietary needs.\n\nIn summary, while it's understandable to be concerned about your daughter's height, it's important to trust the expertise of her healthcare provider and focus on ensuring that she receives proper nutrition and care. If you continue to have concerns, consider scheduling a follow-up appointment for further evaluation."}

Mangat.", "ai": " I understand that you're asking if kidney dialysis can be delayed for your mother, given her medical history of thyroid, high blood pressure, prior kidney infection, and current creatinine level of 5.2 with a blood pressure index of 150/100.\n\nThe decision to start or delay dialysis depends on various factors. These include the severity of kidney damage, the rate of kidney function decline, and the presence of symptoms or complications. In the absence of symptoms and stable kidney function, some people with chronic kidney disease (CKD) can maintain their health without dialysis for an extended period.\n\nHowever, in your mother's case, given her high blood pressure and prior kidney infection, the need for dialysis may be more pressing. The dialysis prescribed once was likely an emergency treatment for acute kidney failure, possibly related to the infection. The ongoing medical conditions, such as thyroid disease and high blood pressure, may also contribute to the ongoing kidney damage.\n\nThat being said, ongoing communication with her healthcare team is crucial. The conversation about delaying or stopping dialysis should involve her doctors, nephrologist, and other specialists. They will consider the overall medical history, current kidney function, the progression of CKD, and any complications. They may also suggest alternative treatments, such as medication adjustments, lifestyle modifications, or supplemental treatments to help manage symptoms and potentially slow the progression of CKD.\n\nUltimately, the best approach is frequent and open communication with her healthcare team. They will provide the most accurate and personalized advice based on her specific medical situation."}

So the next step is to look for certain liver damage and most common casue is fatty liver disease. It should be confirmed by ultrasound. Other causes are viral hepatitis,s irrhosis, medications, alcohol intake or autoimmune diseases. To verify exact cause, US, bilirubin levels and tumor markers should be additionaly done Then appropriate treatment can be started.I hope I have answered you query. If you have any further questions you can contact us in every time.Kindly regards. Wish you a good health.", "ai": " 1. For high SGPT and SGOT levels in your brother's case,consult a Hepatologist or a Gastroenterologist as they are specialists in dealing with liver-related issues. You can find these doctors in Pune at:\n\n- Dr. D.Y. Patil Medical College Hospital and Research Centre, Pune\n- Ruby Hall Clinic, Pune\n- Sahyadri Speciality Hospital, Pune\n\nIn Ahmednagar, you can consider:\n\n- Kosumbi Hospital and Research Centre, Ahmednagar\n- Nisarg Hospital and Research Centre, Ahmednagar\n\n2. High SGPT and SGOT levels (over 1000 U/L) are often associated with various liver diseases. Given the context of your brother's Dengue history, it is likely that he may have developed Dengue Hemorrhagic Fever leading to liver damage. However, this is just a hypothesis, and the results of further investigations like Hepatitis A,B,C serology, and autoimmune markers will help in confirming the diagnosis.\n\n3. For the management of high SGPT and SGOT levels following Dengue:\n\na) Maintain adequate hydration: Ensure your brother drinks plenty of fluids to replace the lost fluids due to dehydration. Electrolytes supplements may also be required.\n\nb) Follow a low-fat, balanced diet: Encourage the consumption of small, frequent meals to minimize the workload on the liver. Avoid foods high in saturated and trans fats, but include plenty of fruits, green leafy vegetables, and lean proteins (like fish, chicken, and beans).\n\nc) Avoid alcohol and tobacco: Both alcohol and tobacco negatively impact liver function.\n\nd) Rest: Encourage your brother to get plenty of rest to help the body recover.\n\n4) The treatment for high SGPT and SGOT levels, particularly in the context of Dengue, will revolve around supportive care, such as:\n\n- Balanced nutrition\n- Proper hydration\n- Controlling fever with paracetamol\n- Preventing bleeding (vitamin K and fresh frozen plasma)\n- Addressing any underlying electrolyte imbalances\n\nYour brother should cooperate with the treating physicians. These medicines may also be suggested based on individual requirements:\n\n- N-acetylcysteine (NAC)\n- Vitamin E\n- Prednisolone\n- Antiviral agents (depending on the infection)\n\nIt is essential to follow the physician's recommendations and consult them for any concerns or updates."}

Side effects of antibiotics: Certain antibiotics, such as rifaximin, neomycin, and erythromycin, can cause foamy stools by increasing the amount of gas in the intestines.\n2. Malabsorption: Pneumonia and urosepsis can cause inflammation and damage to the gastrointestinal tract, leading to malabsorption of fats. When the body is unable to break down and absorb fats properly, large amounts of undigested fat can accumulate in the stool, resulting in foamy or greasy stools.\n3. Liver dysfunction: Pneumonia and sepsis can also affect liver function, leading to an accumulation of bile in the intestines and causing foamy stools.\n4. Intestinal infections: Intestinal infections, including Clostridioides difficile infection (C. diff), can cause persistent diarrhea and foamy stools.\n\nIt is important to consult your partner's healthcare provider if you notice any significant changes in their stools, especially foamy stools.

If it is above 38 degrees Celsius (or 100.4 Farenheit) she should call her OB provider to see if she needs to go back to the hospital.If her fever is not elevated, she may just be cold, so lots of blankets, hot tea and warm clothing will make her feel better and it may just take time for her to get over this illness.Make sure she drinks lots of liquids and also pay attention to the movements of the baby.

However, in your friend's case, the absence of a fever and the presence of terrible chills and a hot forehead could be indicative of hypothalamic dysfunction or thyroid issues, which can also cause such symptoms during pregnancy. The low potassium level mentioned may be a separate issue and not directly related to the fever and chills.

{"question": "What does lump in the liver in CT scan indicate?Was at the gastroenterologist yesterday and by chance a CT scan showed a lump in my liver. I was not expecting this, as that was not what I was being treated for. It is 1/2 AND HE SAID TO WAIT 3 MONTHS AND WE WOULD DO ANOTHER SCAN to see if it grows. Should I be worried and see another doctor?", "human": "Hi, dearI have gone through your question. I can understand your concern.Accidental lump in the liver is common. You may some benign cyst or hemangioma. Wait for a month. GO for ultrasound and if size is increasing then you should go for ultrasound guided liver biopsy to search the cause of lump. Then you should take treatment accordingly.Hope I have answered your question, if you have any doubts then contact me at bit.ly/Drsanghvihardik, I will be happy to answer you.Thanks for using health care magic.Wish you a very good health.", "ai": " A detected liver lump on a CT scan may indicate various conditions, including benign cysts, benign tumors, or malignant tumors. A wait-and-see approach, as suggested by your gastroenterologist, is typically adopted for smaller liver lesions to observe if they grow or change, which could provide clues as to their nature. However, a significant growth or other concerning features may require further evaluation, such as a biopsy or additional testing.\n\nIt's essential to maintain open communication with your healthcare provider and discuss any concerns or anxiety you may have regarding your liver lump. Keep in mind that the likelihood of this being a malignant condition is relatively low, and most liver lesions detected incidentally on imaging studies are ultimately benign.\n\nIn your case, you should consider following up with your doctor every three months for imaging studies and discussing any new symptoms or concerns you may have. If you feel uneasy or have other health issues, it might be worth consulting with another healthcare professional for a second opinion. But, try not to panic, as the results of a watch-and-wait approach are usually reassuring in most cases."}

As Calutide-50 is a common hormonal therapy used for prostate cancer, there might not be an immediate need to change the medication if the father is responding well to it and experiencing minimal side effects.\n\nHowever, it is always recommended to consult a healthcare professional, such as an oncologist or urologist, for a thorough evaluation to assess the current status of the cancer and to discuss any potential changes in treatment or medication as necessary. Regular follow-up appointments are crucial to monitor disease progression and side effects.\n\nIt is also important to note that the information provided might not cover all aspects of the father's medical history, and individual circumstances may vary.

However, as you've mentioned, it can be challenging to find DXM lozenges due to their discontinuation.\n\nAs an alternative, you may consider using other OTC medications that can help alleviate your cold and cough symptoms:\n\n1. DXM Cough Syrups: Although you mentioned a preference for lozenges, DXM cough syrups can be effective alternatives. Follow the recommended dose mentioned on the label.\n\n2. Expectorants: Expectorants help to thin and loosen mucus in the chest and throat, making it easier to cough up and expel. Common brands include Mucinex, Robitussin, and Sudafed PE.\n\n3. Pain Relievers: Decongestants like pseudoephedrine, found in brands like Sudafed and Claritin-D, can help relieve the pain and pressure associated with a persistent cough. However, be aware that they can increase heart rate and cause insomnia in some individuals.\n\n4. Hydration: Staying hydrated can help soothe a sore throat and ease coughing. Drinking plenty of water, tea, or clear soups can help you feel better and reduce the severity of your symptoms.\n\n5. Honey and Lemon: Adding honey and lemon to warm water can help soothe a sore throat and provide some relief from coughing. Honey has antibacterial properties, while lemon contains vitamin C, which can help boost the immune system.\n\n6. Saline nasal drops or sprays: These can help alleviate nasal congestion, making it easier to breathe and reduce the strain on your chest and throat when coughing.\n\nBefore taking any new medication, be sure to read the label carefully and consult your healthcare provider if you have any concerns or questions about the safety or appropriateness of the specified alternative medication."}

It is rare for men under the age of 18 to develop prostate cancer. Therefore, based on your age, the likelihood of having prostate cancer is extremely low.\n\nYour concerns and anxious feelings might be related to a psychiatric condition such as hypochondriasis or illness anxiety disorder. These are conditions where individuals have an excessive preoccupation with having a serious illness, despite no or minimal medical evidence to support their concerns. If you find that your worries are significantly impacting your daily life, causing distress, and interfere with your normal activities, it may be beneficial to speak with a healthcare professional or a mental health specialist to discuss your symptoms and explore potential treatment options.

The three-week regimen prescribed to your husband is considered the minimum treatment duration for early-stage Lyme disease. However, prolonged treatment beyond three weeks might be necessary for more severe cases or those with persistent symptoms. Consulting with his healthcare provider is recommended to determine the best course of action.

I suggest using emollient ointment or creams for this. If still not better - I suggest you to upload photographs of the same on this website, so that I can guide you scientifically.  Skin conditions are best diagnosed only after seeing directly. Regards - Dr. Sumanth", "ai": " Based on the information provided, the causes of skin peeling on a child's hands and feet without itching, redness, or irritation for a few weeks could be:\n\n1. Athlete's foot (tinea pedis): A fungal infection that often affects the feet and between the toes, causing peeling and flaking of the skin. It is contagious and can be acquired from sharing towels, pools, or locker room floors.\n2. Dry skin (xerosis): Dryness can lead to skin peeling, especially in areas like hands and feet that are frequently exposed and washed. In football players, repeated hand washing and sweat can contribute to dryness.\n3. Allergic reaction: Some children may have allergic reactions to certain soaps, detergents, or substances in the locker room. Although rare, it's worth considering, especially if there's no apparent external cause.\n4. Other skin conditions: Other skin conditions like psoriasis, eczema, or dermatitis may also cause skin peeling, depending on their specific symptoms and triggers.\n\nIn this case, since your son's symptoms do not include itching, redness, or irritation, and athlete's foot seems a likely possibility given his football participation, you may consider the following steps:\n\n1. Encourage good hygiene: Make sure your son practices good hygiene, such as washing hands regularly with soap and water and drying them thoroughly.\n2. Foot hygiene: Have him wash his feet daily with soap and water, dry thoroughly, and apply a foot powder or antifungal cream.\n3. Clean his equipment: Make sure he cleans his equipment, like cleats, uniforms, and towels, before use.\n4. Over-the-counter (OTC) creams: OTC creams, like moisturizing lotions, emollients, or antifungal creams (for athlete's foot), can help alleviate symptoms and prevent further peeling. Read the instructions on the label carefully and consult a pediatrician or pharmacist if you have any doubts.\n5. Regular monitoring: Keep an eye on his condition and report any changes, such as itching, redness, or increased peeling, to a healthcare professional.\n\nIf his condition worsens, does not improve after a few weeks, or develops additional symptoms like pain, redness, or swelling, consult a healthcare professional for further evaluation. In the meantime, reassure him to maintain good hygiene and cleanliness, especially in the locker room, to avoid spreading any potential infections."}

Gallbladder issues: Pain in the right shoulder blade area can sometimes be a sign of gallbladder problems, such as gallstones or gallbladder inflammation (cholecystitis).\n3. Heart conditions: Although your symptoms may seem unrelated to the heart, some heart conditions like angina or a heart attack can cause referred pain in the shoulder blade area.

Muscle strains or spasms:Infant's muscles can get strained or go into spasms sometimes, especially after an illness or infection, which might explain your baby's behavior. You can try gentle massages and warm compresses to alleviate the discomfort.\n\n2. Discomfort from teething: Although your baby seems to be weaning off solids, he may still be teething. Teething can lead to tense muscles, ear pulling, and facial grimacing. Try soothing teething symptoms with teething rings or a cool, wet cloth.\n\n3. Constipation: Based on the information you've provided, it appears that your baby is experiencing hard bowel movements or is constipated. This can sometimes lead to abdominal discomfort and tension in the neck and shoulder area due to the baby's attempts to relieve the pain or discomfort by pulling themselves up.\n\n4. Underdeveloped neck and shoulder muscles: At this age, babies are still developing their neck and shoulder muscles. If your baby frequently practices pushing or pressing, as described, it could be a sign that he's working on gaining more control over these muscles.\n\n5. Infection: Although your baby has finished his antibiotics, it's essential to keep an eye on any persisting symptoms. If the stiffness and discomfort continue, it might be worth revisiting your pediatrician for further assessment.\n\nIn conclusion, the stiffness in your 9-month-old's neck and shoulders could be due to any of the above reasons.

Over-the-counter antihistamines: Diphenhydramine (Benadryl) or loratadine (Claritin) can help reduce symptoms caused by an allergic reaction.\n2. Cold compression: Applying a cold compress on the affected areas, such as the eyes and nose, may help reduce swelling and alleviate discomfort.\n3. Hydration: Drinking plenty of water or other clear fluids can help prevent dehydration caused by increased nasal drainage and sweating.\n\nAlways read the label and consult a healthcare professional or pharmacist before administering any medication to ensure it's safe for your husband's current condition.

The pain is constant. I noticed today that after swelling my food when it gets to that area it hurts going down. Also hurts more when I bend. The pain is constant and radiates across my back.", "human": "Thanks for your question on HCM. In my opinion you are having GERD (Gastro Esophageal Reflux Disease). But as a rule in chest pain, we have to rule out cardiac and pulmonary causes.So get done ECG and 2D Echo to rule out cardiac causes.Get done chest x ray to rule out infection in the lungs.If all the above are normal than it is mostly GERD.It is due to laxity of gastroesophageal sphincter. Due to this acid of the stomach tends to come up in the esophagus and cause the central chest pain.Try to follow these for better control of GERD.1. Avoid hot and spicy food.2. Avoid stress and anxiety. 3. Avoid large meals. Take small meals.4. Start proton pump inhibitors. 5. Go for walk after meals.6. Keep 2-3 pillows under your head in bad.", "ai": " A constant throbbing chest pain between the breasts, especially when swallowing or bending, which radiates to the back, may indicate a condition called angina or gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD). Angina is a type of chest pain caused by reduced blood flow to the heart muscle, whereas GERD is a digestive disorder where stomach acid flows back into the esophagus. However, it's essential to consult a healthcare professional for an accurate diagnosis and proper treatment plan. Symptoms like shortness of breath without chest pain may indicate other underlying conditions, such as asthma or chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD)."}

You can control the attack of asthma by Inhaler like Asthalin or any inhalers containing corticosteroids.", "ai": " Based on the information provided, I suggest the following treatments for your asthma and chest pain:\n\n1. Medications: Asthma is a chronic respiratory condition that requires regular treatment. Your healthcare provider may prescribe inhaled corticosteroids, long-acting beta-agonists, or combination inhalers to help manage your asthma symptoms. Quick-relief inhalers can also be used as needed for coughing episodes or chest pain.\n2. Allergy testing and immunotherapy: Consider scheduling allergy testing to identify any allergens that may be contributing to your asthma symptoms or chest pain. Immunotherapy, also known as allergy shots, can be an effective long-term treatment for allergic asthma.\n3. Avoid triggers: Eliminating asthma triggers, such as mold, cleaning products, air sprays, smoke, and other airborne irritants, is crucial for managing asthma symptoms. Make sure your workspace is well-ventilated, and consider using a HEPA air filter to reduce your exposure to mold spores.\n4. Air filtration system: Installing a high-efficiency air filtration system at home can help reduce the amount of allergens and irritants in the air, which may help alleviate your symptoms.\n5. Chest physical therapy: For persistent chest pain or coughing, chest physical therapy can be helpful. This technique involves using various devices to loosen mucus in the chest and improve airflow. Your healthcare provider can recommend a registered respiratory therapist for this treatment.\n6. Moisture therapy: Using a humidifier or taking warm showers can help soothe your airways and reduce the symptoms of dry coughing.\n7. Maintain a healthy weight: Losing weight can improve asthma symptoms, as obesity can contribute to inflammation and make it harder to breathe. Regular exercise, such as walking, can be helpful, but be sure to consult with your healthcare provider about what level of activity is appropriate for you.\n8. Consider seeing a pulmonologist: If your symptoms are severe or persist despite treatment, consider visiting a pulmonologist for further evaluation and treatment options. They may recommend additional tests, such as a bronchial challenge or lung function tests, to better understand your condition and determine the most effective treatment approach."}

One dose not affect much.you should take ig regularly once started.and you should continue life time.consult phsician to set the dose according to your bp.", "ai": " One dose of Stamlo (nifedipine) does not affect your blood pressure permanently. It works by relaxing blood vessels, which helps lower blood pressure. However, its effects are temporary, lasting around 6-8 hours. Therefore, continued use of the medication is necessary if you have persistent high blood pressure to maintain adequate control. Adhering to a healthy diet is also essential, as dietary choices can influence blood pressure. There is no definitive evidence that a single dose of Stamlo will increase your blood pressure for the rest of your life."}

It is available as a topical solution, and you can buy it over the counter without a prescription. Minoxidil works by promoting hair growth and slowing down hair loss. There are different brands of minoxidil, such as Rogaine, and generic versions are also available, which may be less expensive.\n\nAnother medication that has been proven effective for hair loss is finasteride, which is a prescription drug. It works by reducing the production of dihydrotestosterone (DHT), which contributes to hair loss. If your doctor has not suggested this option, you can ask them about it. However, it may have more side effects compared to minoxidil.\n\nRegarding the medications you have mentioned (anutamul, bitozed forte, zinfate, dazit, zinetac), I couldn't find any evidence to suggest that they are effective treatments for hair loss. It's important to stick to treatments that are proven to be effective to avoid wasting time and money.\n\nSome natural remedies for hair loss, such as massaging the scalp, using essential oils like rosemary oil and peppermint oil, and taking vitamin supplements, may help to some extent. However, it's essential to consult your healthcare provider before trying any new treatments for hair loss, especially if you have underlying health conditions.

Does not smoke or drink. Ex Athlete/swimmer.", "human": "Dear- thanks for using our service , I understand your concern and will try to help you with my advise. She is having orthostatic hypotension, with a baseline of low blood pressure. She should not worry about this blood pressure during the night but will need to be careful when stands up and moves her head to avoid a drop in the blood pressure with dizziness and risk of fall. She needs to have an evaluation to find out the reason of her low blood pressure. Athletes can have low blood pressure and low heart rate due to the exercise and physical fit. I hope this advise will be helpfulDr.Sara", "ai": " Low blood pressure, also known as hypotension, in a young adult with no apparent symptoms other than fainting and a non-threatening blood pressure reading of around 80/40 to 100/60 mmHg, is not necessarily dangerous. However, it's essential to consider potential underlying causes that could contribute to her low blood pressure. Some common factors include:\n\n1. Dehydration: This can occur due to excessive sweating, vomiting, or diarrhea.\n2. Medications: Certain medications, such as diuretics, beta-blockers, or ACE inhibitors, can lead to low blood pressure.\n3. Nutrient deficiencies: Deficiencies in essential minerals like sodium, potassium, calcium, or iron can result in low blood pressure.\n4. Hormonal issues: Conditions like Addison's disease or hypothyroidism can cause low blood pressure.\n5. Physically active lifestyle: A history of being an athlete or a swimmer can sometimes lead to low blood pressure due to increased heart muscle efficiency and decreased blood volume.\n\nIt's crucial to note that these potential causes do not apply to every individual, and the specific cause for your daughter's low blood pressure can only be determined by a healthcare professional. Encourage her to drink plenty of fluids and consider seeking medical attention earlier if she experiences symptoms such as dizziness, fainting, or severe weakness. Additionally, keeping track of her blood pressure readings over the next few days can help in evaluating her overall health and addressing any potential concerns."}

Medications: Certain medications used in infants, including antibiotics, can cause temporary changes in stool color, consistency, and odor.\n\nIt is essential to consult your child's pediatrician for an accurate diagnosis. Since your baby is still recovering from a cold and hasn't shown a fever, it is possible that the symptoms are related to the illness, but it is important to rule out other potential causes. Your child's doctor may recommend additional tests or treatments based on their assessment and diagnosis."}

It can affects multiple family members.  This is worse during the dry and cold winter months and improves hot, humid climate. As with the progression of age it tends to improve. For the treatment part you apply petroleum gelly just after bath when the body is still wet or can use urea-containing creams which are useful by binding water to superficial layers of skin. There are certain skin peeling creams known as Keratolytic creams and certain oral treatments which can be discussed with your doctor to get the best of the relief.Hope to provide you with best information.Dr Sanjay K Kanodia (MD - Skin)", "ai": " Dry skin can be caused by various factors including genetics, environment, and aging. In your case, it appears to be a long-term issue that has been present since you were young and seems to have been passed down in your family. While olive oil can be a good natural moisturizer for some people, it may not be sufficient for severely dry skin.\n\nHere are some suggestions that might help:\n\n1. Use a rich and heavy moisturizer: Look for moisturizers that contain ingredients like petroleum jelly, ceramides, or hyaluronic acid. These ingredients can help seal in moisture and repair damaged skin.\n2. Use a humidifier: Dry air can worsen dry skin. Using a humidifier in your home or workplace can help keep the air moist, making it easier for your skin to retain moisture.\n3. Avoid hot water: Hot water can strip your skin of its natural oils, making it even drier. Try taking shorter, lukewarm showers or baths instead.\n4. Moisturize frequently: Apply moisturizer after every shower or bath while your skin is still damp. This can help lock in moisture and prevent further dryness.\n5. Avoid harsh soaps and chemicals: Harsh soaps and cleansers can strip your skin of its natural oils, making it more prone to dryness. Look for gentle, fragrance-free cleansers and avoid using harsh scrubs or exfoliants.\n6. Protect your skin from the sun: Sun damage can also contribute to dry skin. Use a broad-spectrum sunscreen with an SPF of at least 30 every day, even in the winter.\n7. Stay hydrated: Drinking plenty of water and other fluids can help keep your skin hydrated from the inside out.\n8. Consider seeing a dermatologist: If your dry skin is severe and not responding to over-the-counter treatments, it might be a good idea to see a dermatologist for a proper evaluation and recommendation of potential treatments, such as prescription topicals or oral medications."}
{"question": "What does severe pain in the mouth indicate?I have what I have had several time in the past. It need relief although the dentist said there was little to do about it. I get terrible pain in my mouth that roams from one part to the other. Nothing wrong can be seen by dentists after exams. Cannot take Advil.", "human": "Hello,As per your query, you have symptoms of severe pain in the mouth which seems to be due to TMJ dysfunction and locking of the jaw in a particular position. It could be an infection in multiple teeth in different quadrants.Need not to worry. I would suggest you rest properly and don't bend frequently forward. You should take light food and avoid hard food from that side. Take Tramadol for pain removal. Take ice creams and suck on ice pops.Visit the dentist once and take the combination of Ibuprofen and Diclofenac medicines. Maintain oral hygiene by brushing and flossing. Do warm saline and betadine gargles. Try to relax jaws and consult ENT specialist as well once.Hope I have answered your query. Let me know if I can assist you further.Regards,Dr. Harry Maheshwari", "ai": " Severe pain in the mouth without an identifiable cause or visible signs of dental issues, despite multiple dental examinations, could be indicative of various conditions such as trigeminal neuralgia, glossitis, or neuralgia affecting the cranial nerves.

{"question": "What is the cause of dark circles around the eyes and red pimples on the face?My 1 yr old girl has very dark circles around her eyes and red pimples around her eyes,mouth and on her cheeks. The pimples don t have a head and seem to disappear after a day and reappear somewhere else. She sleeps for approx 12/13 hrs a night and has 2 x2hr naps in the day. Should I take her to see a doctor?", "human": "Hi...Skin conditions are best diagnosed only after seeing directly. I suggest you to upload photographs of the same on this website, so that I can guide you scientifically.  Hope my answer was helpful for you.  I am happy to help any time. Further clarifications and consultations on Health care magic are welcome. If you do not have any clarifications, you can close the discussion and rate the answer. Wish your kid good health.Dr. Sumanth MBBS., DCH., DNB (Paed).,", "ai": " Dark circles under the eyes in infants and young children are usually caused by genetics and immaturity of the skin around the eyes. The thin skin and delicate tissue cause the blood vessels to show more prominently, giving the appearance of dark circles.\n\nRed pimples or rashes on the face could be caused by several things. Infants can get diaper rash that can spread to the face due to drooling or hand-to-face contact. Allergic reactions to food or environmental factors, eczema, and contact dermatitis are also possible causes. Infections, such as strep throat or impetigo, can also cause facial rashes.\n\nHowever, in your daughter's case, the lack of a head on the pimples and their tendency to disappear and reappear elsewhere suggest that they may be milia - small white bumps caused by trapped keratin under the skin. Milia commonly occur in infants and young children, especially around the eyes and cheeks, and are harmless.\n\nThat being said, it's always a good idea to consult a doctor if you have concerns about your child's health. The doctor can examine your daughter, rule out any serious conditions, and offer advice on how to manage her symptoms at home. If the red pimples are accompanied by other symptoms such as fever, irritability, or difficulty swallowing, seek medical attention right away."}

It often occurs during an episode of cough and cold. It is generally caused due to certain viral infections and is self limiting, resolving in 5-7 days. It is unlikely to be serious but nevertheless needs medical supervision. Asthalin is a bronchodilator and must have been given to relieve wheezing. It is safe to be given to a child of 2 months and is recommended for relief of bronchospasm which causes wheezing.", "ai": " I cannot definitively answer your question as I am an AI language model and not a medical professional. However, I can share some general information that may help shed some light on the situation. Asthalin inhaler is a prescription medication typically used to treat asthma and other respiratory conditions in people of all ages, including older children and adults. It contains albuterol, a short-acting bronchodilator that helps relax and open the airways, making it easier to breathe.\n\nHowever, the use of asthma inhalers in infants under the age of 2 years is generally not recommended due to the potential risks involved. According to the American Academy of Pediatrics, the risks of using asthma inhalers in young children include:\n\n* Increased heart rate\n* Agitation\n* Tremors\n* Muscle cramps\n* Vocal cord dysfunction\n* Tooth decay (from the use of spacers or nebulizers, which involve breathing through a mouthpiece)\n* Delayed growth\n\nMoreover, the symptoms your child is experiencing, such as cough and cold, are common in infants and do not necessarily indicate a serious underlying respiratory condition that would justify the use of an asthma inhaler at such an early age.\n\nI would recommend talking to your doctor again to express your concerns and asking for a clear explanation of why they prescribed the Asthalin inhaler and what the diagnosis is. You may also consider seeking a second opinion from another pediatrician if you are not satisfied with the answer. In the meantime, you can try soothing your child's cough with natural remedies such as steam inhalation, warm drinks, and nose drops if recommended by your doctor."}

In your case, they might be related to the grief following the loss of your husband and the side effects of the antidepressant Elavil (amitriptyline). Grief is a natural response to a significant loss and can lead to feelings of sadness, anxiety, and difficulty sleeping. Antidepressants like Elavil can cause side effects such as insomnia, anxiety, and increased emotional reactivity, especially during the initial adjustment period or when the dosage is changed. It's essential to consult your healthcare provider if you experience these symptoms persistently, as they might consider adjusting your medication or adding an adjunctive treatment. They might also explore other underlying causes, including psychological and lifestyle factors, and provide appropriate interventions to help manage your symptoms effectively."}

I have reviewed your query and here is my advice. Some babies may have these effects. Pus cells may be normal or due to gut infection. Give the baby some gut flora like Enterogermina. Hope I have answered your query. Let me know if I can assist you further.", "ai": " Based on the information provided, it's important to consult a healthcare professional for proper diagnosis and treatment. However, I can suggest some possible causes for your son's watery, green, and mucus-filled stools.\n\nThe green color of the stool could be due to an excessive amount of bile, which may indicate bile malabsorption. Omeprazole is a proton pump inhibitor (PPI) commonly used to treat acid reflux. But it can also interfere with the normal production of bile salts in the intestines, leading to diarrhea and fat malabsorption.\n\nThe presence of pus cells (leukocytes) and mucous in the stool might suggest an infection, such as enteritis or irritable bowel syndrome. Infections could be due to several causes, including contaminated food or water, bacteria or viruses.\n\nTo address these symptoms, consider the following steps:\n\n1. Consult your pediatrician: Discuss your concerns with your son's doctor. Your doctor might recommend alternative treatment options for his silent reflux or suggest running additional tests to rule out any underlying infections or conditions.\n\n2. Probiotics: Probiotics can help improve the balance of bacteria in the gut and may prevent or reduce diarrhea in infants. Provide probiotics such as lactobacillus or bifidobacterium as recommended by your doctor.\n\n3. Rehydration: Ensure that your son remains well-hydrated. Offer breast milk or formula frequently and provide water or clear electrolyte solutions as needed.\n\n4. Dietary considerations: Avoid foods or formulas that trigger allergic reactions in your son. In some cases, lactose intolerance or sensitivity to specific food components, like soy or corn, can lead to diarrhea and mucus in the stool. If you suspect these issues, consider consultating a dietitian for guidance on appropriate dietary modifications.\n\nRemember that it is essential to follow the guidance of your healthcare professional for the best course of action to ensure your son's overall well-being."}

Hope I have answered your query. Let me know if I can assist you further. Regards,Dr. S. R. Raveendran, Sexologist", "ai": " I'm an AI language model and don't have the ability to physically examine you or provide medical treatment. However, I can try to help you understand the potential causes and suggested treatments based on the information you've provided. It sounds like you may be experiencing a condition called retrograde ejaculation. This condition can occur when the muscles at the end of the urethra (the tube that carries urine and semen out of the body) do not close properly during ejaculation, causing semen to flow back into the bladder and be released during urination.\n\nThere are several possible causes for retrograde ejaculation. These may include:\n\n1. Certain medical conditions, such as diabetes, multiple sclerosis, spinal cord injury, or prostate surgery.\n2. Certain medications, such as antidepressants or alpha-blockers.\n3. Aging.\n4. Nerve damage due to surgery or injury.\n\nTreatment options for retrograde ejaculation may include:\n\n1. Medications: Certain medications, such as phosphodiesterase-5 inhibitors (e.g., sildenafil, tadalafil, or vardenafil), can help improve the tone of the muscles in the urethra and improve erectile function, which may help prevent retrograde ejaculation.\n2. Techniques to promote ejaculation in forward direction: During sexual activity, certain techniques can be used to help promote ejaculation in the forward direction, such as contracting the muscles at the base of the penis during orgasm.\n3. Surgical procedures: In some cases, surgical procedures may be recommended to help improve the tone of the muscles in the urethra and prevent retrograde ejaculation.\n\nIt's important to talk with your healthcare provider about your symptoms and any potential underlying causes to determine the most appropriate treatment approach for your individual case. I hope this information is helpful to you. Please note that it's not meant to replace the advice of a qualified healthcare professional."}

Therefore, you must see a your consultant doctor today for a close detailed examination and a simple needle biopsy to relieve your concerns!Hope this helps you..Regards,", "ai": " The cause of a lump inside the ankle after undergoing chemotherapy for breast cancer is unrelated to your previous treatment. Most ankle lumps are not related to breast cancer and are usually due to common conditions such as ankle sprains, cysts, bursitis, or tendonitis. I strongly recommend consulting your healthcare provider to have the lump evaluated. They may order imaging tests or a biopsy to determine the cause. In the meantime, avoid any activities that aggravate the lump, and apply ice to reduce swelling and discomfort."}

I went to a dental doctor. the doctor suggested that these stains will not go by simple brushing. I need to undergo scling. He has given appointment for scaling.", "human": "Hi Raksha, Scaling is a procedure for cleaning teeth which is followed by polishing to remove stains and any other deposits accumulated in time. Scaling as i am sure as your dentist would have mentioned needs to be done every 6 months. The external stains may go with scaling and polishing but this does not result in whitening.Whitening of teeth is an entirely different procedure in which teeth lighten by 3-4 shades from the normal colour or sometimes even more. this procedure is commonly referred to as bleaching. There are 2 types of whitening procedure. one is done in clinic called inoffice procedure and the other is done by the patient in the house called home whitening. If you desire whitening, please consult your dentist for the same.Regards", "ai": " Yes, based on your description, it seems that scaling is recommended by your dental doctor to remove the yellow stains on your teeth that cannot be removed by brushing alone. Scaling is a professional cleaning procedure that involves removing tartar and bacteria from the teeth, including stains under the gum line. This can help to improve the appearance of your teeth and promote oral health. Follow the appointment schedule given by your doctor."}

Other causes like brain tumor, infection and demyelination can also cause similar problem. I feel MRI of the brain would be a better option than CT scan for better details. Sincerely, Dr Shiva Kumar RConsultant Neurologist & EpileptologistBangalore", "ai": " Based on the symptoms you've described, it is likely that your niece has experienced a stroke, possibly on the right side of her brain. Strokes can cause various symptoms including paralysis on one side of the body, difficulty walking, and speaking problems. A stroke occurs when there is a disruption of blood flow to the brain, which can lead to damage or death of brain cells.\n\nThe sudden onset of these symptoms within a week implies that there may have been an underlying cause, such as a blood clot or bleeding in the brain. It's important that your niece receives further evaluation and treatment from a medical professional. Depending on the severity and location of the stroke, treatment options may include medications to dissolve clots, surgery to remove clots or repair any damage, or rehabilitation therapy to help regain function.\n\nA cure for stroke depends on the extent of damage caused by the stroke and the response to treatment. Early intervention and intensive rehabilitation therapy can help improve the chances of recovery and minimize long-term disability.

There is no previous history of such event. I am currently on Aspirin. I had an EKG, lung x-ray and D-dimer blood test. Is it possible to have a pulmonary embolism with negative D-dimer test? If the clot breaks or moving, then will D-dimer work? What else could cause pulmonary embolism like symptoms?", "human": "Hello. I have a few questions here, if you would not mind answering them: Revert back with the answers to the above questions to an internal medicine physician online --> https://www.icliniq.com/ask-a-doctor-online/internal-medicine-physician", "ai": " A: Aspirin, as an antiplatelet medication, does not directly affect D-dimer levels in the blood. However, it may affect the interpretation of D-dimer test results. A positive D-dimer result is commonly used to support the diagnosis of deep vein thrombosis (DVT) or pulmonary embolism (PE), but a negative result does not rule out these conditions, particularly in patients with a high clinical suspicion based on symptoms and other diagnostic findings. In your case, the negative D-dimer test result alone should not exclude the possibility of PE, especially considering your recurrent chest pains and shortness of breath. Other causes of these symptoms include pneumonia, heart disease, anxiety, or pulmonary hypertension. It is important to continue follow-up with your healthcare provider to discuss further diagnostic options, such as repeat testing, imaging studies, or an echocardiogram, to help determine the underlying cause of your symptoms. Additionally, the symptoms you are experiencing could be related to your current condition that caused the pain behind your knee. It is crucial to keep taking your Aspirin as prescribed by your doctor and communicate any other changes in symptoms to your healthcare provider."}

Use a broad-spectrum sunscreen with an SPF of at least 30 every day, even when indoors.\n2. Topical treatments: Certain creams, such as hydroquinone, niacinamide, retinoids, and kojic acid, can help fade pigmentation. Consult a dermatologist for the most effective and safe options.\n3. Chemical peels: A gentle chemical peel, like alpha hydroxy acid (AHA) or beta hydroxy acid (BHA), can help remove dead skin cells and stimulate new cell growth, reducing the appearance of pigmentation.\n4. Microdermabrasion: A gentle exfoliating technique using fine particles to remove dead skin cells and improve skin texture, which can help in reducing pigmentation.\n5. Laser therapy: Pigmentation laser treatments, like Q-switch or intense pulsed light (IPL) therapy, can target melanin and help fade pigmented areas.

It's important to consult a healthcare professional for an accurate diagnosis and personalized treatment plan. However, I can share some potential strategies to help reduce the curvature and alleviate pain caused by excessive masturbation.\n\n1. Reduce masturbation frequency: Cut down on the frequency of masturbation to give your body time to heal and recover. Try to limit yourself to once a day or every other day, and avoid using forceful or rough techniques.\n2. Use proper hand positioning: Try to avoid gripping the penis too tightly or using a twisting or Milking motion during masturbation. Instead, use a more gentle, circular motion with a relaxed grip. This can help prevent further damage to the penis tissue.\n3. Use lubricant: Using lubricant can help reduce friction during masturbation, which can help prevent damage to the sensitive tissue.\n4. Exercise and stretching: Certain penis exercises and stretching routines, such as Jelqing or the VaParagraph method, can help correct curvature and improve penis health overall. However, it's important to use these techniques correctly and not overdo it, as excessive force can worsen the problem.\n5. Seek professional help: If your penis curvature and pain persist despite making lifestyle changes, consider seeking help from a healthcare professional. They may recommend physical therapy, medications, or other treatments to help correct the curvature and alleviate pain.\n6. Quit smoking and limit alcohol consumption: These habits can negatively impact penis health and may contribute to curvature and pain during intercourse.\n7. Maintain a healthy lifestyle: Regular exercise, a balanced diet, and adequate hydration are essential for optimal penis health and can help improve overall sexual function.\n8. Manage stress and anxiety: Stress and anxiety can impact sexual performance and create psychological causes for curvature and pain during intercourse. Consider practicing relaxation techniques, such as meditation or deep breathing exercises, to help reduce stress and anxiety levels.\n9. Consider emotional causes: Emotional factors, such as relationship issues or psychological stress, can contribute to problems with erectile function or cause sexual pain. Consider seeking counseling or therapy to address these underlying emotional issues."}

Make sure to rinse it thoroughly and pat her skin dry. Avoid using harsh scrubs or abrasive cloths. If the pimples persist, you may want to consult a pediatrician or a dermatologist for further evaluation.\n\nAs for the excessive hair growth, it is normal for newborns to have fine, downy hair all over their body, known as lanugo. This usually disappears within a few weeks. If the hair is darker and coarser, especially on the face, it may be a sign of a condition called hirsutism. However, it is unlikely for a 40-day-old baby to have hirsutism, and it is not usually a cause for concern. If you are concerned about the hair growth or if it is interfering with your baby's comfort, you can gently pluck it out with clean tweezers or ask your pediatrician for advice."}

Rib contusion: Vigorous workouts or accidental injury can cause a bruise or contusion on the rib cage, which may be tender to touch and develop a rash due to friction or irritation.\n2. Inflammation or infection: The lump and rash could be a sign of inflammation or infection, such as costochondritis (inflammation of the cartilage connecting the ribs to the breastbone) or an infection in the area, such as cellulitis.\n3. Allergic reaction: The rash could be an allergic reaction to a new food or medication, such as a workout supplement or a food you've recently introduced into your diet.\n4. Cancer: While the biopsy results showed no cancer in your throat, it's important to rule out other potential malignancies. However, the symptoms you've described are more consistent with benign conditions.\n\nGiven your recent weight loss, it's worth considering the possibility of a rib contusion from working out too aggressively or accidental injury. You may want to take it easy on your workouts for a while and give the area time to heal. If the symptoms persist or worsen, it would be a good idea to follow up with your healthcare provider for further evaluation."}

Warm compress: Apply a warm compress to your face, especially over the sinus areas and around your eyes, to help alleviate pressure and ease pain.\n3. Over-the-counter (OTC) medications: Consider using decongestants, pain relievers, or antihistamines (as advised by your doctor) to help treat symptoms such as sinus pressure, headaches, and congestion.\n4. Nasal saline spray: Use a nasal saline spray regularly to help rinse out your nasal passages and soothe any inflammation or irritation.\n5. Steam inhalation: Inhale steam from a hot shower or a bowl of water to help relieve sinus pressure and congestion.\n6. Rest: Get sufficient rest and avoid physically demanding activities that could exhaust you and worsen your symptoms.\n7. Allergy testing: If your symptoms persist, consider getting an allergy test to determine if environmental allergens are contributing to your sinus infection and sinusitis.\n8. Consult a healthcare professional: If your symptoms worsen or don't improve after trying these treatments, consult a healthcare provider who can evaluate your condition and provide you with further guidance, which may include advanced treatments or sinus surgery (depending on the severity of your condition).\n\nRemember not to self-diagnose a deviated septum without proper evaluation by a healthcare professional.

{"question": "Suggest treatment for Lyme s diseasei am trying to find ut the range for ebv tests? i have blood work showing positive ana, positive ebv and 4 lyme disease band indicators...i have a spinal tap tomorrow and have not heard back from my doctor...is this lymes disease...what is the treatment?", "human": "HiLyme's disease is a bacterial infection , hence antibiotics are given for the treatment.Lyme disease is best treated in the early stages. Early treatment is a simple 14 to 21 day course of oral antibiotics. This can eliminate all traces of infection. Medications used to treat Lyme disease are:  1.  doxycycline for adults and children older than 8 years old   2.  cefuroxime and amoxicillin for adults, younger children, and women who are nursing or breast-feedingHope this information was of help.Thank you.", "ai": " Based on your positive ANA, EBV antibodies, and Lyme disease band indicators in your blood work, it is possible that you have both Lyme disease and EBV infection. However, a definitive diagnosis requires further confirmation through additional tests, such as a positive Lyme disease Western blot or PCR test, and a diagnosis from a healthcare professional.\n\nAs for the range for EBV tests, it can vary depending on the specific test being used. Generally, EBV tests may include measures of IgG, IgM, and/or VCA antibodies. Normal values for these tests can depend on the laboratory and the specific assay used. Your healthcare provider can provide more information on the specific tests being ordered and the reference ranges.\n\nRegarding treatment, Lyme disease is typically treated with antibiotics, such as doxycycline, amoxicillin, or ceftriaxone. The length of treatment can depend on the severity of the infection and other factors. EBV infection, on the other hand, does not typically require antiviral treatment as the immune system usually clears the virus on its own. However, symptomatic relief may be provided through pain management and other supportive measures. Be sure to discuss your treatment options with your healthcare provider.\n\nIt is important to note that a spinal tap (lumbar puncture) may be ordered to help diagnose neurological Lyme disease, but the results may not be available immediately. Your healthcare provider should be able to provide you with more information about your specific diagnosis and treatment plan based on the results of your tests and other clinical assessments."}
{"question": "Diagnosed with celiac disease and have gluten allergyHi doctor, my father is diagnosed with celiac disease and was told he was allergic to gluten. It would be nice if u could give me an insight regarding the above said condition and gluten allergy.", "human": "Coming to the first part of your question, Gluten Intolerance or Celiac Disease is a hereditary problem affecting the immune system. The consumption of gluten destroys the lining of the small intestine called mucosa. Consequently, essential vitamins and nutrients are not properly absorbed.", "ai": " Celiac disease is an autoimmune disorder where the consumption of gluten leads to damage in the small intestine. Gluten is a protein found in wheat, barley, and rye. When a person with celiac disease eats gluten, their body mounts an immune response that damages the villi in the small intestine, inhibiting the absorption of nutrients. This can lead to malnutrition and a wide range of symptoms, including abdominal pain, bloating, diarrhea, weight loss, anemia, fatigue, and joint pain.\n\nA gluten allergy, on the other hand, is a different condition where the immune system reacts to gluten with an allergic response. Symptoms can include hives, itching, and eczema, as well as gastrointestinal symptoms similar to those of celiac disease.\n\nBoth celiac disease and gluten allergy require strict adherence to a gluten-free diet to manage symptoms and prevent health complications. The diet involves avoiding all foods that contain gluten, including wheat, barley, and rye, as well as processed foods that may contain hidden sources of gluten.\n\nIt's important for your father to communicate with his healthcare team about his diagnosis and to work with them to develop a comprehensive plan for managing his condition, which may include regular testing to monitor the health of his small intestine and ensure proper nutrient absorption. Your father should also be aware that gluten may be found in unexpected places, such as medications and supplements, and should read labels carefully to avoid accidental exposure. Additionally, your father may find it helpful to seek out support groups or online resources to connect with others who are also living with celiac disease or gluten allergy."}

Bladder cancer usually causes symptoms in the lower urinary tract such as pain during urination, frequent urges to urinate, and blood in the urine. Upper back pain is not a typical symptom of bladder cancer. However, some people with advanced bladder cancer may experience back pain due to the spread of the cancer to other areas, including the bones or nerves.\n\nIf you're experiencing persistent upper back pain and have concerns about its possible connection to your bladder cancer, it's essential to discuss this issue with your healthcare provider. You can try the following approaches to communicate your concerns effectively:\n\n1. Share your symptoms: Describe the severity, location, and duration of your upper back pain in detail.

{"question": "Suggest treatment for rashes on neckI had a questionable encounter with an individual about a year ago. I took a rapid test at a local clinic about 1 month ago, I have since developed a rash on my neck. As such, my question is 2 fold. How accurate are the rapid antibody tests, and can they be read incorrectly?", "human": "Hello,I read carefully your query and understand your concern. The Rapid test detects HIV antibodies in the blood. Most people will develop enough HIV antibodies to be detected three to four weeks after infection. The Rapid test is just as accurate as a Standard HIV test.If you test negative, then you do not require any further tests.Hope my answer was helpful.If you have further queries feel free to contact me again.Kind regards! Dr.Dorina Gurabardhi General &Family Physician", "ai": " Regarding your first question, the accuracy of rapid antibody tests for detecting COVID-19 infection depends on various factors, including the timing of the test, the specific antigen or antigens being tested for, and the individual's immune response. According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), while these tests can provide results within minutes, they may not always be as accurate as laboratory-based molecular tests, such as PCR tests. False positives and false negatives are possible, especially in the window period before and after infection. However, these tests can be useful for identifying individuals who may have been exposed to COVID-19 and may be infectious.\n\nAs for your second question, developing a rash on your neck is not specifically linked to a false-positive result on a rapid antibody test for COVID-19. Skin rashes can have many causes, including allergic reactions to medications, foods, or environmental factors, infections, autoimmune conditions, and others. Therefore, if you have concerns about a rash on your neck, it is recommended that you consult a healthcare professional to determine the underlying cause and appropriate treatment. Your healthcare provider may recommend various tests or exams, such as a skin biopsy or blood tests, to help diagnose the cause of the rash. Additionally, even if your rapid antibody test was accurate, it does not rule out other possible causes for your rash. Therefore, it is important to address any skin concerns with a healthcare professional for proper evaluation and treatment."}

You should consult a dentist to check for any problem in your oral cavity.If the problem is due to calculus and plaque it can be removed by scaling and polishing of your teeth. Flossing of teeth and tongue cleaning using tongue scraper should be done daily.", "ai": " There are several reasons why your mouth may still have an unpleasant smell despite brushing three times a day. Here are some suggestions:\n\n1. Proper brushing technique: Make sure you are brushing correctly. Hold the toothbrush at a 45-degree angle to the gums, use gentle circular motions, and brush all surfaces of the teeth, including the tongue.\n2. Flossing: Flossing is important as it helps remove food particles and plaque between the teeth that a toothbrush can't reach.\n3. Poor dental hygiene: Brushing alone may not be enough to keep your mouth clean. Make sure you are rinsing your mouth with water after each meal and snack.\n4. Dry mouth: A lack of saliva can make it harder to keep your mouth clean and fresh. Try using a saliva substitute, drinking plenty of water, or chewing sugarless gum to increase saliva production.\n5.

The continuous bleeding in the form of heavy bleeding and clots indicate that abortion has been incomplete and still products of conception remain in the uterus. It is suggested that you should get an ultrasound pelvis done soon to rule out any products of conception. If they are seen, then you would have to undergo dilatation and curettage (D and C) for complete removal of products. Meet your physician soon now.", "ai": " Based on the information provided, your symptoms of persistent spotting and leg pain after an abortion could be due to several reasons. Here are a few possibilities, but please note that this advice should not replace a consultation with a healthcare professional:\n\n1. Hormonal changes: Following an abortion, your body undergoes hormonal shifts. These changes can lead to irregular bleeding and spotting. It's essential to monitor the amount, consistency, and duration of the spotting.\n\n2. Infection: An incomplete abortion or a post-abortion infection could cause persistent spotting and leg pain. If you have a fever, foul-smelling vaginal discharge, or severe pain, you might have an infection.\n\n3. Cervical injury: If you experienced cervical injury during the abortion procedure, you might experience persistent spotting, pain, or other symptoms.\n\n4. Thrombosis or embolism: Although rare, blood clots can form following an abortion in some cases. Signs of a blood clot include sudden sharp pain, swelling, redness, or warmth in the affected leg.\n\n5. Uterine polyp or fibroid: Sometimes, these growths can cause intermittent or persistent spotting following an abortion.\n\nGiven your symptoms, it would be best to consult your healthcare provider for a proper evaluation. They may recommend further tests like an ultrasound or blood tests to determine the cause. It's important to note that your symptoms might not be related to your abortion, so it's always best to err on the side of caution and seek medical advice.\n\nIn the meantime, you can take over-the-counter pain medication to help with the leg pain.

Bruising is typically a result of soft tissue injury and does not usually involve damage to the bone itself. However, it is important to follow your doctor's recommendations for treatment and follow-up care. If your symptoms do not improve or worsen, your doctor may order further imaging tests to rule out any potential fractures or other injuries.

Let me know if I can assist you further.Regards,Dr. Ilir Sharka, Cardiologist", "ai": " The symptoms you describe -- pain in the shoulder and arm, numbness in the hand, and weakness with pins and needles sensations -- are common in various conditions. Multiple Sclerosis (MS) and shoulder conditions such as rotator cuff injury or frozen shoulder are possible causes. MS is a neurological disease affecting the central nervous system, while shoulder conditions are related to the musculoskeletal system.\n\nGiven your age, concerns about MS are understandable. However, based on your description, it's essential to consider both options. Here are some differences to help distinguish between them:\n\n1. Shoulder Conditions:\n\n- Pain is usually localized to the shoulder or radiates from the shoulder to the arm.\n- Numbness and weakness, if present, are typically limited to the affected hand or fingers.\n- Shoulder movements may be restricted and painful, particularly overhead movements.\n- Pain and limitations often worsen with use and improve with rest.\n\n2. Multiple Sclerosis (MS):\n\n- Symptoms can include pain, tingling, numbness, and weakness throughout the body, not just in the shoulder and arm.\n- Symptoms may be present in the leg(s) and other body parts as well.\n- Fatigue, blurred vision, and speech difficulties may also occur.\n- Sometimes MS symptoms may come and go over hours or days, followed by periods of relative stability.\n\nGiven your concerns about MS, I would recommend discussing your symptoms with your healthcare provider, especially if they have worsened or remained unchanged despite therapy. A neurological evaluation can help determine if your symptoms are indicative of MS or another condition. Additionally, having family members or friends accompany you to appointments can help ensure you receive accurate information and are able to ask any questions or concerns you may have."}

Hydration: Ensure your baby is getting enough fluids. Offer small, frequent feedings of formula instead of larger portions. If vomiting and diarrhea continue, consult a pediatrician.\n3. Gas relief: Burp your baby during and after feedings to release trapped air. You can also use wind-relief drops or apply gentle compressions on your baby's tummy to help release gas.\n4. Dietary changes: If formula is causing digestive issues, you may want to switch brands or consider a hypoallergenic or lactose-free formula under a doctor's guidance.\n5. Fiber intake: Increase your baby's fiber intake through food, if they are eating solids. Rice cereal or pureed fruits and veggies can help soften the stools.\n6. Exercise: Encourage some light physical activity, like tummy time, to help with bowel movements.\n7. Warm bath: Giving your baby a warm bath can help relax their muscles, making it easier for them to pass stools.\n8. Consult a pediatrician: If your baby hasn't passed stools for an extended period despite trying the above methods, consult a pediatrician to rule out any underlying medical conditions.\n\nIII. Caution: If your baby shows signs of serious dehydration (lack of tears when crying, dry mouth, sunken eyes, and lethargy), seek immediate medical assistance."}
{"question": "Is surgery for removal of clots from lungs and around heart risky?My husband is having a very high risk surgery to remove clots.from lungs and around heart. They have to open his chest. He has been suffering.for 10 years..this past year his health declined so quickly he could.not even.walk to the bathroom without fits of coughing...is surgery really as.risky as they say...he is only 46...and.seems like 70..", "human": "Thanks for your question on HCM. By your description I think your husband is having large , chronic pulmonary embolism in major pulmonary arteries.And if it is large enough to occlude blood flow than surgery is the only option. And yes, surgery is very risky. Because already lungs and heart are weakened due to clots.So it is considered as major surgery with very very high risk intra operatively as well as post operatively. So need to discuss outcomes in depth with your treating surgeon.", "ai": " Sure, I'll provide a straight answer to your question. The surgery you're describing, known as a thoracic lung resection or a thoracotomy, carries risks like any other major surgery. These risks can include complications such as infection, bleeding, and reaction to anesthesia. Additionally, due to the invasive nature of the procedure, which involves opening the chest, there may be risks specific to this surgery, including damage to the pleura (the lining of the lungs), injury to the heart or major blood vessels, and respiratory complications.\n\nHowever, the specific risks for any given individual depend on various factors, such as age, overall health, the extent of the surgery required, and the presence of any underlying health conditions. It's important to note that your husband's age (46) does not automatically make him more or less likely to experience complications. His ten-year history of clots in the lungs and around the heart, as well as his rapid decline in health in the past year, suggest that the benefits of the surgery may outweigh the risks, as the condition may continue to worsen without intervention.\n\nUltimately, the decision about whether or not to undergo surgery should be made in consultation with your husband's healthcare team. They will be able to provide more detailed information about the potential risks and benefits based on his specific medical history and current condition."}

Wish your kid good health.Dr. Sumanth MBBS., DCH., DNB (Paed).,", "ai": " I'm an AI language model and I don't have the ability to touch or examine your child's skin, but I can suggest some general treatments for a pimple on a 10-year-old child's nose. It's important to avoid squeezing or picking at the pimple to prevent further inflammation and potential scarring. Here are some steps you can take to help reduce the appearance of the pimple:\n\n1. Keep the area clean: Wash the nose gently with warm water and mild soap twice a day. Gently pat the area dry with a clean towel.\n2. Apply a warm compress: Dip a clean washcloth in warm water and place it on the pimple for about 10 minutes at a time. Repeat this process several times a day to help reduce inflammation and draw out any impurities.\n3. Use a topical treatment: Consider using an over-the-counter topical cream or gel that contains salicylic acid or benzoyl peroxide. These ingredients can help dry out the pimple and reduce the appearance of any redness or inflammation. Follow the instructions on the label carefully.\n4. Moisturize: Keep the skin around the pimple hydrated by using a gentle moisturizer. Avoid heavy or oily products that can clog pores.\n5. Maintain a healthy lifestyle: Encourage your child to eat a healthy diet and get plenty of rest. Stress, sugar, and processed foods can contribute to acne.\n6. Consult a healthcare professional: If the pimple does not improve after a few weeks or if it becomes more red, inflamed, or painful, consult a healthcare professional for further evaluation and treatment options."}

{"question": "Cellular and deep penetrating fibrous histiocytoma, CD43 positive in blood vessels. Cancer?I have recently been told that a lesion removed from my leg is cellular and deep penetrating fibrous histiocytoma.My doctor wants to do a wider excision of the area again. He said he is confident about the outcome but local recurrence can happen. Is this cancer?  It said in the report it was CD43 positive in blood vessels.", "human": "Fibrous histiocytoma is a type of tumor that does not spread to other parts of the body. However it is a locally aggressive tumor and recurs locally even after adequate surgery. So, recurrence at the same site after inadequate surgery is almost sure shot. Thus, a wide excision of the area is mandatory. As, i said, local recurrence can still happen, but the chances are much less. CD 43 positivity in this setting means nothing and doesnt change either the outcome or the treatment plan.", "ai": " Yes, cellular and deep penetrating fibrous histiocytoma is a type of cancer called a histiocytoma. Histiocytomas are a group of tumors that develop from histiocytes, which are a type of white blood cell. Fibrous histiocytomas are the most common type of histiocytoma and can be benign or malignant. The presence of CD43 positivity in blood vessels in the tumor suggests a malignant or aggressive variant. Your doctor's recommendation for a wider excision and possibility of local recurrence indicates that this is likely a malignant fibrous histiocytoma. It is important for you to follow your doctor's recommendations for treatment and monitoring to reduce the risk of the cancer spreading or recurs."}
{"question": "Suggest treatment for rashes in handHi I went to the doctor yesterday to show him a rash on the back of my hands, but he didn't see the white lines and circles that show up and then go away. The redness also goes away then comes back and my feet and palms itch. The circles and lines look really scary, like crop circles or something", "human": "Hi. Welcome to HCMfrom what you described you seem to be having allergic reactions causing wheals or hives. Is this the first episode or do you have a previous history of allergies in the past. Try and recall any possible cause of the rash. Any history of outdoor activity, exposure to plants, dust, animals, chemicals, any medication , any particular food. Anything you have been allergic to in the past?Once you can narrow down the possible factor, you will have to avoid it or you will keep having similar reactions. Seeing circles and lines, either white or reddish wherever you apply pressure, or scratch, is called dermographism and is a sign of sensitivity and high allergy levels in blood. So do consult a doctor regarding tests for the blood levels of eosinophils, serum IgE etc, which can show allergy. Skin tests can also be done to check specific reactions.Very rarely this reaction can happen even in normal skin.Apply a menthol/calamine lotion for the itching, 2-3 times a day. Start an antihistamine daily for 5-7 days after consulting the dermatologist. They may advise a longer course after seeing your blood work. This can help bring the allergy levels in control.If it is severe or persistent, you may be advised a cortisone shot in the ER.Use a mild soap for washing, avoid harsh chemicals. In case you have severe swelling, puffiness of face, lips, difficulty breathing, etc go to the ER immediately.Hope this helps guide you. Try to see the doctor as soon as the rashes appear.", "ai": " Based on the description provided, it appears you may be experiencing hives or contact dermatitis. Here are some suggestions for treatment:\n\n1. Over-the-counter (OTC) antihistamines: To help relieve itching and discomfort, consider taking an OTC antihistamine, such as diphenhydramine (Benadryl) or loratadine (Claritin).\n\n2. Cool compresses: Placing cool compresses on the affected areas can help alleviate itching and reduce inflammation.\n\n3. Avoid triggers: Identify and avoid any potential allergens or irritants that may be causing your symptoms.\n\n4. Topical creams: Using a topical corticosteroid cream or ointment, such as hydrocortisone, can help reduce inflammation and itching. Consult with your doctor before applying any prescription-strength medications.\n\n5. Moisturize: Keeping your skin moisturized can help prevent the rash from getting worse. Use an unscented, hypoallergenic lotion or cream.\n\n6. Seek medical advice: If your symptoms persist or worsen, consult with your healthcare provider. They may prescribe additional medications or treatments.\n\nRemember that this advice is intended for informational purposes only and should not replace professional medical advice.

No specific medication are required nor available for this.Get yourself examined by an ENT specialist to look for your vocal chords.Take care.", "ai": " There are several reasons why a boy may have a light or high-pitched voice instead of the typical deep voice associated with adolescent boys. Some common causes include:\n\n1. Hypogonadism: This condition results from the lack of adequate functioning of the gonads, which are responsible for producing hormones such as testosterone. The absence or insufficient production of testosterone can lead to a delay in the development of a deep voice.\n2. Klinefelter Syndrome: This is a genetic condition characterized by an extra X chromosome in every cell of the body. Boys with Klinefelter Syndrome may have a delay in the development of a deep voice due to the absence or insufficient production of testosterone.\n3. Hypothyroidism: A thyroid gland that does not produce enough thyroid hormones can affect the development of a deep voice in boys.\n4. Neurological conditions: Damage to the vocal cords or the nerves that control them can also result in a high-pitched voice.\n5. Vocal strain or misuse: Overuse or misuse of the voice can lead to vocal strain and damage, which can affect the quality and depth of the voice.\n\nThere is no single medicine that can instantly make your voice deeper. However, if the cause of your light voice is hormonal, such as hypogonadism or Klinefelter Syndrome, your doctor may recommend hormone replacement therapy to help promote the development of a deeper voice. Other treatments, such as speech therapy or vocal exercise, may also be helpful in improving the quality and depth of your voice.\n\nI strongly recommend consulting a healthcare professional for a proper diagnosis and treatment plan. They can evaluate your overall health and determine the underlying cause of your light voice, and provide you with personalized recommendations for managing your symptoms."}

I was prescribed with Paternia & Wysolone tablet. In what way Paternia and Wysolone helps in my case?", "human": "HiWelcome to HealthcareMagicYour sperm count is low and absent motility is not encouraging at all. Paternia is a nutritional supplement and is also given as an adjuvant for many other treatments. It contains co enzyme Q, carnitine and lycopene which have antioxidant properties which may improve sperm parameters. Wysolone (Prednisolone) is not a drug which treats infertility per say but it can help treat infertility if there is any inflammation causing the infertility.The number of days and the dosage will be best decided by your doctor as he will know the exact reason why it is being administered. Take care.", "ai": " Paternia and Wysolone are medications that have been used in infertility treatment for various indications, but their specific effects on your condition, which includes low sperm count with nil motility and a diagnosis of varicocele, depend on the underlying cause of your infertility.\n\nPaternia (Mucuna pruriens) is a herbal supplement that has been suggested to boost testosterone and increase sperm production by enhancing the release of Luteinizing Hormone (LH) and Follicle Stimulating Hormone (FSH). However, the scientific evidence supporting these claims is limited and inconsistent.\n\nWysolone (Methylprednisolone) is a synthetic corticosteroid that can help reduce inflammation and swelling. Varicocele, as you've been diagnosed with, is a dilatation of the pampiniform plexus and the associated veins, which can lead to increased temperatures around the testicle and impaired sperm production. Wysolone may be prescribed to decrease the size of the varicocele and, in turn, improve sperm quality.\n\nIt's important to note that taking these medications may come with side effects and potential risks. It's crucial to discuss the risks and benefits with your healthcare provider, as they will be able to assess the overall treatment approach and potential alternatives based on your specific condition and medical history.\n\nTherefore, the way that Paternia and Wysolone can help in your case is through their potential anti-inflammatory effects from Wysolone, which aims to reduce the size of the varicocele, and the proposed testosterone-boosting and sperm-promoting effects from Paternia. However, it is essential to follow your healthcare professional's advice and regularly monitor your condition to determine their effectiveness."}

Contact your oral surgeon or dentist who performed the surgery: They have the most accurate information about the type of implants and screws used during your procedure. Request a copy of your medical records or contact them directly to inquire about the materials used.\n\n2. X-rays or CT scans: Schedule an appointment with your dentist or oral surgeon for radiographic evaluation. They may be able to take X-rays or CT scans of your jaw to identify the metal used in your implants or screws.\n\n3. Medical documentation: Dig through your old medical records to see if there's any documentation about the type of metal used during your surgery.\n\n4. Consult with your radiologist: Speak with the radiologist who will be interpreting your breast MRI. Inform them about the possible presence of metallic implants or screws in your jaw and ask if these materials are known to interfere with MRI results. Some MRIs with specific techniques, like Breast Coil Only, can still be performed with metal implants.\n\n5. Explore alternative imaging methods: If your breast MRI cannot be performed due to your jaw implants, explore other imaging modalities, such as mammography with tomosynthesis, ultrasound, or thermography, to support a breast cancer diagnosis instead. Inform your doctor about the need for an alternative imaging method due to metal implants."}

{"question": "What causes appearance of green and orange patches on tongue?My son has orange and green patches on his tongue! What is this? It occured first when he was about a month old and was treated for thrush which took several months to clear up. Now a couple weeks later, the orange and green patches are appearing again. He is 5 months old, about 14 1/2 pounds and 27 inches long.", "human": "hello there,thank you for posting your query with healthcare magic,First of all, i would like to appreciate you for sharing the past experience your baby had.Oral thrush is nothing but a fungal infection which is most common in babies and elderly, it is seen clinically as white curd like appearance in the tongue,In case of babies we advise parents to clean their babies tongue after feeding them, if we know its from poor oral hygiene. But in some cases when babies get sick their immune system goes down and that  is when opportunistic infections like candidiasis appear. But according to your information here, if their is no white curd like appearance on babies tongue, nor any bleeding spots after you clean the tongue, then it may not be oral thrush(candidiasis), orange and green patches sometimes could also be stains from the foods we offer to our kids like fruit/vegetable juices.I would like you to keep an eye on these patches if they change in shape or size, also kindly take care of your babies oral hygiene.If you feel your baby is not eating well , then kindly seek consultation with a pediatrician.i hope any answer was helpful for you,feel free to write back if you have further questions.have a nice day,thank you", "ai": " The appearance of green and orange patches on your son's tongue could be due to a condition called \"lingual papillae variegates,\" which is harmless and common in infants and young children. These patches are caused by the natural variation in size and color of the papillae (tiny bumps) on the tongue. Alternatively, the patches could be a sign of an oral infection, such as thrush or herpes, which should be evaluated by a healthcare professional. If the patches are accompanied by other symptoms, such as difficulty swallowing, fever, or pain, it is important to consult a doctor. Additionally, it is worth mentioning that the treatment for thrush usually takes weeks to months to fully clear up, and the recurrence of patches does not necessarily mean that the infection has returned."}

Investigation like reproductive hormone analysis, USG scan, ovarian follicle study, HSG, semen analysis will help you. Last option is in vitro fertilization, intrauterine insemination. Hope this may help you. Contact further if follow up needed.Best regards,Dr. Sagar", "ai": " Duphaston (pergolide) is a medication used to treat certain conditions such as hyperprolactinemia, which can interfere with conception by reducing the number of menstrual cycles and ovulation. However, Duphaston itself is not a means of becoming pregnant. If you have been trying to conceive for four years and have undergone all necessary tests with normal results, then it's important to continue with proven methods to increase your chances of getting pregnant, such as having regular intercourse during your fertile window.\n\nIf you have been taking Duphaston for 16 days since your last menstrual period (LMP), and your cycles are regular, then your next period would be expected around 28 days from your LMP. If you have a longer menstrual cycle, your period may come later than this. If you have not yet had your period after taking Duphaston for a full cycle, then it's too early to determine whether or not you are pregnant. It's recommended to wait until after a missed period to take a pregnancy test to get an accurate result.\n\nIn summary, Duphaston is not a means of becoming pregnant, but rather a medication used to treat certain conditions that can interfere with conception. If you have undergone all necessary tests and have been trying to conceive for four years with no success, then you may want to consider seeking the advice of a fertility specialist to explore other options to increase your chances of getting pregnant."}

However, other possible causes of swelling in the ankle and a lump in the groin area include injury, infection, or inflammation.\n\nYour mom should contact her healthcare provider immediately, as a blood clot can be a serious condition that requires prompt diagnosis and treatment. Your mom's healthcare provider may recommend diagnostic tests such as ultrasound, CT scan, or blood tests to determine the underlying cause of the symptoms. Additionally, if she is taking any blood-thinning medications, she needs to inform her healthcare provider as they may need to adjust her treatment regimen.\n\nIt is important to note that swelling and discomfort are common after heart procedures, and it may take some time for these symptoms to resolve.

Both  High doses of Ofloxacillin , INH & Ethambutal are placed in catagory c for their use in pregnancy. Though there are no sufficient evidences about their teratogenicirty, they are to be used with precautions in pregnancy when the benefits over weigh the side effects & they are essential for control of Tuberculosis in pregnant woman.    The doses offered to you are in normal range.. & I feel you shoulf believe your treating doctor & continue taking it as per the advise, while regular pregnancy check ups are done.     Thanks.", "ai": " The use of Ofloxacin, INH (Isoniazid), and Ethambutol during pregnancy for tuberculosis treatment can pose risks to the fetus. Here's a brief summary of their potential adverse effects:\n\n1. Ofloxacin: Although data is limited, some studies suggest an increased risk of joint anomalies and muscle and bone development issues if taken during the first trimester. It is usually recommended to avoid use during pregnancy if possible, especially during the first trimester. However, a short-term exposure might not lead to major fetal complications.\n\n2. INH (Isoniazid): Prolonged use of INH during pregnancy, especially in the second and third trimesters, has been associated with hepatotoxicity, hepatomegaly, and jaundice. These conditions may lead to birth defects, stillbirths, or neonatal complications. However, the benefits of treating the mother for tuberculosis outweigh the risks, as the alternative may lead to severe maternal and fetal complications.\n\n3. Ethambutol: Ethambutol is considered safer during pregnancy when compared to other TB drugs, but its long-term effects are not fully understood. Research indicates that using ethambutol during pregnancy does not increase the risk of congenital abnormalities or childhood developmental issues. However, as a precaution, some healthcare providers may advise against the use of ethambutol during the first trimester.\n\nGiven the current information, the mother's physician should carefully assess the benefits and risks of continuing her TB treatment during pregnancy. It's important to note that each pregnancy is unique, and the risks can vary depending on individual factors. If possible, the healthcare team might consider alternative treatment options or adjusting the dosage to minimize the risks to the fetus. In any case, close monitoring of both the mother and the developing fetus is recommended to ensure optimal health outcomes for both.\n\nConsulting with a healthcare professional or a TB specialist is highly advised to obtain accurate and personalized medical advice for this situation. Additionally, ongoing discussions between the mother's healthcare provider and the obstetrician can help mitigate any potential risks and ensure the best possible care for the mother and her unborn child."}

Your family history for atrial fibrilation doesn't seem to be related to your symptomatology. Has anybody besides you noticed the skin discoloration of your limbs? You are too young for such cardiac disorders. Anyway, a metabolic disorder (like thyroid dysfunction, etc.) can not be excluded. I recommend consulting with your GP for a careful physical examination and a complete check up : - a resting ECG- a chest X ray study - blood lab tests : complete blood count, thyroid hormone levels, blood electrolytes, fasting glucose, kidney and liver function tests, cortisol plasma levels, etc. A treadmill test and an ambulatory 24-48 hours ECG monitoring may be necessary if suspicions of a cardiac arrhythmia are raised. If all the above tests result normal, the main cause of your symptoms would be just pure anxiety. In such case, I would recommend consulting with a specialist of this field to help you manage your anxiety.

Contact emergency services if you experience severe, unexplained chest pains, numbness, or shortness of breath.\n2. Keep a record of your symptoms, including when they occur, their duration, and any patterns you notice.\n3. Consider adopting a heart-healthy lifestyle. This includes:\n   a. Healthy eating: Aim for a balanced diet rich in whole grains, lean proteins, fruits, vegetables, and healthy fats. Limit intake of saturated and trans fats, sodium, and added sugars.\n   b. Regular physical activity: Consult your healthcare professional for exercise recommendations based on your symptoms and medical history.\n   c. Manage stress: Engage in stress reduction techniques like deep breathing, meditation, or yoga.\n   d. Quit smoking or avoid secondhand smoke: Nicotine can damage your heart and blood vessels and increase your heart rate and blood pressure.\n   e. Limit or avoid alcohol: Excess alcohol can lead to weight gain, heart muscle damage, and high blood pressure.\n4. Monitor your ankle and foot pain. If rest doesn't relieve the pain, consult your healthcare professional. It could be a sign of an underlying issue like peripheral artery disease.\n5. Consider wearing compression stockings to help improve blood flow and reduce swelling if you have discolored extremities or experience pain and swelling in your ankles or feet.\n\nUltimately, it's essential to consult a healthcare professional for proper diagnosis and treatment. They can consider your symptoms in the context of your medical history and provide guidelines tailored to your individual needs."}

This sound is not usually a cause for concern unless accompanied by pain or other symptoms, such as difficulty walking or sitting, loss of bowel or bladder control, or a deformity in the spine. If the child seems otherwise normal and appears comfortable, it is most likely a normal developmental occurrence and not indicative of a serious issue.

Gentle range of motion exercises: Perform gentle finger bending and straightening exercises several times a day to maintain flexibility and prevent the formation of scar tissue. Be careful not to force the movement.\n\n2. Massage and stretch: Gently massage the affected areas, focusing on the middle finger and the surrounding tissue, to improve circulation and reduce any potential nerve entrapment or irritation. You can also try holding your hand out with the palm facing up and bending your fingers back one at a time, then releasing them, to perform a finger extension stretch.\n\n3.

Heat therapy: Apply heat to the affected areas for 15-20 minutes, three or four times a day, to help reduce tension and improve circulation. Be sure not to use heat directly on the skin, as this could cause burns.\n\n5. Cold therapy: Applying ice packs wrapped in a thin cloth to the affected areas for 10-15 minutes, three to four times a day, can help reduce inflammation, swelling, and pain.\n\n6. Splinting: Your healthcare provider may recommend using a hand or finger splint to keep your fingers in the correct position and prevent further injury or development of incorrect muscle patterns. Be sure to follow your provider's instructions regarding splint use.\n\n7. Monitor symptoms: Keep an eye on your symptoms and report any changes or worsening symptoms to your healthcare provider, as they may need to adjust your treatment plan accordingly.\n\n8. Stay positive: Stay optimistic about your recovery. Most patients experience full recovery from trigger finger release, but it can take some time for the symptoms to subside completely. Regularly practicing the aforementioned techniques can help improve your healing process.\n\n9. Avoid repetitive strain: Try to avoid activities that require repetitive hand or finger motion, as these can be a contributing factor to the development of trigger finger. If needed, consider hand therapy or ergonomic modifications to accommodate your particular situation."}

The mild pain in the right kidney warrants further evaluation. Treatment options for kidney cysts depend on their size, location, number, and symptoms. For small asymptomatic cysts, observation and periodic monitoring are typically recommended. However, if the cysts are causing symptoms or are growing in size, intervention may be necessary.\n\nGiven your history of undergoing cystoscopy twice, it's essential to discuss your symptoms and imaging results with your urologist. They may consider offering you treatment options like minimally invasive procedures like percutaneous aspiration or sclerotherapy if the cysts' size and symptoms warrant intervention. These procedures help reduce or eliminate the cysts, thereby alleviating symptoms.\n\nIn conclusion, you should consult with your urologist to discuss the next steps regarding your kidney cysts and symptoms. Based on their assessment, they may recommend monitoring or treatment options tailored to your specific situation."}

Is this disease curable and is this dosage is normal or over dosage.  Because she is feeling drowsy in the morning hours and not able to get up early.", "human": "Parkinson's disease is currently not curable.  The dopa medicines help alleviate the symptoms of slowness of movement but do not change the course of the disease itself.  it sounds like the drowsiness may be from medication if she is taking it in the morning.  the most common culprit is the blood pressure medication.  Parkinson's disease causes low blood pressure when standing so patients usually do not need medication.  talk to your doctor about your concern over the morning drowsiness", "ai": " Parkinson's disease is currently not curable. The medications your mother is taking, such as Rasagiline (Razorpan), Prasarginine (Synthon-PA), and Carbidopa/Levodopa (Carbinoxamide/Levodopa or Sinemet), are used to manage the symptoms of Parkinson's disease. The BP (Blood Pressure) medicine and cholesterol medication she is taking are unrelated to Parkinson's disease and are likely being used for other health conditions. The dosages prescribed by her doctor are within the normal therapeutic range and should not cause excessive drowsiness, but it's important to consult her healthcare provider if she experiences persistent side effects. It's also worth mentioning that drowsiness can be a side effect of her Parkinson's disease medications, especially Levodopa, and adjustments to her treatment plan may be necessary to improve her symptoms and morning wakefulness."}

Perianal abscess: An infection that develops in the tissue around the anus, which can cause swelling and reddening in the hip area if the child has been wiping the area forcefully after bowel movements. The hard bumps could be the result of the body's attempt to wall off the infection.\n2. Fabric irritation: The bumps could be a reaction to continuous rubbing or friction against fabric, such as underwear or pants, especially if the child is sensitive to certain materials.\n3. Fatty tumors: These are benign growths made up of fat cells, also known as lipomas. They are often movable and painless, but they can have a hard, nodular feel. The bumps may increase in size over time.\n4. Spina bifida occulta: This is a birth defect in which a portion of the spinal cord or its coverings fails to form properly. While it usually doesn't cause symptoms, some cases may lead to skin discoloration or the presence of small bumps in the lower back or hip area.\n\nIt's important to consult a healthcare professional for an accurate diagnosis.

{"question": "Do i have PTB if my chest x-ray shows minimal PTB?I had 6 months treatment for my ptb and the last result of my sputum test is already negative, yesterday i  went to the hospital for xray as requested by my employer and the result is still the same ptb minimal.  Do i still have ptb and is it again contagious after 6 months of treatment", "human": "Thanks for your question on Health Care Magic. I can understand your concern. At present, you are mostly having old, healed, fibrotic lesion on chest x ray. After six months of treatment, active tb lesions on chest x ray heal. Healing takes place mostly in the form of fibrosis, calcification or both (fibro calcification). Complete resolution is rare in tuberculosis. So these healed areas appear as scar lesion on chest x ray. They will be seen as it is for lifetime. So presence of this fibrotic lesion is not suggestive of tuberculosis. Your sputum report is also negative. So you are mostly having healed lesion and not having active tb lesion. But if you really want to rule out active tuberculosis then get done CT thorax and bronchoscopy with BAL (bronchoalveolar lavage) analysis. If both these are negative for TB then you are not having active tuberculosis fir sure.Hope I have solved your query. I will be happy to help you further. Wish you good health. Thanks.", "ai": " Based on the information provided, your chest x-ray indicates minimal residual PTB (tuberculosis) lesions. This does not necessarily mean that you still have active PTB or that you are contagious.\n\nAfter 6 months of treatment, your sputum test results have been negative, indicating that the active infection has been cleared. However, it's important to note that the presence of minimal PTB lesions on a chest x-ray does not necessarily mean that you can't develop active disease again in the future.\n\nYour employer's request for a chest x-ray may have been due to occupational Health and Safety regulations. However, based on the information provided, it does not appear that you pose a significant risk of transmitting PTB to others.\n\nIf you have any concerns about your health, it's recommended that you consult with your healthcare provider for further guidance."}

As far as my knowledge goes, Primolut should not be prescribed as a progesterone supplement during pregnancy. This can cause virilization of a female fetus if used at the stage of organogenesis. It can also adversely effect the differentiation of the male sex organs. There are other, safer progesterone supplements like Duphaston, that can be used when needed. Please check with your doctor once again if the drug has been correctly prescribed or not. Since you are spotting, it is essential to take absolute bed rest, avoid all stressful situations and have regular follow up to know the pregnancy status. If the cause of the previous pregnancy loss can be known, it would be more useful.

However, the decision to use Primolut Depot in a specific pregnancy depends on various factors and should be made by a healthcare professional. The use of this medication does not guarantee a safe pregnancy or the delivery of a healthy baby, as other factors can still influence pregnancy outcomes.

If this is close to the implant then you should see a doctor as there is a risk that the implant may become infected. If you have had this problem for a number of years, this may indicate that a sinus or tract has formed under the skin. This may need to be treated with antibiotics or surgically excised.

Dr said it s probable that I ll get the use of hands back as double crush. Having EMG done soon. Also have have herniation C-3 & C-7. Dr wants me to have pt for neck, but my neck hurts just turning it.", "human": "Hello and Welcome to ‘Ask A Doctor’ service.I have reviewed your query and here is my advice.Several features of pain can be helpful in clarifying what is going on and the next steps for diagnosis and treatment.Type of pain: Burning mostly means a nerve is having problems. This can be either a sick nerve or a nerve that has had an injury. Electrical, shooting would be others implying nerve source for pain.Location of pain: There is a lot to this. First, if something goes in the pathway of a nerve, then that is the nerve involved. Nerves are long and the pain is in a belt-like long pathway. Smaller areas are smaller nerves. This also tends to say what might be going on. Obviously if there was an injury to the area and then there was pain outward from it \"hit a nerve\" would be a possibility. Sick nerves are multiple areas and tend to be the TIPS of the nerve not the whole nerve.What hurts: Moving a particular way that triggers the pain tells what is hurting. Specifically it can distinguish outward structures like skin, muscles, tendons, joints from deep structures like organs and nerves.There is the pain. There is the context of it. If it is getting less that is perceived as good regardless of the pain. If the patient is making a lot of pain, then after the patient, the pain is less.Pain exists, at multiple levels of abstraction. There is how it is held. Producing the pain by oneself (patient) changes this and generally helps. Having a control of the pain helps.Hope I have answered your query.
