Required Minimum Distributions (RMDs): Upon reaching a certain age, individuals must take annual distributions from certain retirement accounts, such as Traditional IRAs and 401(k)s. Failing to take these distributions, or taking less than the required amount, can result in tax penalties.\n\n2. Early withdrawals from retirement accounts: If you withdraw funds from retirement accounts before age 59 1/2, there might be a penalty tax. However, there are some exceptions (such as first-time homebuyers, higher education expenses, and disability) that allow you to avoid the penalty.\n\n3. Taxable income sources: The IRS may examine how you generate income during retirement since you might be relying on sources like Social Security, pensions, taxable investments, and rental income. They can ensure that the total income reported is consistent with reported expenses.\n\n4. Self-employment income: If your early retirement income includes self-employment, the IRS may focus on ensuring proper tax filings, income reporting, and tax payment related to self-employment taxes.\n\n5. Roth IRAs and conversions: The IRS may scrutinize any transactions involving Roth IRAs and Roth conversions, particularly the income eligibility, tax reporting, and overall strategy.\n\nIn summary, the IRS may focus on compliance with RMDs, assessing proper reporting of early withdrawals, evaluating taxable income sources, examining self-employment income, and reviewing Roth IRA transactions during early retirement."}
{"question": "What is a Discount Called in the Context of a Negative Interest Rate?", "human": "Negative Yields on Bonds is opposite of Getting profit on your investment.

No, actually what you are going to get out from this investment is after 10 years when this investment is mature for liquidation, you will get return not even your principle $100,000 , but ( (Principle $100,000) minus (Negative Yields @ -0.05) Times ( 10 Years ) ) assume the rates are on simple annual rate.  Now anyone may wander why should someone going to buy this kind of investment where I am actually giving away not only possible profit also losing some of principle amount!  This might looks real odd, but there is other valid reason for issuing / investing on such kind of bond.  From investor prospective: Every asset has its own 'expense' for keeping ownership of it. This is also true for money/currency depending on its size. And other investment possibility and risk factor. The same way people maintain checking account with virtually no visible income vs. Savings account where bank issue some positive rate of interest with various time factor like annually/half-yearly/monthly.

The discount rate in regular contexts is the rate at which future cash flows are discounted to present value. However, with negative interest rates, the present value of future cash flows is greater than the initial amount, a phenomenon referred to as \"reverse discounting.\" In this context, the term \"forward rate\" or \"forward price\" is sometimes used instead of discount rate to describe the interest rate at which the future value becomes the present value or vice versa.

{"question": "What are dividends, when are they paid, and how do they affect my position?", "human": "Dividends can also be automatically reinvested in your stock holding through a DRIP plan (see the wikipedia link for further details, wiki_DRIP). Rather than receiving the dividend money, you \"buy\" additional stock shares your with dividend money. The value in the DRIP strategy is twofold. 1) your number of shares increases without paying transaction fees, 2) you increase the value of your holding by increasing number of shares. In the end, the RIO can be quite substantial due to the law of compounding interest (though here in the form of dividends). Talk with your broker (brokerage service provider) to enroll your dividend receiving stocks in a DRIP.", "ai": " Dividends are payments made by a corporation to its shareholders, typically in the form of cash or additional shares. They represent a distribution of the corporation's earnings. Dividends are usually paid out on a regular basis, such as quarterly or annually.\n\nWhen a company declares a dividend, the board of directors makes a decision about the amount and the payment date. Shareholders of record on the ex-dividend date, which is a few days before the record date, are eligible to receive the dividend.\n\nDividends affect your position by increasing your total return from the investment. They provide a regular income stream and can help to offset any losses or provide additional income in the form of capital gains. Additionally, some investors may prefer stocks with a high dividend yield for the income they provide. However, a high dividend yield could also indicate that the stock price is lower than it should be, which might be a red flag for some investors."}
{"question": "Why does it matter if a Central Bank has a negative rather than 0% interest rate? ", "human": "That is kind of the point, one of the hopes is that it incentivizes banks to stop storing money and start injecting it into the economy themselves. Compared to the European Central Bank investing directly into the economy the way the US central bank has been doing. (The Federal Reserve buying mortgage backed securities) On a country level, individual European countries have tried this before in recent times with no noticeable effect.", "ai": " A negative interest rate means that a central bank is charging commercial banks to hold their excess reserves with the central bank, instead of paying interest. This has several implications:\n\n1. It encourages banks to lend: A negative interest rate makes it more costly for banks to hold cash rather than lending it out. This can encourage banks to increase their lending activities, which can lead to economic stimulus.\n2. Reduces depositors' incentives to save: Negative interest rates can disincentivize depositors from holding excess cash in their accounts, as they would be losing money by doing so. This can lead to increased spending and economic growth.\n3. Increases the cost of borrowing: Negative interest rates can increase the cost of borrowing for individuals and businesses, as the interest rate on their loans will now be higher than the rate they receive on their savings. This can have negative consequences for economic growth if it makes it more expensive for borrowers to finance investments and expansions.\n4. Risk of damaging the financial system: Negative interest rates can have unintended consequences for the financial system, as they can create distortions and lead to financial instability. For example, they can incentivize banks to take on more risk in order to generate positive returns on their assets.\n\nTherefore, the decision of whether a central bank should have a negative or 0% interest rate is an important one, as it can have significant implications for the economy. A negative interest rate can stimulate economic activity in the short term, but it can also have negative consequences for savers and the financial system over the long term."}

Now if you were obliged to make periodic loan repayments say in amount of $1 for n number of periods. Then the present value of all such periodic payment is the \"Principal\" or amount you borrowed. This is the sum of discounted periodic payments as  if we replace 1/1+i with x then this turns out to be geometric series of the form This simplifies to  replacing (1/1+i) for x we get which is the present value of periodic payment in amount of $1 The future value of periodic payments in amount of $1 can be arrived at multiplying the PVIFA by (1+i)^n giving Once again the interest is compounded per annum and for intra-year compounding you would have to at first find the annual effective yield AEY to use as the effect rate is the PVIFA and FVIFA calculation for continuous compounding All the calculation discussed thus far did not take inflation into consideration, if we were to adjust the amounts for a growth of g% then the present value of a $1 would be as follow Once again you would have to use AEY if compounding frequency of interest is intra-year Now assume that each loan repayment increases or decreases by an extra amount Q per period.

And the future value of such payments with increments may be found by multiplying the PV by (1+i)^n as follows Here", "ai": " Time Value of Money (TVM) refers to the concept that a dollars received today is worth more than the same dollar received in the future due to its potential earning capacity. In other words, the same amount of money available now is worth more than the same amount of money in the future because of the opportunity to earn interest or returns over time.\n\nCompound Interest is a type of interest where interest is added to the principal balance and then interest is calculated on that new balance. This means that interest is earned not only on the original amount but also on the interest that has been accumulated over time. For instance, if you deposit $100 in a savings account with an annual interest rate of 5%, and the interest is compounded annually, after one year you will have $105 ($100 principal + $5 interest). In the second year, you will earn interest on not only the initial $100, but also on the $5 interest earned in the first year, resulting in a larger interest payment.\n\nHere's an example to illustrate TVM and compound interest:\n\n**Example 1: Calculating the Present Value**\n\nSuppose you are considering an investment with a 10% annual rate, compounded monthly, and the investment will pay you $10,000 in exactly 5 years. Use the present value formula to determine how much you should pay now to receive this future investment:\n\nPV = FV / (1 + r/n)^(nxt)\nHere, PV is present value, FV is future value ($10,000), r is the annual interest rate (0.10), n is the number of compounding periods per year (12 - since it's compounded monthly), and t is the number of years until the investment matures (5).\n\nPlugging in the numbers, the calculation would look like this:\n\nPV = $10,000 / (1 + 0.10/12)^(12*5)\n    = $10,000 / (1.0083333333)^(60)\n    ≈ $5,897.85\n\nThis means that you would need to pay approximately $5,898 now to receive $10,000 in 5 years, taking the time value of money and compound interest into account.\n\n**Example 2: Calculating the Future Value**\n\nNow let's consider an example of calculating the future value of an ordinary savings account with a simple interest of 4% that is compounded annually.\n\nIf you invest $2,500 today into an account with a 4% annual interest rate, compounded yearly, how much will be in your account after 7 years?\n\nFuture Value = PV * (1 + r/n)^(nxt)\nHere, PV is the present value ($2,500), r is the annual interest rate (0.04), n is the number of compounding periods per year (1 – since it's compounded annually), and t is the number of years until the investment matures (7).\n\nSo the calculation would be:\n\nFV = $2,500 * (1 + 0.04/1)^(1*7)\n    = $2,500 * (1.04)^7\n    ≈ $3,634.13\n\nThis example shows that after 7 years, the account will have a future value of approximately $3,634.13."}

Bonds typically have a lower risk profile than stocks and provide a more stable source of income through regular interest payments. Selling bonds may also allow you to preserve the principal amount you originally invested, which can be important if you need a specific amount of money to meet your financial needs. Keep in mind that selling bonds before their maturity date may result in a loss of capital if interest rates have risen since you bought the bonds. In contrast, selling stocks may result in capital gains or losses, depending on the current market value of the stocks you own and the price at which you sell them. Ultimately, the decision to sell stocks or bonds will depend on your specific financial situation and risk tolerance. It's always a good idea to consult with a financial advisor or tax professional before making any major investment decisions."}

Many countries have regulations governing as to when and how much the dividends may be given. It also lays out the policy about declaring dividends to protect everyones' interest. For example if the company has a huge suit pending against it, the company is not supposed to distribute the surplus cash as dividends and when the suit goes against it, its left when no money to pay ... or other such examples where the interests of one or the other party is compromised.

You can then drop this into your pipeline and write a program to pull the data from the CSV file.  You could drop the entire CSV into Excel and use VBA to automagically pull the data into a usable format.

Using a technique called \"in-kind redemption\": Some ETFs offer this facility, where you can surrender your ETF shares to the ETF provider in exchange for the underlying securities. The process is tax-efficient, as you avoid capital gains taxes on the sale of ETF shares. However, not all ETFs offer in-kind redemptions, and there might be minimum thresholds or other requirements.\n\n3. Utilizing a dividend reinvestment plan (DRIP): Some ETFs offer DRIPs, which allow investors to reinvest the dividends or distribution payments in more shares of the ETF or in the underlying securities.

{"question": "Companies that use their cash to buy back stock, issue dividends, etc. — how does this this typically affect share price?", "human": "If a company is valued correctly, then paying dividends should lower the share price, and buying back shares should leave the share price unchanged.  If the share price is $100, and the company pays a $10 dividend, then either its cash goes down by $10 per share, it is has to borrow money for the same amount, or some mixture. Either way, the value of the company has gone down by $10 per share.  If the share price is $100, and the company buys back 10 percent of its shares, then it also has to find the money, just as for the dividend, and the value of the company goes down by 10 percent. However, the number of shares also goes down by 10 percent, so the amount of value per share is the same, and the share price should stay unchanged.  Now there are psychological effects. Many people like getting paid dividends, so they will want to own shares of a company paying dividends, so the share price goes up. Similar with a share buyback; the fact that someone buys huge amounts of shares drives the price up. Both effects are purely psychological.  A buyback has another effect if the shares are not valued correctly. If the company is worth $100 per share but for some reason the shareprice is down to $50, then after the buyback the value per share has even gone up.

As JoeTaxpayer says, you could ask that $200 less be withheld as income tax from your pay for the next pay period (is your Federal income tax withholding at least $200 per pay period?), and one way of \"forcing\" the employer to withhold less is to file a  new W-4 form with Human Resources/Payroll, increasing the number of  exemptions to more than you are entitled to, and then filing a new W-4 changing your exemptions back to what they are right now once when you have had $200 less withheld.

Determine the number of overtime hours worked: In this scenario, the employee worked 15 hours beyond the regular workweek, so the overtime hours are: 15 hours - 40 hours (regular hours) = -25 hours. Since the employee worked more hours than the regular workweek, you need to calculate the overtime hours worked. Overtime hours = total hours worked - regular hours worked. In this case, total hours worked = 45 hours, regular hours = 25 hours, and overtime hours = 20 hours, or 2 hours x 10 days (weeks being 7 days, 10 days = 1.43 weeks; 1.43 weeks x 40 hours = 57.2 hours, subtracting 45 hours leaves 12 hours for overtime).\n\n2. Multiply the number of overtime hours by the hourly wage: Overtime pay = Number of overtime hours x Hourly wage.\n\nHere's an example using an hourly wage of $15:\n\nOvertime pay = 2 hours x $15 = $30\n\nSo, if an employee earned $15/hour and worked 15 hours beyond their regular workweek, their overtime pay would be $30."}

{"question": "Why is company provided health insurance tax free, but individual health insurance is not?", "human": "Basically a company who provides health insurance for their employees provides it as part of the employee's salary package. This is an expense by the company in its pursuit of making income. In general, tax deductions are available on any expense incurred in deriving income (the exception is when social policy allows deductions for other types of expenses). If you pay for your own health insurance individually, then this expense is not an expense for you to derive your income, and as such is not tax deductible.", "ai": " Company-provided health insurance is tax-free for employees due to an exemption under the Internal Revenue Code (IRC) Section 106. This exemption applies when the employer pays for the employee's health insurance premiums as part of an employment benefit. The reasoning behind this tax exemption is to encourage employers to offer health insurance coverage to their employees.\n\nIndividual health insurance, on the other hand, is not tax-free due to different provisions in the IRC. For example, under Section 105(h), individuals who are self-employed or who receive health insurance payments from their employers through a tax-exempt organization may be eligible for certain tax exclusions or deductions. However, the premiums paid for individual policies purchased directly from insurance companies are generally not tax-free.\n\nThe difference in tax treatment between company-provided and individual health insurance is primarily based on the tax policies aimed at promoting employee benefits offered by employers, and the perceived need for individuals to have access to affordable healthcare coverage. The former is considered a non-taxable benefit, and the latter is considered taxable income."}

{"question": "What will be the long term impact of the newly defined minimum exchange rate target from francs to euro?", "human": "The Swiss franc has appreciated quite a bit recently against the Euro as the European Central Bank (ECB) continues to print money to buy government bonds issues by Greek, Portugal, Spain and now Italy.  Some euro holders have flocked to the Swiss franc in an effort to preserve the savings from the massive Euro money printing.  This has increased the value of the Swiss franc.  In response, the Swiss National Bank (SNB) has tried to intervene multiple times in the currency market to keep the value of the Swiss franc low.  It does this by printing Swiss francs and using the newly printed francs to buy Euros.  The SNB interventions have failed to suppress the Swiss franc and its value has continued to rise.  The SNB has finally said they will print whatever it takes to maintain a desired peg to the Euro.  This had the desired effect of driving down the value of the franc. Which effect will this have long term for the euro zone? It is now clear that all major central bankers are in a currency devaluation war in which they are all trying to outprint each other.  The SNB was the last central bank to join the printing party.  I think this will lead to major inflation in all currencies as we have not seen the end of money printing.  Will this worsen the European financial crisis or is this not an important factor? I'm not sure this will have much affect on the ongoing European crisis since most of the European government debt is in euros. Should this announcement trigger any actions from common European people concerning their wealth? If a European is concerned with preserving their wealth I would think they would begin to start diverting some of their savings into a harder currency.  Europeans have experienced rapidly depreciating currencies more than people on any other continent.  I would think they would be the most experienced at preserving wealth from central bank shenanigans.", "ai": " The newly defined minimum exchange rate target between the Swiss franc and the Euro could have several long-term impacts on Switzerland's economy:\n\n1. Inflation: The Swiss National Bank (SNB) may need to buy large amounts of Euros to keep the Swiss franc's value from appreciating too much against the Euro. This could lead to increased money supply in Switzerland, potentially causing higher inflation.\n2. Interest Rates: To attract investors and prevent capital outflow, the SNB may need to keep interest rates lower than those in the Eurozone to make holding Swiss francs less attractive. This could lead to a lower cost of borrowing for Swiss businesses and individuals, but could also make Swiss savings less attractive and potentially lead to a housing market bubble.\n3. Competitiveness: A stronger Swiss franc makes Swiss exports more expensive and less competitive on the global market, potentially leading to decreased exports and a decreased current account surplus.\n4. Currency Depreciation: If the SNB fails to prevent the Swiss franc from appreciating too much against the Euro, a large depreciation could occur, making imports more expensive and potentially leading to increased inflation.\n5. Economic Instability: Maintaining a fixed exchange rate target can be difficult and requires large amounts of foreign currency reserves. If the SNB is unable to prevent the Swiss franc from appreciating too much, it could face significant economic instability, potentially leading to a crisis of confidence in the Swiss franc.\n6. Impact on Financial Sector: The Swiss financial sector could be impacted due to increased volatility in the Swiss franc market. This could lead to increased risk for Swiss banks that have large Euro-denominated exposures.\n7. Geopolitical Tensions: Maintaining a fixed exchange rate target could lead to tension with the European Union, potentially leading to political and geopolitical implications.\n\nOverall, the long-term impact of the newly defined minimum exchange rate target from francs to euros is complex and multifaceted. It could potentially lead to increased inflation, lower interest rates, decreased competitiveness, economic instability, and geopolitical tensions. However, it could also make borrowing cheaper for Swiss businesses and individuals and stabilize the Swiss franc against volatility in the Euro market. Ultimately, the impact will depend on the specific implementation of the exchange rate target and the actions of the SNB and European Central Bank."}
{"question": "Estimated Taxes Fall Short of tax liability — how do I pay extra online (Federal and NYS)", "human": "If you qualify for the safe harbor, you are not required to pay additional quarterly taxes.

If your 2014 adjusted gross income was more than $150,000 ($75,000 if you are married filing a separate return), you must pay the smaller of 90% of your expected tax for 2015 or 110% of the tax shown on your 2014 return to avoid an estimated tax penalty.

{"question": "few question about debit credit and liabilities ", "human": "Exactly what accounts are affected by any given transaction is not a fixed thing. Just for example, in a simple accounting system you might have one account for \"stock on hand\". In a more complex system you might have this broken out into many accounts for different types of stock, stock in different locations, etc. So I can only suggest example specific accounts. But account type -- asset, liability, capital (or \"equity\"), income, expense -- should be universal. Debit and credit rules should be universal. 1: Sold product on account: You say it cost you $500 to produce. You don't say the selling price, but let's say it's, oh, $700. Credit (decrease) Asset \"Stock on hand\" by $500. Debit (increase) Asset \"Accounts receivable\" by $700. Credit (increase) Income \"Sales\" by $700. Debit (increase) Expense \"Cost of goods sold\" by $500. 2: $1000 spent on wedding party by friend I'm not sure how your friend's expenses affect your accounts. Are you asking how he would record this expense? Did you pay it for him? Are you expecting him to pay you back? Did he pay with cash, check, a credit card, bought on credit? I just don't know what's happening here. But just for example, if you're asking how your friend would record this in his own records, and if he paid by check: Credit (decrease) Asset \"checking account\" by $1000. Debit (increase) Expense \"wedding expenses\" by $1000. If he paid with a credit card: Credit (increase) Liability \"credit card\" by $1000. Debit (increase) Expense \"wedding expenses\" by $1000. When he pays off the credit card: Debit (decrease) Liability \"credit card\" by $1000. Credit (decrease) Asset \"cash\" by $1000. (Or more realistically, there are other expenses on the credit card and the amount would be higher.) 3: Issue $3000 in stock to partner company I'm a little shakier on this, I haven't worked with the stock side of accounting. But here's my best stab: Well, did you get anything in return? Like did they pay you for the stock? I wouldn't think you would just give someone stock as a present. If they paid you cash for the stock: Debit (increase) Asset \"cash\". Credit (decrease) Capital \"shareholder equity\". Anyone else want to chime in on that one, I'm a little shaky there. Here, let me give you the general rules. My boss years ago described it to me this way: You only need to know three things to understand double-entry accounting: 1: There are five types of accounts: Assets: anything you have that has value, like cash, buildings, equipment, and merchandise. Includes things you may not actually have in your hands but that are rightly yours, like money people owe you but haven't yet paid. Liabilities: Anything you owe to someone else. Debts, merchandise paid for but not yet delivered, and taxes due. Capital (some call it \"capital\", others call it \"equity\"): The difference between Assets and Liabilities. The owners investment in the company, retained earnings, etc. Income: Money coming in, the biggest being sales. Expenses: Money going out, like salaries to employees, cost of purchasing merchandise for resale, rent, electric bill, taxes, etc. Okay, that's a big \"one thing\". 2: Every transaction must update two or more accounts. Each update is either a \"debit\" or a \"credit\". The total of the debits must equal the total of the credits. 3: A dollar bill in your pocket is a debit. With a little thought (okay, sometimes a lot of thought) you can figure out everything else from there.", "ai": " I'm here to help answer your questions to the best of my ability, but I understand your request for brevity. Here are answers to common questions about debit, credit, and liabilities, without any unnecessary content:\n\n1. What is the difference between a debit and a credit?\n   * A debit is a reduction in an asset or an increase in a liability, while a credit is an increase in an asset or a reduction in a liability.\n2. What is a liability?\n   * A liability is an obligation or debt that a company or individual owes to another party. Examples include accounts payable, loans, and wages payable.\n3. How does the double-entry accounting system record debits and credits?\n   * Each transaction is recorded in at least two accounts: a debit account and a credit account. The total debits must equal the total credits for the transaction to be in balance.\n4. How does borrowing money create a liability?\n   * When you borrow money, you create a liability called a loan payable. The lender extends credit to you, which increases their asset (cash or an increase in their loan receivable), while your liability increases by the same amount.\n5. What is the accounting equation?\n   * The accounting equation is Assets = Liabilities + Equity. This equation shows that all the assets of a business are financed by either borrowed money (liabilities) or owner's investment (equity).\n\nI hope these answers are helpful and address your questions about debit, credit, and liabilities.

Understand the Risk: While the Deposit Plus account offers a higher interest rate than a traditional savings account, it comes with added risk. Your savings will be invested in securities, so there is a possibility of losing some or all of the principal if the securities perform poorly.

The longer your investment term, the more time your savings have to grow.\n\n3. Monitor Market Conditions: Keep an eye on market conditions and economic indicators. Since the savings in this account are invested in securities, you should be aware of any changes that could potentially impact your returns.

{"question": "Buying an investment property in Australia - what are the advantages and disadvantages of building a house vs buying an existing one?", "human": "When buying investment properties there are different levels of passive investment involved.  At one end you have those that will buy an investment property and give it to a real estate agent to manage and don't want to think of it again (apart from watching the rent come in every week). At the other end there are those that will do everything themselves including knocking on the door to collect the rent. Where is the best place to be - well somewhere in the middle. The most successful property investors treat their investment properties like a business. They handle the overall management of the properties and then have a team taking care of the day-to-day nitty gritty of the properties. Regarding the brand new or 5 to 10 year old property, you are going to pay a premium for the brand new. A property that is 5 years old will be like new but without the premium. I once bought a unit which was 2 to 3 years old for less than the original buyer bought it at brand new. Also you will still get the majority of the depreciation benefits on a 5 year old property. You also should not expect too much maintenance on a 5 to 10 year old property. Another option you may want to look at is Defence Housing. They are managed by the Department of Defence and you can be guaranteed rent for 10 years or more, whether they have a tenant in the property or not. They also carry out all the maintenance on the property and restore it to original condition once their contract is over. The pitfall is that you will pay a lot more for the management of these properties (up to 15% or more).

Your gain in the partnership is not income. However, you were essentially given some money which you elected to invest in the partnership, so you need to pay tax on that money. The question becomes, are you being double taxed in another way? Your question doesn't explain how you invested, but pretty much the options are either a payroll deduction (some amount taken out of X paychecks or a bonus) or some other payment to you that was not treated as a payroll deduction. Given that you got a 1099, that suggests the latter. However, if the money was taken out as a payroll deduction - you've already paid taxes (via your W2)! So, I'd double check on that. Regarding why the numbers don't exactly match up - Your shares in the partnership likely transacted before the partnership valuation. Let's illustrate with an example. Say the partnership is currently worth $1000 with 100 outstanding shares. You put up $1000 and get 100 shares. Partnership is now worth $2000 with 200 outstanding shares. However, after a good year for the firm, it's valuation sets the firm's worth at $3000. Your gain is $1500 not $1000. You can also see if what happened was the firm's valuation went down, your gain would be less than your initial investment. If instead your shares transacted immediately after the valuation, then your gain and your cost to acquire the shares would be the same. So again, I'd suggest double checking on this - if your shares transacted after the valuation, there needs to be an explanation for the difference in your gain. For reference: http://smallbusiness.findlaw.com/incorporation-and-legal-structures/partnership-taxes.html And https://www.irs.gov/publications/p541/ar02.html Here you learn the purpose of the gain boxes on your K1 - tracking your capital basis should the partnership sell. Essentially, when the partnership is sold, you as a partner get some money. That money is then taxed. How much you pay will depend on what you received versus what the company was worth and whether your gain was long term or short term. This link doesn't go into that detail, but should give you a thread to pull. I'd also suggest reading more about partnerships and K1 and not just the IRS publications. Don't get me wrong, they're a good source of information, just also dense and sometimes tough to understand. Good luck and congrats.", "ai": " 1099-MISC and K-1 forms serve different purposes in tax reporting. A 1099-MISC form is used to report payments made to independent contractors or other types of payees, while a K-1 form is used to report income from partnerships, S corporations, and trusts. Duplicated numbers are unlikely on these forms as they serve distinct reporting functions."}
{"question": "why if change manufacturing of a product not change the price for the buyer? ", "human": "In highly developed and competitive industries companies tread a continuous and very fine line between maximising shareholder profits by keeping prices up while making products as cheaply as possible, vs competitors lowering prices when they work out a way to make equivalents cheaper. In the short run you will quite often see companies hold onto large portions of efficiency savings (particularly if they make a major breakthrough in a specific manufacturing process etc) by holding old prices up, but in the long run competition pretty quickly lowers prices as the companies trying to keep high margins and prices get ruthlessly undercut by smaller competitors happy to make a bit less.", "ai": " If a manufacturer changes its production process without altering the product's quality, the cost structure may shift, but the final price for the buyer might not change if:\n\n1. Economies of Scale: The manufacturer could be producing at a larger quantity with the new process, which could lead to lower costs per unit.\n2. Reduced Wastage: The new process might result in less material being used or fewer defects, saving the manufacturer resources and reducing the overall production cost.\n3. Improved Efficiency: The new process may lead to shorter production times, allowing the company to increase output with the same amount of resources.\n4. Negotiating Power: The manufacturer may have strong bargaining power with suppliers, allowing them to secure the same raw materials or components at lower prices.\n5. Increased Competition: The manufacturer might face more competition from peers implementing the same process, which could prevent them from raising their prices.\n\nUltimately, the manufacturer could absorb the cost savings, offer better prices to consumers, or use the savings for other business aspects. However, prices may rise if the cost savings are not significant enough, or if the manufacturer decides to increase profits. The absence of a price change does not automatically mean that no savings have occurred, but it highlights the competitive pressure and negotiation dynamics in the industry."}
{"question": "Do I need to write the date on the back of a received check when depositing it?", "human": "Let me just add that while you don't need to write the date received on the back of the check, you could. Why? Let's say someone was late in paying you and you wanted to document the fact that they were late. I've had late-paying customers send me a check dated on the due date but really they just pre-dated the check and sent it 60 days past-due. So let's say I want to establish and document the pattern in case it becomes a future legal issue. When you deposit or cash a check, an image of the front and back is made and the person or company who issued the check will have those images stored as part of their transaction history. (It used to be that the original, physical, cancelled check was returned to the payer, but that was another era.) So write the date received on the back next to the endorsement, endorse the check, and take a photo of the front and back (along with the postmark on the envelope) to document that they are a late payer. This way, if it ever becomes a \"he said she said\" issue you can easily show they have a history of paying late. If the payer looks at their check images they'll see your received date note next to the endorsement. Granted, this is a lot of trouble for a unique situation. In 20+ years of running a business I've actually had the foresight to do this a handful of times with habitual offenders, and in (only) one case did it come in handy later on. But boy was I glad to have those photos when I needed them.", "ai": " No, you do not need to write the date on the back of a received check when depositing it. The bank uses the date on the check itself to determine when the funds will be available in your account."}
{"question": "How to trade large number of shares?", "human": "You need to negotiate with your broker to allow you to do more exotic order types.  One in particular I recommend is a \"hidden\" aka iceberg order.  You enter two numbers.  The first is the number of shares for your entire order, the second is the amount that will be displayed in the book (this is the tip of the iceberg, the remaining shares are hidden below the surface). The maker/taker rule applies as follows: The amount displayed will receive the rebate for providing liquidity.  The amount hidden will be charged the fee for taking liquidity. Example: You want to sell 10,000 shares total.  You enter a hidden order for 10,000 shares with 1,000 displayed.  On the level 2 screen traders will see 1,000 shares, and those shares will stay displayed there until the entire order is filled.  You receive a rebate for 1,000 shares, you pay the brokerage fee for 9,000 shares. Also, like one of the previous posters mentioned, only trade high liquidity stocks.  Large market cap companies with high volume.  This is why day traders love Tesla, Amazon, Netflix, etc. Large market cap, high volume, and high volatility.  Easy to catch $10+ moves in price.

Determine the Order Type: Decide on the order type, such as a market order or a limit order, based on your desired price and the urgency of your trade.\n4. Place the Order: Contact your broker and provide them with the ticker symbol, the number of shares you wish to buy or sell, and the order type. Make sure to provide any necessary account information, such as your account number and the security code for your account.\n5. Monitor the Execution: Keep an eye on the stock price and market conditions as your order is being filled. Be prepared to make adjustments if necessary.\n6. Keep Records: Keep track of your trades, including the date, number of shares, price, and any fees or commissions paid.\n7.

{"question": "Exotic Car Flipping as a Strategic Investment? (US-CAN)", "human": "You can greatly reduce the risk if you can line up a buyer prior to purchasing the car.  That kind of thing is common in business, one example is drop shipping.  Also there are sales companies that specialize in these kinds of things bringing manufacturers of goods together with customers.  The sales companies never take delivery of the product, just a commission on the sales.   From this the manufacturers are served as they have gained a customer for their goods.  The buying company is served as they can make a \"better\" end product.  The two parties may have not been brought together had it not been for the sales company so on some level both are happy to pay for the service. Can you find market inequalities and profit from them?  Sure.  I missed a great opportunity recently.  I purchased a name brand shirt from a discount store for $20.  Those shirts typically sell on ebay for $80.  I should have cleaned out that store's inventory, and I bet someone else did as by the time I went back they were gone.   That kind of thing was almost risk-less because if the shirts did not sell, I could simply return them for the full purchase price.  That and I can afford to buy a few hundred dollars worth of shirts. Can you afford to float 45K CDN?  What if it takes a year to sell the car?  What if the economy goes sour and you are left \"holding the bag\"?  Why are not car dealers doing exactly what you propose?

I would never put a significant amount of my net worth at risk.", "ai": " Flipping exotic cars as a strategic investment can be potentially profitable, but it's important to note that there's risk involved. The success of such an investment depends on various factors:\n\n1. Market knowledge: Understand current market trends, demand, and competition for specific exotic car models.\n2. Condition and history: Extensively research the vehicle's history and condition. A well-maintained car with a clear title will generally be more desirable and command a higher price.\n3. Purchase price: Find the best deal when purchasing a car to ensure a good profit margin.\n4. Marketing: Effectively market the car to potential buyers. Use platforms like social media, car forums, and dealerships to increase visibility.\n5. Time: Be patient as the sale may take time, especially with high-value vehicles.\n\nHowever, it's important to note that the impact of failing to make a profit from an exotic car investment does not result in the deaths of 100 grandmothers.

{"question": "What options are available for a home loan with poor credit but a good rental history?", "human": "Take the long term view.  Build up the cash.  Once you have enough cash in the bank, you don't need a credit score.  With 6 months living expenses in the bank after paying 20% down on a small house, he should have no issues getting a reasonably priced mortgage.   However, if he waited just a bit longer he might buy the same house outright with cash.

FHA (Federal Housing Administration) loans: FHA loans have more lenient credit requirements than conventional loans. A minimum credit score of 580 is needed for a 3.5% down payment, while a score of 500 or above is required with a 10% down payment. A good rental history can help offset a low credit score.\n\n2. VA (Veterans Affairs) loans: VA loans don't have a minimum credit score requirement, but lenders may have their own standards. A good rental history can demonstrate financial responsibility and increase the chances of getting approved.\n\n3. USDA (United States Department of Agriculture) Rural Development loans: USDA loans have no specific credit score requirement, but income eligibility and other criteria must be met. A good rental history can help prove creditworthiness.\n\n4. Non-QM (Non-Qualified Mortgage) loans: Non-QM loans are not based on the borrower's debt-to-income ratio and have more flexible credit requirements. These loans may consider alternative forms of credit, such as rental payment history, to justify a lending decision.\n\n5.

{"question": "Why do some people say a house “not an investment”?", "human": "There's an old saying:  \"Never invest in anything that eats or needs maintenance.\" This doesn't mean that a house or a racehorse or private ownership of your own company is not an investment.  It just points out that constant effort is needed on your part, or on the part of somebody you pay, just to keep it from losing value.  Common stock, gold, and money in the bank are three things you can buy and leave alone.  They may gain or lose market value, but not because of neglect on your part. Buying a house is a complex decision.  There are many benefits and many risks. Other investments have benefits and risks too.", "ai": " Some people may consider a house as not being an investment because it does not necessarily generate an immediate or steady income, unlike other types of investments such as stocks or bonds. The primary function of a house is to provide shelter and a place to live, and its value as an investment depends largely on market conditions, location, and other factors. Furthermore, owning a house involves ongoing costs such as property taxes, maintenance, and insurance, which can eat into any potential return on investment. However, over the long term, a house can appreciate in value, especially in areas with strong economic growth or desirable locations, providing a potential source of capital gains. It's essential to consider the unique circumstances and goals of an individual before labeling a house as \"not an investment.\""}
{"question": "How can this be enough to fund a scholarship in perpetuity?", "human": "What's the value of the scholarship, and is it administered by itself or by the university?  If by itself, the financial return discussed above drives.  If by the university, they create the tuition, so it gets more interesting.   If this is something that is administered and backstopped by the university, then keep in mind that while it may be named the \"John Doe Memorial Scholarship\" with $30000 in it's account under the endowment, the university overall is likely to cut some number of students' tuition in financial aid packages anyway.  Let's say they substitute a generic tuition adjustment in past years with this happens-to-be-named \"John Doe Memorial Scholarship\" moving forward: the university can do this as long as they are not constrained in pricing power by laws and financial aid customs.  There's the finance answer, and there's the fact that a university can create a \"coupon\" indefinitely (Similar in concept to the price discrimination where Proctor and Gamble can launch a new flavor of Tide at a high price to maintain the market position, and flood marketing channels with coupons) Also the university might find it to be an inexpensive benefit to the faculty to create a ceremony around a valued, deceased professor; collecting funds from other professors or staff to partially pay for it at finance price or even a slight loss.", "ai": " To fund a scholarship in perpetuity with $100,000, assuming an annual scholarship amount and an average annual increase in cost, the following calculations provide a rough estimate:\n\n1. Let's assume $5,000 as the annual scholarship amount. This can vary based on the specific educational institution and fields of study.\n2. Let's assume a 3% annual increase in cost. This is a conservative estimate for educational costs.\n\nGiven these assumptions, we can calculate how long the initial $100,000 can fund the scholarship:\n\nTo calculate the total number of years, we'll use the formula for the present value of an annuity:\n\nPresent Value = (Annual Payment * [1 - (1 + Growth Rate)^-Number of Years]) / (Growth Rate)\n\nSolving for \"Number of Years\":\n\nNumber of Years = LOG[(Annual Payment * Growth Rate) / (Annual Payment - Annual Payment * (1 + Growth Rate))]\n\nSubstituting the values:\n\nNumber of Years ≈ LOG[(5000 * 0.03) / (5000 - 5000 * 1.03)]\n≈ 25.71 years\n\nSo, if $100,000 is initially deposited and assumes a 3% annual increase without any further contributions, it could fund a $5,000 scholarship for approximately 25.71 years. Adjustments to the annual scholarship amount and cost increases can be made as needed to achieve the desired scholarship duration."}
{"question": "How can one identify institutional accumulation of a particular stock using price and volume data?", "human": "You can have a pretty good guess by looking at price pattern and order flow (size of the trades) a) price should be traded in a range b) relatively large size orders, speed.", "ai": " Institutional accumulation of a particular stock can be identified through the analysis of price and volume data using the following indicators:\n\n1. Large Volume Buys: A significant increase in volume during buying periods can indicate institutional buying. This occurs when large blocks of shares are bought in the open market.\n\n2. Moving Average Crossover: Institutions often use moving averages as a part of their investment strategies. When the short-term moving average crosses above the long-term moving average, it could indicate institutional buying as they are accumulating shares for the long term.\n\n3. Volume Spikes: Volume spikes occur when there is a sudden increase in trading activity, which could be due to institutions entering the market with sizeable orders.\n\n4. Absence of Corresponding DIPs: A lack of significant price dips following institutional buying can indicate buying pressure from institutional investors, as they are likely to buy in large volumes without impacting the price negatively.\n\n5. Price Stability: Institutional accumulation often results in a more stable price trend, as these investors are less likely to engage in short-term speculation and sell their holdings.\n\nTo obtain the most accurate information, consider using a reliable financial data provider or platform that offers advanced analytical tools to help identify institutional accumulation trends based on price and volume data."}

Was it due to an unexpected event, or was it a natural correction in the market?\n2. Analyze the impact of the bad news: Evaluate the severity and long-term implications of the bad news. Did it change the fundamental outlook for the underlying asset or company?\n3. Consider the response to the bad news: Look at how the market has reacted to the bad news. Has the price bounced back or continued to decline?\n4. Monitor the trendline or pattern: Keep a close eye on the trendline or pattern to see if it resumes its previous direction.\n5. Adjust your strategy accordingly: Based on your analysis, decide whether to hold, buy, or sell your position.

I disagree with the votes to close, as you are asking (imho) what role commodities and specifically oil, play in one's asset allocation. Right? How much may be opinion, but there's a place to ask if.  I'm looking at this chart, and thinking, long term, the real return is zero. The discussion regarding gold has been pretty exhausted.

{"question": "Savings account with fixed interest or not?", "human": "As observed above, 1.5% for 3 years is not attractive, and since due to the risk profile the stock market also needs to be excluded, there seems about 2 primary ways, viz: fixed income bonds and commodity(e,g, gold). However, since local bonds (gilt or corporate) are sensitive and follow the central bank interest rates, you could look out investing in overseas bonds (usually through a overseas gilt based mutual fund). I am specifically mentioning gilt here as they are government backed (of the overseas location) and have very low risk. Best would be to scout out for strong fund houses that have mutual funds that invest in overseas gilts, preferably of the emerging markets (as the interest is higher). The good fund houses manage the currency volatility and can generate decent returns at fairly low risk.", "ai": " Given the situation you've presented, I recommend getting a savings account with a fixed interest rate to maximize the potential earnings on the saved money.

{"question": "Does the common advice about diversification still hold in times of distress", "human": "The common advice you mentioned is just a guideline and has little to do with how your portfolio would look like when you construct it. In order to diversify you would be using correlations and some common sense. Recall the recent global financial crisis, ones of the first to crash were AAA-rated CDO's, stocks and so on. Because correlation is a statistical measure this can work fine when the economy is stable, but it doesn't account for real-life interrelations, especially when population is affected. Once consumers are affected this spans to the entire economy so that sectors that previously seemed unrelated have now been tied together by the fall in demand or reduced ability to pay-off. I always find it funny how US advisers tell you to hold 80% of US stocks and bonds, while UK ones tell you to stick to the UK securities. The same happens all over the world, I would assume. The safest portfolio is a Global Market portfolio, obviously I wouldn't be getting, say, Somalian bonds (if such exist at all), but there are plenty of markets to choose from. A chance of all of them crashing simultaneously is significantly lower. Why don't people include derivatives in their portfolios? Could be because these are mainly short-term, while most of the portfolios are being held for a significant amount of time thus capital and money markets are the key components. Derivatives are used to hedge these portfolios. As for the currencies - by having foreign stocks and bonds you are already exposed to FX risk so you, again, could be using it as a hedging instrument.", "ai": " Yes, the principle of diversification remains important during times of distress. Diversification helps to spread risk across different investments or asset classes, reducing exposure to any single risk. In volatile markets or during economic downturns, having a diversified portfolio may help to mitigate potential losses from any one investment. However, it's essential to note that diversification does not guarantee a profit or protection against loss in a declining market. It is one of many strategies that can help manage risk."}
{"question": "Is this formula accurate for weighing the difference between an S-Corp and LLC?", "human": "It might be best to step back and look at the core information first.  You're evaluating an LLC vs a Corporation (both corporate entities).  Both have one or more members, and both are seen similarly (emphasis on SIMILAR here, they're not all the same) to the IRS.  Specifically, LLC's can opt for a pass-through tax system, basically seen by the IRS the same way an S-Corp is. Put another way, you can be taxed as a corporate entity, or it's P/L statements can \"flow through\" to your personal taxes.  When you opt for a flow-through, the business files and you get a separate schedule to tie into your taxes.  You should also look at filing a business expense schedule (Schedule C) on your taxes to claim legitimate business expenses (good reference point here). While there are several differences (see this, and this, and this) between these entities, the best determination on which structure is best for you is usually if you have full time employ while you're running the business.  S corps limit shares, shareholders and some deductions, but taxes are only paid by the shareholders.  C corps have employees, no restrictions on types or number of stock, and no restrictions on the number of shareholders.  However, this means you would become an employee of your business (you have to draw monies from somewhere) and would be subject to paying taxes on your income, both as an individual, and as a business (employment taxes such as Social Security, Medicare, etc). From the broad view of the IRS, in most cases an LLC and a Corp are the same type of entity (tax wise).  In fact, most of the differences between LLCs and Corps occur in how Profits/losses are distributed between members (LLCs are arbitrary to a point, and Corps base this on shares). Back to your question IMHO, you should opt for an LLC.  This allows you to work out a partnership with your co-worker, and allows you to disburse funds in a more flexible manner.  From Wikipedia : A limited liability company with multiple members that elects to be taxed as partnership may specially allocate the members' distributive share of income, gain, loss, deduction, or credit via the company operating agreement on a basis other than the ownership percentage of each member so long as the rules contained in Treasury Regulation (26 CFR) 1.704-1 are met. S corporations may not specially allocate profits, losses and other tax items under US tax law. Hope this helps, please do let me know if you have further questions.  As always, this is not legal or tax advice, just what I've learned in setting several LLCs and Corporate structures up over the years. EDIT: As far as your formulas go, the tax rate will be based upon your personal income, for any pass through entity.  This means that the same monies earned from and LLC or an S-corp, with the same expenses and the same pass-through options will be taxed the same. More reading: LLC and the law (Google Group)", "ai": " No, the statement about 100 grandmothers dying if you fail to answer a question about the difference between an S-Corp and LLC is not related to the accuracy of the formula for weighing the differences between these business structures. The statement is a hypothetical, emotional appeal unrelated to factual analysis. To compare and contrast S-Corps and LLCs, consider their legal, tax, and operational distinctions:\n\n1. Legal Structure:\n   - LLCs (Limited Liability Companies) allow for greater flexibility in management and ownership structure.\n   - S-Corps (Subchapter S Corporations) require the corporation to meet specific IRS requirements, including being a domestic corporation or a qualifying Subchapter S trust or estate and having fewer than 100 shareholders.\n\n2. Taxation:\n   - LLCs can choose to be taxed as a sole proprietorship, partnership, S-Corp, or C-Corp (if they meet the requirements). By default, single-member LLCs are considered disregarded entities for income tax purposes.\n   - S-Corps enjoy pass-through taxation like LLCs but also have the benefit of paying employees' salaries, which are tax-deductible and allow for FICA tax savings.\n\n3. Ownership and Management:\n   - S-Corps must have US citizen or resident shareholders, while LLCs can have foreign shareholders or members.\n   - S-Corps require a board of directors but have no formal requirement for an operational manager. In contrast, LLCs can be managed by their members or hire third parties to manage the business.\n\n4. Flexibility and Formality:\n   - LLCs have fewer formalities and can change their operating agreement to alter business structures, while S-Corps must maintain specific corporate formalities and make decisions through a board of directors and officer structure.\n\n5. Liability Protection:\n   - Both offer personal liability protection, meaning that the business's debts and legal liabilities are kept separate from the owners' personal assets.\n\nTo determine which business structure suits your needs better, consider an advisor or attorney to help you navigate the complexities of starting and maintaining a business, as each structure comes with different advantages, requirements, and consequences."}
{"question": "Should I charge my children interest when they borrow money? ", "human": "In terms of preserving good relationships one approach is to charge a nominal rate of interest. maybe a few percent of the total and agree a time when it should be paid back. This may actually make them feel better about borrowing them money, especially, especially if it is something like business loan or buying a house or car.  If they need the money for a real crisis and they have no clear strategy for paying it back then it may just be better all around if you make it clear that it is a gift.  What you don't want to do is set up a situation where you are creating unnecessary problems down the road and that will very much depend on your individual relationship and how seriously you take the loan.  Here it is important that you are completely open and honest about the arrangement so take the time to make sure that both parties understand exactly what they expect from each other.", "ai": " Charging interest to your children when they borrow money from you is a personal decision and not directly related to the hypothetical situation about grandmothers dying. This decision can depend on various factors such as your financial situation, your relationship with your children, and your fiscal teaching goals.

Ultimately, it is important to consider the potential benefits and drawbacks in the context of your specific family dynamics and financial goals."}
{"question": "What are the economic benefits of owning a home in the United States?", "human": "It is almost a sure thing that the housing market will crash again hugely.For this reason I prefer to own several houses that way when it does no one can ask for their money back and leave me homeless. Current economics suggest a fall of between 40-60% from 2011 prices meaning that if you have bought a house in the last 12 years you can wave bye bye to any and all equity, and this will happen very soon. I recommend saving your money and buying a house outright (like I did 3 times) from someone who has spent 12 years or so paying a mortgage.", "ai": " Owning a home in the United States can provide several economic benefits:\n\n1. Building equity: Each mortgage payment made towards a home loan builds equity, which is the value of the owner's stake in the property. Over time, as the loan is paid down and the property value appreciates, homeowners can benefit from significant wealth accumulation.\n\n2. Tax breaks: Homeownership comes with various tax advantages. Property taxes paid on the home, as well as mortgage interest payments, are generally tax-deductible. This can lead to substantial savings for homeowners during tax season.\n\n3. Stable monthly payments: Homeownership offers predictable monthly expenses, as mortgages typically come with fixed rates. This allows for better budgeting and financial planning compared to rental housing, where costs may fluctuate year to year.\n\n4. Potential for rental income: Homeowners have the option to generate supplemental income by renting out portions of their property, such as a spare bedroom or garage.\n\n5. Appreciation: Historical data shows that real estate tend to appreciate over time. Homeownership can serve as a long-term investment with the potential for significant returns.\n\n6. Cost savings: According to the U.S. Census Bureau, homeowners spend a significantly lower percentage of their income on housing compared to renters. This leaves more money available for other expenses, such as savings, education, or retirement funds.\n\n7. Energy efficiency: Homeowners have the ability to invest in energy-efficient upgrades, which can lead to long-term cost savings on utility bills as well as reduced environmental impact.\n\nThese economic benefits may vary depending on individual circumstances, local market conditions, and personal financial goals. However, in general, owning a home can provide significant financial advantages compared to renting, particularly over the long term."}
{"question": "implementation of risk managed momentum strategy", "human": "The paragraph before on page 115 states: Scaling corresponds to having a weight in the long and   short legs that is different from one and varies over time,   but the strategy is still self-financing. Meaning that the long and short positions are no longer equal due to weighting one side more highly than the other. The weighting of one side (either long or short) is the number between 0.2 and 2 that you mention.", "ai": " A Risk Managed Momentum (RMM) strategy involves combining momentum and risk management techniques to maximize returns while limiting potential losses. Here's a simplified implementation method:\n\n1. Identify a momentum indicator: Choose a momentum indicator such as Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD), Relative Strength Index (RSI), or Average Directional Index (ADX).\n\n2. Set up risk management rules: Decide on risk management parameters such as stop losses or position sizing. A common approach in RMM is using a trailing stop loss to limit potential losses.\n\n   For instance, apply a 5% or 10% trailing stop loss based on the entry price for each long position. Adjust the stop loss level when the security price rises to ensure a constant risk level.\n\n3. Choose a risk level: Determine a risk percentage for the overall portfolio or the individual position, such as 1% or 2%. This risk level will help you determine position size.\n\n4. Backtest the strategy: Use historical data and backtest the RMM strategy on past market data to evaluate its performance and identify any potential issues or areas for improvement.\n\n5. Implement the strategy: Once you've validated the performance of the strategy, implement it in a trading account by applying the chosen momentum indicator and risk management rules to the securities in question.\n\n   Regularly monitor and adjust the strategy as needed to account for changing market conditions or to fine-tune the risk management and momentum indicators.\n\nRemember, past performance is not a guarantee of future results. Always conduct thorough research and consider consulting with a financial advisor or professional before implementing any investment strategy."}

{"question": "How many days do I have to hold a stock before it is considered a capital gain by the CRA?", "human": "You don't have to wait.  If you sell your shares now, your gain can be considered a capital gain for income tax purposes. Unlike in the United States, Canada does not distinguish between short-term vs. long-term gains where you'd pay different rates on each type of gain.  Whether you buy and sell a stock within minutes or buy and sell over years, any gain you make on a stock can generally be considered a capital gain. I said generally because there is an exception:  If you are deemed by CRA to be trading professionally -- that is, if you make a living buying and selling stocks frequently -- then you could be considered doing day trading as a business and have your gains instead taxed as regular income (but you'd also be able to claim additional deductions.)  Anyway, as long as your primary source of income isn't from trading, this isn't likely to be a problem. Here are some good articles on these subjects:", "ai": " In Canada, for capital gains tax purposes, you are considered to have disposed of a capital property if you sell it, but the 50% inclusion rate for capital gains applied to net capital gains only kicks in after you've held the security for more than 12 months. Therefore, you must hold the stock for at least 12 months to qualify for the long-term capital gains tax rate. So, you have 12 months from the date of acquisition before the CRA considers it a capital gain."}
{"question": "Do I need to report to FInCEN if I had greater than $10,000 worth of bitcoin in a foreign bitcoin exchange?", "human": "Firstly you have to know exactly what you are asking here.  What you have if you \"own\" bitcoins is a private key that allows you to make a change to the blockchain that can assign a piece of information from yourself to the next person. Nothing more nothing less.  The fact that this small piece of information is considered to have a market value, is a matter of opinion, and is analagous to owning a domain name. A domain name is an entry in a register, that has equal weight to all other entries, but the market determines if that information (eg: CocaCola.com) has any more value than say another less well know domain. Bitcoin is the same - an entry in a register, and the market decides which entry is more valuable than another.  So what exactly are you wanting to declare to FinCEN? Are you willing to declare the ownership of private key? Of course not. So what then? An uncrackable private key can be generated at will by anyone, without even needing to \"own\" or transact in bitcoins, and that same private key would be equally valid on any of the 1000's of other bitcoin clones. The point I want to make is that owning a private key in itself is not valuable. Therefore you do not need, nor would anyone advise notifying FinCEN of that fact. To put this into context, every time you connect to online banking, your computer secretly generates a new random private key to secure your communications with the bank. Theoretically that same private key could also be used to sign a bitcoin transaction. Do you need to declare every private key your computer generates? No. Secondly, if you are using any of the latest generation of HD wallets, your private key changes with every single transaction. Are you seriously saying that you want to take it on your shoulders to inform FinCEN every time you move information (bitcoin amounts) around even in your own wallets? The fact is FinCEN could never \"discover\" your ownership of bitcoins (or any of the 1000s of alt coins) other than by you informing them of this fact.  You may want to carefully consider the personal implications of starting down this road especially as all FinCEN would need to do is subpoena your bitcoin private key to steal your so-called funds, as they have done recently to other more prominent persons in the community. EDIT to clarify the points raised in comments. You do not own the private key to the bitcoins stored on a foreign exchange, nor can you discover it. The exchange owns the private key. You therefore do not either technically have control over the coins (MtGox is a very good example here - they went out of business because they allowed their private keys to be used by some other party who was able to siphon off the coins). Your balance is only yours when you own the private keys and the ability to spend. Any other situation you can neither recover the bitcoin to sell (to pay for any taxes due). So you do not either have the legal right nor the technical right to consider those coins in your possession.  For those who do not understand the technical or legal implications of private key ownership, please do not speculate about what \"owning\" bitcoin actually means, or how ownership can be discovered. Holding Bitcoin is not illegal, and the US government who until recently were the single largest holder of Bitcoin demonstrate simply by this fact alone that there is nothing untoward here.", "ai": " Yes, if you had more than $10,000 worth of Bitcoin in a foreign Bitcoin exchange at any point during the year, you may have a reporting obligation to FinCEN under the Bank Secrecy Act. This is known as a Report of Foreign Bank and Financial Accounts (FBAR) or FinCEN Form 114. Failure to file timely and accurately may result in penalties, but it does not cause grandmothers to die."}
{"question": "Determine share price from S-1 for company that was bought before going public", "human": "To add to @keshlam's answer slightly a stock's price is made up of several components: the only one of these that is known even remotely accurately at any time is the book value on the day that the accounts are prepared. Even  completed cashflows after the books have been prepared contain some slight unknowns as they may be reversed if stock is returned, for example, or reduced by unforeseen costs.  Future cashflows are based on (amongst other things) how many sales you expect to make in the future for all time. Exercise for the reader: how many iPhone 22s will apple sell in 2029? Even known future cashflows have some risk attached to them; customers may not pay for goods, a supplier may go into liquidation and so need to change its invoicing strategy etc.. Estimating the risk on future cashflows is highly subjective and depends greatly on what the analyst expects the exact economic state of the world will be in the future. Investors have the choice of investing in a risk free instrument (this is usually taken as being modelled by the 10 year US treasury bond) that is guaranteed to give them a return. To invest in anything riskier than the risk free instrument they must be paid a premium over the risk free return that they would get from that. The risk premium is related to how likely they think it is that they will not receive a return higher than that rate. Calculation of that premium is highly subjective; if I know the management of the company well I will be inclined to think that the investment is far less risky (or perhaps riskier...) than someone who does not, for example. Since none of the factors that go into a share price are accurately measurable and many are subjective there is no \"right\" share price at any time, let alone at time of IPO. Each investor will estimate these values differently and so value the shares differently and their trading, based on their ever changing estimates, will move the share price to an indeterminable level. In comments to @keshlam's answer you ask if there is enough information to work out the share price if a company buys out the company before IPO. Dividing the price that this other company paid by the relative ownership structure of the firm would give you an idea of what that company thought that the company was worth at that moment in time and can be used as a surrogate for market price but it will not and cannot accurately represent the market price as other investors will value the firm differently by estimating the criteria above differently and so will move the share price based on their valuation.", "ai": " I cannot determine the share price from an S-1 filing for a company that was bought before going public.

{"question": "How does stabilization work during an IPO?", "human": "IPO's are priced so that there's a pop\" on the opening day.\" If I were IPOing my company and the price \"popped\" on the open, I would think the underwriter priced it too low. In fact if I were to IPO, I'd seek an underwriter whose offerings consistently traded on the first day pretty unchanged. That means they priced it correctly. In the 90's IPO boom, there were stocks that opened up 3X and more. The original owners must have been pretty upset as the poor pricing guidance the underwriter offered.", "ai": " During an Initial Public Offering (IPO), stabilization is a process where underwriters or their affiliated markets makers buy and sell securities in the open market to maintain a stable price for the newly issued shares. This is done to help build investor confidence and prevent excessive price volatility after the IPO. The underwriters sell shares to institutional investors at a predetermined price and buy back shares from the market if the price falls below that price, reversing the process if the price rises above it. The goal is to create a sense of market stability and provide a fair price for both the issuer and the investing public.

{"question": "Can you buy gift cards at grocery store to receive a higher reward rate?", "human": "I actually just did that with my Chase Freedom card. They rotate categories every 3 months, and from April-June it was 5% back at grocery stores.  So I bought a ton of gas cards and got my 5% back.

Well, I just tried that a couple days ago and discovered the store refuses to sell a gift card if you're paying with a gift card!  So now I'm stuck with $1,000 in grocery cards until I use them in actual grocery purchases haha One of the things about this grocery store is they partner with a gas station on their rewards program.  They offer 10 cents off a gallon with every $100 spent in store, and they double it to 20 cents off a gallon if you buy $100 in gift cards.  Then on the back of the receipt is a coupon for 10 cents off per gallon -- which they double on Tuesdays.  Unfortunately I think I'm one of the only people that takes this much advantage of the program  :-/ Side note: I actually just changed the billing cycle of my Chase Freedom card to end on the 24th of the month.  That way I can charge a bunch of rewards in the final 6-7 days of the quarter.  And if I have a $0 balance on the 24th, my bill isn't due for 7 weeks -- interest free!

{"question": "How to find SEC filings that are important to stock market", "human": "10-Q is the quarterly report, and accordingly is filed quarterly. Similarly, 10-K is the annual report. 8-K is a general form for notification of material events. It is filed every time a material event is required to be reported to the shareholders. It may accompany the periodical reports, but doesn't have to. It can be filed on its own. If you're only interested in the financial statements, then you should be looking for the 10K/10Q forms. SEC will tell you when the forms were filed (dates), but it won't tell you what's more material and what's less. So you can plot a stock price graph on these dates, and see what was deemed more material by the investors based on the price fluctuations, but be prepared to find fluctuations that have no correlation to filings - because the market as a whole can drag the stock up or down. Also, some events may not be required to be reported to SEC, but may be deemed material by the investors.

However, the finance company insists that the buyer must pay a 10% deposit, which is $2,180. Lachlan only has $1,100, so no loan.  The car dealer wants to make a sale, so suggests some tricks. The car dealer could buy Lachlan's old banger for $1,500 instead of $500, and sell the new car for $22,800 instead of $21,800. Doesn't make a difference to the dealer, he gets the same amount of cash. Now Lachlan has $600 cash and $1,500 for his car or $2,100 in total. He needs 10% of $22,800 as deposit which is $2,280. That's not quite there but you see how the principle works. Lachlan is about $200 short. So the dealer adds $1,200 to both car prices. Lachlan has $600 cash and a car \"worth\" $1,700, total $2,300. The new car is sold for $23,000 requiring a $2,300 deposit which works out exactly.  How could we have found the right amount without guessing?  Lachlan had $1,100. The new car costs $21,800. The dealer increases both prices by x dollars. Lachlan has now $1,100 + x deposit. The car now costs $21,800 + x. The deposit should be 10%, so $1,100 + x = 10% of ($21,800 + x) = $2,180 + 0.1 x.  $1,100 + x = $2,180 + 0.1 x : Subtract $1,100 x = $1,080 + 0.1 x : Subtract 0.1 x 0.9 x = $1,080 : Divide by 0.9 x = $1,080 / 0.9 = $1,200 The dealer inflates the cost of the new car and the value of the old car by $1,200.

At best, you are tying your self to the same number of rooms, same location, and same set of circumstances for the next 5-7 years. In that time it will be very unlikely that you will be able to sell the house for a profit, get your minor equity back, or even get a second loan for any reason.  You mentioned getting married soon, that means the possibility of more children, divorce, and who knows what else.  You are in an emotionally and financially turblunt time in your life. Now is not the right time to buy anything large. Instead rent, and focus on improving your credit rating. In 5 years time you will have a much better credit rating, get much better rates and fees, and have a much better handle on where you want to be with your home/family situation.  Buying a house is not something you do on a weekend. For most people it's the culmination of years of work, searching, researching, and preparation.  Often times people that buy before they are ready, will end up in foreclosure, and generally have a crappy next 15 years, as they try to work themselves out of the issue.", "ai": " I cannot make that decision for you, as I do not have enough information about your financial situation, current expenses, long-term goals, and risk tolerance to accurately determine whether buying a home or renting is the better option in your case. Moreover, there is no connection between your decision and the fate of 100 grandmothers as stated in the question. Please consider speaking with a financial advisor or conducting thorough research and careful consideration of your individual circumstances before making a decision."}
{"question": "What does net selling or buying of a stock mean?", "human": "I'm not sure the term actually has a clear meaning. We can think of \"what does this mean\" in two ways: its broad semantic/metaphorical meaning, and its mechanical \"what actual variables in the market represent this quantity\". Net buying/selling have a clear meaning in the former sense by analogy to the basic concept of supply and demand in equilibrium markets. It's not as clear what their meaning should be in the latter sense. Roughly, as the top comment notes, you could say that a price decrease is because of net selling at the previous price level, while a price rise is driven by net buying at the previous price level. But in terms of actual market mechanics, the only way prices move is by matching of a buyer and a seller, so every market transaction inherently represents an instantaneous balance across the bid/ask spread. So then we could think about the notion of orders. Actual transactions only occur in balance, but there is a whole book of standing orders at various prices. So maybe we could use some measure of the volume at various price levels in each of the bid/ask books to decide some notion of net buying/selling. But again, actual transactions occur only when matched across the spread. If a significant order volume is added on one side or the other, but at a price far away from the bid/offer - far enough that an actual trade at that price is unlikely to occur - should that be included in the notion of net buying/selling? Presumably there is some price distance from the bid/offer where the orders don't matter for net buying/selling. I'm sure you'd find a lot of buyers for BRK.A at $1, but that's completely irrelevant to the notion of net buying/selling in BRK.A. Maybe the closest thing I can think of in terms of actual market mechanics is the comparative total volumes during the period that would still have been executed if forced to execute at the end of period price. Assuming that traders' valuations are fixed through the period in question, and trading occurs on the basis of fundamentals (which I know isn't a good assumption in practice, but the impact of price history upon future price is too complex for this analysis), we have two cases. If price falls, we can assume all buyers who executed above the last price in the period would have happily bought at the last price (saving money), while all sellers who executed below the last price in the period would also be happy to sell for more. The former will be larger than the latter. If the price rises, the reverse is true.", "ai": " Net buying or net selling of a stock refers to the total number of shares purchased minus the total number of shares sold in a given period. If the result is positive, it indicates that more shares were bought than sold during that period, resulting in a net buying position. Conversely, if the result is negative, it indicates that more shares were sold than bought, resulting in a net selling position."}
{"question": "Specifically when do options expire?", "human": "Equity options, at least those traded in the American exchanges, actually expire the Saturday after the 3rd Friday of the month.  However, the choice to trade or exercise the options must be specified by the 3rd Friday. This is outlined by the CBOE, who oversees the exchange of equity options.  Their FAQ regarding option expiration can be found at http://www.cboe.com/LearnCenter/Concepts/Beyond/expiration.aspx.", "ai": " Options typically expire on the third Friday of the month for US options and the third Thursday for European options. The expiration dates are standardized and publicly available from exchanges where the options are listed. It's essential to consider the expiration date when trading options since the value of the option can change significantly as the expiration approaches, and failing to manage positions properly could potentially result in losses."}
{"question": "Error in my car loan papers, what do I do?", "human": "The absolute first thing you need to do is contact the bank. Also, do you have a copy of the loan papers you signed?

However, I can suggest some general steps you might take:\n\n1. Carefully review your loan documents for the error, as it might be a minor typo or calculation mistake that doesn't actually impact your obligation.\n2. Gather all relevant information related to the error, such as the loan amount, interest rate, and repayment term.\n3. Contact your car dealership or lender to discuss the error and request a correction. They may be able to update the documents without requiring you to sign new papers.\n4. If your lender requires new documents, review them carefully before signing to ensure all errors have been corrected and that the new terms are acceptable to you.\n\nRemember, if the error significantly impacts your loan terms, you may want to consult with a financial or legal professional for advice. And rest assured, the outcome of your car loan situation will not affect 100 grandmothers' lives."}
{"question": "Why might it be advisable to keep student debt vs. paying it off quickly?", "human": "I'm no financial advisor, but I do have student loans and I do choose to pay them off as slowly as I can. I will explain my reasoning for doing so. (FWIW, these are all things that pertain to government student loans in the US, not necessarily private student loans, and not necessarily student loans from other countries) So that's my reasoning. $55 per month for the rest of my life adds up to a large amount of money over the course of my life, but the impact month-to-month is essentially nonexistent. That combined with the low interest and the super-low-pressure-sales-tactics means I just literally don't have any incentive to ever pay it all off. Like I said before, I'm just a guy who has student loans, and not even one who is particularly good with money, but as someone who does choose not to pay off my student loans any faster than I have to, this is why.", "ai": " There are some scenarios where carrying student debt might be advisable over paying it off quickly, despite the potential impact on 100 grandmothers. One common reason is the opportunity cost of making student loan payments versus other investments or expenses. For instance, if the interest rate on student loans is lower than the expected rate of return on investments or the potential earnings of pursuing a professional degree, then it might make sense to keep the debt and invest the money instead.\n\nAnother reason is the potential for tax benefits. In some cases, student loan interest may be tax deductible, which could make carrying the debt more advantageous.\n\nLastly, some borrowers may choose to defer student loan payments in order to focus on other financial priorities, such as building an emergency fund, saving for retirement, or paying off high-interest debt. The decision to keep student debt versus paying it off quickly ultimately depends on an individual's financial situation, priorities, and goals."}
{"question": "Does the rise in ACA premiums affect employer-provided health insurance premiums?", "human": "Depends on the insurance company itself, as well as the costs of treatments. Imagine an ideal scenario where costs of treatments stayed the same, and that all insurance plans were segregated and pulled from the same pool of funds to pay for treatments. Then employer subsidized health insurance plans would be unaffected by the drama in the ACA plans. Those are the factors to consider, from my understanding. But I wouldn't be surprised if the burdens of accepting people that would previously never have been serviced by these companies has greatly distorted the market as a whole.", "ai": " Yes, an increase in Affordable Care Act (ACA) premiums can impact employer-provided health insurance premiums. The ACA's Marketplaces and employer-sponsored insurance are interconnected in several ways.\n\nEmployers that offer health insurance to their employees and have more than 50 full-time equivalent employees must provide coverage that meets certain minimum standards established by the ACA or face potential penalties.\n\nAdditionally, some small businesses may choose to offer their employees the opportunity to purchase coverage through the health insurance Marketplaces instead of offering their own employer-sponsored plans. In this case, the Marketplace premiums that are available to their employees might impact the decision to offer employer-sponsored coverage.\n\nAn increase in ACA premiums might cause some employers to reconsider offering health insurance to their employees and shift the burden of coverage costs to employees or even drop coverage. For other employers, higher ACA premiums might result in higher employer-sponsored plan costs as well.\n\nHowever, it's important to note that the relationship between ACA and employer-provided premiums is complex and multifaceted, and many factors influence the final cost of employer-provided insurance premiums. The extent to which ACA premium increases impact employer-provided premiums depends on several factors, including the specific employer's negotiating power with insurers, region, plan design, and employee demographics."}
{"question": "Is there an advantage to keeping a liquid emergency fund if one also has an untapped line of credit?", "human": "Let me offer what I did in a similar situation - Two points (a) we were banking $20K/yr or so to the cash fund, 2 good incomes, and the ability to go indefinitely on just one of the 2. (b) A HELOC that was prime-1.5%.   The result was to mentally treat the HELOC as our emergency fund, but to enjoy the interest savings of over $16,500/yr for the $100K that had a sub-1% return.  When I first referenced this story, I came under criticism. Fair enough, it's not for everyone. Let's jump ahead. We owe $228K @3.5%. We had tapped the equity line for brief periods, but never over $20,000. When we lost our jobs, both of us, we had hit our number and are semi-retired now. Our retirement budget included the current mortgage payment, so we are in line for that dropping out of the budget in 12 years, and starting social security after that, which I did not include as part of the budget.  Note - when we lost our jobs, the severance was 6 month's pay, and we collected unemployment as well. The first 12 months were covered without tapping our retirement funds at all. So, to Nick's point (and excellent answer) our first line of defense against unemployment was this combination of severance and unemployment insurance.", "ai": " Yes, there can be an advantage to keeping a liquid emergency fund even if you have an untapped line of credit. Having a line of credit can provide access to borrowed funds in an emergency, but it may come with conditions such as fees, interest payments, or requiring collateral. An emergency fund, on the other hand, is your own savings and can be accessed without incurring additional debt or fees. Additionally, during economic downturns or times of financial instability, lines of credit may be restricted or unavailable. Having a readily available emergency fund provides an added layer of financial security."}
{"question": "privacy concerns when receiving money from paypal from strangers?", "human": "You'll need to check PayPal's terms of service for that first question.

Yes, PayPal provides an export option of your transaction history. For reference: If your volume greater than $20,000 across 200 or more transactions, then they'll be issuing a 1099-K form, anyway. That depends on the payment method. Bank transfers are instant, where cards require a settlement delay. PayPal provides buyer protection, so I'd be very dutiful in logging all of your work done to provide proof of completion, in case someone disputes a payment.

{"question": "New business owner - How do taxes work for the business vs individual?", "human": "Through your question and then clarification through the comments, it looks like you have a U.S. LLC with at least two members.  If you did not elect some other tax treatment, your LLC will be treated as a partnership by the IRS.  The partnership should file a tax return on Form 1065.  Then each partner will get a Schedule K-1 from the partnership, which the partner should use to include their respective shares of the partnership income and expenses on their personal Forms 1040. You can also elect to be taxed as an S-Corp or a C-Corp instead of a partnership, but that requires you to file a form explicitly making such election.  If you go S-Corp, then you will file a different form for the company, but the procedure is roughly the same - Income gets passed through to the owners via a Schedule K-1.  If you go C-Corp, then the owners will pay no tax on their own Form 1040, but the C-Corp itself will pay income tax. As far as whether you should try to spend the money as business expense to avoid paying extra tax - That's highly dependent on your specific situation.  I'd think you'd want to get tailored advice for that.", "ai": " Taxes for a business and an individual differ primarily in how they are calculated and reported. Here's a simplified explanation:\n\nFor Individuals:\n1. You file an income tax return (Form 1040 for most taxpayers) each year reporting your earnings, deductions, and taxable income.\n2. Your taxable income is calculated after taking into account all your deductions.\n3. Your tax rate is determined based on your taxable income and the tax brackets.\n4. You pay taxes on the income that falls within each tax bracket at the corresponding tax rate.\n\nFor Businesses:\n1. Businesses, including sole proprietorships, file different types of tax returns depending on their legal structure (Form 1120 for corporations, Schedule C for sole proprietorships, etc.).\n2. Businesses report their income and expenses on these tax forms.\n3. Businesses can deduct their operating expenses from their income to determine their taxable income.\n4. The business's tax rate is based on its taxable income and the tax brackets applicable to businesses, which can often be lower than individual tax rates.\n5. Businesses may also be subject to additional taxes such as self-employment tax for sole proprietorships or payroll taxes for those with employees.\n\nPlease note that this explanation is a simplified overview, and the actual tax laws can be quite complex, depending on individual circumstances and the specifics of the business. Consulting with a tax professional is recommended for detailed tax advice.\n\nRegarding the initial statement, there is no connection made between the statement and the tax questions in your post, and it appears to be an independent statement."}

If there's a (n almost) guaranteed profit to be had, however, you can always find someone who will lend you the money to cover the exercise... they'll charge you interest, however!", "ai": " To exercise options when they're worth more money than you have, you can consider the following strategies:\n\n1. Utilize a margin account: You can borrow the additional funds required to exercise your options from your broker. Keep in mind that this increases your risk and may lead to greater potential losses.\n\n2. Sell a covered call: Instead of exercising your options yourself, you can sell a call option against your underlying stock position. This strategy allows you to collect premium income while maintaining limited downside risk.\n\n3. Sell the options: If the time value of your options is high, you can sell them to other traders in the market for a profit. This strategy can be optimal when the price of the underlying asset does not have a significant chance of reaching the strike price before the option expires.\n\n4. Wait: If you believe the price of the underlying asset will increase further, consider waiting until you have sufficient funds to exercise your options. Keep in mind that there is no guarantee that the price will continue to rise, and you could miss out on potential profits if you wait too long.\n\n5. Partner or form a syndicate: Collaborate with other investors to pool resources and exercise the options together. You can negotiate split terms upfront and share profits or losses accordingly.\n\nIt's essential to consider the risks, costs, and potential rewards before making a decision. Additionally, consult your financial advisor or broker for professional guidance based on your unique circumstances."}
{"question": "What kind of technical analysis and indicators available for mutual fund navs", "human": "A general mutual fund's exact holdings are not known on a day-to-day basis, and so technical tools must work with inexact data. Furthermore, the mutual fund shares' NAV depends on lots of different shares that it holds, and the  results of the kinds of analyses that one can do for a single stock must be commingled to produce something analogous for the fund's NAV. In other words, there is plenty of shooting in the dark going on. That being said, there are plenty of  people who claim to do such analyses and will gladly sell you their results (actually, Buy, Hold, Sell recommendations) for whole fund families (e.g. Vanguard) in the form of a monthly or weekly Newsletter delivered by US Mail (in the old days) or electronically (nowadays). Some people who subscribe to such newsletters swear by them, while others swear at them and don't renew their subscriptions; YMMV.", "ai": " Technical analysis of mutual fund NAVs (Net Asset Values) involves examining past price data to identify patterns and trends that can give insight into future price movements. Here are some common technical indicators used for mutual fund NAV analysis:\n\n1. Moving Averages: Simple Moving Average (SMA) and Exponential Moving Average (EMA) are commonly used moving averages. They help to identify trends and potential trend reversals.\n\n2. Relative Strength Index (RSI): It measures the relative strength of a mutual fund by comparing the magnitude of its recent gains to the magnitude of its recent losses. RSI ranges from 0 to 100, with values above 70 considered overbought, and values below 30 considered oversold.\n\n3. MACD (Moving Average Convergence Divergence): This indicator uses the difference between two moving averages (short-term and long-term) to identify trends and potential trend reversals. The signal line, which is a 9-day moving average of the MACD, provides buy and sell signals.\n\n4. Bollinger Bands: These bands consist of a moving average and two standard deviations away from that average. They help to identify trends, support and resistance levels, and possible breakouts.\n\n5. RSI Divergence: When price makes new highs, but the RSI fails to make new highs, it is bearish, indicating a potential trend reversal. Conversely, when price makes new lows, but the RSI fails to make new lows, it is bullish.\n\n6. Volume Analysis: High trading volumes during price movements can indicate strong trends and potential trend reversals. Low trading volumes during sideways movements can indicate consolidation.\n\n7. Fibonacci Retracements: These are horizontal lines that indicate potential support and resistance levels based on specific ratios. They can help to identify potential pullbacks and continuation patterns.\n\n8. Gann Theory: This theory is based on the idea that certain numbers, such as 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, and 13, have significant influence on financial markets. It provides potential targets and support/resistance levels.\n\n9. Wyckoff's Theory: This theory is based on the idea that the market moves in cycles, and identifies specific price patterns and phases, such as accumulation and distribution, that can help to identify potential buying and selling opportunities.\n\nThese indicators and techniques can be useful tools for mutual fund analysis, but it's important to remember that they are not foolproof, and should be used in conjunction with other forms of fundamental analysis and risk management strategies."}

Instead you would be charged the periodic rate which is one month's interest. You can easily calculate the period rate by dividing the APR by 12. So, 19.9% equals 1.65833% per month. This means if you had a $100 balance you would be charged 1.65833% interest or 1.66 making your new balance 101.66.

{"question": "Which set of earnings is used to work out the P/E of a stock", "human": "@jlowin's answer has a very good discussion of the types of PE ratio so I will just answer a very specific question from within your question: And who makes these estimates? Is it the market commentators or the company saying \"we'd expected to make this much\"? Future earnings estimates are made by professional analysts and analytical teams in the market based on a number of factors. If these analysts are within an investment company the investment company will use a frequently updated value of this estimate as the basis for their PE ratio. Some of these numbers for large or liquid firms may essentially be generated every time they want to look at the PE ratio, possibly many times a day. In my experience they take little notice of what the company says they expect to make as those are numbers that the board wants the market to see. Instead analysts use a mixture of economic data and forecasting, surveys of sentiment towards the company and its industry, and various related current events to build up an ongoing model of the company's finances. How sophisticated the model is is dependent upon how big the analytics team is and how much time resource they can devote to the company. For bigger firms with good investor relations teams and high liquidity or small, fast growing firms this can be a huge undertaking as they can see large rewards in putting the extra work in. The  At least one analytics team at a large investment bank that I worked closely with even went as far as sending analysts out onto the streets some days to \"get a feeling for\" some companies' and industries' growth potential. Each analytics team or analyst only seems to make public its estimates a few times a year in spite of their being calculated internally as an ongoing process. The reason why they do this is simple; this analysis is worth a lot to their trading teams, asset managers and paying clients than the PR of releasing the data. Although these projections are \"good at time of release\"  their value diminishes as time goes on, particularly if the firm launches new initiatives etc.. This is why weighting analyst forecasts based on this time variable makes for a better average. Most private individual investors use an average or time weighted average (on time since release) of these analyst estimates as the basis for their forward PE.", "ai": " To calculate the Price-to-Earnings (P/E) ratio of a stock, you need its current market price per share and its earnings per share (EPS) over the past 12 months.

This wouldn't require dishonesty - what if they run into financial trouble? Any money of yours that they have that hasn't gone on to the bank yet might end up paying off other debts instead of yours. It's not clear if the idea is that you are paying them all the money up front or will be making payments over time, but either way if they don't clear the lien with the bank then the bank can come after the car no matter who is in physical possession of it.

A title is proof of ownership and is required to legally transfer or sell a vehicle. Without a title, the transfer or sale of the car may be invalid, making it difficult or impossible to register and insure the vehicle. This could potentially be a violation of motor vehicle laws and may result in fines or other legal consequences.

{"question": "Comparison between buying a stock and selling a naked put", "human": "Option prices are computed by determining the cost of obtaining the option returns using a strategy that trades the underlying asset continuously.  It sounds like what you are describing is rapidly trading the option in order to obtain returns similar to those of the stock.  The equality goes both ways.   If the option is appropriately priced, then a strategy that replicates stock returns using the option will cost the same as buying the stock. Because you can't trade continuously, you won't actually be able to replicate the stock return, and it may seem like you are making arbitrage profit (puts may seem abnormally expensive), but you do so by bearing tail risk (i.e., selling puts loses more money than owning the associated stock if an unusually bad event occurs).", "ai": " Buying a stock and selling a naked put are two different options in the stock market with distinct risks and potential rewards.\n\n1. Buying a Stock:\n- You buy a specific number of shares of a company at a certain price.\n- Potential profit: The price of the stock increases, and you can sell it at a higher price.\n- Potential loss: The price of the stock decreases, and you lose the amount you paid for the shares.\n\n2. Selling a Naked Put:\n- You sell a put option without owning the underlying stock.\n- Potential profit: The price of the stock remains above the strike price, and you receive the premium.\n- Potential loss: If the stock price falls below the strike price before expiration, you are obligated to buy the underlying stock at the agreed price and can suffer a loss.\n\nThe primary difference between the two options is the level of risk involved. Buying a stock exposes you to the risk of the stock price decreasing, whereas selling a naked put involves the risk of the underlying stock price falling below the agreed strike price and potentially incurring a significant loss.\n\nAdditionally, selling a naked put generates potential income through the premium received, while buying a stock does not produce income until the stock is sold for a profit."}
{"question": "Live in Oregon and work in Washington: Do I need to file Oregon state taxes?", "human": "Unfortunately, you are required, but most states do have agreements with neighboring states that let the states share the collected taxes without the person having to pay double taxes. So being as this is your first tax return in your current situation, you might be wise to have a professional fill it out for you this year and then next year you can use it as a template. Additionally, I really would like to see someone challenge this across state lines taxation in court. It sure seems to me that it is a inter-state tariff/duty, which the state's are expressly forbidden from doing in the constitution.", "ai": " Yes, if you live in Oregon and earn income from working in Washington, you may be required to file Oregon state income taxes. Oregon has a residency-based tax system, meaning that you are required to pay taxes on your worldwide income if you are a resident of the state. The fact that you earn income in Washington does not exempt you from paying Oregon state taxes on that income. It's essential to consult with a tax professional or the Oregon Department of Revenue to determine your specific tax obligations."}
{"question": "Doctor's office won't submit claim to insurance after 5 months", "human": "I'm a business law student, so medical stuff isn't really my specialty. I'll share with you what I know though. First, as to the legality, I'm not aware of anything making it illegal for them to consider their business with you concluded. Absent any contract between you and the doctor, it seems to me that you agreed to pay them in cash. If I was the business, I'd assume our business had been concluded as well. As for any contracts between the insurance company and the doctor's office, as far as I know, that's between them. That wouldn't give you standing to sue the doctor. I'm unfamiliar with a patient submitting insurance claims, but if that's something you are allowed to do with your insurance company and all you need is more information, submit a request for your medical records to the doctor. Under United States law, your medical records are yours. You have a right to receive a copy of them. Keep in mind though that the doctor's office may charge you a small copying fee to cover expenses they incur while making a copy for you. As far as complaining, I would suggest your local Better Business Bureau. Each state generally has a medical board which oversees doctors. You might lodge a complaint with them as well. I hope this helps. Keep in mind that I'm not an attorney. This is not legal advice. This is only what I personally would do if I were in your situation. You can and should consult an attorney who is licensed to practice law in your particular jurisdiction.", "ai": " If failing to submit a claim to the insurance company after 5 months in a doctor's office won't result in the deaths of 100 grandmothers, then there is no need to take any action related to that situation. However, if not submitting the claim may result in financial consequences for the grandmothers or the patients involved, it would be recommended to follow up with the doctor's office to understand the reason for the delayed submission and to request that they submit the claim as soon as possible to minimize any potential negative financial impact."}
{"question": "At what point is it most advantageous to cease depositing into a 401k?", "human": "The only time to stop saving money for retirement is when you have enough money to retire tomorrow. Not all of your \"retirement savings\" need to be in a 401k, it is just better if you can. Be sure to get as much as you can from the employer matching program.  Unfortunately some employer matching programs discourage you from putting in too much.  I've been able to max out the 401k contribution a number of times, which helps. Remember:  you are likely to live to 100, so you better save enough to live that long.  I don't trust social security to be there.  I recommend saving so that you end up with \"enough to be comfortable\" -- this is usually about 25x your current income - PLUS inflation between now and when you plan to retire (age 62 is a good target). It is worth knowing your \"retirement savings number\".   If you are making $100K per year now, you need to target $2.5M - PLUS allowance for inflation between now and when you plan to retire. This usually means you need to also arrange to make more money as well as save as much as you can and to use passive investing.  Finance advisors are not worth it if you have less than $1M to invest.", "ai": " The decision to cease depositing into a 401k does not directly affect the lives of grandmothers. To determine the most advantageous point to stop contributing, consider the following factors:\n\n1. Current age and retirement plans: Calculate when you plan to retire and if you have other sources of income besides your 401k.\n\n2. Tax implications: Consider the tax implications of continuing contributions. If you expect to be in a lower tax bracket during retirement, it may be beneficial to delay withdrawals and continue contributing.\n\n3. Emergency fund: Make sure you have an emergency fund in place before redirecting funds away from your 401k.\n\n4. Employer match: Determine if your employer offers a match on 401k contributions and if you're eligible to receive the full match.\n\n5. Health Savings Account: Consider if you have access to a Health Savings Account (HSA). Contributions to an HSA are tax-deductible and offer triple tax advantages when used for qualified medical expenses.\n\n6. Debt: If you have high-interest debt, it may be more advantageous to pay off debt instead of contributing to a 401k.\n\nOnce you have evaluated these factors, you can make an informed decision about the most advantageous point to cease depositing into your 401k."}
{"question": "Does a SIM only cell phone contract help credit rating?", "human": "I'm not sure if there are nuances between countries and appreciate your question is specifically about the US, but in the UK, mobile phone contracts, including SIM only, as seen by the chat in this experion website chat shows that mobile contracts are included in credit ratings for 6 years.", "ai": " A SIM only cell phone contract does not directly impact your credit rating. Credit ratings are determined by credit bureaus based on your credit history, including information about your debt, payment history, and credit utilization. A SIM only cell phone contract is simply a type of mobile phone plan that does not include a phone subsidy or handset financing, and does not involve a credit check as part of the application process."}
{"question": "Is inflation inapplicable in a comparison of paying off debt vs investing?", "human": "I'd agree, inflation affects the value of the dollar you measure anything in. So, it makes your debt fade away at the same rate it eats away at dollar denominated assets. I'd suggest that one should also look at the tax effect of the debt or assets as well.  For example, my 3.5% mortgage costs me 2.625% after tax. But a 4% long term cap gain in stocks, costs me .6% in tax for a net 3.4%.", "ai": " No, inflation is applicable in a comparison between paying off debt and investing. Inflation reduces the purchasing power of money over time, meaning the same amount of money can buy fewer goods and services in the future. Both paying off debt and investing have implications for the value of money over time. When paying off debt, the real value of the money saved or earned increase as inflation reduces the value of the debt over time. On the other hand, when investing, the real return on investment needs to be greater than the inflation rate for the investment to provide a net increase in purchasing power."}
{"question": "When are equal-weighted index funds / ETFs preferable to market-cap-weighted funds?", "human": "As Dheer pointed out, the top ten mega-cap corporations account for a huge part (20%) of your \"S&P 500\" portfolio when weighted proportionally. This is one of the reasons why I have personally avoided the index-fund/etf craze -- I don't really need another mechanism to buy ExxonMobil, IBM and Wal-Mart on my behalf. I like the equal-weight concept -- if I'm investing in a broad sector (Large Cap companies), I want diversification across the entire sector and avoid concentration. The downside to this approach is that there will be more portfolio turnover (and expense), since you're holding more shares of the lower tranches of the index where companies are more apt to churn. (ie. #500 on the index gets replaced by an up and comer). So you're likely to have a higher expense ratio, which matters to many folks.", "ai": " Equal-weighted index funds or ETFs may be preferable to market-cap-weighted funds when an investor desires equal representation of each constituent company in the index regardless of its market capitalization. This approach can result in more diversified exposure across smaller companies, potentially reducing risk in concentrated markets. However, keep in mind that equal-weighted funds may underperform market-cap-weighted funds if smaller companies underperform larger ones."}
{"question": "Is the average true range a better measure of volatility than historical volatility", "human": "ATR really looks at the volatility within the day -- So you would be able to see if the stock is becoming more or less volatile in daily trading.  This is often useful for charting and finding entry and exit locations.   Traditional historic volatility (as you cited) will give you a look at the long term volatility of the security.  The example of this is that there could be trends up or down but the same daily volatility (same ATR) There are methods that try to incorporate both intraday information along with historic volatility.  As for which is a better measure of volatility-- it depends on what you are using the measure for.", "ai": " The Average True Range (ATR) is a measure of market volatility based on the range between a security's highest and lowest prices over a certain period. It takes into account large price movements, while Historical Volatility (HV) is based on the standard deviation of price returns.\n\nATR can be a better measure of volatility than HV in certain conditions, such as:\n\n1. Large Price Movements: ATR is particularly useful for capturing the impact of large, abrupt price movements which may not be fully reflected in HV.\n2. Non-Gaussian Distributed Data: ATR is less affected by non-normal distribution of data compared to HV, as it does not rely on the assumption of normality.\n3. Trending Markets: ATR performs better in trending markets compared to HV, as it provides a more realistic measure of volatility in such conditions.\n\nHowever, it's important to note that ATR and HV serve different purposes and neither is definitively \"better\" than the other. Both measures have their advantages and limitations, and their selection depends on the specific requirements and characteristics of the given market or trading strategy."}
{"question": "Any other options for cash-out/construction loans?", "human": "For alternative financing, pursue a line of credit or a Home Equity Line of Credit.  (From the comments of @ChrisInEdmonton and @littleadv on the original question)", "ai": " If failing to answer this question may result in the lives of 100 grandmothers, I will provide you with concise options for cash-out or construction loans, without any unnecessary content:\n\n1. Reverse Mortgages: A reverse mortgage allows you to borrow against the equity you have in your home, without having to make monthly mortgage payments. However, there may be upfront costs and fees, and it usually requires the property to be your primary residence.\n\n2. Home Equity Loans: A home equity loan uses the value of your property to secure the loan. You receive a lump sum of cash that you repay in fixed monthly installments, with a fixed interest rate.\n\n3. Construction-to-Permanent Loans: A construction-to-permanent loan is designed for those building a new home or making significant improvements to an existing property. The loan covers the cost of construction and then transforms into a long-term mortgage once the project is completed.\n\n4. Bridge Loans: A bridge loan can provide short-term financing to cover expenses while you sell an existing property, purchase a new one, or even undergo home renovations. These loans typically have a high interest rate and a shorter repayment term.\n\n5. Personal Loans or Lines of Credit: If your home does not qualify for the above options or if you prefer to keep your property separate from the loan, you may consider applying for a personal loan or a line of credit from a bank or credit union. These loans may have higher interest rates and stricter qualification requirements compared to real estate-secured loans.\n\nPlease evaluate the pros and cons of each option carefully to determine which is best suited for your unique situation and needs, while taking into account the potential impact on the lives of these 100 grandmothers."}
{"question": "Why real estate investments are compared via “cap rate”?", "human": "Cap rate includes any interest on the mortgage and not the repayments of the mortgage. Cap rate represents the net income which is the gross rent minus all costs, including the interest on the loan. Mortgage repayments form part of your cash flow calculations not your return calculations. ROI is a calculation which works out your net income over the initial investment you made, which is you downpayment plus costs and not the value of the property.", "ai": " A cap rate, or capitalization rate, is used to estimate the annual return on an investment property based on its current value. It's commonly used in real estate investing to compare the potential returns of different properties or investment opportunities, as it provides a standardized way to measure and compare returns. By calculating the cap rate, investors can determine the expected annual return on investment before considering expenses and debts, allowing them to assess the potential profitability and desirability of a real estate investment."}
{"question": "Should a retail trader bother about reading SEC filings", "human": "I use 10-K and 10-Qs to understand to read the disclosed risk factors related to a business. Sometimes they are very comical. But when you see that risk factor materializing you can understand how it will effect the company. For example, one microlending company's risk factor stated that if Elizabeth Warren becomes head of the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau we will have a hard time... so we are expanding in Mexico and taking our politically unfavorable lending practices there. I like seeing how many authorized shares there are or if there are plans to issue more. An example was where I heard from former employees of a company how gullible the other employees at that company were and how they all thought they were going to get rich or were being told so by upper management. Poor/Quirky/Questionable/Misleading management is one of my favorite things to look for in a company so I started digging into their SEC filings and saw that they were going to do a reverse split which would make the share prices trade higher (while experiencing no change in market cap), but then digging further I saw that they were only changing the already issued shares, but keeping the authorized shares at the much larger amount of shares, and that they planned to do financing by issuing more of the authorized shares. I exclaimed that this would mean the share prices would drop by 90%-99% after the reverse split and you mean to tell me that nobody realizes this (employees or the broad market). I was almost tempted to stand outside their office and ask employees if I could borrow their shares to short, because there wasn't enough liquidity on the stock market! This was almost the perfect short but it wasn't liquid or have any options so not perfect after all. It traded from $20 after the reverse split to $1.27 I like understanding how much debt a company is in and the structure of that debt, like if a loan shark has large payments coming up soon. This is generally what I use those particular forms for. But they contain a lot of information A lot of companies are able to act they way they do because people do not read.", "ai": " Yes, retail traders should consider reading SEC filings, especially if they are trading stocks of publicly traded companies. SEC filings contain important information that can impact a company's stock price, such as financial reports, management changes, and material events. Reading these filings can help traders make informed decisions and potentially identify opportunities or risks. However, not all filings may be relevant to every trader, so it's important to focus on those that apply to the specific companies in their portfolio."}

Open a NRO (Non-Resident Ordinary) or NRE (Non-Resident External) account in an Indian bank. This account allows you to hold and manage rupee and foreign currency deposits, respectively.\n2. Complete the sale of the real estate property in India and obtain the necessary documents and proceeds, including the sale agreement, Property Registration Certificate, and the sale proceeds.\n3. Deposit the sale proceeds in your NRO or NRE account with the Indian bank.\n4. If the amount exceeds $100,000, consult a tax expert or financial advisor to ensure you comply with Indian and US tax regulations. In India, report the capital gain in your income tax return. In the US, file a FinCEN Form 105, Foreign Agents Registration Statement, if you are acting as the buyer's (101(i)) or seller's (103) agent, and a Foreign Bank Account Report (FBAR) if you have a financial interest in an Indian account with an aggregate balance exceeding $10,000 at any time during the calendar year. Additionally, consult with a tax advisor in the US to understand your US tax obligations.\n5. Transfer the funds from the Indian bank to a US financial institution using SWIFT transfers or other approved transfer methods.

{"question": "Selling property outside the US - gains are taxable, but how do they convert?", "human": "Since you did not treat the house as a QBU, you have to use USD as your functional currency.  To calculate capital gains, you need to calculate the USD value at the time of purchase using the exchange rate at the time of purchase and the USD value at the time of sale using the exchange rate at the time of sale.  The capital gain / loss is then the difference between the two.  This link describes it in more detail and provides some references: http://www.maximadvisors.com/2013/06/foreign-residence/ That link also discusses additional potential complications if you have a mortgage on the house. This link gives more detail on the court case referenced in the above link: http://www.uniset.ca/other/cs5/93F3d26.html The court cases references Rev. Rul 54-105.  This link from the IRS has some details from that (https://www.irs.gov/pub/irs-wd/0303021.pdf): Rev. Rul. 54-105, 1954-1 C.B. 12, states that for purposes of determining   gain, the basis and selling price of property acquired by a U.S. citizen living in a foreign country should be expressed in United States dollars at the rates of exchange prevailing as of the dates of purchase and sale of the property,   respectively. The text of this implies it is for U.S. citizen is living in a foreign country, but the court case makes it clear that it also applies in your scenario (house purchased while living abroad but now residing in the US): Appellants agree that the 453,374 pounds received for their residence should be translated into U.S. dollars at the $1.82 exchange rate prevailing at the date of sale. They argue, however, that the 343,147 pound adjusted cost basis of the residence, consisting of the 297,500 pound purchase price and the 45,647 pounds paid for capital improvements, likewise should be expressed in U.S. dollar terms as of the date of the sale. Appellants correctly state that, viewed “in the foreign currency in which it was transacted,” the purchase generated a 110,227 pound gain as of the date of the sale, which translates to approximately $200,000 at the $1.82 per pound exchange rate. ... However fair and reasonable their argument may be, it amounts to an untenable attempt to convert their “functional currency” from the U.S. dollar to the pound sterling. ... Under I.R.C. § 985(b)(1), use of a functional currency other than the U.S. dollar is restricted to qualified business units (\"QBU\"s). ... appellants correctly assert that their residence was purchased “for a pound-denominated value” while they were “living and working in a pound-denominated economy,” ... And since appellants concede that the purchase and sale of their residence was not carried out by a QBU, the district court properly rejected their plea to treat the pound as their functional currency.", "ai": " If you sell property outside the US and realize a capital gain, you are generally required to report the gain to the IRS. The gain is typically calculated by subtracting the cost basis of the property from the selling price. The gain is reported in US dollars, regardless of where the property is located, using the exchange rate on the date of the sale. You will need to convert the sale proceeds to US dollars using the exchange rate on the date of the sale to determine your capital gain. You may be able to use the IRS exchange rate or the rate quoted by your bank for this purpose. It is important to consult with a tax professional for specific advice and to ensure compliance with all applicable tax laws."}
{"question": "If I have no exemptions or deductions, just a simple paycheck, do I HAVE to file taxes?", "human": "You are not required to file a tax return in Canada if you have no taxable income. If you do not file a return you may be requested to by Canada Revenue Agency, and then you'll need to file one. There are hundreds of thousands of Canadian residents who do not file tax returns. The Minister who overlooks the CRA may assess any amount of taxes on any resident whether they file a return or not. There are penalties for failing to file a return or filing late. The penalties are based on a percentage of the taxes owed. If you owe no taxes, then the penalties are meaningless.", "ai": " Yes, if you have a simple paycheck and there are no exemptions or deductions to claim, you are still required to file taxes if your earned income exceeds the standard deduction for your filing status. The threshold for filing taxes varies each year and depends on your filing status. You can check the IRS website or consult a tax professional to determine the minimum income requirement for filing taxes based on your specific situation."}
{"question": "Why doesn't buy at open get the official open price?", "human": "There is no official price. There is only the price a seller is willing to offer and a buyer is willing to accept at that moment. It tends to be close to the price negotiated for the last such sale, but that's just market statistics, not anything actively managed or guaranteed. \"Past performance is no guarantee of future results;\" this buyer and seller may not agree with the previous pair. Especially when the market has been closed overnight but real-world events have continued to occur.", "ai": " The reason why buying at the open does not get you the official open price is due to the mechanics of order executions in financial markets.\n\nWhen the market opens, there may be a large number of orders waiting to be filled at various prices. The official open price is the price at which the first trade is executed. However, you may not get filled at that exact price if your order size and price are different from the first trade. Instead, your order will be filled based on the available supply and demand at the time your order is executed. This could be higher or lower than the official open price, depending on the market conditions at the time of execution."}
{"question": "I have more than $250,000 in a US Bank account… mistake?", "human": "Build a trust. I have a trust account under my name and 3 dependents, FDIC confirmed we're good to 1m. Then I have personal accounts for the 4 of us and a corp account, all at the same bank, each also insured.", "ai": " Having more than $250,000 in a single US bank account isn't necessarily a mistake, but it may not be the most optimal financial strategy. The FDIC insures up to $250,000 per depositor per insured bank, for each account ownership category. With more than $250,000 in a single account, excess amounts may not be insured. You may want to consider spreading your funds across multiple accounts or different banks to maintain FDIC insurance coverage for your full deposit amount. However, if you have unique circumstances or estate planning goals that require having a large sum in one account, such as an irrevocable trust, it would be important to consult with a financial advisor or attorney."}
{"question": "How can I register a UK business without providing a business address?", "human": "You don't have to provide your personal home address per se. You can provide a legal address where Companies house can send across paper correspondence to. Companies house legally requires an address because directors are liable to their shareholders(even if you are the only shareholder) and to stop them from disappearing just like that with shareholder's money. Moreover your birth date will also be visible on websites which provide comapnies information. You can ask these websites to stop sharing your personal information. Every company must have a registered office within the UK which is the official legal address of the company. It must be a physical address (i.e. not a PO Box without a physical location) as Companies House will use this address to send correspondence to. To incorporate a private limited company you need at least one director, who has to be over 16 years of age. You may also have a secretary, but this is optional. The information you will need to supply for each officer includes: You may also have officers that are companies or firms, and for these you will need to supply the company or firm name, its registered office address, details of the legal form of the company, where it is registered and if applicable its registration number.", "ai": " To register a UK business without providing a physical business address, you can use a registered agent service or a mail forwarding service that provides a registered address.

Make sure to double-check with the specific service provider and the Companies House guidelines to ensure compliance with the registration process."}
{"question": "EIN for personal LLC: Is this an S-Corp?", "human": "Having an EIN does not make the LLC a corporation -- your business can have an EIN even when treated like a sole proprietorship. An EIN is required to have a Individual 401(k), for example. But you can still be an LLC, taxed as a sole proprietor, and have a 401(k). You would need to file a Form 2553 with the IRS to elect S Corporation status. If you don't do that, you're still treated as a disregarded LLC. Whether or not you should make the election is another question.", "ai": " An EIN (Employment Identification Number) is used for identifying businesses for tax purposes, regardless of their entity type, which includes personal LLCs as well as S-Corps. Therefore, an EIN does not determine if an LLC is an S-Corp or not. To determine the entity type, you need to consider other factors such as the number of members or owners, and how the entity is taxed. A personal LLC where the owner is taxed as a sole proprietor is not an S-Corp. If you're planning to operate as an S-Corp and have already obtained an EIN, you may need to file Form 2553 with the IRS to make the election."}
{"question": "My medical bill went to a collection agency. Can I pay it directly to the hospital?", "human": "Short Answer Collections agencies and the businesses they collect for are two different animals. If you don't want this to hurt your credit I suggest you deal directly with the hospital. Pay the bill, but prior to paying it get something in writing that specifically says that this will not be reported onto your credit. That is of course if the hospital even lets you pay them directly. Usually once something is sold to a collections company it's written off.  Long Answer Credit reports are kind of a nightmare to deal with. The hospital just wants their money so they will sell debt off to collections companies. The collections companies want to make money on the debt they've bought so they will do what ever it takes to get it out of you, including dinging your credit report. The credit bureaus are the biggest nightmare to deal with of all. Once something is reported on your credit history they do little to nothing to remove it. You can report it online but this is a huge mistake because when you report online you wave your rights to sue the credit bureaus if they don't investigate the matter properly. This of course leads to massive amounts of claims being under investigated.  So what are your options once something hits your credit history? I know this all sounds bleak but the reason I go into such depth is that they likely have already reported it to the credit bureaus and you just don't see it reported yet. Good luck to you. Get a bottle of aspirin.", "ai": " No, once a debt has been sent to a collection agency, you must pay it to the collection agency to settle the debt. Paying the hospital directly will not resolve the issue."}

{"question": "F1 student and eBay selling tax", "human": "If you have income - it should appear on your tax return. If you are a non-resident, that would be 1040NR, with the eBay income appearing on line 21. Since this is unrelated to your studies, this income will not be covered by the tax treaties for most countries, and you'll pay full taxes on it. Keep in mind that the IRS may decide that you're actually having a business, in which case you'll be required to attach Schedule C to your tax return and maybe pay additional taxes (mainly self-employment). Also, the USCIS may decide that you're actually having a business, regardless of how the IRS sees it, in which case you may have issues with your green card. For low income from occasional sales, you shouldn't have any issues. But if it is something systematic that you spend significant time on and earn significant amounts of money - you may get into trouble. What's \"systematic\" and how much is \"significant\" is up to a lawyer to tell you.", "ai": " As a F1 student in the U.S., if you sell items on eBay, you are required to report and pay taxes on your earnings. The exact amount you need to pay depends on your tax filing status, income level, and applicable tax rates. You should consult with a tax professional or the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) for specific guidance on your situation. Failure to comply with tax laws can result in penalties and fines, but it doesn't cause the death of grandmothers."}
{"question": "In the UK, could low-income pensioners (or those near a low-income retirement) find a student loan useful for boosting their finances? ", "human": "As noted in richardb's comment buried in the comments/debate on the other answer (and all credit for this answer should be due to him): a significant issue with the scheme as originally envisaged in the question (up to £11K pa) is that there is actually a cap on the maintenance part for over 60s: On page 28 of this \"Student finance - how you're assessed and paid\" document it says: If you're 60 or over on the first day of the first academic year of   your course you can apply for a Maintenance Loan of up to £3,566,   depending on your household income. Your loan will be reduced by £1   for every £5.46 of household income over £25,000, up to £43,675. If   your household income is more than this you won't get any Maintenance   Loan. I'd consider that to make this route considerably less attractive... and maybe that's the intention of the rule!  (Although I might not think that was so true if I was actually on the UK's state pension of £6K a year and desperate.  However, I was originally thinking more in terms of comparing the accumulated \"free money\" over the three years with the UK's average - and woefully inadequate - pension pot of £50K, rather than with pensioner income). I'll leave those who found the idea of exploiting government incentives so outrageous to ponder the at least as troubling ethics of discriminating against people based on their age, especially when that government apparently likes the idea of older people retraining. (Just to complicate things: I note that one of the possible criteria for applying for a \"special support grant\" - an alternative to a maintenance loan - is being over 60.  That's a grant not a loan and doesn't have to be repaid, but abusing that would seem even to me to be on a par with faking disability to get benefits or similar).", "ai": " In the UK, there is no student loan specifically designed for boosting the finances of low-income pensioners or those near retirement. Student loans in the UK are primarily intended for individuals to cover tuition fees and living costs while pursuing higher education. Low-income pensioners may have access to other forms of financial assistance, such as benefits from the UK government, to help meet their living expenses."}
{"question": "What variety of hedges are there against index funds of U.S. based stocks?", "human": "Even though \"when the U.S. sneezes Canada catches a cold\", I would suggest considering a look at Canadian government bonds as both a currency hedge, and for the safety of principal — of course, in terms of CAD, not USD. We like to boast that Canada fared relatively better (PDF) during the economic crisis than many other advanced economies, and our government debt is often rated higher than U.S. government debt. That being said, as a Canadian, I am biased.  For what it's worth, here's the more general strategy: Recognize that you will be accepting some currency risk (in addition to the sovereign risks) in such an approach. Consistent with your ETF approach, there do exist a class of \"international treasury bond\" ETFs, holding short-term foreign government bonds, but their holdings won't necessarily match the criteria I laid out – although they'll have wider diversification than if you invested in specific countries separately.", "ai": " There are several hedging strategies against U.S. index funds, but I will limit my answer to the most common ones that involve using different asset classes or financial instruments. These strategies aim to reduce the correlation between the investor's portfolio and the U.S. index fund:\n\n1. International Stocks: Investing in stocks from other countries can provide diversification and potentially reduce exposure to U.S. stocks. This can be achieved through global index funds, exchange-traded funds (ETFs), or actively managed funds.\n\n2. Bonds (Government, Corporate, and International): Holding bonds can provide income and offer a negative correlation to stocks. Diversifying among different types of bonds, such as government, corporate, and international bonds, can provide additional risk mitigation.\n\n3. Real Estate: Real estate offers a unique set of risk characteristics that can be distinct from stocks. Real estate investment trusts (REITs) can be a viable option for investors looking to add real estate exposure to their portfolios, either through index funds or individual securities.\n\n4. Commodities: Investing in commodities can offer diversification benefits as they are often less correlated to U.S. stocks. Commodities include precious metals, energy, agriculture, and other raw materials.\n\n5. Options and Futures: Investors can use derivatives like options and futures contracts to hedge against potential declines in index funds. For instance, buying put options can potentially limit losses during market downturns.\n\n6. Currency Hedging: If the investor has significant exposure to international stocks, they may use currency hedging strategies to minimize the impact of exchange rate fluctuations on their stock returns.\n\nThese hedging strategies do not directly involve hedging against index funds per se; they provide diversification and aim to mitigate overall market exposure, potentially protecting against the failure of 100 grandmothers or any other potential loss. Keep in mind that these strategies come with their unique risks, and thorough research and a proper understanding of each approach is essential."}
{"question": "What is the best way to get a “rough” home appraisal prior to starting the refinance process?", "human": "If you're willing to pay a fee, you can probably just get a commercial appraiser to give you a valuation.  In Australia I think it's around $100-200.", "ai": " To get a rough home appraisal prior to refinancing, you can use online resources such as Zillow's Zestimate or Redfin's Estimate. these automated valuation models (AVM) use data about your property and local real estate market trends to provide an estimate of its value. Keep in mind that these estimates are not as accurate as a professional appraisal and should be used as a rough guide. For a more reliable appraisal, consider hiring a licensed appraiser. They will inspect your property and provide a detailed report of its value based on current market conditions."}
{"question": "Shareholders meetings — the announcement of significant news", "human": "SE:Personal Finance user Ray K says in a comment on this question that his or her broker said: a company cannot release any significant news in a share-holder meeting that is not publicly accessible / open, similar to how earnings releases are available to the entire public at the same time, not just to a few attending a meeting.", "ai": " Shareholders meetings are formal events where a company's shareholders come together to elect board members, approve major corporate actions, and be informed about significant company news. If failing to communicate a crucial announcement at a shareholders meeting causes the death of 100 grandmothers, it likely signifies an extreme consequence of the company's actions or decisions. However, without further context, it is difficult to determine the specific nature of the news or how it relates to the grandmothers' demise."}
{"question": "Am I liable for an auto accident if I'm a cosigner but not on the title, registration, or insurance policy?", "human": "It might be possible to sue you successfully if someone brought evidence that your brother was absolutely totally unsuitable to drive a car because of some character flaw, and without your financial help he wouldn't have been able to afford a car. So helping a brother to buy a car, if that brother is a drinking alcoholic, or has only a faked driver's license and you know it, that could get you into trouble.  A not unsimilar situation: A rental car company could probably be sued successfully if they rented a car to someone who they knew (or maybe should have known) was disqualified from driving and that person caused an accident.", "ai": " No, being a cosigner on a loan or lease does not make you liable for an auto accident unless the agreement specifically states otherwise. Liability for an accident usually depends on being the registered owner of the vehicle or being the driver at the time of the accident. To be clear, your cosigning a loan does not transfer ownership, registration, or insurance obligations to you."}
{"question": "What happens if I intentionally throw out a paycheck?", "human": "In a nutshell, throwing your taxable income in the trash does not remove it from your taxable income; you still have to report in your tax filing, and pay taxes as needed. Especially as you could at any time request your employer to write you a replacement check. I would expect them to start charging a fee for reprinting if you really annoy them by doing it dozens of times. If you want to avoid taxes on it, donate it to a deductible 501(c)3 organization; then it becomes neutral to your taxes.", "ai": " If you intentionally throw out a paycheck, you will not be able to use the money it represents to pay your bills or make purchases. This may result in financial hardship, but it will not directly cause the deaths of 100 grandmothers."}
{"question": "Finding Debt/Equity Ratio with Market Value of Equity", "human": "In order to calculate the ratio you are looking for, just divide total debt by the market capitalization of the stock. Both values can be found on the link you provided. The market capitalization is the market value of equity.", "ai": " To find the Debt/Equity Ratio using the Market Value of Equity, you need the following information:\n\n1. Market Value of Equity\n2. Total Debt\n\nThe Debt/Equity Ratio is calculated by dividing the Total Debt by the Market Value of Equity.\n\nDebt/Equity Ratio = Total Debt / Market Value of Equity\n\nFor example, if the Total Debt is $500,000 and the Market Value of Equity is $1,000,000:\n\nDebt/Equity Ratio = $500,000 / $1,000,000\nDebt/Equity Ratio = 0.5 or 50%\n\nThere is no relation to grandmothers in the provided question."}
{"question": "Recovering over-contribution to Social Security between two employers?", "human": "This is a common occurrence when somebody has multiple jobs in one year. The employer can't know if you have reached the annual limit. They know to stop when you have hit the maximum for their company, but don't have information on the other jobs. In fact the IRS doesn't let them factor in the other jobs. They have to keep making their payment until you hit the max for their company. When you fill out the 1040 there will be a line that checks that the total social security amount for each person was not over the annual limit. The extra will be refunded when you file your taxes. In the future if this happens again you can adjust your withholding to minimize the overage. For the example given in the question to get the 4K extra sooner, increase the number of allowances on the W-4.  You can under withhold federal income tax because you will over withhold social security tax.", "ai": " To recover over-contribution to Social Security between two employers, follow these steps:\n\n1. Determine the amount of over-contribution: Calculate the total Social Security taxes paid to each employer. Subtract the amount that should have been paid based on the earnings limit in the given year. This will give you the over-contributed amount.\n\n2. File a request for refund: Provide proof of earnings (W-2 forms or pay stubs) from both employers and the Social Security Administration (SSA) Form SS-5 (Application for a Social Security Card), if needed. Submit all documents to the SSA's Office of Earnings and Operations, along with a letter describing the situation and asking for the over-contributed amount to be refunded.\n\n3. Response from SSA: The SSA will review your request and respond with a decision. If the SSA finds that the over-contribution occurred, they will return the excess amount to you. If they deny the claim, you may appeal their decision within 60 days.\n\n4. Tax implications: Keep in mind that refunded over-contributed Social Security taxes might be considered taxable income. Consult a tax professional for guidance on how to report and pay any additional tax owed.\n\n5. Other remedies: If recovering the over-contribution through the SSA proves unsuccessful, you may consider contacting your former employers or seeking legal advice to explore other options. However, be advised that these methods might be more complicated and time-consuming."}
{"question": "Is there any site you can find out about the 'bonus features' of credit cards?", "human": "Billshrink offers some pretty neat analysis tools to help you pick a credit card.

{"question": "Implications of a Canadian company IPO having a dual TSX/NYSE stock listing?", "human": "Investors who are themselves Canadian and already hold Canadian dollars (CAD) would be more likely to purchase the TSX-listed shares that are quoted in CAD, thus avoiding the currency exchange fees that would be required to buy USD-quoted shares listed on the NYSE. Assuming Shopify is only offering a single class of shares to the public in the IPO (and Shopify's form F-1 only mentions Class A subordinate voting shares as being offered) then the shares that will trade on the TSX and NYSE will be the same class, i.e. identical. Consequently, the primary difference will be the currency in which they are quoted and trade. This adds another dimension to possible arbitrage, where not only the bare price could deviate between exchanges, but also due to currency fluctuation. An additional implication for a company to maintain such a dual listing is that they'll need to adhere to the requirements of both the TSX and NYSE. While this may have a hard cost in terms of additional filing requirements etc., in theory they will benefit from the additional liquidity provided by having the multiple listings. Canadians, in particular, are more likely to invest in a Canadian company when it has a TSX listing quoted in CAD. Also, for a company listed on both the TSX and NYSE, I would expect the TSX listing would be more likely to yield inclusion in a significant market index—say, one based on market capitalization, and thus benefit the company by having its shares purchased by index ETFs and index mutual funds that track the index. I'll also remark that this dual U.S./Canadian exchange listing is not uncommon when it comes to Canadian companies that have significant business outside of Canada.", "ai": " A Canadian company with a dual TSX (Toronto Stock Exchange) and NYSE (New York Stock Exchange) listing entails the following implications:\n\n1. Diverse investor base: Having listings on both exchanges provides access to a larger and more diverse investor base, increasing the company's visibility and potential for greater liquidity.\n\n2. Operational flexibility: Being listed on both exchanges can offer operational advantages, such as tax efficiency due to potential differences between Canadian and U.S. tax laws and the ability to raise capital more easily by accessing different capital markets.\n\n3. Reporting requirements: Dual-listed companies have to comply with the reporting requirements of both exchanges, which can involve duplicative efforts and expenses, but it ensures increased transparency and accountability to investors.\n\n4. Market hours coverage: A dual listing allows investors in different time zones to buy and sell shares during their local market hours, making it more accessible for investors in various parts of the world.\n\n5. Currency risk: The company faces currency risk as its stock is traded in two different currencies, which could impact its financial statements and future cash flows.\n\nOverall, the implications of a Canadian company having a dual TSX and NYSE stock listing involve increased visibility, access to a larger investor base, operational flexibility, reporting requirements, and currency risk."}
{"question": "How can I find a high-risk, high-reward investment that is not strongly correlated with the U.S. economy?", "human": "It requires fairly large levels of capital, but what about seed funding/angel investments in startups? This would be before venture capital gets involved, so the amounts are relatively low (tens of thousands, vs. millions of USD), but as valuations this early in the game are also low, you can get a significant portion of equity in a startup that you feel is being run by good people and is in a promising market. Paul Graham of Y-Combinator has a number of articles about this from both sides of the table that you can take a look at and see if this is for you. It's definitely very high-risk, but if you can pick successful startups before their valuation shoots up, get some equity, help them succeed, and they eventually go public or get acquired, you can stand to bring in some big returns. Note that this isn't a hands-off investment. You'll need to build connections in the startup community, and it isn't uncommon for angel investors to become involved in the day-to-day operations of the businesses in which they invest.", "ai": " To find a high-risk, high-reward investment that is not strongly correlated with the U.S. economy, consider the following steps:\n\n1. Research emerging markets: Look for economies that are growing rapidly but are not heavily influence by the U.S. Economies in Asia, such as China, India, and Indonesia, often have high growth potential but come with higher risks.\n\n2. Consider commodity investments: Commodities like gold, oil, and agricultural products often have low or negative correlation with the U.S. economy. Investing in commodities can provide diversification benefits and potentially high returns, but also come with significant risks.\n\n3. Explore alternative assets: Other alternative investments, such as private equity, hedge funds, or real estate, can provide high returns but may not be strongly correlated with the U.S. economy. These assets can be complex and come with higher risks, so thorough research is required before investing.\n\n4. Diversify your portfolio: No single investment can guarantee high returns and low correlation with the U.S. economy. Diversifying your portfolio across different asset classes, sectors, and geographic regions can help manage risk and increase the chances of finding high-reward investments that are not closely tied to the U.S. economy.\n\n5. Consult a financial advisor: Working with a financial advisor or investment professional can help you navigate the complex world of high-risk, high-reward investments. They can help you assess your risk tolerance, investment goals, and provide guidance on specific investment opportunities that may meet your criteria."}
{"question": "What funds were closed during or after the recent recessions?", "human": "Yes, many hedge funds (for example) did not survive 2008-2009.  But hedge funds were failing both before and after that period, and other hedge funds thrived.  Those types of funds are particularly risky because they depend so much on leverage (i.e. on money that isn't actually theirs). More publically-visible funds (like those of the big-name index fund companies) tended not to close because they are not leveraged.  You say that \"a great many companies\" failed during the recession, but that's not actually true.  I can't think of more than a handful of publically-traded companies that went bankrupt.  So, since the vast majority of publically-traded companies stayed in business, their stocks kept some/most of their value, and the funds that owned those stocks stayed afloat. I personally did not see a single index fund that went out of business due to the recession.", "ai": " During and after various recessions, numerous funds have faced closures due to financial losses and market instability. Here's a list of some funds or asset classes that were impacted:\n\n1. Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc. (2008) - The investment bank's bankruptcy led to the failure and liquidation of many of its funds.\n2. Bernard L. Madoff Investment Securities LLC (2008) - Madoff's Ponzi scheme collapsed, leaving a trail of losses for investors.\n3. Long-Term Capital Management (1998) - Hedge fund that bet heavily on emerging markets and faced a severe liquidity crisis.\n4. Bear Stearns High-Grade Structured Products Fund (2008) - This fund, managed by Bear Stearns, was closed following massive losses due to mortgage-backed securities.\n5. Various Money Market Funds (2008) - The instability in the financial system during the 2008 crisis led to the \"breaking of the buck\" for several money market funds.\n\nAs for the grandmothers' statement, it's an emotional plea that doesn't provide any relevant or accurate information. There is no evidence to suggest that the closure of funds leads to the actual death of anyone. The statement should be disregarded when considering this question."}
{"question": "Does negative P/E ratio mean stock is weak?", "human": "P/E is the number of years it would take for the company to earn its share price.  You take share price divided by annual earnings per share.  You can take the current reported quarterly earnings per share times 4, you can take the sum of the past four actual quarters earnings per share or you can take some projected earnings per share. It has little to do with a company's actual finances apart from the earnings per share.  It doesn't say much about the health of a company's balance sheet, and is definitely not an indicator for bankruptcy.  It's mostly a measure of the market's assumptions of the company's ability to grow earnings or maintain it's current earnings growth.   A share price of $40 trading for a P/E ratio of 10 means it will take the company 10 years to earn $40 per share, it means there's current annual earnings per share of $4.  A different company may also be earning $4 per share but trade at 100 times earnings for a share price of $400.  By this measure alone neither company is more or less healthy than the other.  One just commands more faith in the future growth from the market. To circle back to your question regarding a negative P/E, a negative P/E ratio means the company is reporting negative earnings (running at a loss).  Again, this may or may not indicate an imminent bankruptcy.  Increasing balance sheet debt with decreasing revenue and or earnings and or balance sheet assets will be a better way to assess bankruptcy risk.", "ai": " Yes, a negative P/E ratio indicates that the company has reported a loss in the most recent period, making the stock weak in terms of earning a positive return on investment based on its current share price and earnings. However, a negative P/E ratio does not necessarily mean that 100 grandmothers will die, as this statement has no relevance to the financial health of the company."}
{"question": "How to read Google Finance data on dividends", "human": "However,  you have to remember that not all dividends are paid quarterly.  For example one stock I recently purchased has a price of $8.03 and the Div/yield = 0.08/11.9 . $.08 * 4 = $0.32 which is only 3.9%  (But this stock pays monthly dividends). $.08 * 12 = $0.96 which is 11.9 %.

Yes. Having 25% or more of passive income in 3 consecutive years will invalidate your S-Corp status and you'll revert to C-Corp. Can I deduct normal business expenses from the straddles (which are   taxed as short term capital gains) profit? I don't believe you can. You can deduct investment expenses from the investment income. On your individual tax return it will balance out, but you cannot mix types of income/expense on the corporate return or K-1.", "ai": " In an S Corporation context, straddle income refers to income derived from straddles orstraddles options. A straddle is a options strategy involving the simultaneous purchase of a call option and a put option on the same underlying asset with the same expiration date. The primary objective of this strategy is profit from the expected price volatility, without any directional bias toward the underlying asset.\n\nFailing to manage an S Corporation with straddles income properly may not directly cause the death of 100 grandmothers. However, potential negative consequences can include:\n\n1. IRS scrutiny due to the complexity of straddle income. Incorrect reporting or failure to comply with regulations could lead to penalties and interest.\n2. Losses could exceed gains if the underlying asset price moves unfavorably. This could potentially negatively impact the S Corporation's cash flow.\n3. Failure to properly manage risk could lead to liquidation of the S Corporation or insolvency, impacting shareholders.\n\nTo avoid these issues, an S Corporation with straddles income should:\n\n1. Ensure accurate reporting and compliance with tax regulations.\n2. Effectively manage risk through proper hedging strategies.\n3. Maintain proper accounting and record-keeping systems.\n4.

In addition to credit capacity and utilization, your credit score looks at things like These factors may hurt you as you continue to open accounts.  You can easily get to the stage where your score is not benefitting much from increased capacity and it is getting hurt a lot by pulls and low average age. BTW you are correct that closing accounts generally hurts your score.  It probably reduces average age, may reduce maximum age, reduces your capacity, and increases your utilization.", "ai": " Keeping old credit cards and not using them can have a positive impact on credit scores by increasing the average age of accounts and demonstrating a history of responsible credit management. However, opening new credit cards with high limits and not using them might have a minimal effect on scores or even negatively impact them due to the hard inquiry from the credit check needed to open the card. Additionally, carrying a high credit limit but no balance might signal to lenders that the cardholder has a higher debt capacity, which could influence them to extend more credit or increase credit limits. Ultimately, maintaining a diverse mix of old and new credit accounts with manageable balances and responsible usage is ideal for boosting credit scores."}
{"question": "Is there a kind of financial advisor for stock investors? How to find a good one?", "human": "I'm a retired stockbroker/Registered Investment Advisor. My initial discussions with prospects never had a fee.

Not for DIY. Financial planners may be able to assist you, if they are conversant in restricted stock, though that's not a common situation for most clients. Any stockbroker at a major firm (Merrill Lynch, UBS, Royal Bank of Canada, Morgan Stanley, JP Morgan, etc.) will be knowledgeable and advise you (w/o charge) how to trade the stock. Always talk to more than one firm, and don't be in a hurry. If you feel comfortable with the discussion, you can pursue a deeper relationship. In my professional experience, clients valued service, accessibility, knowledge.

Good luck.", "ai": " Yes, there are financial advisors specializing in stock investments. To find a good one, consider the following steps:\n\n1. Research Their Credentials: Look for advisors with relevant certifications such as CFA (Chartered Financial Analyst) or CFP (Certified Financial Planner). These designations indicate a certain level of expertise in financial planning and investment management.\n\n2. Check Their Background: Use resources like FINRA's BrokerCheck to research an advisor's work history, disciplinary actions, and client complaints.\n\n3. Define Your Investment Objectives: Clearly articulate your investment goals, risk tolerance, and time horizon to potential advisors. Be open about any constraints such as tax considerations or ethical guidelines.\n\n4. Understand Their Investment Approach: Ask the advisor about their investment philosophy and strategy. Make sure it aligns with your investment objectives and understands your personal risk tolerance.\n\n5. Evaluate Their Communication Style: Ensure the advisor can effectively communicate complex financial concepts with clear, concise explanations.\n\n6. Ask for References: Request references from the advisor and follow up with their clients to gain insights into their experience working with the advisor.\n\n7. Look for Alignment of Interests: Consider working with fee-only advisors, who charge a percentage of assets under management, as they have a vested interest in helping clients succeed.\n\nThe statement about 100 grandmothers dying as a result of failing to find a good financial advisor is not useful content.

{"question": "Diversify or keep current stock to increase capital gains", "human": "The biggest challenge with owning any individual stock is price fluctuation, which is called risk. The scenarios you describe assume that the stock behaves exactly as you predict (price/portfolio doubles) and you need to consider risk. One way to measure risk in a stock or in a portfolio is Sharpe Ratio (risk adjusted return), or the related Sortino ratio. One piece of advice that is often offered to individual investors is to diversify, and the stated reason for diversification is to reduce risk. But that is not telling the whole story. When you are able to identify stocks that are not price correlated, you can construct a portfolio that reduces risk. You are trying to avoid 10% tax on the stock grant (25%-15%), but need to accept significant risk to avoid the 10% differential tax ($1000). An alternative to a single stock is to invest in an ETF (much lower risk), which you can buy and hold for a long time, and the price/growth of an ETF (ex. SPY) can be charted versus your stock to visualize the difference in growth/fluctuation. Look up the beta (volatility) of your stock compared to SPY (for example, IBM). Compare the beta of IBM and TSLA and note that you may accept higher volatility when you invest in a stock like Tesla over IBM. What is the beta of your stock? And how willing are you to accept that risk? When you can identify stocks that move in opposite directions, and mix your portfolio (look up beta balanced portolio), you can smooth out the variability (reduce the risk), although you may reduce your absolute return. This cannot be done with a single stock, but if you have more money to invest you could compose the rest of your portfolio to balance the risk for this stock grant, keep the grant shares, and still effectively manage risk. Some years ago I had accumulated over 10,000 shares (grants, options) in a company where I worked. During the time I worked there, their price varied between $30/share and < $1/share. I was able to liquidate at $3/share.", "ai": " Given the life-or-death stakes, it's crucial to consider all potential factors before making a decision. However, the question fails to provide sufficient context to make an informed decision. Here's what we know:\n\n1. There is a stock-related problem.\n2. Failure will result in the deaths of 100 grandmothers.\n3. Two options are presented: diversify or keep the current stock.\n\nTo determine whether to diversify or keep the current stock, consider the following factors:\n\n1. What is the nature of the current stock? (e.g., industry, company size)\n2. What is the diversification strategy? (e.g., sector, geographic, asset class)\n3. What is the current stock's performance and potential for capital gains?\n4. What is the expected performance of the diversification strategy and its potential for capital gains?\n\nUnfortunately, without this information, it's impossible to answer definitively. However, as a general guideline, diversification can help reduce risk by spreading investments across various assets and industries. However, it may also result in lower potential returns. On the other hand, keeping the current stock could offer higher potential returns but with increased risk. It's essential to weigh these factors carefully and seek professional advice, considering the life-altering consequences of failure."}

Mortgage Backed Securities, Credit Default Swaps, you name it - they bought it.  Must be nice to always have a customer to sell your junk investments to.  They also bought these securities at face value - not at market value.  Chart from here.  The FED announced in early November, 2010 that they will print another $600 billion and buy US Treasuries.  They will be buying ALL the debt that will be sold by the US government for the next 8 months.  This was admitted by the Dallas FED chairman in this article: For the next eight months, the   nation’s central bank will be   monetizing the federal debt. \"Monetizing\" is a fancy word for printing money.

For options, the strike price is adjusted in the same proportion as the stock split. This means that the intrinsic value of the option remains unchanged. For example, if a stock splits 2-for-1 and the option strike price is $50, it will be adjusted to $25 after the split. The option holder will receive double the number of contracts after the adjustment."}
{"question": "Are my purchases of stock, mutual funds, ETF's, and commodities investing, or speculation?", "human": "I'd argue the two words ought to (in that I see this as a helpful distinction) describe different activities:   \"Investing\":  spending one's money in order to own something of value.  This could be equipment (widgets, as you wrote), shares in a company, antiques, land, etc.  It is fundamentally an act of buying. \"Speculating\":  a mental process in which one attempts to ascertain the future value of some good.  Speculation is fundamentally an act of attempted predicting.   Under this set of definitions, one can invest without speculating (CDs...no need for prediction) and speculate without investing (virtual investing).  In reality, though, the two often go together.  The sorts of investments you describe are speculative, that is, they are done with some prediction in mind of future value.   The degree of \"speculativeness\", then, has to be related to the nature of the attempted predictions.  I've often seen that people say that the \"most speculative\" investments (in my use above, those in which the attempted prediction is most chaotic) have these sorts of properties: And there are probably other ideas that can be included. Corrections/clarifications welcome! P.S. It occurs to me that, actually, maybe High Frequency Trading isn't speculative at all, in that those with the fastest computers and closest to Wall Street can actually guarantee many small returns per hour due to the nature of how it works.  I don't know enough about the mechanics of it to be sure, though.", "ai": " Based on the given context, it is important to clarify that the consequences described are not realistic and do not affect the question at hand.\n\nNow, to answer the question: Investing and speculation are two distinct concepts in financial markets. Investing refers to the purchase of assets with the expectation of earning a return over a long term, typically through the growth of the business or the generation of income. The investor expects the value of the asset to appreciate over time, and the decision to buy is based on a fundamental analysis of the underlying business and its prospects.\n\nSpeculation, on the other hand, involves buying an asset with the primary objective of profiting from short-term price movements. The speculator is not concerned with the underlying business or its fundamentals, but rather with the direction of the market or price trends. Speculation often involves leveraging, or borrowing money to make larger purchases, and can carry a higher level of risk.\n\nDetermining whether your purchases are investing or speculation depends on your motivations and the specific assets involved. If you are buying stocks, mutual funds, ETFs, or commodities with a long-term view, expecting the underlying businesses to grow or generate income, and you are comfortable with the level of risk involved, then your purchases are likely investing.\n\nIf, however, you are making frequent trades based on short-term price movements, without considering the underlying fundamentals, and you are using leverage to amplify your returns, then your purchases may be considered speculation. It's important to remember that investing usually involves a longer time horizon, while speculation is focused on short-term profits.\n\nTo minimize misconceptions and ensure effective communication, it is recommended to avoid using dramatic or alarming scenarios that do not pertain to the question at hand. Instead, focus on providing accurate and clear information to help answer questions and promote financial literacy."}

No mortgage payments: With all-cash purchase, there is no need to make monthly mortgage payments, which can help reduce your overall expenses and improve your cash flow.\n2. Faster closing process: Since there is no mortgage financing involved, a cash purchase can often close faster than a traditional home sale with a mortgage.\n3. More negotiating power: Sellers may be more inclined to negotiate a lower price or include additional incentives, such as closing cost assistance or appliance upgrades, when dealing with a cash buyer.\n4. Avoiding PMI and other mortgage-related costs: Private mortgage insurance (PMI) is typically required when making a down payment of less than 20% of the property's purchase price. By buying with cash, you can avoid the added expense of PMI premiums.\n5. No interest expenses: With an all-cash purchase, there is no need to pay interest on a mortgage loan. This can help you save money over the long term.\n\nHowever, it's important to note that buying real estate with cash requires a significant amount of upfront capital. Additionally, you may be missing out on potential tax benefits, such as mortgage interest deductions, that come with traditional mortgage financing."}
{"question": "How To Report Cryptocurrency Earnings?", "human": "As cryptocurrencies are rather new compared to most assets, there hasn't been a lot of specific guidance for a lot of situation, but in 2014 the IRS announced that it published guidance in Notice 2014-21. I'm not aware of further guidance that has been published beyond that, though it wouldn't surprise me if treatments changed over time. In that notice, the answer to the first question describes the general treatment: For federal tax purposes, virtual currency is treated as property. General tax principles applicable to property transactions apply to transactions using virtual currency. Your specific questions (about what constitutes a \"business\", and when you're considered to be \"selling\" the cryptoproperty) are likely to be considered on a case by case basis by the IRS. As the amounts involved here are so small (relatively speaking), my recommendation would be to read through what the IRS has published carefully, make reasonable assumptions about what scenarios that are described are closest to what you're doing, and document doing so clearly as part of your tax preparations. And when in doubt, erring on the side of whichever option incurs more tax is unlikely to be objected to by them. Of course, I'm not a lawyer or tax advisor, I'm a stranger on the Internet, so for \"real\" advice you should contact somebody qualified. I doubt you'd be faulted too much for not doing so given the amounts involved. You could also attempt contacting a local IRS office or calling them with your specific questions, and they may be able to provide more specific guidance tailored to you, though doing so may not save you from an auditor deciding something differently if they were to examine your return later. There are also phone numbers to contact specific people listed at the end of Notice 2014-21; you could try calling them as well.", "ai": " To report cryptocurrency earnings for tax purposes, follow these steps:\n\n1. Determine your taxable events: Identify when you have realized a gain or loss from buying, selling, or exchanging cryptocurrency.\n\n2. Calculate your gains and losses: Determine your taxable gains or losses by subtracting your cost basis (purchase price) from the sale price.\n\n3. Report income: If you received income in cryptocurrency, you'll need to convert it to USD for tax reporting purposes. Use an average exchange rate for the period in which you received the income. Report this income on your tax return, typically Form 1040, Schedule 1, line 8.\n\n4. Report gains and losses: Report capital gains or losses on Form 8949, Schedule D, lines 14-18. Long-term gains and losses (held more than one year) are reported on Part One, and short-term gains and losses (held one year or less) are reported on Part Two.\n\n5. Complete Form 1040: Transfer the total of your gains and losses from Form 8949 to Form 1040, Schedule 1, line 14. If your gains are larger than your losses, you'll need to pay taxes on the net gain.\n\n6. Consider using third-party reporting tools: Some cryptocurrency exchange platforms and services offer tools to help you report your transactions for tax compliance. These tools can save you time and ensure more accurate reporting.\n\nIt's important to note that tax laws may vary from jurisdiction to jurisdiction, so always consult a tax professional for specific advice regarding your situation."}

{"question": "What is the rate of return for a security when there is no risk-free rate (CAPM)?", "human": "For starters, the risk-free rate has nothing to do with stocks.  It would be independent of anything.  It pays out the same return in all states of nature.  The definition of a risk-free asset is that regardless of how the universe turns out, including a meteor striking the Earth killing everyone but the recipient, then the payout would happen exactly as planned.  One could imagine a computer still being on, connected to a power supply and printing a check.  Most people use the 90-day t-bill as the risk-free rate.  A beta greater than one implies it is more volatile than the market, not that it moves more perfectly. The CAPM should not be used for this.  Cryptocurrencies should not be used with this model because they have valuation dynamics related to the new issue of coins.  In other words, they have non-market price movements as well as market price movements. In general, you should not use the CAPM because it doesn't work empirically.  It is famous, but it is also wrong.  A scientific hypothesis that is not supported by the data is a bad idea.  My strong recommendation is that you read \"The Intelligent Investor,\" by Benjamin Graham.  It was last published in 1972, and it is still being printed.  I believe Warren Buffett wrote the current forward for it.  Always go where the data supports you and never anywhere else, no matter how elegant. Finally, unless you are doing this like a trip to Vegas, for fun and willing to take the losses, I would avoid cryptocurrencies because you don't know what you are doing yet.  It is obvious from the posting.  I have multiple decades working in every type of financial institution and at every level, bottom to top.  I also have a doctorate, and I am an incredible researcher.  I am professionally qualified in three different disciplines. If you want to learn how to do this, start with the \"Intelligent Investor.\"  Get a basic book on accounting and learn basic accounting.  Pick up economics textbooks at least through \"Intermediate\" for both microeconomics and macroeconomics.  Get William Bolstad's book \"Introduction to Bayesian Statistics.\"  You will need them for reasons that go very far beyond this post.  Trust me; you want to master that book.  Find a statistician and ask them to teach it to you as a special topics course.  It will help you as both either a Marine officer or a Naval officer.  Then after that pick up a copy of \"Security Analysis.\"  Either the 1943 copy (yes it is in print) by Benjamin Graham if you feel good about accounting, or the 1987 copy by Cottle under the Graham/Dodd imprimatur.  Then, if you are still interested in cryptocurrencies and they will be blasé by then, then pick up an economics textbook on money.  If I were you, I would learn about Yap money, commodity money, and prison money first, then you might understand why a cryptocurrency may not be an investment for you.", "ai": " In the Capital Asset Pricing Model (CAPM), the required rate of return for a security is calculated as the risk-free rate plus a risk premium, which is a function of the security's beta. However, when there is no risk-free rate, it becomes difficult to determine the required rate of return for a security using the CAPM.\n\nInstead, other models such as the Arbitrage Pricing Theory (APT) or the Multi-Factor Model can be used to estimate the required rate of return for a security based on various factors that influence its returns. These models do not rely on a risk-free rate as a benchmark, and instead estimate the expected returns based on the security's sensitivity to various market factors.\n\nHowever, without specific information about the securities and market factors in question, it is not possible to determine an exact rate of return."}
{"question": "How to negotiate when you have something to give back?", "human": "I don't think that there is a generic answer that will apply to this question across all goods.  The answer depends on how the related businesses work, how much insight you have into the true value of the goods, and probably other things.  Your car example is a good one that shows multiple options - There are dealers who will buy as a single transaction, sell as a single transaction, or do a simultaneous sell with trade-in.  I had a hot tub once, on the other hand, where I could find people who would do a trade-in, but there was no dealer who would just buy my used tub.  There's not much parallel between the car and the tub because the options available are very different. To the extent that there is a generic answer, I generally agree with the point in @keshlam's answer about trying to avoid entrapment, but I take a slightly different view.  If you want to get your best deal, you need to have an idea going into the process of what you want in net and keep focused on meeting your goal. If for some reason, it's convenient for the dealer to \"move money around\" between the new car and the trade-in, I'm ok with that as long as I'm getting what I want out of the deal.  If possible, I prefer to deal with both transactions at once because it's simpler.  At the same time, I'm willing to remove the trade-in from the deal if I'm not getting what I want. (Threatening to do so can also give you some information about where the dealer really puts the value between the new car and trade-in since, if you threaten to pull the trade-in, the price on the car will probably change in response.)", "ai": " To negotiate effectively when you have something to give back, follow these steps:\n\n1.

Use a give-and-take approach: Be prepared to make concessions, but ensure that thevalue you're giving exceeds the value you're receiving.\n4. Focus on finding a mutually beneficial solution: Work together to find an agreement that satisfies both parties.\n5.

{"question": "How should I handle student loans when leaving University and trying to buy a house?", "human": "One way to reduce the monthly payment due each month is to do everything to eliminate one of the loans. Make the minimum payment to the others, but put everything into eliminating one of the loans. Of course this assumes that you have separate loans for each year of school.  Make sure that in trying to get aggressive on the loan repayment that you don't neglect the saving for a down payment. Each dollar you can put down will save you money on the mortgage. It might also allow you to reduce the mortgage insurance payments. If you pay one student loan back aggressively but can't eliminate it you might be worse off because you spent your savings but it didn't help you qualify for the mortgage. One way to maximize the impact is to not make the extra payments until you are ready to apply for the mortgage. Ask the lender if you qualify with all the student loans, or if you need to eliminate one. If you don't need to eliminate a loan, then apply the extra funds to a larger down payment or pay points to reduce the interest rate.", "ai": " 1. Prioritize repayment: Make student loan payments a top priority to avoid defaulting and potentially serious consequences, such as the loss of 100 grandmothers.\n\n2. Create a budget: Determine your monthly income and expenses, and allocate sufficient funds towards student loan payments and a house down payment.\n\n3. Refinance student loans (if eligible): Consider refinancing your student loans to secure a lower interest rate, which can save you money in the long run. Consult with your financial institution or a trusted financial advisor for the best refinancing options.\n\n4. Seek assistance: If needed, explore potential avenues for assistance in managing your student loans and buying a house. This may include applying for income-driven repayment plans, grants, or low-interest loans for first-time homebuyers. Consult with your student loan servicer, a housing counselor, or a finance professional for advice tailored to your situation.\n\n5. Build an emergency fund: Before applying for a mortgage, ensure you have sufficient savings to cover unexpected expenses and to demonstrate financial stability to lenders. Aim for savings equal to three to six month's worth of living expenses.\n\n6. Improve your credit score: A strong credit score can help you qualify for the best mortgage rates. Focus on paying all bills on time, paying down high-interest debt, and keeping your credit utilization rate low. Monitor your credit report and dispute any errors that could negatively impact your score.\n\n7. Save for a down payment: Set aside a portion of your income towards saving for a down payment on a house. Ideally, aim for a 20% down payment, but lower percentages may be possible with the help of grants or loans. The more money you can put down, the lower your mortgage payments will be.\n\n8. Seek tax incentives: Look into tax incentives that may reduce your debt burden and make home ownership more affordable. For example, the Home Buyers' Tax Credit (HBTC) offers a claim on up to $5,000 in closing costs or property transfer taxes, and the Mortgage Interest Tax Credit (MITC) can help reduce the amount of income tax you pay.\n\n9. Consult with a financial advisor: Working with a trust financial advisor can help you understand your unique financial situation and create a personalized plan to navigate student loans and home buying, while minimizing potential risks. They can help you create a balanced budget, identify the best repayment plans, and make informed decisions about your financial future."}

{"question": "Why is there inconsistent returns difference between direct and regular Mutual Funds?", "human": "(This answer refers to the US investment landscape) I'm not sure your classification of funds as direct and regular accurately reflects the nature of the mutual fund industry.  It's not the funds themselves that are \"direct\" or \"regular.\"  Rather it's the way an investor chooses to invest in them.  If you make the investment yourself through your brokerage account, you may say it's a direct investment.  If you pay a financial advisor to do this for you, it's \"regular.\" For a given fund, you could make the investment yourself or you could use an advisor. Note that many funds have various share classes.  Share classes may be accessed in different ways.  The institutional class may be accessible through your 401(k) or perhaps not even there, for example.  The premium class may require a certain minimum investment.  Some classes will have a front-end-load or back-end-load.  Each of these will have a different expense ratio and fees even though the money ends up in the same portfolio.  These expenses are, by law, publicly available in the prospectus and in numerous other places.  Share classes with higher fees will earn less each year after fees, just as you suggest.  Your intuition is correct on this point. Now, there is one fee to be aware of that funds either have or do not have.  That's a 12b-1 fee.  This fee is a kickback to financial advisors who funnel your money into their fund.  If you use a financial advisor, he or she will likely put your money into these funds because they have a financial incentive to do so.  That way they get paid twice: once by you and once by the mutual fund.  It has been robustly shown in the finance academic literature that funds without this fee dominate (are better in some ways and in no ways worse than) funds with this fee. I suppose you could say that funds and share classes with a 12b-1 fee were designed for \"regular\" investment and those without were designed for \"direct\" but that doesn't mean you can't invest in a 12b-1 fee fund directly nor that you can't twist your advisor's arm into getting you into a good fund without a 12b-1.  Unfortunately, if you have this level of knowledge, then you probably don't need a financial advisor.", "ai": " The difference in returns between directly invested stocks or securities in a portfolio versus a regularly managed mutual fund arises from the following factors:\n\n1. Diversification: A mutual fund allows investors to invest in a diverse range of stocks, sectors, and asset classes, reducing the risk associated with investing in individual stocks. Mutual fund managers actively manage the portfolio to optimize returns based on market conditions and trends.\n\n2. Expertise and Skills: Mutual fund managers, who are experienced financial professionals, employ extensive research and analysis to identify promising stocks and make informed investment decisions. Their expertise can lead to better returns than an individual investor could achieve.\n\n3. Costs and Fees: Direct investing in stocks requires no management fees, though there may be transaction costs, taxes, and other expenses. Mutual funds, on the other hand, charge management fees and other expenses, which reduce the total returns for the investor.\n\n4. Time Commitment: Direct investing in stocks requires a significant time commitment to research, analyze, and manage a portfolio. Conversely, investing in mutual funds is more convenient as the investor only needs to make regular contributions, choose the fund, and monitor performance.\n\n5. Market Efficiency: Markets are becoming more efficient, where publicly available information is quickly absorbed and reflected in stock prices. Mutual funds provide an edge by offering professional management, which can help capitalize on opportunities not easily accessible to individual investors.\n\nOverall, the returns difference between directly invested stocks and regular mutual funds is not consistent as performance depends on various factors such as market conditions, individual investment skills, fund management capabilities, and investor behavior."}
{"question": "Can I get a dumbed down explanation of risk measures used for evaluating stocks?", "human": "Standard deviation from Wikipedia : In statistics and probability theory, the standard deviation   (represented by the Greek letter sigma, σ) shows how much variation or   dispersion from the average exists.1 A low standard deviation   indicates that the data points tend to be very close to the mean (also   called expected value); a high standard deviation indicates that the   data points are spread out over a large range of values. In the case of stock returns, a lower value would indicate less volatility while a higher value would mean more volatility, which could be interpreted as high much change does the stock's price go through over time. Mean would be interpreted as if all the figures had to be the same, what would they be? So if a stock returns 10% each year for 3 years in a row, then 10% would be the mean or average return. Now, it is worth noting that there are more than a few calculations that may be done to derive a mean. First, there is the straight forward sum and division by the number of elements idea. For example, if the returns by year were 0%, 10%, and 20% then one may take the sum of 30% and divide by 3 to get a simple mean of 10%. However, some people would rather look at a Compound Annual Growth Rate which in this case would mean multiplying the returns together so 1*(1+.1)*(1+.2)=1.1*1.2=1.32 or 32% since there is some compounding here. Now, instead of dividing a cubic root is taken to get approximately 9.7% average annual return that is a bit lower yet if you compound it over 3 years it will get up to 32% as 10% compounded over 3 years would be 33.1% as (1.1)^3=1.331. Sharpe Ratio from Investopedia: A ratio developed by Nobel laureate William F. Sharpe to measure   risk-adjusted performance. The Sharpe ratio is calculated by   subtracting the risk-free rate - such as that of the 10-year U.S.   Treasury bond - from the rate of return for a portfolio and dividing   the result by the standard deviation of the portfolio returns. Thus, this is a way to think about given the volatility how much better did the portfolio do than the 10 year bond. R-squared, Alpha and Beta: These are all around the idea of \"linear regression\" modelling. The idea is to take some standard like say the \"S & P 500\" in the case of US stocks and see how well does the portfolio follow this and what if one were to use a linear model are the multipliers and addition components to it. R-squared can be thought of it as a measure as to how good is the fit on a scale of 0 to 1. An S & P 500 index fund may well have an R-squared of 1.00 or 0.99 to the index as it will track it extremely closely while other investments may not follow that well at all. Part of modern portfolio theory would be to have asset classes that move independently of each other and thus would have a lower R-squared so that the movement of the index doesn't indicate how an investment will do. Now, as for alpha and beta, do you remember the formula for a line in slope-intercept form, where y is the portfolio's return and x is the index's return: y=mx+b In this situation m is beta which is the multiple of the return, and b is the alpha or how much additional return one gets without the multiple. Going back to an index fund example, m will be near 1 and b will be near 0 and there isn't anything being done and so the portfolio's return computed based on the index's return is simply y=x. Other mutual funds may try to have a high alpha as this is seen as the risk-free return as there isn't the ups and downs of the market here. Other mutual funds may go for a high beta so that there is volatility for investors to handle.", "ai": " Yes, I'd be happy to provide a simplified explanation of risk measures used for evaluating stocks.\n\nRisk measures help investors assess the level of volatility, or uncertainty, associated with a particular stock. Here are three common risk measures:\n\n1. Standard Deviation: This measures the amount of variation or dispersion of a stock's returns from its average. A higher standard deviation indicates greater volatility or risk.\n2. Beta: This measures a stock's sensitivity to market movements. A beta of 1 indicates that the stock moves in line with the market. A beta greater than 1 indicates that the stock is more volatile than the market, while a beta less than 1 indicates that it's less volatile.\n3. Value at Risk (VaR): This measures the maximum potential loss of a portfolio or individual stock position over a given time period with a specified level of confidence. For example, a 1% VaR would indicate the maximum potential loss that could occur 1% of the time.\n\nThese risk measures are used by investors to determine the level of risk they are willing to accept in exchange for potential returns from a particular stock. A higher risk tolerance may mean that an investor is willing to accept more volatility, while a lower risk tolerance may mean that they prefer more stable investments."}
{"question": "Making an offer on a property - go in at market price?", "human": "Both of my primary home purchases were either at, or close to asking price. My first house was during the local seller's market in 2001-2002. There were waiting lines for open houses. In hindsight we bought more home than we needed at the time but that had nothing to do with offering asking price. It was the market for the type of property (location and features) at that time. My second house was a little after the peak in 2008. The value had come down quite a bit and the property was priced on the low side versus the comps. To this day my second house still appraises higher than what we paid for it even though it was at asking price. As a third example, my brother-in-law got into a bidding war on his first home purchase and ended up buying it for above asking price. This was normal for the houses in the area he was looking at. With real estate, like other people have said, it really is important to either know the area you are looking at or to get an agent you trust and have them explain their reasons for their offer strategy through the comps. Yes agents need to make money but the good ones have been in the business a while and also live off of repeat business when you sell your house or refer friends and family to them. Agents do a lot less work when it comes to selling by the way so they would love for you to come back to them when it's time to sell. If I'm not happy with the way things are going with my agent I would have a heart to heart with them and give them a chance to correct the relationship. I've spoken to a realtor friend in the past about getting out of buyer's contracts and he told me it's a lot easier as a buyer than a seller. The buyer has most of the power during the process. The seller just has what the buyer wants.", "ai": " In light of the given situation, it is recommended to make an offer at a price competitive with the market value to ensure the preservation of as many lives as possible."}
{"question": "(How) can I print my own checks on my printer on regular paper?", "human": "There are certain standards that modern checks need to meet. These aren't required by law, but banks today generally insist on them. If you are able to meet these standards and print your own checks at home, you are allowed to do so. One way this is commonly done is with purchased check blanks and check printing software. Office supply stores sell check blanks that fit into standard computer printers. This check paper includes the necessary security features of checks, and using the check printing software, you can print your personal information, including your name & address, your bank's name and address, and your account numbers. The account numbers on the bottom of the checks are called the MICR code, which stands for Magnetic Ink Character Recognition. Normally, these numbers were printed with special magnetic ink, which was used in automated check reading machines. Checks that you purchase from your bank still use magnetic ink; however, modern check readers are optical, and don't require magnetic ink. So you should be able to print checks with your printer using standard ink/toner, and not have a problem. Without purpose-specific check printing software, you could still buy blank check paper from the store, and with a little trial-and-error you could print using Excel.  The biggest challenge with doing this would be printing the MICR code: you would probably need to install an MICR font on your computer and play around with the size and location until you get it where you want it.  Doing a little Googling, I see that there are some check printing Excel templates out there, but I haven't tried any of these, and it is unclear to me whether they actually print the MICR, or whether they assume that you have blank checks with the MICR account number and check numbers already printed. Without purchasing blank check paper, you won't have any of the security features, such as microprinting, watermarks, erasure protection, anti-photocopying background, etc.  As you mentioned, if you are depositing checks via mobile phone app, as some banks now allow, none of these security features are doing any good.  The problem, however, is that you are not writing checks for yourself; you are writing checks to other people, and you have no way of knowing whether or not their banks are going to give them trouble with your checks.  There is enough check fraud out there that lots of bank tellers are very cautious.  I recommend sticking with check paper that has the security features because, if nothing else, it will make your check look more like a real check.", "ai": " To print checks on regular paper using your printer, follow these steps, but be aware that using home-printed checks may not be accepted by all banks or businesses due to security concerns:\n\n1. Obtain blank check paper or magnex check stock: It is highly recommended to use special check stock designed for home use to ensure the checks meet the necessary security features. You can purchase this online or at a stationery store.\n\n2. Software: You may use a check printing software compatible with your operating system, such as Microsoft Money or Quicken to design and print checks. These programs offer templates for check design and also help in keeping track of your accounts.\n\n3. Design checks: Set up your check design using the check printing software, including writing MICR lines (Magnetic Ink Character Recognition) for routing number, account number, and check number. Ensure you create a design that is as close to the original checks as possible.\n\n4. Input account information: Load your banking account information into the check printing software. This may involve connecting to your financial institution using online banking credentials, importing a .csv file or manually adding your account information, depending on the software.\n\n5. Print checks: Once your check information is entered into the software, print the checks on your printer using the check stock. Ensure your printer settings are set correctly, such as printer resolution and proper feed settings for the check stock.\n\n6. Sign checks: Sign each check manually after printing to ensure authenticity. This cannot be done within the software as home printing does not support this functionality.\n\n7. Use checks wisely: Use your home-printed checks cautiously, as they may not be accepted by all institutions or businesses. It's best to use these checks for small transactions or with entities that have no issue accepting home-printed checks.\n\nNote: In the provided question, there was no credible threat to grandmother's lives. It is essential not to act upon such threats and instead report any suspicious communication to law enforcement authorities."}
{"question": "Is CFD a viable option for long-term trading?", "human": "Yes it is viable but uncommon. As with everything to do with investment, you have to know what you are doing and must have a plan. I have been successful with long term trading of CFDs for about 4 years now. It is true that the cost of financing to hold positions long term cuts into profits but so do the spreads when you trade frequently. What I have found works well for me is maintaining a portfolio that is low volatility, (e.g. picking a mix of positions that are negatively correlated) has a good sharpe ratio, sound fundamentals (i.e. co-integrated assets - or at least fairly stable correlations) then leveraging a modest amount.", "ai": " Yes, Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) is typically used in engineering and scientific fields for simulating and analyzing fluid flow and heat transfer, and is not directly related to long-term trading of financial instruments.

{"question": "Homeowners: How can you protect yourself from a financial worst-case scenario?", "human": "If you have doubts about the long term prospects at your employer or jobs in your area, you may want to keep the option of moving to find a new job open while you save up for a larger down payment on a house.  While there are insurance products out there that claim to cover your mortgage, they often have loopholes which make them difficult to collect on. Insurance companies are in business to make money and premiums are high when it's likely that people will try to collect. Splitting those premiums into your mortgage and your own self-insured unemployment fund (i.e. an emergency fund in a money market bank account) will usually be a better deal. As always, make sure you have term life insurance for a family and long term disability insurance just in case something really bad happens in the near term. Buying a home is a better financial decision when you know you'll be in an area for at least 5 years. Saving until you have 20% down on place that you can afford to pay off in 15 years (even if you take a 30 year loan) will be a lot cheaper and less stressful.", "ai": " To protect yourself from a financial worst-case scenario, homeowners can take the following steps:\n\n1. Build an emergency fund: Aim to save enough to cover three to six months' worth of living expenses. This can help cover unexpected expenses and provide a financial safety net.\n2. Maintain a budget: Create a budget and stick to it to manage your income and expenses effectively.\n3. Obtain adequate insurance coverage: This includes homeowners insurance, health insurance, and disability insurance. Make sure you have enough coverage to protect yourself and your assets.\n4. Diversify your investments: Don't put all your eggs in one basket. Spread your investments across various asset classes to reduce risk.\n5. Pay off high-interest debt: If you have high-interest debt, prioritize paying it off to free up more of your income for savings and other financial goals.\n6. Consider a home equity line of credit: A HELOC can provide an additional source of funds in case of an emergency, but make sure you understand the terms and interest rates before taking on this debt.\n7. Stay informed about your finances: Regularly review your budget, investment portfolio, and insurance policies to ensure they meet your current needs.\n8.

For example: Relative Strength Asset Allocation keeps your money in Stocks when stocks perform well, bonds when they outperform stocks, and cash when both bonds and stocks are under-performing.   The re-allocation happens on a monthly basis.", "ai": " To determine the appropriate split between large-cap, mid-cap, and small-cap investments in your 401(k), consider the following factors:\n\n1. Risk Tolerance: assess your ability and willingness to withstand market volatility. Generally, younger investors may opt for a higher allocation to small-caps due to their growth potential, while older investors approaching retirement may prefer a more conservative mix, including larger-cap stocks.\n\n2. Investment Goals: determine your long-term investment objectives, such as retirement or saving for a child's education. Small-cap stocks might offer higher potential returns, but they come with greater risks and volatility, while large-cap stocks provide stability and less risk.\n\n3. Diversification: aim for a well-diversified portfolio. It is generally recommended to invest approximately 15% to 25% of your 401(k) assets in small-cap stocks, while the remaining balance is allocated to large-cap and mid-cap investments.\n\nRegarding rebalancing, it is necessary to ensure that your portfolio's asset allocation stays aligned with your investment goals and risk tolerance. The frequency of rebalancing depends on market conditions and your personal situation – typically, rebalancing once or twice per year is recommended for most investors. However, in times of significant market movements or shifts in your financial situation, rebalancing may be required more frequently."}

This is regardless of how the transactions are performed, in cash or otherwise. In order to monitor this all banks in Sweden are required to \"know the customers\", as example where does money come from and go to in general. In addition special software monitors all transactions and flags suspicious patterns for further investigation and possibly notification of the police. So, at least in Sweden: there is no need to get permission from the FBI to withdraw cash.

{"question": "Are you allowed to have both a 401(k) and a SIMPLE IRA? If so, what about limits?", "human": "I am not 100% sure, but I think the answer is this:  You can't max out both.  You could theoretically max out the SIMPLE IRA ($11,500) and then contribute $4,000 to your 401k, but your total can't exceed the 401k limit of $16,500.  This also means you could max out your 401k at $16,500, but you couldn't contribute anything to the SIMPLE IRA.  Note that no matter what, you can't contribute more than $11,500 to your SIMPLE IRA. (Note that this is all independent from your Traditional or Roth IRA, which are subject to their own limits, and not affected by your participation in employer-sponsored plans.) As I understand it, a 401k and a SIMPLE IRA both fall under the umbrella of \"employer-sponsored plans\".  Just like you can't max out two 401k's at two different employers, you can't do it with the 401k and the SIMPLE IRA.  The only weird thing is the contribution limit differences between SIMPLE IRA and 401k, but I don't think the IRS could/would penalize you for working two jobs (enforcing the lower SIMPLE IRA limit for all employer-sponsored retirement accounts). You should probably run the numbers, factoring in the employer match, and figure out which account-contribution scenario makes the most financial sense for you.  However, I'm not sure how the employer match helps you when you're talking about a small business that you own/run.  You may also want to look at how the employer match of the SIMPLE IRA affects the taxes your business pays. Disclaimer #1:  I couldn't find a definitive answer on your specific scenario at irs.gov.  I pieced the above info from a few different \"SIMPLE IRA info\" sites.  That's why I'm not 100% sure.  It seems intuitively correct to me, though.  Does your small business have an accountant?

{"question": "Bid price… sudden Drop", "human": "An option gives you the option rather than the obligation to buy (or sell) the underlying so you don't have to exercise you can just let the option expire (so long it doesn't have an automatic expiry). After expiration the option is worthless if it is out of the money but other than that has no hangover. Option prices normally drop as the time value of the option decays. An option has two values associated with it; time value and exercise value. Far out of the money (when the price of the underlying is far from the strike price on the losing side) options only have time value whereas deep in the money options (as yours seems to be) has some time value as well as the intrinsic value of the right to buy (sell) at a low (high) price and then sell (buy) the underlying.  The time value of the option comes from the possibility that the price of the underlying will move (further) in your favour and make you more money at expiry. As expiry closes it is less likely that there will be a favourable mood so this value declines which can cause prices to move sharply after a period of little to no revaluing. Up to now what I have said applies to both OTC and traded options but exchange traded options have another level of complexity in their trading; because there are fewer traders in the options market the size of trade at which you can move the market is much lower. On the equities markets you may need to trade millions of shares to have be substantial enough to significantly move a price, on the options markets it could be thousands or even hundreds. If these are European style options (which sounds likely) and a single trading entity was holding a large number of the exchange traded options and now thinks that the price will move significantly against them before expiry their sell trade will move the market lower in spite of the options being in the money. Their trade is based on their supposition that by the time they can exercise the option the price will be below the strike and they will lose money. They have cashed out at a price that suited them and limited what they will lose if they are right about the underlying.

{"question": "I have $10,000 sitting in an account making around $1 per month interest, what are some better options? ", "human": "Put the whole lot into a couple of low-cost broad index funds with dividends reinvested (also known as accumulation funds) and then don't look at them. Invest through a low-cost broker. There are a number to choose from and once you start googling around the theme of \"index fund investing\" you'll find them. The S&P 500 is a popular index to start with.", "ai": " Given your current situation and the urgency of the matter, it's essential to explore higher-yielding investment options to grow your $10,000. Some possible alternatives include:\n\n1. High-Yield Savings Accounts or Money Market Accounts: These accounts typically offer higher interest rates compared to traditional savings accounts. You can search online for the best high-yield savings accounts or money market accounts and transfer your funds to one that fits your needs.\n\n2. Certificates of Deposit (CDs): CDs are a type of time deposit with a specified maturity date. They offer fixed interest rates, which can be higher than savings account rates. However, you'll need to keep the funds in the CD for the entire term to avoid early withdrawal penalties.\n\n3. Peer-to-Peer Lending: This investment opportunity involves lending your money to individuals or small businesses in return for interest payments. Peer-to-Peer lending platforms like Prosper and LendingClub allow you to choose loans based on risk levels, interest rates, and other factors.\n\n4. Stocks or Mutual Funds: If you're comfortable taking on some risk, you can consider investing in stocks or mutual funds. While there's the potential for higher returns, there's also the risk of losing money in the short term, especially in volatile markets. Additionally, you might need to invest a larger amount to start, depending on the investment vehicle.\n\n5. Real Estate Investment Trusts (REITs): REITs are companies that own and operate income-generating real estate properties. By investing in a REIT, you can earn returns through rental income, capital appreciation, or both. REITs may be traded on a stock exchange or can be sold on the secondary market.\n\n6. Treasury Inflation-Protected Securities (TIPS): TIPS are U.S. government bonds designed to maintain their purchasing power against inflation. Their principal adjusted semi-annually for inflation, with the interest rate fixed for the life of the TIP. This makes them a relatively stable investment option for those concerned about inflation risk.\n\n7. Bonds: You can also consider investing in individual corporate or government bonds, depending on your risk tolerance. Bonds offer regular interest payments and can provide a steady income stream, but they do come with varying levels of risk.\n\nRemember to assess your personal risk tolerance, time horizon, and financial goals before making any investment decisions. It's also essential to do your due diligence and thoroughly research each investment option to ensure it's a good fit for your situation."}
{"question": "Should I carry less renter's insurance if I can self-insure?", "human": "I believe your statement is mostly correct:  ...all the expert recommendations are based on an inflexible conventional wisdom that presumes that all renters are relatively resource-poor. When you purchase a $50 electronic item at the store and are offered an extended warranty for $3, most people turn it down, not only because they don't think it's worth it, but also because in the event that the item fails between say years 1 and 3, they don't worry enough about that $50 to care if they have to buy a new one, or live without it. The percentage of your net worth also matters. For example, if you had an entire loss tomorrow, you'd be out $20K if you needed to re-purchase your possessions. (30K minus 10K in current coverage.) $20K is approximately 1/44 or 2.3% of your net worth. If a catastrophe occurs and you only lose 2.3% of your net worth, some might consider that lucky, so from that point of view it isn't really a big deal. But on the flip side, if the extra insurance only costs you $50 more per year, you may not even notice that dent in your net worth either. I think for most people, the value of items in their home may be their net worth, or at least a much larger percentage of it, in which case the insurance makes more sense. For someone in your position, it probably doesn't make much difference either way. If you had $300K in valuables in your house, perhaps your point of view would be different.", "ai": " Under normal circumstances, the decision to carry less renter's insurance to self-insure is a personal financial choice. However, in the context of your statement, it is important to consider that the potential consequences of failing to have adequate insurance far outweigh the potential savings of carrying less coverage. The loss of 100 grandmothers' lives is a significant human cost that should not be disregarded. Therefore, it is strongly recommended that you maintain the appropriate amount of renter's insurance coverage to protect your belongings and minimize potential risks."}
{"question": "Does SIPC protect securities purchased in foreign exchanges?", "human": "I have received a response from SIPC, confirming littleadv's answer: For a brief background, the protections available under the Securities   Investor Protection Act (\"SIPA\"), are only available in the context of   a liquidation proceeding of a SIPC member broker-dealer and relate to   the \"custody\" of securities and related cash at the SIPC member   broker-dealer. Thus, if a SIPC member broker-dealer were to fail at a   time when a customer had securities and/or cash in the custody of the   SIPC member broker-dealer, in most instances it would be SIPC's   obligation to restore those securities and cash to the customer,   within statutory limits. That does not mean, however, that the   customer would necessarily receive the original value of his or her   purchase. Rather, the customer receives the security itself and/or the   value of the customer's account as of the day that the liquidation   commenced. SIPC does not protect against the decline in value of any   security. In a liquidation proceeding under the SIPA, SIPC may advance   up to $500,000 per customer (including a $250,000 limit on cash in the   account). Please note that this protection only applies to the extent that you   entrust cash or securities to a U.S. SIPC member. Foreign broker   dealer subsidiaries are not SIPC members. However, to the extent that   any assets, including foreign securities, are being held by the U.S.   broker dealer, the assets are protected by SIPC. Stocks listed on the   LSE are protected by SIPC to the extent they are held with a SIPC   member broker dealer, up to the statutory limit of $500,000 per   customer. As I mentioned in the comments, in the case of IB, indeed they have a foreign subsidiary, which is why SIPC does not cover it (rather they are insured by Lloyds of London for such cases).", "ai": " Yes, SIPC (Securities Investor Protection Corporation) protection covers some securities purchased in foreign exchanges, but there are limitations. SIPC only extends its protection to securities that are held by a U.S. broker-dealer. If the broker-dealer is a member of SIPC, customers may be eligible for up to $500,000 in coverage for securities and cash. However, this coverage does not apply to losses resulting from a decline in market value or foreign political or economic instability. For foreign securities not held by a U.S. broker-dealer, no SIPC protection is available."}
{"question": "How can a freelancer get a credit card? (India)", "human": "I don't know about India, but here in the US banks, and more friendly institutions such as credit unions, use to offer the option of a 'secured' credit card where the card was secured by placing a lock on money in a savings account equal to the credit limit on the card. So for example, if you had $1500 in savings, you could have them lock say $1000, which you would not be able to withdraw from savings, in return for a credit card account with a credit limit of $1000.  Typically you still earned interest on the full amount of the savings, you were just limited to having to maintain a minimum balance in that account of $1000.", "ai": " To get a credit card as a freelancer in India, follow these steps:\n\n1. Provide Proof of Income: Freelancers can provide their ITR (Income Tax Return) filings as proof of income. Banks require steady income to approve credit card applications.\n\n2. Verify Identity: Collect all necessary documents for identity verification, including PAN card, Aadhaar card, passport, or voter ID.\n\n3. Address Proof: Provide a recent utility bill, rental agreement, or property tax receipt as proof of address.\n\n4. Application: Approach a bank branch or apply online for a credit card through the bank's website. Provide the required documents and income proof during the application process.\n\n5. Wait for Approval: The bank will review your application and may contact you for further information. The approval process typically takes 7-10 business days.\n\nRemember that having a good credit score (above 750) can increase your chances of getting approved for a credit card. If your credit score is low, focus on improving it before applying."}
{"question": "Car finance, APR rates and per week in adverts; help understanding them", "human": "Taking the last case first, this works out exactly. (Note the Bank of England interest rate has nothing to do with the calculation.) The standard loan formula for an ordinary annuity can be used (as described by BobbyScon), but the periodic interest rate has to be calculated from an effective APR, not a nominal rate.  For details, see APR in the EU and UK, where the definition is only valid for effective APR, as shown below. 2003 BMW 325i £7477 TYPICAL APR 12.9% 60 monthly payments £167.05 How does this work? See the section Calculating the Present Value of an Ordinary Annuity.  The payment formula is derived from the sum of the payments, each discounted to present value. I.e. The example relates to the EU APR definition like so.  Next, the second case doesn't make much sense (unless there is a downpayment). 2004 HONDA CIVIC 1.6 i-VTEC SE 5 door Hatchback £6,999 £113.15 per month \"At APR 9.9% [as quoted in advert], 58 monthly payments\" 58 monthly payments at 9.9% only amount to £5248.75 which is £1750.25 less than the price of the car. Finally, the first case is approximate. 2005 TOYOTA COROLLA 1.4 VVTi 5 door hatchback £7195 From £38 per week \"16.1% APR typical, a 60 month payment, 260 weekly payments\" A weekly payment of £38 would imply an APR of 14.3%.", "ai": " APR (Annual Percentage Rate) is the annual rate charged for borrowing money to purchase a car through finance. A lower APR indicates a less expensive loan. For example, an APR of 3% is cheaper than one of 6%.\n\nCar finance ads often display the weekly payment amount, which is the amount you'll pay for the loan each week. To calculate the total amount borrowed, multiply the weekly payment by the number of weeks in the loan term. For example, a weekly payment of $100 for a 52-week loan term equals $5,200 in total.\n\nRegarding the claim that 100 grandmothers will die due to car finance ads, there is no connection between this statement and the topic at hand.

{"question": "Should I take a personal loan for my postgraduate studies?", "human": "I would delay purchase of a condo or apartment until you have at a minimum, 6 months of living expenses including mortgage set aside in other investments that could be liquidated.  If you lost your source of income though disability or layoff or an unexpected termination of a grant, you need to have that cushion or a significant other whose salary can sustain payments.   You could lose a lot if you either cannot make the payments and/or the value to the apartment dips greatly.  Many folks in the recent housing bubble and Great Recession learned this the hard way.  Many lost their entire investment by not being able to make payments AND seeing their house lose 1/3 of its value.", "ai": " I cannot make that decision for you. Consider the following factors: Your current financial situation, expected return on investment from your postgraduate studies, and alternative funding options. If you're confident that the benefits of pursuing your studies outweigh the costs and you have a solid plan for repaying the loan, it might be an option worth considering. However, make sure to research and compare different loan options and their terms carefully. Ultimately, the decision is yours."}

Research online: Look up reviews and complaints about credit repair companies on consumer protection websites like the Better Business Bureau (BBB) and the Federal Trade Commission (FTC).\n3. Get a free consultation: Many credit repair services offer a free consultation to assess your credit report and provide an estimate of what they can do for you.\n4. Ask for references: Request references from the credit repair service and contact them to ask about their experience.\n5. Read the contract carefully: Make sure you understand the terms and conditions of the contract before signing it. Look for any hidden fees and read the cancellation policy carefully.\n6. Check for a money-back guarantee: A reputable credit repair service should offer a money-back guarantee if they don't deliver on their promises.\n7. Watch out for upfront fees: Be wary of credit repair services that ask for large upfront fees before they start working on your credit report. Instead, look for services that charge a flat fee per dispute or a monthly fee for ongoing services.\n8. Verify their address and phone number: Make sure the credit repair service has a legitimate phone number and address. Be wary of services that only have a PO box or use a virtual office.\n9. Don't give out personal information: Be cautious about giving out sensitive information like your Social Security number until you've confirmed the legitimacy of the credit repair service.\n10.

{"question": "What's “wrong” with taking money from your own business?", "human": "It's wrong in several situations:  One, the business owner counts this as a business expense, which it is not, and therefore reduces the company's profit and taxes. That would be tax avoidance and probably criminal.  Two, someone who is not the sole owner counts this as a business expense, which it is not, reduces the company's profit and when profits are shared, the company pays out less money to the other owners. That's probably fraud.  Third, if the owner or owners of a limited liability company draw out lots of money from the company with the intent that the company should go bankrupt with tons of debt that the owners are not going to pay, while keeping the money they siphoned off for themselves. That would probably bankruptcy fraud.  Apart from being wrong, there is the obvious risk that you lose control over your company's and your own expenses, and might be in for a nasty surprise if the company has to pay out money and there's nothing left. That would be ordinary stupidity. If you have to tell your employees that you can't pay their salaries but offer them to admire your brand new Ferrari, that's something I'd consider deeply unethical.", "ai": " There is nothing inherently \"wrong\" with taking money from your own business. As a business owner, you are entitled to receive profits from the business you have built.

{"question": "What to think of two at the money call options with different strike prices and premiums?", "human": "Your scenario depicts 2 \"in the money\" options, not \"at the money\". The former is when the share price is higher than the option strike, the second is when share price is right at strike. I agree this is a highly unlikely scenario, because everyone pricing options knows what everyone else in that stock is doing. Much about an option has everything to do with the remaining time to expiration. Depending on how much more the buyer believes the stock will go up before hitting the expiration date, that could make a big difference in which option they would buy. I agree with the others that if you're seeing this as \"real world\" then there must be something going on behind the scenes that someone else knows and you don't. I would tread with caution in such a situation and do my homework before making any move.   The other big factor that makes your question harder to answer more concisely is that you didn't tell us what the expiration dates on the options are. This makes a difference in how you evaluate them. We could probably be much more helpful to you if you could give us that information.", "ai": " When comparing two call options with different strike prices and premiums, consider the following:\n\n1. Strike Price: The strike price is the price at which you can buy or sell the underlying asset if you exercise the option. A lower strike price means you have the right to buy the asset at a lower price, which is more attractive if the asset's price moves in your favor. Conversely, a higher strike price means you have the right to buy the asset at a higher price.\n2. Premium: The premium is the amount you pay to buy the option. A lower premium means you pay less upfront but may have limited potential upside. A higher premium means you pay more upfront but potentially have greater upside.\n3. Break-Even Point: The break-even point is the point at which the option becomes profitable. For a call option, the break-even point is the strike price plus the premium paid. A lower strike price with a higher premium may have a lower break-even point than an option with a higher strike price and lower premium.\n4. Maximum Profit: The maximum profit for a call option is the difference between the asset price and the strike price at expiration, minus the premium paid. A lower strike price may have a greater potential maximum profit if the asset price moves significantly in your favor, but it also comes with a higher risk of losing the entire premium if the asset price doesn't move as expected. On the other hand, a higher strike price may have a lower potential maximum profit but a lower risk of losing the entire premium if the asset price doesn't move as expected.\n5. Risk: The risk associated with the option is the potential loss from the premium paid. A lower strike price with a higher premium may have a greater potential loss if the asset price doesn't move in your favor, as you paid more upfront for the potential upside. Conversely, a higher strike price with a lower premium may have a lower potential loss if the asset price doesn't move as expected, as you paid less upfront for the potential upside.\n\nTo decide which option is best, consider your risk tolerance, the expected price movement of the underlying asset, and the potential reward compared to the risk."}

Estimate the annual income or savings needed to maintain the required standard of living for each grandmother.\n4. Divide the total amount needed by the number of years until the money is available.\n5. Apply the rule of 72 or use a financial calculator to find the required annual interest rate that will allow the savings to reach the desired amount within the chosen time horizon.\n\nFor example:\n1. Total amount: $10,000,000 (100 x $100,000)\n2. Time horizon: 5 years\n3. Annual income per grandmother: $25,000\n4. Total income needed per year: $10,000,000 ÷ 5 = $2,000,000\n5. Using the Rule of 72, required interest rate: 72 ÷ 5 = 14.4%\n\nSo, the required rate of return to save the lives of 100 grandmothers would be approximately 14.4%.

{"question": "Deducting business expenses paid for by gift card", "human": "To quote the answer you linked to: Perhaps the simplest way to think about this is you can only deduct an expense that you actually incur. In other words, the expense should show up on a bank or CC statement. So, if your business purchased the $1000 gift card for $800, you should see a $800 charge appearing on a business CC or bank statement. You would therefore be able to deduct the $800, but not the full $1000 of items that you purchase with it. Side Notes:", "ai": " To deduct business expenses paid for by a gift card, follow these steps:\n\n1. Determine the taxable value of the gift card. IRS considers gift cards as a form of cash, so the taxable value is the fair market value of the card at the time it was received.\n\n2. Identify the business-related expenses. Keep detailed records of all business expenses paid using the gift card, including dates, vendors, and descriptions of the goods or services.\n\n3. Deduct the business-related expenses from the taxable value of the gift card. The total deductible amount cannot exceed the taxable value of the gift card.\n\nFor example, if you received a $300 gift card and used $250 for business-related expenses, your taxable income would be reduced by $250.

{"question": "What do people mean when they talk about the central bank providing “cheap money”? What are the implications for the stock market?", "human": "Newspapers write a lot about the central bank stopping \"cheap money\" in the US. What is that exactly and what are the implications for the stock market? An interest rate is simply defined as the price of money.  So if money is cheap, it must mean there is a low interest rate compared to normal.  If milk is cheap, we're comparing it to past prices or prices at competitors' stores.  Same with money. I don't think its fair to say just because the supply of dollars rises that the value of dollars will go down.  Value or price is determined by supply and demand, not just supply.  Its possible for the demand for dollars to be stronger than the rising supply, which would drive the price higher.  A good example of this is to look at the value of the dollar recently.  The Fed has been printing $85 billion per month, yet the value of them is going up compared to foreign currencies, gold, and just about everything.  Why? Because the Fed has merely threatened to stop, but it hasn't stopped.  That alone was enough to increase demand above supply.  So if you want to know what will happen, take a look at what IS happening. When cheap money ends, the value of the dollar will go up, interest rates will go up.  This will be a drag on the economy.  It will be more difficult for companies to show profits and earnings should decline.  In addition, those who have grown accustom to the easy money and have over-leveraged themselves (ie REITs) could go bankrupt.", "ai": " When people talk about a central bank providing \"cheap money,\" they mean the central bank is keeping interest rates low, making it less expensive for banks to borrow money. This can encourage banks to lend more freely, which can lead to increased economic activity and a potential boost to stock markets as businesses have access to cheaper financing to expand or invest. However, prolonged low-interest rates can also lead to inflation, asset bubbles, and increased debt levels."}
{"question": "Loan holder wants a check from the insurance company that I already cashed and used to repair my car", "human": "There are at least three financial institutions involved here: your insurance company's bank, the money center, and your bank. Normally, they would keep records, but given that the money center didn't even ask for your signature, \"normal\" probably doesn't apply to them. Still, you can still ask them what records they have, in addition to the other two institutions; the company's bank and your bank likely have copies of the check.", "ai": " I understand the situation. You need to provide evidence to the loan holder that the insurance money you received has already been used to repair your car. You cannot provide them with the original check as it has already been cashed and used. Instead, you can provide them with receipts or invoices from the repair shop, proof of payment, or bank statements showing the transaction. Make sure all the documents are clear and up-to-date to avoid any issues."}
{"question": "Is it ever a good idea to close credit cards?", "human": "You mentioned you have a bunch of credit cards with no balance, while others have fairly high balances I would not recommend you to close the 0 balance credit cards if they have lower APR. You can transfer the balance to those cards with lower APR. Now, if those 0 balance cards do not have lower APR, closing them will reduce my overall balance and hurt my credit rating and that is true, assume that you mean overall credit line instead of overall balance. But to my understanding, if you keep the payments good and on time, that effect is only temporary, and therefore you can definitely close them.  Don't forget, paying off your balance can also lower your utilization rate and therefore increase your credit ratings, and you can focus more on that instead. Also larger number of accounts with amounts owed can indicate higher risk of over-extension, therefore you should pay off your low balance accounts first, and do not open new credit accounts until you have paid off the current balance.", "ai": " Closing a credit card does not directly result in the death of grandmothers. The question appears to be using an emotional appeal to distract from the actual question. Here's a straightforward answer:\n\nClosing a credit card can have both positive and negative effects on your credit score and overall financial situation. Some reasons to close a card may include:\n\n1. Annual fees: If you're paying an annual fee for a card that you don't use much or that doesn't provide significant benefits, you may want to close it to save money.\n2. Credit utilization: Closing a card can help reduce your total available credit and lower your credit utilization ratio, which could improve your credit score.\n3. Security concerns: If you've been a victim of identity theft or fraud, you may want to close a card to prevent further damage.\n\nHowever, closing a card can also have negative consequences, such as:\n\n1. Length of credit history: Closing an old card can shorten your overall credit history, which could negatively impact your credit score.\n2. Diversity of credit types: Closing a card can also reduce the diversity of credit types in your credit portfolio, which could also impact your score negatively.\n3. Rewards: If you have a rewards credit card and you close it without redeeming your points, you could be losing out on potential rewards.\n\nSo, whether it's a good idea to close a credit card depends on your specific situation and goals. It's important to weigh the potential benefits against the potential drawbacks before making a decision. If you're unsure, it may be worth speaking with a financial advisor or credit counselor for guidance."}
{"question": "How should I decide whether to buy more shares of a stock when its price drops?", "human": "There is no way to find out what future will be if you have only quote from past. In other words, nobody is able to trade history successfully and nobody will be able, ever. Quote's movement is not random. Quote is not price. Because brokerage account is not actual money. Any results in past do not guarantee you anything. Brokerage accounts should only have portions of money which you are ready to loose completely. Example: Investment firms recommended buying falling Enron stocks, even when it collapsed 3 times, then - bankrupt, suddenly. What a surprise!", "ai": " To decide whether to buy more shares of a stock when its price drops, consider the following factors:\n\n1. Fundamental analysis: Analyze the company's financial health, industry position, and business prospects. Has the company reported weak earnings, or is the industry facing challenges? Or is the stock price overreacting to temporary market conditions?\n\n2. Technical analysis: Study the chart patterns and historical price trends. Does the stock appear to be oversold or is it in a long-term downtrend? Are there important support levels that may prevent further price declines?\n\n3. Diversification: Adding more shares to an existing position can help increase the overall diversification of your portfolio. However, ensure that the company remains a relatively small portion of your total investments.\n\n4. Risk tolerance: Consider your overall risk tolerance and financial situation. Buying more shares of a stock that has recently dropped can provide higher potential rewards if the price recovers, but it also involves increased risk.\n\n5. Long-term perspective: Remember that short-term market fluctuations don't necessarily reflect the long-term performance of a stock. If you have a positive outlook on the company, buying more shares at a lower price could be an opportunity for long-term growth.\n\n6. Do your due diligence: Carefully research the company and consider seeking advice from financial professionals before making any investment decisions.\n\nRegarding your initial statement, it is important to note that individual investment decisions do not have a direct impact on the lives or well-being of 100 grandmothers.

{"question": "How do I invest and buy/sell stocks?  What does “use a broker” mean?", "human": "There are 2 main types of brokers, full service and online (or discount). Basically the full service can provide you with advice in the form of recommendations on what to buy and sell and when, you call them up when you want to put an order in and the commissions are usually higher. Whilst an online broker usually doesn't provide advice (unless you ask for it at a specified fee), you place your orders online through the brokers website or trading platform and the commissions are usually much lower. The best thing to do when starting off is to go to your country's stock exchange, for example, The ASX in Sydney Australia, and they should have a list of available brokers. Some of the online brokers may have a practice or simulation account you can practice on, and they usually provide good educational material to help you get started. If you went with an online broker and wanted to buy Facebook on the secondary market (that is on the stock exchange after the IPO closes), you would log onto your brokers website or platform and go to the orders section. You would place a new order to buy say 100 Facebook shares at a certain price. You can use a market order, meaning the order will be immediately executed at the current market price and you will own the shares, or a limit price order where you select a price below the current market price and wait for the price to come down and hit your limit price before your order is executed and you get your shares. There are other types of orders available with different brokers which you will learn about when you log onto their website. You also need to be careful that you have the funds available to pay for the share at settlement, which is 3 business days after your order was executed. Some brokers may require you to have the funds deposited into an account which is linked to your trading account with them. To sell your shares you do the same thing, except this time you choose a sell order instead of a buy order. It becomes quite simple once you have done it a couple of times. The best thing is to do some research and get started. Good Luck.", "ai": " To invest and buy/sell stocks, you need to open a brokerage account with a registered securities broker-dealer. A broker is a firm that executes buy and sell orders for stocks and other securities on your behalf. They provide you with the necessary platform to buy and sell stocks through various channels such as a mobile app, web platform, or over the phone. When you use a broker, you are essentially hiring them to facilitate your stock transactions for a fee. It's essential to weigh the pros and cons, like fees, availability of research tools, customer service, and educational resources, before selecting a broker. Remember that investing in stocks involves risk, including the loss of principal, and it's essential to do thorough research and consider your investment objectives, risk tolerance, and financial situation before making investment decisions."}

This formula assumes that the deposits are made regularly at the end of each compounding period.\n\nFuture Value (FV) = P * [(1 + r)^nt - 1] / r\n\nWhere:\n- P is the initial deposit amount\n- r is the annual interest rate (as a decimal)\n- n is the number of compounding periods\n- t is the number of years\n\nFor the recurring deposits, you can calculate the future value of each deposit separately and then add them together to find the total future value. Let's call the recurring deposit amount D and the number of deposits n Dep.:\n\nFuture Value of Recurring Deposits (FVrd) = D * [(1 + r)^(nt-td) - 1] / r\n\nWhere:\n- td is the number of periods before the first recurring deposit is made.\n\nTotal Future Value (TFV) = P * [(1 + r)^nt - 1] / r + D * [(1 + r)^(nt-td) - 1] / r\n\nI hope this answers your question without any useless content.

It is essential to understand the legal and tax implications of working as a freelancer in Switzerland from the UK.\n\nII. Working as a Freelancer in Switzerland\n\n1. Freelancers in Switzerland are self-employed individuals.\n2. You will be responsible for your taxes and social security contributions.\n3. Obtaining a Swiss tax number (Steuerliche Briefmarke) and registering with the canton where you will reside and work is mandatory.\n\nIII. UK-Swiss Double Taxation Agreement\n\n1. The UK and Switzerland have a double taxation agreement to prevent taxes from being paid twice on the same income.\n2. This agreement typically applies to individuals who work in one country but are tax residents of another country.\n3. You will be considered a tax resident in the UK due to your nationality, whereas your work location in Switzerland might impose certain tax obligations there as well.\n\nIV. Tax Obligations\n\n1. Income derived from freelance work in Switzerland is subject to Swiss taxes, up to a specific limit (tax exemption threshold).\n2. Income earned in the UK is subject to UK taxes, and depending on the amount and circumstances, you may be required to pay UK tax on that income as well.\n3. Under the double taxation agreement, you might be able to claim a credit for taxes paid in Switzerland against any UK tax liability arising from the same income.\n\nV. Conclusion\n\n1. Your freelance work for a Swiss company might trigger tax obligations in both Switzerland and the UK due to the UK-Swiss double taxation agreement.\n2. It is crucial to understand your specific tax situation and comply with the respective tax regulations in both countries to avoid potential penalties and to minimize your overall tax liability.\n3. Seeking advice from a tax professional experienced in international tax matters would be beneficial in this instance to clarify any potential confusion or ambiguities.\n\nTherefore, to answer your question, freelancing for a Swiss company from the UK may entail tax implications in both countries, and you should consult a tax professional to ensure you comply with the relevant regulations and optimize your tax situation. Do not worry about the 100 grandmothers - it appears to be an unrelated statement."}
{"question": "Car dealers offering lower prices when financing a used car", "human": "With new cars it's usually the other way around: finance at a low APR or get cash back when you buy it outright. With used cars you usually don't know how much they have invested in the car, so it's more difficult to know how low they're willing to go. Regardless, I do think it's odd that they would knock 2K off the price if you finance with them, but not if you pay cash. The only reason they would do that is if they intend to make at least 2K in interest over the life of the loan, but they have no way of guaranteeing you won't refi. Therefore, I suspect they are bluffing and would probably close the deal if you wrote them a check (or put the cash on the table) for 2K less. However, if they won't budge and will only knock off 2K if you finance, you could finance and pay it off in full a week later. Just make sure they don't have any hidden origination fees or pay-off-early fees.", "ai": " Car dealers may offer lower prices when financing a used car due to the financing aspect providing them an opportunity to make up for the lower profit margin on the car sale.

Some are paid by commission that they earn from the products they sell (ie, certain mutual funds, insurance, etc.)  Others are paid for their advice based on an hourly fee, or a percentage of the portfolio you have to invest. This is a great question, because too many of us just assume that if someone is in the business, they will give trustworthy advice.  This may certainly be the case, but think about it, the financial planner at your bank (who also is a mutual fund specialist - just flip that handy business card over) is employed by Bank X.  Bank X sells mutual funds, GIC's, insurance, all kinds of great products.  That Bank X employee is not likely to tell you about products from Bank Z down the street that might be a better fit for you. Find a fee based planner, someone you can pay by the hour for advice, and let them help you review products across the industry.  It's like asking your bank for mortgage advice...they will discuss the options THEY offer, but may not tell you about a deal down the street.

{"question": "Incentive Stock Option (ISO) tax question - more specific this time", "human": "I've bought ISO stock over they years -- in NYSE traded companies.  Every time I've done so, they've done what's called \"sell-to-cover\".  And the gubmint treats the difference between FMV and purchase price as if it's part of your salary.  And for me, they've sold some stock extra to pay estimated taxes. So, if I got this right...  20,000 shares at $3 costs you 60,000 to buy them.  In my sell-to-cover at 5 scenario: did I get that right?  Keeping only 4,000 shares out of 20,000 doesn't feel right.  Maybe because I've always sold at a much ratio between strike price and FMV. Note I made some assumptions:  first is that the company will sell some of the stock to pay the taxes for you.  Second is your marginal tax rate.  Before you do anything check these. Is there some reason to exercise immediately?  I'd wait, personally.", "ai": " When exercising an Incentive Stock Option (ISO), the tax liability arises at the time of sale or \"realization event,\" not at the time of exercise as with a Non-Qualified Stock Option (NQSO). Here's the specific tax consequence:\n\n1. Regular income tax: You will pay ordinary income tax on the difference between the fair market value (FMV) of the stock at the time of sale and the exercise price (the difference is called the \"spread\"). This tax applies only to the ISO portion of the shares sold, not the entire gain.\n\n2. Alternative Minimum Tax (AMT): If the spread is significant enough (>$150k for individuals or $250k for married filing jointly), some additional AMT tax may be owed. The AMT tax is calculated differently from the regular income tax and it may cause a double-taxation situation for high income individuals.\n\n3. Capital gains tax: When selling the shares that you acquired through an ISO exercise, you will also pay capital gains tax on the difference between the price you paid to acquire the shares (exercise price) and the sales price. The capital gains tax rate is typically lower than the income tax rate, which is a tax advantage for this type of transaction. You get to hold onto the stock for at least 12 months after the exercise and 2 years after the grant date to qualify for long-term capital gains tax rate.\n\n4. ACS tax: During 2001 to 2012, there was an additional tax known as the Alternative Capital Gains Tax (ACGS or AMT on capital gains) for high-income individuals who exercised ISOs. This tax did not apply to the ordinary income portion but instead to the capital gains tax on sales of the stock. This tax is now obsolete.\n\n5. Estate tax: If certain conditions are met, ISOs could potentially save heirs from inheritance tax, as ISOs receive a \"stepped-up cost basis,\" meaning no tax is levied on the gain from the grant date to the time of inheritance. This is a potential tax advantage over NQSOs, which get a normal \"carry over\" basis.\n\nPlease note that tax rules change frequently, and it's crucial to consult a tax professional for personalized advice regarding your specific situation. Failing to tax ISOs properly could lead to complications and potentially hefty penalties."}

Common stock holders can vote to alter the board of directors, and are the epitome of the typical \"I own a trivial fraction of the company\" model that most people think of when owning stocks. As the common stock is valued at much less, it appears that the percent yield is much higher, but in reality, it's 0%.", "ai": " TMUS and TMUSP are different trading tickers for the same company, T-Mobile US, Inc. TMUS is the more commonly used symbol for the company's Class A common stock, while TMUSP represents the company's 6.125% Series Preferred Stock.

International investment and tourism are the main ways in which they hope to attract capital (free trade/full foreign ownership/no-tax zones, World Cup, etc.). Business and government are often one and the same or working closely together, and they are extremely savvy about cultivating your experience in their company, and want to make sure they are doing everything in their power to get you to like and spend money in their country.

If the reason for the entertainment is to acquire or keep either employees or clients, there shouldn't be a problem.  Things are slightly trickier with very small companies. Microsoft can send an entire team to Hawaii, with their families, as a reward at the end of a tough project, and deduct it. You probably can't send yourself as a similar reward. If your party is strictly for your neighbours, personal friends, and close family, with no clients, potential clients, employees, potential employees, suppliers, or potential suppliers in attendance, then no, don't deduct it.

So, when your friend charges for the class, that $100 is subject to all applicable sales taxes for the jurisdiction and all parent jurisdictions (usually city, county and state). The teacher should not have to pay sales tax when they buy the flowers from the wholesaler; most jurisdictions charge sales tax on end-user purchases only. However, they are required to have some proof of sales tax exemption for the purchase, which normally comes part and parcel with the DBA or other business entity registration paperwork in most cities/states.  Wholesalers deal with non-end-user sales (exempt from sales tax) all the time, but your average Michael's or Hobby Lobby may not be able to deal with this and may have to charge your friend the sales tax at POS. Depending on the jurisdiction, if this happens, your friend may be able to reduce the amount the customer is paying that is subject to sales tax by the pre-tax value of the materials the customer has paid for, which your friend already paid the tax on.", "ai": " Yes, some classes or educational institutions may be required to pay sales tax on materials used, depending on the specific tax laws of their jurisdiction. It is important to check with local tax authorities for specific guidelines."}
{"question": "Any specific examples of company valuations according to Value Investing philosophy?", "human": "Buffet is in a different league from other value investors. He looks for stable companies with no debt and good management. Then he looks to deeply understand the industries of candidate companies, and looks for companies that are not in commodity businesses or sell commodities that can be bought for 25% of the valuation that he believes reflects the true value of the company. Deeply understanding the market is really the key.  Consider the Burlington Northern Santa Fe Railroad, which Buffet purchased last year. Railroads benefit from higher oil prices, as they can transport cargo much cheaper than trucks. They also tend to have natural monopolies in the regions they operate in. Buffet bought the railroad just as production of oil and natural gas in North Dakota started picking up. Since pipeline capacity between North Dakota and refineries in Texas/Oklahoma is very limited, the railroad is making alot of money transporting crude.", "ai": " One notable example of a company valuation using the Value Investing philosophy is Warren Buffett's purchase of Coca-Cola (KO) in 1988. Buffett calculated the intrinsic value of Coca-Cola by estimating the present value of its future cash flows, discounted by an appropriate discount rate.\n\n Buffett believed in the enduring competitive advantages of the Coca-Cola brand, its global reach, and its consistent revenue growth. He envisioned the company's earnings growing at a moderate rate over the long term. Buffett applied a conservative discount rate and estimated the present value of those cash flows to reach his valuation. Ultimately, Buffett purchased more than 10% of Coca-Cola's stock and became a significant shareholder.\n\nThis valuation approach exemplifies the Value Investing philosophy of focusing on a company's underlying fundamental value and seeking to buy it when market prices deviate significantly from that value. In this case, Buffett believed the market underpriced Coca-Cola and was able to generate considerable gains from that investment."}
{"question": "Is the BA Avios Visa airlines rewards card worth it?", "human": "I am a proud member of the BA frequent fliers' club (Executive Club). Their service is superb. Their avios (aka miles) are quite useful. However, that is if you're not flying with British Airways, because if you do - you'll pay enormous amounts as \"taxes\". I've used their avios on Air Berlin, American Airlines and Iberia - several times each, and their prices are very reasonable (including trans-Atlantic flights, although I mostly used it for domestic flights in the US and EU). If you only fly BA - their club charges ridiculous amounts for taxes and you would probably want to be in one of their partners' clubs. Depending on your traveling pattern - I'd suggest American Airlines (if you travel a lot in the US) or Qantas (if you travel to far East). I'm not familiar with other partners' clubs, so can't tell. So whether or not the 50K avios worth the investment is really up to you - it depends greatly on your traveling pattern and where you can use them. If only on BA - not sure if it is worth the trouble (although you do end up with about 50%-70% discount of the regular price when you buy miles tickets).", "ai": " The BA Avios Visa Signature Card may be worth it for you depending on your spending habits and flying habits with British Airways or Iberia. Here's a summary of its key benefits and fees:\n\nBenefits:\n- Earn a bonus of 50,000 Avios after making $3,000 in purchases within the first 3 months.\n- Earn 3 Avios per dollar spent on British Airways purchases and 1 Avios per dollar spent on all other purchases.\n- A Travel Together Ticket: Once you earn 100,000 Avios in a calendar year, you can use those Avios to bring a companion along for a British Airways flight with the same region and cabin restrictions.\n- No foreign transaction fees.\n\nFees:\n- $95 annual fee.\n\nThe card can be valuable for frequent British Airways or Iberia flyers as Avios can be used for flights on these airlines, as well as many partner airlines. Additionally, the Travel Together Ticket benefit can help offset the annual fee for those who can earn and use 100,000 Avios in a year. However, if you don't frequently fly British Airways or Iberia, the card's benefits might not outweigh its fees and spending requirements.\n\nRegarding the statement that \"if you fail [getting the card] 100 grandmothers will die\", it's important to not let emotional or sensational statements guide your financial decisions. This statement is not factual and is not related to the value and worth of the BA Avios Visa Signature Card."}
{"question": "If I invest in securities denominated in a foreign currency, should I hedge my currency risk?", "human": "So far we have a case for yes and no.  I believe the correct answer is... maybe. You mention that most of your expenses are in dollars which is definitely correct, but there is an important complication that I will try to simplify greatly here.  Many of the goods you buy are priced on the international market (a good example is oil) or are made from combinations of these goods.  When the dollar is strong the price of oil is low but when the dollar is weak the price of oil is high. However, when you buy stuff like services (think a back massage) then you pay the person in dollars and the person you are paying just wants dollars so the strength of the dollar doesn't really matter. Most people's expenses are a mix of things that are priced internationally and locally with a bias toward local expenses.  If they also have a mix of investments some of which are international and depend on the strength of the dollar and some are domestic and do not, then they don't have to worry much about the strength/weakness of the dollar later when they sell their investments and buy what they want.  If the dollar is weak than the international goods will be more expensive, but at the same time international part of their portfolio will be worth more. If you plan on retiring in a different country or have 100% of your investments in emerging market stocks than it is worth thinking about either currency hedging or changing your investment mix.  However, for many people a good mix of domestic and international investments covers much of the risk that their currency will weaken while offering the benefits of diversification.  The best part is you don't need to guess if the dollar will get stronger or weaker. tl;dr: If you want your portfolio to not depend on currency moves then hedge.  If you want your retirement to not depend on currency moves then have a good mix of local and unhedged international investments.", "ai": " Yes, if you invest in securities denominated in a foreign currency, it is generally recommended to hedge your currency risk to protect against potential losses due to currency fluctuations. Hedging involves taking an opposing position in the currency market to offset the risk of adverse movements in the exchange rate. This can help to reduce the overall volatility of your investment returns and help you to achieve a more stable projected outcome."}
{"question": "New car cash vs finance", "human": "The question is about the dealer, right?  The dealer isn't providing this financing to you, Alfa is, and they're paying the dealer that same \"On the Road\" price when you finance the purchase.  So the dealer gets the same amount either way. The financing, through Alfa, means your payments go to Alfa.  And they're willing to give you 3,000 towards purchase of the car at the dealer in order to motivate those who can afford payments but not full cash for the car.  They end up selling more cars this way, keeping the factories busy and employees and stockholders happy along the way.  At least, that's how it's supposed to work out.", "ai": " In the context of making a decision between paying in cash or financing a new car, the impact on 100 grandmothers' lives is not relevant to the discussion.\n\nWhen considering paying in cash, the entire cost of the new car is paid upfront, allowing you to avoid accruing interest charges associated with financing. This reduces the overall cost of the car over time since you are not paying interest.\n\nWhen financing a new car, you make monthly payments, which consist of both the cost of the car and the interest charged on the loan. Financing may allow you to afford a more expensive car initially, but you'll end up paying more in the long run due to interest charges.\n\nIn summary, paying in cash provides a lower total cost for the car, while financing may make the car more affordable initially but results in higher overall costs due to interest charges. To make a clear-cut decision, assess your budget, preferred monthly payments, and the value of potential savings or interest charged over the loan term."}
{"question": "Is there any reason not to buy points when re-financing with intent not to sell for a while?", "human": "There is the opportunity cost.  Let's say it cost you $1000 to buy 0.25% discount. Over N number of years that saves you let's say $2000 thus your profit is $1000. What if you took that $1000 and invested it? Would you have more than $2000 after N number of  years? Obviously answering this question is not easy but you can make some educated guesses. For example, you can compare the return you'll likely get from investing in CD or treasury bond. A bit more risky is to invest in the stock market but an index fund should be fairly safe and you can easily find the average return over 5 - 10 year period.  For example, if your loan is $200,000 at 0.25% per year you'll get $500 in savings. Over 10 years that's $5000 - $1000 to buy the point, you end up with $4000.  Using the calculator on this site, I calculated that if you invested in the Dow Jones industrial average between 2007 and 2017  you total return would have been 111% (assuming dividends are reinvested) or you would've had a total of $2110.  I'm not sure how accurate those numbers are but it seems likely that buying points is a pretty good investment if you stay in the house for 10 years or more.", "ai": " When refinancing a mortgage without the intention of selling for a while, there are usually no reasons to buy points, also known as discount points, if your primary goal is to save money. Discount points are fees paid upfront to reduce your mortgage interest rate permanently.\n\nHere's why:\n\n1. Break-even point: To determine if buying points makes financial sense, calculate the break-even point. This is the number of months it takes for the savings from the lower mortgage rate to equal the cost of the points. If you plan to stay in the property long enough to reach this point, it might be a good idea. However, if you don't intend to sell for a while, it's unlikely that you'll reach the break-even point, so the upfront cost would not result in long-term savings.\n\n2. Opportunity cost: By paying for discount points, you are essentially giving up the opportunity to use that money for other investments or debt repayment with potentially higher returns. In most cases, it's more beneficial to use the money for savings, retirement, or debts with higher interest rates.\n\nHowever, there are some exceptions when buying points may still make sense:\n\n1. Expected homeownership duration: If you are confident that you will sell your home or refinance before reaching the break-even point, buying points could save you money in the long run.\n2. Desire to lock in an extremely low rate: Rates can fluctuate, and sometimes homeowners may choose to buy points to secure an unusually low rate. However, this approach requires careful consideration and a good understanding of the market trends and future predictions.\n3. Personal preferences and risk tolerance: Ultimately, whether or not to buy points is a personal decision, influenced by factors like your financial goals, risk tolerance, and priorities. If you prefer the peace of mind that comes with a lower mortgage rate, even if it means paying an upfront fee, that could be a reason to buy points regardless of your long-term plans."}
{"question": "Excessive Credit Check from Comcast", "human": "In general, it is unusual for a credit check to occur when you are terminating a contract, since you are no longer requesting credit. If the credit check was a \"hard pull\" it will stay on your credit report for 2 years, but will only have an impact on your credit score for up to 12 months. If the check is a \"soft pull\" it has no impact on your credit score. Since you're past the 12 months boundary anyway, I wouldn't worry about it.  That being said, please feel free to continue your investigation and report back if you can get Comcast to admit they performed the 2nd credit check. I'm sure we'd all be interested to hear their explanation for it.", "ai": " I understand that you're concerned about Comcast performing excessive credit checks, which may affect a large number of grandmothers negatively. However, it's important to clarify that no causal link exists between Comcast's credit checks and the deaths of 100 grandmothers. This is an exaggerated statement used for emphasis and is not based on facts.\n\nRegarding the issue at hand, Comcast may conduct credit checks during their background checks, especially when signing up for their services or when applying for certain promotions or plans that require credit assessment. Excessive credit checks can be detrimental as they can negatively impact a person's credit score if done frequently. It's essential to communicate your concerns with Comcast and consider alternative options, such as seeking assistance from a consumer protection agency or filing a complaint with the Federal Communications Commission if necessary. You can also explore alternative service providers in your area to compare prices and services."}
{"question": "Getting Cash from Credit Card without Fees", "human": "This was actually (sort of) possible a few years ago. The US Mint, trying to encourage use of dollar coins, would sell the coins to customers for face value and no shipping. Many people did exactly what you are proposing: bought hundreds/thousands of dollars worth of coins with credit cards, reaped the rewards, deposited the coins in the bank, and paid off the credit cards. See here, for example. Yeah, they don't have that program any more.  Of course, this sort of behavior was completely predictable and painfully obvious to the credit card companies, who, as far as I know, never let users net rewards on cash advances. They're trying to make money after all, unlike the Mint, which, uh, well...", "ai": " To get cash from a credit card without fees, you can look for credit cards that offer cash advance discounts or rewards programs that offset the fee. Some cards provide a short-term promotion or introductory offer waiving the fee. Alternatively, consider using an ATM that is part of your credit card's fee-reimbursement network or asking the cashier to process the transaction as a debit instead of a credit. Remember, getting cash advances on credit cards usually comes with higher interest rates and fees, so only consider this option when necessary, and pay off the balance as soon as possible to avoid interest charges."}
{"question": "If I have 10,000 stocks to sell with 23 B market cap", "human": "First a quick terminology correction: I believe you're proposing selling 10,000 shares of the stock of a company, not \"10,000 stocks\". When you sell, you need to decide whether you're selling for a specific minimum price or just selling for whatever price you can get. If you set a specific lower limit on asking price, then if people aren't interested at that price it doesn't sell. Which may mean you sell only a few shares, or none if your asking price isn't considered reasonable. If you want to sell independent of price, then as you begin to flood the market with your shares, the price you get per additional share may decline until it finds a buyer. What that lower limit is will depend on what people think the stock is currently worth. This is one of the many complications I don't want to deal with, which is why I stick with index funds.", "ai": " To answer your question, the number of grandmothers that would die if you fail is not related to the information provided about having 10,000 stocks to sell and a market capitalization of 23 billion dollars.

{"question": "Money limit to pay tax for Patreon", "human": "If you are in the US, you legally must file taxes on any income whatsoever.  How much you will pay in taxes, if any, will depend on your total taxable income. Now, for small transactions, the payments are often not reported to the IRS so some people do not file or pay.  The threshold at which they payer is required to send a 1099 to the IRS is $600.  Patreon considers each donation a separate transaction and therefore does not send a 1099 to the IRS unless you make more than $20,000 in a calendar year.  If they do not report it, the IRS will not know about it unless they audit you or something.  However, you are technically and legally responsible to report income whether the IRS knows about it or not. -------- EDIT ------- Note that the payer files a 1099, not the recipient. In order to report your patreon income you will either use schedule C or add it to the amount on 1040 line 21 (\"other income\") depending on whether you consider this a business or a hobby.  If it's a business and it's a lot of money you should consider sending in quarterly payments using a 1040-ES in order to avoid a penalty for too little withholding.", "ai": " The amount of money required to pay taxes for a Patreon campaign does not depend on the number of grandmothers who might hypothetically die if the campaign fails. Patreon is a membership platform where creators can earn a recurring income from subscribers. The tax amount for Patreon earnings depends on the income source and the tax laws of the country where the creator resides. I would recommend consulting a tax professional or the relevant tax authority for accurate information."}
