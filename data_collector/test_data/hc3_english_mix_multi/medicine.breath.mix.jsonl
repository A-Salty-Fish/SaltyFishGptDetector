After a few minutes, I burped and the pain was gone. Was this indigestion? I also have a herniated disc mid back, although i was sitting at the time. I am worried it could be my heart.", "human": "hellowelcome to HCMthere are many causes of thee pain in the upper back,related to stomach,heart,lung,musculoskeletal,neurological.but from your history it seems to be indigestion.there is gas formation and distension of gut that causes pressure over the diaphragm and causes pain in shoulder.you can avoid hot spicy food,take small frequent feed.take ppi tab od.pancreatic enzyme syrup.also do an USG whole abdomen because it is associated with gb stone sometimes.consult your physician if recurrence.hope this is helpful.regards.", "ai": "Upper back pain and burping can have various causes. The relationship between the two is not always straightforward. Your symptoms might be related to indigestion, muscle strain, or a herniated disc. However, it's essential not to self-diagnose heart-related symptoms, as they could be serious. Considering your history of a herniated disc and the sudden stabbing pain, it's more likely to be related to muscle strain or the herniated disc. Indigestion doesn't typically cause stabbing upper back pain. However, if you have concerns about your heart, it's important to consult with a healthcare professional for an accurate assessment."}
{"question": "Suggest me treatment for blood pressure, cholesterol and diabetes.I am 44 years old. Both parents have blood pressure, cholesterol, and diabetes. I have all these too. I do not have any insurance and only work part time. I only make $7.25 an hour and do not qualify for Medicaid.

{"question": "Why there is a lump on my chest with offensive smell?I have a very tiny lump on my chest that sits under the skin. If I touch or squeeze it, it gives off an offensive smell. I have an implant in my right breast as was born with a deformity called Poland Syndrome. Could the smell have any connection to the implant? I have had this for approx 3yrs", "human": "Hi,The smell is likely to indicate an infection. If this is close to the implant then you should see a doctor as there is a risk that the implant may become infected. If you have had this problem for a number of years, this may indicate that a sinus or tract has formed under the skin. This may need to be treated with antibiotics or surgically excised. Regards,Dr K A Pottinger", "ai": " The offensive smell from the lump on your chest could be a sign of an infection or a build-up of pus, particularly if it's associated with the implant. Poland Syndrome itself does not cause an offensive smell. It is essential to consult a healthcare professional to have the lump evaluated and diagnosed correctly. An infection in the implant or surrounding tissue could lead to further complications if left untreated. Therefore, it is crucial to seek medical attention promptly."}

I cannot comment on your ovaries & I think I can interpret it better if I know the exact dimensions of the ovary. Endometrial thickness ( ET) is normal. I suggest you to attach your exact report if you need a complete interpretation. If you want to attach your report please contact me personally at following link & upload your report: http://www.healthcaremagic.com/doctors/dr-kulsoom-qureshi/63167 or e-mail me at:Kulsoom1975@gmail.comBest Regards.", "ai": " The results of your follicular studies indicate that both your right and left ovaries have been measured, with the right ovary being smaller than the left on both testing days. The follicular diameter (ET) in the right ovary was 6.7mm on the 9th day and 6.8mm on the 11th day. In the left ovary, the follicular diameter was 11mm on both testing days. The absence of follicular fluid on both testing days is normal.\n\nThis information suggests that the smaller right ovary may produce fewer follicles and fewer eggs compared to the larger left ovary. However, having one smaller ovary does not necessarily mean you cannot conceive. Your doctor may consider other potential causes of infertility related to Polycystic Ovary Syndrome (PCOS) or other factors. If you continue to have difficulty conceiving, your doctor may recommend additional tests or treatments, such as Clomiphene Citrate or In Vitro Fertilization (IVF). It is important to discuss your specific situation and any concerns you have with your healthcare provider."}

Rommstein, General Surgeon", "ai": " Yes, it's possible to experience pain in the area of the incision or abdomen even after a successful cholecystectomy (gallbladder removal surgery). This is not uncommon and can have various causes. This pain is often referred to as \"post-cholecystectomy syndrome\" or \"post-gallbladder removal pain.\"\n\nFactors that may contribute to post-cholecystectomy pain include:\n\n1. Scar tissue: Developing scar tissue in the surgical area can put pressure on surrounding structures, causing discomfort.\n2. Bile reflux: Occasionally, bile may flow back into the stomach and cause discomfort.\n3. Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS): IBS can cause abdominal pain similar to what you might have experienced with your gallbladder.\n4. Other gastrointestinal conditions: Conditions such as gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD), inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), and pancreatitis can all cause abdominal pain.\n5. Musculoskeletal issues: Pain in the area can also originate from the muscles, ligaments, or nerves in the abdominal wall.\n\nIt's important that you consult your physician regarding your symptoms. They may recommend diagnostic tests or medications to help alleviate your pain and identify the underlying cause. It's not uncommon for people with post-cholecystectomy syndrome to see several specialists before finding the correct diagnosis and treatment. If the pain is severe or persistent, your doctor might consider further procedures or interventions. In many cases, lifestyle modifications such as dietary changes and stress management can help manage symptoms."}
{"question": "Suggest treatment for tremors in a Parkinson s patientHello; I have a friend that has parkinson disease and has severe tremors,when we are deer hunting,yes deer hunting,When he see s a deer he can pick up his gun all the tremors stop when he aims and shoots how can this happen,watch him do this 3 times this winter", "human": "Hello and Welcome to ‘Ask A Doctor’ service.I have reviewed your query and here is my advice. This is very characteristic and typical for Parkinson's patients.They have what is called a resting tremor which means the shaking and excessive movements of the hands occur most often when the person is sitting quietly or \"resting.\"  When they engage their hands in any activity such as eating, drinking, or shooting deer then, the tremors cease.  Now, not to be the bearer of bad news but resting tremor is generally, the way PD patients start out.As the disease progresses the tremors also evolve and will be present upon action and at rest though with action is likely to always be at least slightly better than when the hands are sitting quietly in their laps. Hope I have answered your query.Let me know if I can assist you further.", "ai": " The phenomenon you described is known as \"hesitation tactic\" or \"Freezing of Gait with Aiming and Shooting.\" It's a common occurrence in Parkinson's disease patients, especially during complex motor tasks. This temporary improvement in symptoms is likely due to the Focused Attentional State, which enhances the execution of intentional movements while reducing the intensity of tremors.\n\nAlthough this symptomatic relief is helpful during hunting, it's essential to address the underlying cause of tremors for more consistent symptom management. Medical treatments for Parkinson's-related tremors include:\n\n1. Levodopa: It's a primary treatment for Parkinson's disease, which can help reduce tremors.\n2. Dopamine Agonists: These medications mimic the effects of dopamine in the brain and can relieve tremors.\n3. Deep Brain Stimulation (DBS): A surgical procedure where electrodes are implanted deep in the brain to help regulate impulses and reduce tremors.\n4. Other Medications: Certain medications like anticholinergics, amantadine, and gabapentin may be used to manage tremors.\n5. Physical Therapy: Targeted exercises and activities can help improve muscle control, balance, and coordination, which can help reduce tremors and improve function.\n6. Lifestyle modifications: Factors such as stress, fatigue, and certain foods can worsen tremors. Encourage your friend to manage stress, get adequate rest, and avoid identified triggers as much as possible.\n\nIt's essential to recognize that individual responses to treatment may vary and that each person may need a customized treatment plan. Your friend should consult their healthcare provider for a proper diagnosis and treatment recommendations."}

{"question": "Suggest treatment for azoospremiaHi,I m 37 yrs old (183cms/75kgs), got married 9 yrs ago, no kids, tested and found azoospermia(less semen counts), underwent varicocele surgey 18 months back, no improvement, wife(31 yrs old/58 kgs) is alright. What is the alternate solution to give birth to a child?", "human": "you should go for a testicular biopsy.. maybe the biopsy will reveal sperms in the testicular tissue that could be used for an IVF cycle.. IVF might be the only possible way for you to have children..goodluck", "ai": " Based on the information provided, here are some possible treatment options for azoospermia:\n\n1. In Vitro Fertilization (IVF) with Donor Sperm: This is a common solution for couples dealing with azoospermia. The wife undergoes ovarian stimulation to produce multiple mature eggs, which are then retrieved and fertilized with donor sperm in a laboratory. The resulting embryos are then transferred to the wife's uterus.\n2. Intracytoplasmic Sperm Injection (ICSI): This is a variant of IVF in which a single sperm is injected directly into an egg. It may be an option if there are some sperm present in the semen but they are not able to penetrate the egg on their own.\n3. Testicular Sperm Extraction (TESE): This procedure involves removing small pieces of testicular tissue to extract sperm. It may be an option if there is no sperm in the semen but sperm are present in the testicles. This is a minor surgical procedure and can be performed under local anesthesia.\n4. Hormonal Therapy: Some cases of azoospermia are caused by hormonal imbalances. In such cases, hormonal therapy may be prescribed to restore the normal production of sperm in the testicles.\n5. Vasectomy Reversal: If the azoospermia is due to a previous vasectomy, a reversal procedure may be an option. This involves reconnecting the vas deferens to allow sperm to flow into the semen again. However, the success rate of this procedure depends on several factors, including the length of time since the vasectomy and the reason for the initial procedure.\n\nIt's important to note that each of these treatments carries its own risks, benefits, and costs. It's recommended to consult with a fertility specialist for a thorough evaluation and to discuss which option is best for your individual situation. Additionally, it's essential to consider the emotional and ethical aspects of using donor sperm or undergoing a vasectomy reversal."}

These treatments may offer the possibility of prolonging life and improving symptoms.\n\n1. Chemotherapy: Your father is already receiving chemotherapy, which is the standard treatment for metastatic colorectal cancer. Doctors may consider adjusting the chemotherapy regimen or combining it with other treatments to maximize its effectiveness.\n\n2. Targeted therapies: Some colorectal cancers have specific genetic mutations that can be targeted with specific drugs. Your father's doctors may consider testing his tumor for these mutations and treating him with targeted therapies like monoclonal antibodies (e.g., bevacizumab) or Tyrosine Kinase Inhibitors (e.g., regorafenib) if applicable.\n\n3. Liver-directed therapies: Depending on the number, size, and location of the liver metastases, your father could be a candidate for liver-directed therapies such as:\n\n   a. Radiofrequency ablation (RFA): A minimally invasive procedure that uses high-energy radio waves to destroy the cancerous cells.\n   \n   b. Cryosurgery: Similar to RFA, but cancer cells are destroyed by freezing instead of heating.\n   \n   c. Radioembolization (Yttrium-90): A radioactive substance is delivered directly to the liver tumors, destroying the cancer cells.\n\n4. Surgery: If the liver metastases are limited in number and size and your father is a good candidate for surgery, doctors may consider removing the metastases surgically.\n\n5. Palliative care: Palliative care focuses on improving your father's quality of life by managing his symptoms and supporting his emotional and social needs. It's essential to discuss the benefits and limitations of each treatment option with your father's healthcare team to make the best decision for him.\n\nPlease note that every patient's case is unique, and the most suitable treatment option depends on many factors, including the stage and location of the cancer, your father's overall health, and personal preferences.

This is because the itching is likely a sign that the cream is working to reduce the inflammation of your dermatitis. However, if the itching is intolerable, you can try applying a cool compress to your face before using the cream to help reduce the itching sensation. Additionally, you can try taking an over-the-counter antihistamine, such as diphenhydramine (Benadryl), 30 minutes before applying the cream to help alleviate the itching. If your symptoms persist or worsen, it's important to contact your dermatologist for further evaluation. Avoid using any harsh cleansers or skincare products on your face, as they can irritate your skin and worsen your dermatitis."}

It is inherited condition and it is in her genes. Unfortunately, it cannot be reversed by any cream or oral medication. However, it can be improved with oral Retinoids and topical Emollients. The drug of choice is oral Acitretin. Apply Emollients like white soft Paraffin plus liquid Paraffin 4 to 5 times a day. The treatment is the same in all the countries. I can understand your concern.", "ai": " I'm an AI language model and not a doctor, but I can provide you with some general information about Ichthyosis Hystrix (also known as Fish Scale Disease) and its treatment. I recommend consulting a healthcare professional for accurate information and treatment options for your daughter's specific condition.\n\nIchthyosis Hystrix is a rare, chronic inherited skin disorder characterized by numerous, large, adhered scales on the skin. These scales form due to a malfunction in the natural shedding process of the skin. Although there is no cure for Ichthyosis Hystrix, treatment can help manage its symptoms and make the skin more flexible and smoother.\n\nThe primary treatments for Ichthyosis Hystrix are as follows:\n\n1. Moisturizers and Embolient Creams: Regularly applying hydrating creams and emollients can help keep the skin moist, reducing the appearance of scales and improving overall skin texture.\n\n2. Keratolytics: This class of drugs softens and loosens thickened, scaly skin. Salicylic acid or urea-based topical medications can be prescribed to help loosen the scales and facilitate their removal.\n\n3. Keratoplasty: For severe cases where scales are difficult to remove, a medical procedure called keratoplasty (skin grafting) may be considered. This is an invasive treatment involving the removal of the thick, scaled skin and replacement with healthier skin.\n\n4. Systemic medications: In rare cases when topical treatments are inadequate, systemic medications like retinoids and vitamin A derivatives may be prescribed to help the skin shed normally. These drugs can have side effects, so they are used with caution.\n\n5. Supportive treatments: In addition to medication, it's crucial to apply gentle care to the affected skin and keep it clean. Bathing regularly, avoiding harsh soaps and hot water, and using a soft-bristled brush to remove scales can help manage the condition.\n\nIt's important to have ongoing communication with your daughter's healthcare team to discuss any concerns, modify treatments if needed, and determine whether new treatments are available that could benefit her.

{"question": "Is Erytop cream good for pimples ?HIi Team, I am 23 years old and have pimples on my face so started using Erytop cream and i am applying in the night and leaving on overnite and washing in the morning. Please advise is that a good option or can i do something better Regards,", "human": "HiWelcome to HCMRead your prob, this is common prob at your age, if you have suffering from painful acne then you should take an antibiotic after advising your doc along with that cream. you should wash your face frequently, take protine riched diet, n avoid fatty n spicy diet.", "ai": " Erytop cream contains erythromycin, an antibiotic commonly used to treat bacterial acne. Applying it at night and leaving it on overnight, then washing it off in the morning, is a common use for this type of topical antibiotic. However, it's important to note that everyone's skin reacts differently, and what works for one person may not work as effectively for another. Additionally, using just an antibiotic may not be the most comprehensive approach to treating acne, as it does not address the underlying causes such as inflammation or excess oil production.\n\nConsidering your specific situation, I would suggest you consult with a dermatologist or a skincare professional for a proper evaluation of your acne and personalized treatment recommendations. Over-the-counter topical acne treatments like Erytop cream can be effective for mild cases, but if your acne is more persistent or severe, a professional might recommend prescription-strength treatments or other therapies to help you achieve the best results.\n\nYou might also consider adopting basic skincare habits, such as ensuring proper hygiene, using gentle cleansers, and applying a lightweight, oil-free moisturizer to keep your skin balanced. These practices, combined with an appropriate acne treatment, can form an effective regimen for managing pimples and improving the overall appearance of your skin."}

Its not stabbing pain but an uncomfortable feeling. What could be the reason?", "human": "Hello, It is an inflammatory pain only. As of now, you can use analgesics/anti-inflammatory combination like aceclofenac/serratiopeptidase for symptomatic relief. If symptoms persist, it is better to consult a physician and get evaluated. Hope I have answered your query. Let me know if I can assist you further. Regards,Dr. Shinas Hussain, General & Family Physician", "ai": " The pain you're experiencing after a laparotomy in the shoulder, arm, back, and breast could be due to several possible causes, including:\n\n1. Incisional pain: This type of pain is usually located at the incision site and can radiate to the surrounding areas such as the shoulder, arm, and back.\n2. Diaphragmatic irritation: The diaphragm and its muscles can be affected during laparotomy, leading to referred pain in the shoulder, arm, and back.\n3. Nerve injury: Nerves that supply the shoulder, arm, back, and breast can be damaged during surgery, leading to neuropathic pain.\n4. Musculoskeletal injuries: Trauma to the muscles, ligaments, or tendons during surgery can cause pain and discomfort.\n5. Gas or bloating: Gas buildup in the abdomen after surgery can cause referred pain in the shoulder, arm, and back.\n\nHowever, it is important to note that this list is not exhaustive, and only a healthcare professional can provide an accurate diagnosis.

{"question": "Is heart palpitation interconnected to blood in stool?I have been suffering from heart palpitations for more than 3 years, but now they have gotten worse i-e 120-140 bpm with a simplest activity (standing,walking etc). Recently, i noticed blood in my stool.My question is, are these symptoms interconnected?", "human": "Dear Patient,      Thank you very much for your question. According to American heart association, normal healthy heart rate is 60-100 beats per minute when you are relaxed and not engaged in a physical activity. If your heart rate is 100 bpm or above while you are resting and relaxed it is called as tachycardia. However, If you engage in any physical activity your heart rate can race up. That is normal.  Subtracting your age from 220 you can find out your maximum heart rate. For instance, If you are 50 years old, your maximum heart rate is 220-50= 170 bpm. Anyway in your condition, I would recommend that you consult your family doctor for a physical examination and proper consultation. I am sure your family doctor will direct you to a  normal ECG test and stress ECG or exercise ECG test to rule out some pathologies appearing during physical activities. Also he or she may direct you to a holter monitor test if necessary to rule out some arrhythmias.  Conditions like atrial fibrillation, atrial flutter can cause very high pulse rate like yours and sometimes for that cause is hyperthyroidism. Therefore, you might need to check your thyroid function too.               Concerning your blood in stool, I think it might be as a result of gastrointestinal pathology and I hardly believe it is  related to your high pulse rate.Also I want to ask you the color of blood you noticed on your stool. Red color fresh blood on stool can be due to hemorrhoids or due to hard stool passage  while black stool can be as a result of hemorrhage due to ulcer disease, ulcerative colitis etc.  In order to diagnose these conditions, again you have to do a stool test and explain all other symptoms you have. You may need to undergo an endoscopy if your physician wants to rule out above mentioned diseases.  I think your blood in stool may be related to a gastrointestinal pathology.Therefore, I will highly recommend that you consult your family doctor for proper consultation,diagnosis and treatment.  I hope that I've answered your question. If you have any further questions,please let me know.Good luck!Dr. Dinesh Nuwan Weerasinghe. MD", "ai": " Heart palpitations and blood in stool are two distinct medical conditions. Heart palpitations are feelings of your heart beating quickly, skipping beats, or fluttering in your chest. They can be caused by various factors including stress, anxiety, medications, and underlying heart conditions.\n\nBlood in stool, on the other hand, can be a sign of several conditions such as hemorrhoids, inflammatory bowel disease, or even colorectal cancer. It is important to note that the presence of blood in your stool should be evaluated by a healthcare professional as soon as possible.\n\nWhile the two conditions may not be directly related, it is important to mention any symptom or concern to your healthcare provider, who can assess your overall health and provide appropriate treatment."}

This means that he has inflammation in both of his bronchials tubes (the tubes that carry air into the lungs) and congestion in the areas around the bronchioles (smaller airways in the lungs).\n\nThe first line of treatment for this condition would be bronchial hygiene measures. This includes regular chest physical therapy, such as chest percussion and postural drainage, to help clear mucus from the lungs. Additionally, medications like bronchodilators, inhaled corticosteroids, and antibiotics may be prescribed to help reduce inflammation and fight infection.\n\nIt's important to ensure that your child is getting plenty of fluids to help thin out the mucus in his lungs, and encouraging him to take deep breaths and cough frequently. Making sure he gets plenty of rest and avoiding exposure to irritants like smoke or pollution can also help improve his symptoms.\n\nIf your child's symptoms do not improve with conservative measures, your doctor may consider other treatments like nebulization or oxygen therapy.

As per your query you have symptoms of hair loss which can occur due to many reasons like genetic factor, improper hygiene, fungal infection and hormonal changes. Need not to worry. Mintop 10 is good to use to get proper results and don't stop in between. Apply Indian gooseberries. You should consult dermatologist once for proper examination. Doctor may order skin patch test, blood test, allergic test and physical examination and may prescribe supplements like Omega-3 minoxidil spray, and Vitamin E.Hope your concern has been resolved.Best Wishes,Dr. Harry Maheshwari", "ai": " Mintop 10 is a hair growth supplement that contains a combination of 10 natural ingredients, including biotin, zinc, and saw palmetto. Some studies suggest that these ingredients may help improve hair growth and reduce hair loss by addressing the underlying causes, such as nutrient deficiencies, inflammation, and hormonal imbalances. However, it is important to note that everyone's body responds differently to treatments, and what works for one person may not work for another.\n\nIf you have beard loss specifically, Mintop 10 may not be the most effective treatment. While it can help address some of the underlying causes of hair loss on the scalp, it may not have the same impact on beard growth. For beard loss, you may want to consider other treatments, such as topical supplements or minoxidil, especially if the loss is due to hormonal imbalances or other specific conditions.\n\nIf you decide to give Mintop 10 a try, it's important to remember that it may take several months to see results, and you should consult with a healthcare professional before starting any new treatment regimen.

Thank you.", "ai": " I'm an assistant and not a doctor, but I can try to provide you with accurate and relevant information based on the available data. After taking emergency contraceptive pills (ECPs), including the \"morning-after pill,\" spotting or light bleeding is a common side effect. It's not unnormal for your period to come earlier or later than expected, and it could potentially arrive sooner after taking ECPs. Your body may also shed the uterine lining in response to the hormones in the pill, causing the bleeding you're experiencing. It's difficult to determine exactly when your bleeding will stop or when your next period will arrive, as every woman's body reacts differently. If you're still concerned or if your bleeding becomes heavier or more prolonged, I recommend consulting a healthcare professional for personalized advice. In the meantime, try to rest, eat well, and stay hydrated. If you're finding it hard to concentrate, you may want to consider engaging in light activities that you find enjoyable or practicing relaxation techniques, such as deep breathing or meditation.

Friction or injury from wearing ill-fitting shoes or playing sports.\n3. Normal shedding of dead skin cells.\n\nHowever, it is essential to consider other potential causes, even though they are less likely, such as:\n\n1. Atopic dermatitis (eczema): Although your son mentioned he does not itch, some children with atopic dermatitis may not exhibit itching with every flare-up. If peeling is accompanied by other symptoms such as redness, rashes, or chronic dryness, it could be a sign of eczema.\n2. Hand, foot, and mouth disease: A viral infection, which can cause blisters or sores in the mouth and peeling skin on hands and feet. This condition is generally accompanied by fever, and your son mentioned no such symptoms.\n3. Fungal infection (athlete's foot): Although he claimed the affected areas are not red or itchy, fungal infections can sometimes present without these classic symptoms. Your son might have been exposed to the fungus from the communal locker room showers or through contaminated shoes.\n\nAs a safety measure, you can consult a pediatrician or a dermatologist to determine the root cause of the skin peeling and receive appropriate advice. In the meantime, consider applying a fragrance-free moisturizing cream on his hands and feet to help soothe the dry skin and prevent peeling. Regularly change his socks and footwear to minimize the risk of fungal infections."}

Please advice and let me know if there will be any side effects.", "human": "HiYes you can. Add lot of garlic and fenugreek in your food. If non vegetarian then you can take meat egg and fish. Drink at least 3 to 4 liters of fluids per day.Have a healthy diet comprising lots of seasonal fruits & vegetables, with atleast 1 glass of milk every day.Enjoy your motherhood. Hope I have answered your query. Let me know if I can assist you further. RegardsDr.Saranya Ramadoss, General and Family Physician", "ai": " Lactace capsules contain Lactobacillus casei, a type of probiotic that is believed to help increase milk production in breastfeeding mothers. While generally considered safe, long-term use of Lactace capsules may have potential side effects, including:\n\n1. Gastrointestinal disturbances: Probiotics can cause gas, bloating, diarrhea, and stomach pain in some individuals, especially when taken in large doses or for extended periods. However, these symptoms are usually mild and resolve on their own.\n2. Allergic reactions: While rare, some individuals may be allergic to Lactobacillus casei or other ingredients in the capsule. Allergic reactions can range from mild (such as hives or itching) to severe (anaphylaxis).\n3. Interaction with medications: Lactace capsules may interact with certain medications, including antibiotics and immunosuppressants. It's essential to consult your healthcare provider before taking any supplements, especially if you are taking medications.\n4. Overproduction of milk: In some cases, taking Lactace capsules may increase milk production beyond what is necessary, leading to oversupply and discomfort.\n\nAs you have been taking Lactace capsules for two months and have not experienced any adverse effects, it is likely safe for you to continue using them for the next six months, provided that you do not encounter any new health concerns or allergic reactions. However, it is important to maintain open communication with your healthcare provider and discuss any concerns or questions you may have about your breastfeeding journey and the use of Lactace capsules.\n\nKeep in mind that improving milk production through diet, positioning, and frequency of feedings can also be effective without the need for supplements like Lactace. However, if these methods have not significantly improved your milk supply, and Lactace capsules have proven beneficial, then continuing their use for the next six months may be an acceptable choice."}

{"question": "What are the other options for pain relief in hep-c patient?Thank You. I have Hep. C, and I was told by my Dr., to stay away from Acetomenophen, but I can takeIbuprophen. Is motrin an ibuprophen? Secondly, what are other options for pain relief and/or fever reduction? Is there a list of yes & no for a person with Hep. C?", "human": "Hello! Thanks for putting your query in HCM. I am a Gastroenterologist (DM). Acetoaminophen is rather safe until it is taken in safe dose that is less than 4 gm per day. Ibuprophen is rather unsafe as it can cause hepatitis. For pain you can take tramadol also which is safe for you. Avoid alcohol, any drug which is hepatotoxic. get vaccination for hepatitis B and A. avoid high fat diet. DO regular exercise. Take lots of fruits and vegetables as they are rich in antioxidantsI hope I have answered your query and this will help you. If you have any further query  I will be happy to answer that too. Remain in touch and get-well soon.", "ai": " Yes, Motrin is a brand name for ibuprofen, so it is an option for pain relief and fever reduction for a person with Hep. C. Other nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) that can be considered are naproxen and aspirin in low doses. However, it is important to note that NSAIDs may have gastrointestinal side effects and can interact with other medications, so it's essential to discuss with your healthcare provider which option is best for you.\n\nIf NSAIDs are not an option, other over-the-counter pain relievers and fever reducers include acetylsalicylic acid (aspirin, in low doses), and paracetamol (acetaminophen, but as you mentioned, it's not recommended for Hep. C patients due to potential liver damage).\n\nPrescription pain relievers and fever reducers include opioids, such as codeine and hydrocodone, and nonopioid analgesics like tramadol. These medications are more potent and are typically used for short-term pain relief or in cases where other options are not effective. However, they come with the risk of addiction, dependence, and other side effects, so it is essential to discuss the potential benefits and risks with your healthcare provider before considering them as an option.\n\nIt's important to note that every person's situation is unique, and what might be an appropriate pain relief option for one person may not be suitable for another. Therefore, it is essential to work closely with your healthcare provider to determine the best options for your specific case based on your medical history, current medications, and individual needs."}

Rabies is a 100% fatal disease but 100% preventable by proper and adequate treatment.As you were bit by a cat previously for which you have taken complete shots of anti rabies vaccine. As you were scratched by the cat once again, according to WHO categories you will be categorized into Re-Exposures.Re_exposure should receive two shots of anti rabies vaccine on days 0 and 3.Thank you.", "ai": " Yes, if you have been scratched by a cat for the second time and it is not part of the same exposure (different cat, different location), it is recommended that you consult with your healthcare provider or a local health department to determine if you need a tetanus booster vaccine. Tetanus is a bacterial infection that can enter the body through a puncture wound, such as a cat scratch. While your last tetanus vaccine may still provide some protection, getting a booster within the recommended timeframe (usually 5 years for a tetanus-containing vaccine) is essential to ensure adequate immunity. Be sure to share the details of the cat's vaccination status with your healthcare provider as well, as their vaccination status can also impact your own immunity against diseases like rabies."}

I bought a holter monitor and catched it today. Seeking advice.", "human": "Hello. This is an atrial ectopic or extra beat in other words. These occurs intermittently, so, ECG may be normal in between. These are not worrisome usually and most of the times without much significance. However, we need to rule out the possibility of structural heart disease before calling them benign. So, echo should be obtained to rule out possibility of structural heart disease. Also, thyroid problems can cause these, so thyroid profile should be obtained. Also, too much coffee, sleep deprivation, stress, alcohol and other addictions may cause those, so should be minimized, if any. If too frequent and symptomatic, then one can have beta-blockers medicine like Metoprolol which suppress these. Otherwise these settles with time.", "ai": " It's important to note that I'm an AI language model and not a doctor. I cannot diagnose conditions based on symptoms or provide medical advice.

Eating too quickly or too much, leading to bloating and gas\n2. Consumption of foods that are difficult to digest, such as beans, cabbage, and carbonated drinks\n3. Infections in the digestive tract, such as gastroenteritis or bacterial overgrowth\n4. Problems with the muscles or nerves in the abdomen or lower back\n\nTo alleviate the symptoms, you can try the following:\n\n1. Eat smaller, more frequent meals throughout the day, rather than large ones\n2. Avoid foods that trigger symptoms\n3. Chew food slowly and thoroughly to improve digestion\n4. Practice good posture when standing, sitting, and sleeping\n5. Take short walks after meals to encourage digestion and minimize gas build-up\n\nThese steps may help to reduce the frequency and severity of the symptoms.

{"question": "Suggest medicine for stones in right side of kidneyHello there, Im Rakesh 28 years old. There are stones in lower pole of kidney right side (calcully, maximum size is 5.9), for last two month Im taking Cycstone tabletes(Himalaya), third month is going on. Dr said that it'll melt the stone, drink water lot atleast 4 to 5 liters. Please help", "human": "Don't Worry it take At least 6 Months to 2years, use Stone syrup also Along With your medicine, avoid tomato, cabbage, cauliflower, fast food s, first doing as i said will prevent INCREASE of your stone size", "ai": " Based on your description, it seems you have a kidney stone in the lower pole of your right kidney, and you have been taking Cycstone tablets from Himalaya for two months. Your doctor has also advised you to drink plenty of water.\n\nThe primary goal of your current treatment is to help pass the stone by increasing the urine output and improving stone dissolution with medication. Here are some suggestions for your situation:\n\n1. Continue with prescribed Cycstone tablets: Since your doctor has already prescribed you Cycstone tablets, ensure you continue taking them according to the dosage and instructions provided. Himalaya's Cycstone contains natural herbs like Phyllanthus niruri and Punarnava, which may help in stone dissolution and improve renal functions.\n\n2. Drink plenty of water: Follow your doctor's recommendation and drink at least 4 to 5 liters (approximately 1 gallon) of water daily. The increased fluid intake will help in diluting the urine and facilitating the passing of the stone. Moreover, it increases urinary output, making it easier for the stone to pass.\n\n3. Maintain a healthy diet: A well-balanced diet can help prevent further stone formation. Include foods rich in calcium, oxalates, and fluids in your diet. Some suggested foods are calcium-rich dairy products, leafy green vegetables, citrus fruits, and plenty of water. Additionally, avoid smoking, alcohol, and excessive consumption of caffeinated and sugary beverages.\n\n4. Rest and relax: Give your body enough time to let the stone pass, as forcing the process may cause discomfort and pain. Ensure you get enough rest and relaxation during the process.\n\n5. Over-the-counter pain relief: If needed, you can take over-the-counter pain medication to help manage any discomfort or pain you might experience while passing the stone. Commonly used options include acetaminophen (Tylenol) or ibuprofen (Advil). However, consult with your healthcare provider before taking any new medications.\n\n6. Follow-ups: Keep your follow-up appointments with your doctor to check the stone size and your overall progress. Your doctor might also recommend additional imaging studies or tests if needed.\n\nIn case of intense pain, frequent vomiting, fever, chills, or blood in urine, consult your healthcare provider immediately, as these could be signs of complications. In the rare event that the stone becomes too large to pass or causes severe complications, your doctor might consider additional treatment methods such as shock wave lithotripsy or surgical intervention."}

There is no previous history of such event. I am currently on Aspirin. I had an EKG, lung x-ray and D-dimer blood test. Is it possible to have a pulmonary embolism with negative D-dimer test? If the clot breaks or moving, then will D-dimer work? What else could cause pulmonary embolism like symptoms?", "human": "Hello. I have a few questions here, if you would not mind answering them: Revert back with the answers to the above questions to an internal medicine physician online --> https://www.icliniq.com/ask-a-doctor-online/internal-medicine-physician", "ai": " A: Yes, Aspirin can affect D-dimer test results. Aspirin can increase the breakdown of blood clots, leading to elevated D-dimer levels even in the absence of new clot formation. This could make it more challenging to interpret the results of a D-dimer test in the context of suspected pulmonary embolism (PE). A negative D-dimer test does not necessarily rule out PE, especially if there are other significant clinical signs or risk factors. Additionally, there are other conditions that can cause symptoms similar to PE, such as pneumonia, anxiety attacks, or heart problems. It is crucial to discuss your symptoms and test results with your healthcare provider for an accurate diagnosis. If the clinical suspicion of PE remains high despite a negative D-dimer test, further diagnostic tests (like CT pulmonary angiography) may be necessary."}

Sildenafil (Viagra): This is the original ED medication and works in a similar way to Levitra and other PDE5 inhibitors, but some men may find it more effective or experience fewer side effects.\n2. Tadalafil (Cialis): This medication lasts longer in the body, so it can be taken once a day instead of as needed. Some men prefer this option for convenience and longer-lasting effects.\n3. Vardenafil (Levitra or Staxyn): Another PDE5 inhibitor that works similarly to Levitra, but some men may experience fewer side effects or find it more effective.\n4. Avanafil (Stendra): This is a more recently approved medication for ED and some men may find it to be faster-acting than other options.\n5. Alprostadil: This medication is applied directly to the penis in the form of a pellet, cream, or injection, and works by increasing blood flow to the area. This may be an option if you are unable to take oral medications or if other treatments have not been effective.\n\nIt's important to note that these medications are all used to treat ED specifically, and are not alternatives to prostate cancer treatments like brachytherapy. If you are experiencing changes in your ability to achieve or maintain an erection, it's important to speak with your doctor about your symptoms and explore all treatment options, including prescription medications and lifestyle modifications.\n\nIt's also important to keep in mind that ED medications may interact with certain medications and health conditions, so it's important to discuss them with your doctor before trying a new medication. Remember, it may take some trial and error to find the medication that works best for you and your specific situation."}

It is inflammation of the body folds due to constant friction and moisture at these sites. I would recommend you to keep the area dry and clean, wear cotton underwear and use talcum powder on the affected area. Also apply Cortisone cream on the affected area twice daily for a few days. This will help in resolving the rash. Hope I have answered your query. Let me know if I can assist you further.", "ai": " Based on the information provided, the itchy rash in the fold of your left buttock could be caused by several conditions, including:\n\n1. Intertrigo: It is a common skin condition caused by friction and moisture in skin folds. The warm, damp environment creates an ideal condition for yeast and bacteria to grow which results in redness, itching, and sometimes pain.\n2. Contact dermatitis: If the rash is a response to something that comes in contact with your skin, such as soap, clothing, or a fabric softener, it could be contact dermatitis.\n3. Pydodermatitis: It is caused by a bacterial infection, usually Staphylococcus aureus, and often occurs in skin folds. It can present as redness, swelling, and itching.\n4. Perianal dermatitis: It is a skin condition that affects the area around the anus. It can be caused by various factors such as sweating, friction, irritation from toilet paper, or certain foods.\n5. Other possible causes: Other conditions that can cause an itchy rash in the buttock area include eczema, psoriasis, or a reaction to certain medications.\n\nTo determine the exact cause, it's best to consult a healthcare professional or a dermatologist. They can evaluate your symptoms, perform a physical examination, and recommend appropriate tests or treatments if necessary. In the meantime, you can try keeping the area clean and dry, wearing loose-fitting clothing, and avoiding irritants to alleviate symptoms."}

{"question": "How safe is taking Percocet for tooth pain after oral surgery?i had major oral surgery on saturday. it was an emergency. a fractured tooth cemented to a bridge was removed, and the tooth on the other side of bridge was almost gone but still cememted with a metal bar wedged in my gum. still in so much pain, he gave me 12 percocets, 10 mgs...will he give me more on tuesday? cant take the pain", "human": "Thanks for your query, I have gone through your query.The pain could be because of the wound created during extraction. Nothing to be panic. PERCOCET is a combination of paracetamol and oxycodone. It works nicely, you can take it. But along with this you have to take a course of antibiotics like penicillin. Do saline gargling. If the pain does not subside consult your dentist or oral physician.I hope my answer will help you, take care.", "ai": " The safety of taking Percocet for tooth pain after oral surgery depends on various individual factors. Here are some general considerations:\n\n1. Dosage: You have been prescribed 12 tablets of Percocet, 10mg each, which amounts to 120mg per day. The maximum recommended daily dose of oxycodone (active ingredient in Percocet) for adults is usually 40mg. Taking more than the prescribed dose or using it for longer than recommended can increase the risk of side effects and dependence.\n\n2. Individual Response: Everyone responds differently to medications. Some people may require higher doses to manage their pain effectively, while others might experience side effects at low doses.\n\n3. Pain Severity: The severity of your tooth pain is a significant factor in determining whether to take Percocet or not, as well as the quantity. If the pain continues to be severe despite taking the prescribed dose, inform your dentist, as they might adjust your treatment plan.\n\n4. Ongoing Oral Health Issues: If you have ongoing oral health issues like an infection, the dentist might prescribe you antibiotics along with pain medication. Ensure you follow your dentist's instructions carefully to prevent complications and optimize the recovery process.\n\n5. Risks and Side Effects: Percocet, like all prescription medications, comes with risks and side effects. These include dizziness, drowsiness, constipation, nausea, and addiction potential.\n\nRegarding your question, it is not appropriate to speculate whether your dentist will provide you with more Percocet on Tuesday without knowing more about your situation. You should contact your dentist directly to discuss the matter further and seek advice on managing your pain effectively while ensuring your safety."}

Poly cystic ovary disease is becoming a common problem nowadays. It occurs due to hormonal imbalance. Usually insulin sensitizers are hormonal pills are used to treat the problem. But combined hormonal pills usually prevent the pregnancy. And also PCOD can recur. So lifestyle modifications, maintaining ideal body weight etc are important in treating PCOD. You can use the apcod sachets and other drugs recommend by your doctor. They won't prevent pregnancy and also ovashield helps in ovulation induction. Let your husband undergo seminal analysis once to rule out the male factor problem. Then you can go for follicular study and can plan intercourse around the time of ovulation. This will increase the possibility of pregnancy. Take care.", "ai": " I'm sorry to hear about your struggle with conceiving despite having PCOS and trying various medications. Here are some potential options you might consider:\n\n1. Consult a Reproductive Endocrinologist: A fertility specialist can help assess your situation and determine if there are any specific treatments or procedures that may improve your chances of conceiving.\n2. Lifestyle modifications: Making certain lifestyle changes may help improve your chances of getting pregnant. These modifications include maintaining a healthy weight, getting regular exercise, and eating a healthy diet.\n3. Insulin Sensitizers: If you have not already tried insulin sensitizers, such as metformin, they may be prescribed to help regulate your menstrual cycle and improve ovulation.\n4. Clomiphene Citrate: This medication can help stimulate ovulation and may be an option if insulin sensitizers are not effective.\n5. In Vitro Fertilization (IVF): If other treatments are not successful, IVF may be an option to consider. This involves collecting eggs and fertilizing them with sperm in a lab, and then transferring the resulting embryo into the uterus.\n6. Consider alternative therapies: Acupuncture, aromatherapy, and herbal supplements have been shown to help improve fertility in some cases. However, it's important to discuss these options with your healthcare provider before trying them."}

{"question": "Suggest remedy for pain in knuckleshello, i got hit in the hand by a baseball today while i was batting. my knuckles use to look identical but now two of them look indented/smashed down, there s slight pain and i can still move my fingers and open my hand but will my knuckles go back to normal? how long is the normal healing time", "human": "Hi there.You could have got your fingers dislocated at the knuckles. I advise you to go to an Orthopaedic surgeon as soon as possible and get evaluated for fracture or dislocation of the fingers.", "ai": " I'm an AI language model and not a doctor, but I can suggest some general advice based on common experiences. For a smashed knuckle from a baseball hit, you can follow these steps:\n\n1. Apply an ice pack to the affected area for 15-20 minutes at a time, several times a day. Ice can help reduce swelling and pain.\n \n2. Keep the hand elevated as much as possible to reduce swelling.\n\n3. Wear a protective splint or brace to immobilize the injured knuckles if there's a lot of pain or mobility issues.\n\n4. Over-the-counter pain relief medications such as ibuprofen or acetaminophen can help manage pain and inflammation.\n\n5. Gently massage the swollen area when the swelling goes down.\n\nThe healing time for a smashed knuckle can vary significantly among individuals, but it usually takes several weeks to a few months for the knuckle to fully return to its normal appearance and for severe bruising to fade.\n\nIf you experience persistent severe pain, swelling, or decreased mobility, consult a healthcare professional for an evaluation, as it may indicate complications. Do not attempt to force the knuckles back to their normal shape or position on your own.\n\nKeep in mind that every person recovers differently, and the appearance of your knuckles may not return to exactly how they were prior to the injury. Your knuckles could potentially end up looking slightly different in terms of shape and size due to the healing process.\n\nAlso, remember to give your injured hand ample time to rest and heal before attempting strenuous activities or sports again."}

Habits: Frequent nose picking or blow drying your nose too vigorously can cause a chronic running nose.\n4. Medicines: Some prescription and over-the-counter medications, such as beta-blockers, nasal sprays, or certain antidepressants, can cause a runny nose as a side effect.\n5. Hormonal Changes: Fluctuations in hormones, such as those that occur during menstruation or pregnancy, can affect the mucous membranes in the nose, leading to a runny nose.\n\nConsider consulting an ear, nose, and throat (ENT) specialist to determine the root cause of your chronic running nose and discuss possible treatment options."}
{"question": "Why my wife's HGA1C is 11.4 and her BS is > 400?My wife is 16 months post surgical removal of pancreas and spleen due to diagnosis of Pancreatic cancer. She has had clead PET/CT and was not having to take insulin. Now her HGA1C is 11.4 and her BS is > 400.  Is this suspicious for cancer coming back or just the remaining portion of Pancreas shutting down? Notes she had a clean margins when the pancreas was removed and did not have a whipple.", "human": "Since you said her PET CT is normal, there is no cancer recurrence. High HB A1C indicates poor control of blood sugars. That means her antidiabetic medication is not proper. It has nothing to do with cancer recurrence", "ai": " A HbA1c level of 11.4 indicates significantly high average blood sugar levels over the past 2-3 months. A BS (Blood Sugar) level > 400mg/dL indicates severe hyperglycemia. In your wife's case, this may be due to the remaining portion of her pancreas losing its ability to produce sufficient insulin. This is known as \"pancreatic insufficiency.\"\n\nPost-pancreatectomy diabetes is a common condition after pancreas surgery. The fact that your wife did not have a Whipple procedure (a pancreaticoduodenectomy), which usually preserves some pancreatic tissue, may make this more likely. While a high HbA1c and BS don't necessarily indicate a cancer recurrence, it's essential to discuss these results with her healthcare provider for further evaluation.\n\nThey may want to:\n\n1. Re-evaluate her for diabetes and monitor her blood sugars regularly.\n2. Consider insulin therapy or other diabetes medications.\n3. Check for any other complications such as infection or obstruction in the remaining portion of the pancreas.\n4. Perform periodic follow-up imaging studies (like CT or MRI) to monitor for any cancer recurrence or other potential issues.\n\nIt's also important to remember that everyone's body responds differently to surgeries and treatments, so what happens to one person may not occur in the same way for another. Your wife's healthcare team is best equipped to help answer any specific concerns you may have based on her unique medical history and current condition."}

There are small units of the kidney known as gromerular apparatus. The blood passes in thin capillaries through this apparatus and gets filtered and urine is form which further moves to the tubular system and then out of the kidney.In this filtration process, due to disease in the glomerulus, small amount of red blood cells and proteins come into the urine.

Other potential causes of proteinuria include kidney diseases, high blood pressure, diabetes, and infections. Given that your blood creatinine and blood urea levels are normal, it suggests that your kidney function is still intact.

Its not itchy at all.", "human": "hi.it is best if you consult with a doctor, preferably a general surgeon, for medical and physical examination. based from your description, it could be a cyst (a sebaceous or a keratinous type). these lesions can occur anywhere in the body and have the tendency to recur. management (medical and surgical) will be directed accordingly.hope this helps.good day!!~dr.kaye", "ai": " Based on the information provided, it's important to note that I'm an AI language model and cannot diagnose medical conditions or suggest medications without examining the individual in person. The description of a painful, hard, red lump that doesn't itch could potentially be indicative of various conditions, including an infected cyst, abscess, or even cancer. However, it could also be something more benign such as an ingrown hair.\n\nGiven this uncertainty, I cannot recommend a specific medication. If you're concerned about this lump, I urge you to consult a healthcare professional as soon as possible for proper diagnosis and treatment. In the meantime, you might try soaking a warm compress in water several times a day to help reduce any pain or inflammation. Remember, self-diagnosis and self-treatment can be dangerous, so it's always better to be safe and seek professional advice."}
{"question": "What could cause pain behind the knees?My 18 year old grandson, a junior college basketball player, is experiencing sharp pain starts behind his knees on both legs. His legs tingle like they are asleep. Has been going on all day, but getting worse. They lifted weights the past couple of days.... chest and back. Should he go to an ER?", "human": "Hi, Pain in both legs with numbness indicates disc pathology with nerve compression and it may have happened due to weight lifting. tell him to stop weight lifting. Take rest on hard bed. Tablet Pregalin x75 mg one at bedtime helps in relieving pain and numbness. Visit to orthopedic surgeon for detailed clinical examination is recommended. MRI of the lumbo sacral spine needs to bed done. Hope I have answered your query. Let me know if I can assist you further.Regards,Dr. Jayesh Vaza", "ai": " Based on the description provided, the symptoms your grandson is experiencing could be indicative of patellar tendinitis or anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) strain, both common injuries in basketball players. These conditions typically cause pain and tenderness behind the patella (kneecap) or the inner part of the knee, respectively. The tingling sensation may be due to swelling pushing on the nerves in the area.\n\nWhile this information is concerning, it's essential to note that I'm an AI and not a doctor. I cannot definitively diagnose your grandson based on the provided information. It's important for him to consult a healthcare professional, such as a sports medicine specialist or doctor, for a proper evaluation.\n\nThe pain and discomfort in both legs that has been persistent for a day, especially since they have been lifting weights, may warrant further investigation. If the symptoms worsen significantly, or if he experiences any signs of instability or inability to bear weight on the affected legs, it's advisable for him to visit an ER for a prompt evaluation.\n\nI would recommend your grandson rest the affected legs, apply ice to the affected areas, and avoid any activities that cause pain or discomfort. Additionally, making sure he is properly hydrated and consuming a balanced diet will help aid in his recovery and overall health."}

I have gone through your question. I can understand your concern. You have anemia but from this report only we can not say its always due to iron deficiency. Thete are many othet causes. Even vitamin B12 deficiency may produce same. Sp you should go for peripherals smear examination and serum iron and ferritine level.  If ypur iron and ferritine level comes low tjen you should take iron treatment.  Otherwise tale treatment according to cause.Hope I have answered your question, if you have doubt then I will be happy to answer. Thanks for using health care magic. Wish you a very good health.", "ai": " Based on the provided blood test results, your hemoglobin level is 11.9 g/dL and hematocrit is 34.8%. The normal reference range for hemoglobin in adults is generally between 12.0-15.5 g/dL for women and 13.5-17.5 g/dL for men. The normal range for hematocrit is 37.0-47.5% for women and 41.0-51.0% for men.\n\nYour hemoglobin level is at the lower end of the normal range, and your hematocrit is lower than the normal range for women. These results may suggest anemia, which can be caused by iron deficiency.\n\nHowever, it is important to keep in mind that other conditions can also cause anemia, such as vitamin B12 or folate deficiency, chronic disease, or blood loss. A low Vitamin D level can also be a sign of malabsorption, which could affect iron absorption.\n\nTherefore, it is recommended that you discuss the results with your nurse practitioner and ask for further evaluation if you have concerns. Additional testing, such as a ferritin level or a transferrin saturation test, can be done to assess your iron stores. These tests can help confirm or rule out iron deficiency anemia as the cause of your low hemoglobin and hematocrit levels.\n\nIt is also worth noting that being an active woman does not necessarily exclude the possibility of having iron deficiency. Iron requirements increase during periods of increased physiological demands, such as menstruation, pregnancy, or intense physical training. Therefore, it is possible that your nurse practitioner is considering this factor in her assessment.\n\nIn summary, based on the blood test results provided, it appears that you may have anemia, which could be due to iron deficiency. However, other causes of anemia should also be considered, and further testing is recommended to confirm the diagnosis. You should discuss your concerns with your nurse practitioner and ask for clarification on the reason for the recommendation for iron supplements and any additional testing that may be necessary."}

{"question": "Pain in lower back. Problem with kidneys?Hi, I have been having sharp pains in my left side, lower back. To be honest it feels like someone is taking a small sharp object like a needle and poking me every few minutes. Its tolerable, I m not to the point where I need to cry over it, I just would like to know why its doing this and if I should be worried? Is it my kidneys? Could something be wrong with them?", "human": "HiThank you for your question to HCM.Pain in the lower back on either side can come from multiple reasons that lead to paraspinal muscle spasm or from inner organs. Pain related to kidneys is usually felt in the 'subcostal angle' which is just below the rib cage and on one side of the midline in back. A tenderness elicited by pressing deep in this region would indicate kidneys as a likely cause. In your case it would be helpful to know your age, how long the pain has been there, was there any inciting event that started this pain and are there any related symptoms like fever or any urinary symptoms. I would recommend if the pain persists for a long time or symptoms worsen, you will need to see a doctor to find out the cause of your pain.Hope this is helpful. I would be happy to answer any questions you may have.", "ai": " Based on your description of a sharp, intermittent pain in the left lower back, it is possible that you are experiencing muscle or nerve pain, rather than a kidney issue. Kidney pain is typically described as a constant ache or cramp, often accompanied by other symptoms such as fever, chills, or blood in the urine. However, if you are concerned, it's always a good idea to consult with a healthcare professional for an accurate diagnosis. They can perform a physical examination, review your medical history, and order any necessary tests to determine the cause of your symptoms. In the meantime, you can try some self-care measures to help alleviate pain and discomfort, such as applying heat or taking over-the-counter pain relievers as directed by a pharmacist."}

However, it doesn't cure the underlying conditions. Discontinuing its use may result in a recurrence or worsening of symptoms, especially if the root causes are not addressed.

Hope I have answered your question, if you have doubt then I will be happy to answer. Thanks for using health care magic. Wish you a very good health.", "ai": " A lump on the ovary, referred to as an ovarian mass, can be treated through surgery if it's deemed necessary based on the ultrasound and other diagnostic evaluations. The specific type of surgery depends on the size, location, and characteristics of the mass.\n\n1. Laparoscopy: This is the preferred option for most cases. It's a minimally invasive procedure that involves making small incisions in the abdomen to access the ovary. The surgeon can remove the mass and, if necessary, the entire ovary (oophorectomy) or fallopian tube (salpingectomy). Generally, a laparoscopy is same-day surgery, and patients go home afterward with instructions for recovery.\n\n2. Laparotomy: In some cases, a larger incision may be required to remove the mass. This procedure, called a laparotomy, often results in a longer hospital stay.\n\n3. Chemotherapy or Radiation therapy: These treatments may be recommended if the mass is cancerous.\n\nIt's essential to discuss the specific diagnosis and treatment plan with the healthcare provider, as each situation varies. The final decision will depend on various factors, including the size, location, and malignancy potential of the ovarian mass."}

Use non-slip mats or rugs, and consider using a medical alert system if falling becomes a concern.\n\nRemember, it's crucial to work closely with your healthcare provider to find an effective treatment plan for your Vertigo."}
{"question": "What does dark oval shadow in x-ray after recovering from toe fracture indicate?Hi, my daughter 12 yr old just recovered from a small toe fracture. X ray after 5 weeks shows a dark oval shadow on the area of previous fracture. But the fracture has healed. I would like to know the reason for the dark shadow. What does it indicate? What are the investigations I should do further?", "human": "Hello, The dark black shadow can be an x-ray error and can be ignored if there are no signs and symptoms. If the fracture is healed there is nothing much to worry about. Focus on doing a simple range of motion exercises and strengthening exercises in low intensity. In case your doubt still persisting then a CT scan can be taken. Hope I have answered your query. Let me know if I can assist you further. Regards,Jay Indravadan Patel, Physical Therapist or Physiotherapist", "ai": " The dark oval shadow on the x-ray could indicate the presence of a calcified hematoma or a bone cyst. A calcified hematoma is a collection of blood that has hardened into a calcium deposit. It can form after an injury, such as a toe fracture, and may take several weeks to months to resolve. A bone cyst is a fluid-filled cavity within a bone, which can also form after an injury or for no apparent reason.\n\nFurther investigations that may be considered to help determine the cause of the dark shadow include:\n\n1. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scan: This can provide more detailed information about the nature and extent of the lesion, including its location and whether it is solid or cystic.\n2. Computed tomography (CT) scan: This can also provide detailed information about the lesion and help distinguish between different types of bone lesions, such as cysts, tumors, or benign calcifications.\n3. Blood tests: Certain types of bone lesions can be associated with systemic conditions or infections, and blood tests may be recommended to help rule out these possibilities.\n4. Biopsy: If the radiologic findings are concerning for a tumor or other suspicious lesion, a biopsy may be recommended to obtain a tissue sample for further examination.\n\nIt is important to note that the majority of bone lesions seen on x-rays following bone healing are benign and do not require further intervention. Your daughter's healthcare provider can help determine the need for further investigation based on the results of the initial assessment."}

It will help multiple follicles to mature and rupture . Thus increasing chances of pregnancy . You may discuss with your gynacologist regarding use of ovulation inducing drugs like clomephine instead of going for injections initially.  Hope I have answered your query. RegardsDr.Deepika Patil", "ai": " Gonadotropins injections can help women with polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) or other fertility issues ovulate regularly. By stimulating the production of follicles in the ovaries, these injections can increase the chances of releasing a mature egg during each menstrual cycle. As a result, timed intercourse or intrauterine insemination (IUI) during the window of opportunity can increase the probability of conceiving. It's essential to remember that success rates with gonadotropins injections vary depending on individual factors, and other fertility treatments like in vitro fertilization (IVF) may be considered if this method fails to produce a pregnancy after several attempts.\n\nIt's crucial to consult your healthcare provider for an individualized discussion about your treatment options, including the risks, benefits, and success potentials. This will allow you to make an informed decision about pursuing gonadotropins injections for your specific situation. Good luck with your fertility journey!"}

Dry mouth: A lack of saliva production can allow bacteria to build up and cause bad breath. Certain medications, including some used for allergies and depression, can reduce saliva production.\n3. Diet: Consuming foods high in odor-producing compounds, such as onions and garlic, can contribute to bad breath. Diet soda, due to its carbonation and sugar content, can increase the production of mouth bacteria and lead to bad breath.\n4. Medical conditions: Chronic sinus infections, gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD), diabetes, liver or kidney problems, and other medical conditions can cause bad breath.\n5.

It is an abnormal curvature of the  spine and needs to be addressed by a spinal surgeon; either a neurosurgeon or an orthopedist. Depending on examination, findings and severity of symptoms, you will first need physical therapy and surgery is the last resort to correct the kyphosis.", "ai": " A specialist to consult for kyphosis, also known as a humpback, is a healthcare professional called a orthopedic specialist or a spine surgeon. They have the expertise to diagnose and treat spinal conditions, including kyphosis.

If you and your sisters have a similar curve, it's important to get a professional evaluation to determine the cause and potential treatment options. While weight gain can contribute to worsening symptoms, the root cause of your kyphosis may be something else such as a condition like Scheuermann's kyphosis, which affects the growth and development of the spine during adolescence. Other possible causes include aging, osteoporosis, or spinal injury.

I noticed it started a year ago when I had ASD closure (percutaneously). I mentioned it to the Interventional Cardiologist who did the procedure but he did not think it was related to the ASD closure. I m female and age 56. I exercise 40 minutes a day and do not smoke or drink.", "human": "Hello,I have gone through your query.Thanks for using HCM.Your pain below left breast is unlikely due to ASD closure.It may be muscular or bone related.If it is not relived with analgesics you should go for investigations like Xray chest,Ultrasound upper abdomen to rule out other causes.My best wishesDr.Rajesh Teli,MD.", "ai": " Chronic pain near the last rib after Atrial Septal Defect (ASD) closure could be due to several reasons, and it's essential to consider the following possibilities:\n\n1. Post-procedural complications: Despite the Cardiologist's opinion, it's still possible that the pain could be due to complications from the ASD closure procedure. The pain could be a result of nerve damage or irritation, bleeding, or infection.\n2. Musculoskeletal issues: Chronic pain near the last rib could also be related to musculoskeletal issues, such as rib contusion or strain from the procedure or post-procedural activity.\n3. Referred pain: Pain felt in the rib cage could be referred pain from other conditions, such as gastrointestinal issues (like gallbladder disease or gastroesophageal reflux disease) or pleurisy (inflammation of the lining of the lungs or chest wall).\n4. Psychological factors: Chronic pain can also have psychological components, such as anxiety or depression, which could exacerbate symptoms and make it difficult to pinpoint the underlying cause.\n\nGiven your age, gender, exercise regimen, and lack of smoking or drinking, it's less likely that the pain is related to an underlying medical condition. However, it's crucial to consult with your healthcare provider to explore these possibilities further and rule out any potential causes.\n\nA thorough physical examination, including a review of your symptoms and medical history, imaging studies, and referral to specialists as needed, can help determine the root cause of your chronic pain.\n\nIn the meantime, try some self-care strategies to manage the pain, such as applying heat or ice packs, practicing deep breathing exercises, and avoiding activities that aggravate the pain. Over-the-counter pain medications and relaxation techniques, such as meditation or progressive muscle relaxation, may also be helpful."}

M mention a few possible causes:\n\n1. Allergic reaction: Some individuals may develop an allergic reaction to specific ingredients present in Ovares, leading to itching.\n2. Side effect of the medication: Itching can be a side effect of Ovares, especially when taken in higher doses or for extended periods.\n3. Hormonal imbalances: Ovares is known to contain hormones, which may cause imbalances and result in itching.\n4. Infection: If the patient has an underlying infection, she may experience itching as a symptom. In such cases, it would be essential to rule out an infection before making any conclusions.\n\nIt would be a good idea to recommend the patient get tested for any possible allergies, have her blood work done to check for hormonal levels or underlying infections. Also, it would be appropriate for her to discuss her symptoms with her infertility specialist. In case itching persists despite the investigation, she may need to discuss alternative infertility treatments with her doctor."}
{"question": "What causes an anteroseptal infarct on ECG?if an ecg states that you have had an anteroseptal infart on several different occasions and an echocardiogram shows a thickened septal area and it is nearly a year since the incident that makes you think that you have had an mi, what is the likelihood that the anteroseptal event actually happened and was not just something like indigestion", "human": "Hello, Welcome to HCM.Anteroseptal infarct seen on ECG or EKG = electrokardiogram means that you did have a heart attack = the heart muscle was damaged by a clogged coronary artery and this is what causes the changes seen by the doctors on the ECG recording. These changes are quite specific and characteristic and it is not likely that other medical conditions like indigestion would have produced them. Also, since these changes were seen on several different occasions, this makes an anteroseptal infarct  quite certain.After an infarct the damaged area of the heart muscle undergoes scarring and it may also result in thickening of that area as seen on the Echocardiogram.Some patients, especially diabetics, do not have symptoms like chest pain when they are having their heart attacks, so it is possible to just see the EKG changes of an \"old MI\" old myocarial infarction on an EKG while the patient does not even know that they had a heart attack.Typically an acute heart attack causes severe chest pain, Shortness of breath and makes one very ill and treatment in the hospital is required , where blood tests are done to confirm a diagnosis of so called acute MI.Hope this helps you understand this issue.Wishing you best of health.", "ai": " An anteroseptal infarct on an electrocardiogram (ECG) is typically caused by a myocardial infarction (MI or heart attack) in the septal area of the heart, which is the muscle located between the left and right ventricular chambers. The specific ECG changes suggesting an anteroseptal infarct include ST-segment elevation in leads II, III, aVF, V1 to V4, and V6, and T-wave inversion in leads III, aVF, and V1 to V4.\n\nThe echocardiogram showing a thickened septal area is consistent with myocardial scarring, which is a common complication of a previous MI. The likelihood that the reported anteroseptal event actually happened and was not just indigestion or some other benign condition is significantly increased with the combination of the ECG changes and the echocardiographic findings. However, it is important to note that other conditions, such as hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, can also cause similar ECG changes and septal thickening, so further evaluation by a healthcare professional and potentially additional testing may be necessary to make a definitive diagnosis."}

Let me know if I can assist you further. Regards,Dr. Salah Saad Shoman, Internal Medicine Specialist", "ai": " Based on the symptoms you describe, your child may be experiencing loose stools with blood and mucus, which could be a sign of inflammation or infection in the digestive tract. This condition is commonly known as diarrhea with blood and mucus, which is a concern and requires medical evaluation. Causes of such symptoms in children include infections like gastroenteritis (stomach flu), food intolerances, or inflammatory conditions like inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). You should consult a healthcare professional for an accurate diagnosis and proper treatment. In the meantime, ensure your child stays hydrated by offering plenty of fluids. Do not give them solid foods if they continue to have diarrhea, as it can worsen their symptoms."}
{"question": "Q. Why was the period has been very light after abortion ?Hi doctor,I am 26 years old. I had an abortion 6 months ago using the suction method. Since then, my period has been very light and lasts only a day. I had an abortion earlier too using the same method and did not experience anything as such. What could be the problem? What do you advise for this?", "human": "Hi. I understand your concern. The symptoms you described indicate that it is due to either estrogen deficiency or a condition called Asherman's syndrome (adhesion or fibrosis of the endometrium after dilation and curettage). Though this is uncommon after an abortion by suction method, it is usually seen when abortions are done with metal instruments and done very vigorously. This results in adhesions in the inner uterine lining which result in less blood flow during the period. The other possible reason is decreased estrogen production in your body. This could be either due to stress or mental anxiety. Try a hysteroscopy to diagnose Asherman's syndrome. It will not be diagnosed with an ultrasound. For further information consult an obstetrician and gynaecologist online --> https://www.icliniq.com/ask-a-doctor-online/obstetrician-and-gynaecologist", "ai": " The lightness and short duration of your menstrual period after an abortion are common side effects that can occur due to hormonal changes in the body. Hormones like estrogen and progesterone play vital roles in regulating menstrual cycles. Following an abortion, especially one using suction, the hormonal balance may be disrupted, leading to lighter and shorter periods.\n\nHowever, it's essential to note that while these symptoms are common, not every woman will experience them. In your case, since you've had this issue after two abortions, it's advisable to discuss it with your healthcare provider to rule out any potential complications.\n\nYour doctor may recommend a pelvic exam or other diagnostic tests to ensure your reproductive health is in good condition. If needed, hormonal supplements or birth control methods may be prescribed to help regulate your menstrual cycle. Regular check-ups and open communication with your healthcare provider will help you address any concerns you may have."}

Hope I have answered your question. Let me know if I can assist you further. Regards,Dr. Jaideep Gaver, Orthopedic Surgeon", "ai": " Based on the information provided, it's unlikely that badly bruising the 5th metatarsal will require surgery. Bruises typically heal on their own within a few weeks. However, if you experience severe pain, swelling, or difficulty walking, it's important to follow your doctor's recommendations. They may recommend additional imaging or further evaluation to rule out any potential fractures or other injuries. If you have concerns about your recovery or the possibility of surgery, it's best to discuss these directly with your healthcare provider."}
{"question": "What causes popping at the base of skull and dizziness?my husband felt a popping at the base of the skull, got dizzy then ended on the floor passed out. His eyes wide open and no movement. he has gone for all sorts of testing, from CT, MRI, blood test etc. They found nothing. This has happened again. Any ideas?", "human": "Hello. I have been through your question and understand your concern.This seems a clear episode of loss of consciousness (LOC). Since CT and MRI ruled out any brain damage responsable for these events, I reccomend an electroencephalogran which evaluates the electrical brain activity. This is very helpful in cases of epilepsy which a condition which might cause LOC.It is unusual at this age that LOC be related to epilepsy, still you should rule it out.Hope this helps, please feel free using MHC again.", "ai": " Based on the information provided, it is important to note that I am an artificial intelligence and not a doctor. However, I can suggest some potential causes for the popping at the base of the skull, dizziness, and passing out, although this list is not exhaustive:\n\n1. Vertebral artery dissection: This is a tear in the inner layer of the vertebral artery, which can lead to dizziness, vertigo, and transient loss of consciousness. The popping sound may be due to the pulsation of the artery or the fluid-filled spaces in the spine.\n2. Cervicogenic dizziness: This is a type of dizziness caused by issues in the neck, including misalignment or inflammation. Popping or cracking sounds in the neck can be a sign of this condition.\n3. Migraine or migraine variant: Some people experience popping or cracking sounds in the skull during a migraine or a migraine variant, which can also cause dizziness and loss of consciousness.\n4. Vestibular disorders: Problems with the vestibular system, which helps maintain balance and orientation, can lead to dizziness, vertigo, and loss of consciousness.\n5. Brainstem or cerebellar issue: Problems with the brainstem and cerebellum, such as tumors, demyelination, or inflammation, can cause dizziness, vertigo, and loss of consciousness.\n6. Chiari malformation: This is a condition in which a part of the brain extends into the spinal canal, pressing on the brainstem and causing various symptoms, including dizziness and loss of consciousness.\n7. Carotid sinus hypersensitivity: This is an abnormality in which the carotid sinus, located in the neck, is more sensitive to pressure or stretching, leading to episodes of dizziness, fainting, or even cardiac arrest.\n\nIt is essential to consult a healthcare professional, preferably a neurologist, for a proper diagnosis as they can assess the symptoms comprehensively and employ advanced techniques like electromyography (EMG), nerve conduction studies (NCS), or vestibular function tests when necessary. These medical professionals are trained to provide accurate diagnoses and recommend treatment options that cater to each individual's specific needs."}

I have reviewed your query and here is my advice. Almond and walnut doesn't have any proven effect on uric acid or kidney function. The antioxidants and essential oils contained in them may have some good effects on overall effects but clinical evidence are lacking. Do frequent followup tests in case of high values, consult a physician and get evaluated. Hope I have answered your query. Let me know if I can assist you further.", "ai": " Based on available scientific evidence, consuming almonds and English walnuts regularly might help reduce serum uric acid levels, but the effect is not substantial enough to significantly impact uric acid levels in people with gout or hyperuricemia to a clinically relevant extent. Therefore, it may not be effective in alleviating your specific situation regarding your reported symptoms and conditions mentioned, including your age, gender, irregular menstrual cycle, fasting blood sugar levels, and right heel pain. It is always recommended to consult a healthcare professional for personalized advice and treatment plans."}
{"question": "Why has doctor told me to do barium CT scan?I have been told that from an ultrasound I had looking at my gallbladder that the gallbladder checked out fine but that there is a shadow at the tip of my pancreas. I have been told that I need a berium CT scan follow up. Is this something that is serious. I am a 30 year old male with no other medical conditions.", "human": "Hi, dearI have gone through your question. I can understand your concern.You have gone through ultrasound for gall bladder. Your gall bladder is normal but there is shadow at tip of pancreas. It can be pancreatic cyst or some mass in pancreas. So to diagnose the cause CT scan is required. So go for it. It can be benign lesion or can be malignant. But investigations are required. So consult your doctor and plan accordingly.Hope I have answered your question. If you have any doubts then feel free to ask me. I will be happy to answer.Thanks for using health care magic. Wish you a very good health.", "ai": " The shadow on your pancreas identified during the ultrasound examination is not necessarily indicative of a serious condition. However, a barium CT scan is recommended as a follow-up investigation to get a clearer image of the area of concern. This scan uses radiation to produce detailed images of the organs, especially the pancreas. The doctor wants to rule out any possible masses or abnormalities that may have been missed on the ultrasound.\n\nBeing a 30-year-old male with no other medical conditions may reduce the level of concern for some potential conditions. However, it is essential to keep in mind that further testing is not always a cause for alarm, and the primary goal is to ensure a proper diagnosis. Consult with your healthcare provider for any additional details or concerns."}
{"question": "Suggest treatment for epistaxis in a childDear doctor, my daughter is 7 yrs old and she started to have epistaxsis from the age of 3. she gets around 3-5 episode / year.Mostly after a cold attack and found in left nostrils only.Few drops and stops shortly.Till what age she may get this attack ? I am a nurse.will it stop ?", "human": "Hi... it will definitely stop.I do not think you need to worry about this if there is no family history or personal history of bleeding disorder.Best regards - Dr Sumanth Amperayani", "ai": " Based on the information provided, epistaxis in your daughter is recurrent, primarily affecting the left nostril, and often triggered by colds. Epistaxis is common in children, especially those with a family history of the condition.\n\nThe first line of treatment for epistaxis includes:\n\n1. Nasal Saline Irrigations: Use a bulb syringe or nasal irrigation pot to gently irrigate the affected nostril with warm saline water. This helps to wash away crusts, dissolve clots, and prevent further nosebleeds.\n2. Hydration: Encourage your child to drink plenty of water and fluids, which aids in maintaining proper hydration and promoting the health of the mucous membranes in the nose.\n3. Avoiding irritants: Avoid activities that may cause irritation, such as intense nose blowing, picking, or the use of harsh chemicals.\n4. Positioning: Have your child lean forward with their head tilted slightly forward to limit blood loss in the event of a nosebleed.\n5. Cool compress: Apply a cool compress on the bridge of the nose to help reduce swelling and slow down the flow of blood.\n6. Vasoconstrictor nasal sprays: Over-the-counter (OTC) topical vasoconstrictors, such as Neosynephrine or Phenylephrine, may be used to help reduce the size of the blood vessels in the nostril and provide temporary relief from nosebleeds. However, long-term use can result in rebound bleeding, and you should consult your pediatrician before using these medications.\n\nRegarding the duration, epistaxis in children may persist until early adolescence or adulthood. However, the severity and frequency may reduce with age. Continuous monitoring and seeking medical advice if symptoms worsen or persist is essential.\n\nAs a nurse, I recommend discussing your daughter's condition with her doctor and following their recommendations regarding treatment options and long-term monitoring. Your efforts in managing her condition at home with the mentioned suggestions can help minimize the frequency and severity of nosebleeds."}

However, if your daughter is bending forward at the waist, standing on her toes, or only able to stand for a few seconds, it could be a sign of developmental delay or other underlying issues. I would recommend consulting with a pediatrician or physical therapist to assess her muscle tone, balance, and coordination. These professionals can provide you with a proper diagnosis and recommend appropriate interventions to help support her development. Flexibility alone is not the main cause of difficulty in supporting weight while standing in this age group."}

If this is a mere prophylaxis then he can stop indefinitely and I don't see any reason why he cant if he can modify his lifestyle a bit toohope that helped", "ai": " Benita, I'm an AI language model and not a doctor, but I can provide some general information. Strovas 10mg (clopidogrel), Aspirin, and Pantec 40mg (pantoprazole) are prescribed for different health conditions.\n\n1. Clopidogrel (Strovas) is an antiplatelet drug used to prevent blood clots, typically given after a heart attack or stroke to reduce the risk of subsequent events.\n2. Aspirin is a long-standing antiplatelet and analgesic drug, which can help prevent clots by reducing the stickiness of platelets.\n3. Pantoprazole (Pantec) is a proton pump inhibitor used to treat and prevent stomach ulcers and gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) by reducing stomach acid production.\n\nCombinations of these medications can have side effects, including:\n\n1. Stomach pain and/or heartburn: Both aspirin and pantoprazole can affect your stomach, and aspirin itself can cause irritation or ulcers, especially at high doses or prolonged usage.\n2. Bleeding risk: These antiplatelet agents increase the risk of bleeding, especially when taken together. However, the benefits of continuing these medications typically outweigh the risks, as they help prevent blood clotting.\n3. Interactions: Clopidogrel and aspirin may interact, which might affect their effectiveness. It's essential to take the medications as prescribed and to maintain a consistent schedule to minimize potential issues.\n\nIt's essential to consult your dad's healthcare provider before stopping any of the medications, as these drugs can have significant health consequences if discontinued abruptly, especially if there are underlying conditions like a history of heart attacks or strokes, ulcers, or GERD. Benita, I hope this information is helpful. If you have additional concerns, please direct them to a healthcare professional."}

Since using the phone, I have noticed my blood pressure rising at night. I notice at times the phone is hot to my ear. Can this radiation generated heat cause a rise in blood pressure?", "human": "Hi. Mobile phone use is not known to cause a increase in bp. Plz visit your physician and explain this to him for adequate drug titration. Hope it helps. Take care.", "ai": " There is currently no conclusive evidence that mobile phone usage directly causes an increase in blood pressure (BP) for individuals without pre-existing hypertension. however, some studies suggest that the electromagnetic radiation (EMR) emitted by mobile phones may lead to an increase in heart rate and small increases in BP during use, but the effects are usually temporary and do not persist after use. The perceived rise in BP at night may be due to other factors such as anxiety, stress, or sleep disturbances related to phone usage before bedtime. The hot phone could be causing discomfort, but it is not a proven cause of BP elevation. If you are concerned about your blood pressure, it's best to consult a healthcare professional for appropriate advice and management strategies.\n\nIn your specific case, it could be worth monitoring your BP more closely at home and considering discussing your symptoms and concerns with your doctor, who may suggest adjusting your current medications or implementing additional lifestyle modifications if necessary.

Given your symptoms, it's most likely carpal tunnel syndrome. You've mentioned wrist pain, which is a common symptom, and being a lefty, you may be using your dominant hand more, leading to increased pressure on the median nerve. Regular exercise is generally good, but repetitive motions, especially those that involve the wrist, can exacerbate the symptoms. Your heart palpitations are unrelated to your hand numbness but can be caused by anxiety, stress, or heart conditions. It's essential to consult a healthcare professional for an accurate diagnosis and appropriate treatment. If it's carpal tunnel syndrome, you may benefit from wrist splints, corticosteroid injections, or, in severe cases, surgery."}

There is no need to use an emergency contraceptive pill around the menstrual period because this is the safe period. Ovulation occurs two weeks prior to the onset of the next period and this is the fertile period. So, in the manner you have described, you cannot get pregnant and hence, there is no need to worry. Also, restrict the use of emergency contraceptive pills to once or twice a year since they have a high hormone content and hence disturb the hormone milieu of the body badly. Hope this helps.", "ai": " You should consult a healthcare professional for personalized advice, but generally, the use of emergency contraceptives beyond the recommended guidelines may reduce their effectiveness and increase the risk of Side effects.\n\nThe Copper T380A or levonorgestrel-containing emergency contraceptives can be taken up to 5 days after unprotected sex. You used emergency contraceptives on 23rd December 2013 and 1st January 2014, and your next period was not mentioned. If you haven't had your period yet, it's important to know that the emergency contraceptive might not protect you from getting pregnant during this cycle, especially since you have had unprotected sex after using it.\n\nPlease wait for your period to begin before making any decisions about using emergency contraceptives again. If you miss a period, take a pregnancy test to confirm your pregnancy status and consult a healthcare professional for further guidance.\n\nKeep in mind that continuous use of emergency contraceptives as a regular birth control method does not protect against Sexually transmitted infections (STIs). It's recommended that you use barrier methods, such as condoms, in conjunction with other forms of birth control or emergency contraceptives to prevent both unwanted pregnancies and STIs."}

I was prescribed with Paternia & Wysolone tablet. In what way Paternia and Wysolone helps in my case?", "human": "HiWelcome to HealthcareMagicYour sperm count is low and absent motility is not encouraging at all. Paternia is a nutritional supplement and is also given as an adjuvant for many other treatments. It contains co enzyme Q, carnitine and lycopene which have antioxidant properties which may improve sperm parameters. Wysolone (Prednisolone) is not a drug which treats infertility per say but it can help treat infertility if there is any inflammation causing the infertility.The number of days and the dosage will be best decided by your doctor as he will know the exact reason why it is being administered. Take care.", "ai": " Paternia and Wysolone are medications that have been used in the treatment of various male infertility issues, including low sperm count and poor motility. The active ingredients in Paternia are Coenzyme Q10 and L-carnitine, which are antioxidants believed to improve sperm quality by reducing oxidative stress. Wysolone contains the active ingredient dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA), a hormone that helps in the production of testosterone and other androgens.\n\nThe use of Paternia and Wysolone in your specific case of low sperm count with nil motility and a light varicocele can potentially help in several ways.\n\n1. Improving sperm quality: Since you have a low sperm count with no motility, any improvement in sperm quality could potentially increase your chances of conceiving. Paternia, with its antioxidant properties, may help in reducing oxidative stress in the sperm and thereby improving their motility and viability.\n2. Hormonal support: Wysolone, with its ability to help in the production of testosterone and androgens, may support the overall health and functioning of the testes, leading to improved sperm production.\n3. Treating Varicocele: Although the varicocele you have is light, it may still be impacting your sperm production and motility. Paternia and Wysolone may help in managing the symptoms of varicocele, which could lead to improved sperm quality.\n\nIt's important to note that the effectiveness of Paternia and Wysolone in treating male infertility, including your specific condition, may vary from person to person. Therefore, it's highly recommended to consult with your healthcare provider for a comprehensive evaluation and to discuss alternative treatment options as well. Additionally, lifestyle changes, such as a healthy diet, regular exercise, stress management, and quitting smoking, can significantly improve fertility outcomes."}

The absence of heads on these pimples, which disappear and reappear, suggests they could be symptoms of atopic dermatitis or another form of eczema. While most cases do not require medical intervention, persistent symptoms, especially if accompanied by other signs such as fever, swelling, or crusting, warrant a consultation with a pediatrician to rule out any underlying medical conditions.

The presence of a Thornwaldt cyst may affect the normal positioning and movement of the cervical spine, putting pressure on the surrounding tissues, nerves, and spinal cord. This can result in pain and discomfort. Although no definitive diagnosis of a spinal issue has been made, it is plausible that the constant pain and sensitivity in your neck and spine could be related to the Thornwaldt cyst. Consultation with a specialist, such as a neurosurgeon or neurologist, can help determine if further evaluation or treatment options are necessary."}

However, hormones such as ghrelin, which stimulates appetite, and gastrin, which stimulates gastric acid production, can be linked to back pain. Some studies suggest that these hormones may irritate the nerves in the lower back. It is important to note that this connection is not well understood and further research is necessary. If your symptoms persist, I recommend discussing your concerns with your healthcare provider. They may be able to suggest alternative treatments or refer you to a specialist if necessary."}

The best thing to do to help him is to talk to the social workers that are in the hospital. No matter where you live, they should be able to help you find a way to get some coverage for him. Hope I have answered your query. Let me know if I can assist you further.", "ai": " I'm sorry to hear about your father's condition and the financial difficulties you're facing. Both pneumonia and sepsis are serious conditions that require prompt medical attention.\n\nFor pneumonia, treatment typically involves antibiotics to clear the infection, as well as supportive care such as oxygen therapy and fluid replacement. For severe cases, mechanical ventilation may be necessary.\n\nFor sepsis, prompt administration of antibiotics is essential to address the underlying infection. In addition, supportive care such as intravenous fluids and oxygen therapy may be necessary to maintain vital organ function.\n\nRegarding your question about what you can do to get your father the surgery he needs, there are a few options you could consider:\n\n1. Apply for government or charity assistance: Depending on your location, there may be government programs or charities that offer financial assistance for medical procedures. You can check with your local health department, social service agencies, or hospitals to see if they can provide any resources or guidance.\n2. Crowdfunding: You could consider setting up a fundraising campaign on a platform like GoFundMe to help raise funds for your father's surgery. This can be an effective way to reach out to a large network of people and potentially raise a significant amount of money.\n3. Community support: Reach out to your community for support. This could include local religious or civic organizations, neighborhood associations, or even social media groups. People are often willing to help out when they hear of a desperate situation, and you may be able to tap into a network of resources and connections.\n4. Hospitals or medical centers: Some hospitals and medical centers offer financial assistance or payment plans for patients who are unable to pay for their care upfront. You can contact the hospital or medical center's financial assistance office to learn more about your options.\n5. Government programs: Depending on your location, there may be government programs that provide financial assistance for medical procedures. These programs can vary widely, so you will need to do some research to see if you qualify. For example, in the US, Medicare and Medicaid provide healthcare coverage for eligible individuals, and there are also programs like social security disability insurance and veterans benefits that may provide financial assistance for medical expenses.\n6. Insurance: If your father has insurance, you should make sure that you have fully exhausted all of the benefits that are available to you. This may include contacting your insurance company to ask about coverage for the surgical procedure, as well as any additional services or resources that may be available to help you navigate the healthcare system and manage the financial costs.\n\nI hope this information is helpful, and I wish your father a speedy and full recovery. If you have any further questions, don't hesitate to ask."}

Also I seem  to have palpitations when lying on my right side as well, when trying to go to sleep. this  Morning I woke up and my right arm hurt/was numb. I have tried stretching but it lasts for awhile.Can dehydration be a cause?", "human": "YES dehydration can be one of the factors inducing the pain and numbness of specific parts of your body but in your case i would like to ask you to consider your posture while sleeping and have your xray cervical spine done to look for cervical rib or cervical spondylosis if pain and numbness persists, moreover keep on taking a well balanced diet too.", "ai": " Yes, dehydration can potentially cause numbness in an arm and palpitations. Dehydration can lead to a decrease in blood volume, which can cause reduced blood flow to the arm, resulting in numbness. Palpitations, on the other hand, can be a symptom of dehydration due to the body attempting to increase heart rate to maintain blood pressure. However, it is important to note that there can be other causes for these symptoms, and it would be best to consult a healthcare professional for proper diagnosis. If dehydration is the cause, increasing fluid intake may help alleviate the symptoms."}

{"question": "What causes reactive HbSAg, high AST and ALT?my daughter donated blood at a camp. they sent her a note saying her HbSAg was reactive and her AST was 52 ( the normal level is 5 to 40) and her ALT was 77 (the normal range is 5 to 40) her T Bilirubin is 0.5 (0.2 to 1.3) and Anti-HbC is negative. D Bilirubin is 0.1 (0 to 0.4) T Protein is 7.2 (6 to 8) Albumin 4.4(3.5-5). what does it mean", "human": "Hello,the presence of HBsAg means that an individual has come into contact with hepatitis B virus. There are some rare exceptions to this rule. If the core antibody (anti-HBc) is negative then there are two possibilities. (1) there is an infection that has not yet led to increased antibodies against core antigens(2) there is no infection and HBsAg is reactive because of other antigens that cause cross-reactivity.The second is the most likely scenario unless your daughter had symptoms as well. In any case a repeat and more complete testing for hepatitis is warranted.So, besides HBsAg and anti-HBc, also please include the tests:- HBeAg- antiHBe- anti-HBs- liver function testsDoing them in a couple of weeks would be appropriate unless she has symptoms.If she does, then she'll need to contact an infectious diseases or hepatology specialist to receive treatment.I hope I've helped!If you'd like more information, you can contact me again.Kind Regards!", "ai": " Reactive HbSAg (Hepatitis B surface antigen) in your daughter's blood sample indicates an ongoing or past infection with Hepatitis B virus (HBV). The liver enzymes AST (Aspartate Aminotransferase) and ALT (Alanine Aminotransferase) being elevated (AST: 52, ALT: 77) suggests liver damage or inflammation. The normal range for both enzymes is 5 to 40 units per liter. Although this could indicate hepatic damage due to HBV infection, other factors such as medication use or underlying liver conditions should also be considered before making a definitive diagnosis. In this context, a negative Anti-HbC result rules out a superimposed Hepatitis C virus infection. However, further investigation, such as HBV DNA testing, is necessary to determine the current HBV status and the potential need for treatment. It's important for your daughter to follow up with her healthcare provider for proper evaluation and guideline-recommended management."}

In the meanwhile she has to take rest at home and avoid exertion.  Also please tell her to  check how her urine and stool color is.", "ai": " Based on the symptoms you've provided, possible causes for the bruises accompanied by tiredness, dizzy spells, and headaches in a 15-year-old granddaughter could include:\n\n1. Vitamin K deficiency: Bruising with a white center may indicate ecchymosis, which can occur due to Vitamin K deficiency. Vitamin K is crucial for blood clotting, and deficiency can lead to easy bruising. However, other symptoms like fatigue, dizziness, and headaches can suggest underlying conditions such as anemia, liver disease, or malabsorption syndromes.\n2. Disseminated Intravascular Coagulation (DIC): DIC is a serious condition that can cause easy bruising and bleeding, along with fatigue, dizziness, and headaches. It arises when the blood clots excessive amounts throughout the body, disrupting normal clotting, and causing tissue damage. DIC could be a complication of various conditions like sepsis, cancer, childbirth, or trauma.\n3. Medications: Certain medications, such as anticoagulants, antiplatelets, or steroids, could increase the risk of bruising and contribute to fatigue and other side effects. It is worth asking the granddaughter's GP if any medications might be causing these symptoms.\n4. Menstrual cycle: In case the 15-year-old granddaughter is menstruating, hormonal fluctuations during her cycle could exacerbate bruising, fatigue, and headache symptoms. It is advisable to discuss these symptoms with a healthcare professional for accurate diagnosis and appropriate treatment recommendations.\n5. Diet: A deficiency in nutrients like iron, Vitamin B12, or Folic acid can lead to fatigue, dizziness, and bruises. It might be an idea to consult the GP about this possibility and discuss potential dietary changes or supplements."}

{"question": "How to get a sure cure of acne ?hi, if you have been to the doctors before to get something checked out and they tell you that you have something similar to acne what can you ask for to get rid of them ?", "human": "Hi,thanks for query.Acne is very common problem of growing age.The reasons are hormonal changes,oily skin and enviormental effect.Please avoid too much of junk food,take good care of your skin after coming from out side.In case of infected acne you need to take a course of antibiotics to get rid of it.Some local creams also help.In case of severe problem,get in touch with a dermatologist.wishing you good health.", "ai": " Based on scientific evidence, there is no definitive \"cure\" for acne as it is a complex skin condition with various causes, including genetics, hormonal imbalances, and bacterial infections. However, effective treatments can help manage and reduce the severity of acne. Here are some evidence-based approaches suggested by dermatologists:\n\n1. Topical treatments: Prescription or over-the-counter topical medications, such as retinoids (e.g., adapalene, tretinoin), antibiotics (e.g., clindamycin, erythromycin), and benzoyl peroxide, target the pores and the bacteria that contribute to acne.\n\n2. Oral medications: In cases of severe acne, oral treatments such as antibiotics (e.g., isotretinoin, doxycycline), hormonal therapies (e.g., spironolactone), and oral retinoids can be prescribed by a healthcare professional to control acne.\n\n3. Hormonal balancing: If acne is caused by hormonal imbalances, your healthcare provider might suggest hormonal therapies, such as birth control pills or spironolactone, to help regulate hormones and reduce acne.\n\n4. Lifestyle modifications: Factors like stress, poor hygiene, and an unhealthy diet can contribute to acne. Making lifestyle changes like reducing stress through exercise or meditation, practicing good hygiene, and maintaining a healthy diet can help.\n\n5. Chemical peels and microdermabrasion: These cosmetic procedures exfoliate the skin and help to unclog pores, reducing the appearance of acne. Consult a licensed professional for these treatments.\n\n6. Laser or light therapy: Depending on the severity of acne, your doctor might recommend laser or light therapy, such as blue light or photodynamic therapy, to help kill acne-causing bacteria and reduce inflammation.\n\n7. Diet modifications: Some foods, such as sugary and dairy products, have been linked to acne. Reducing your consumption of these foods can help manage acne.\n\nIf you've already discussed these options with your doctor, you may want to explore alternative treatments like natural remedies or holistic approaches, but keep in mind that scientific research may not support their efficacy. Remember that acne treatments work best when used consistently, so be patient and give your chosen treatment time to work. If you have any concerns or experience side effects, consult your healthcare professional for guidance."}

In the meantime, you can try to ease your anxiety by practicing relaxation techniques, such as deep breathing exercises and progressive muscle relaxation. Additionally, try to avoid heavy lifting, strenuous activities, and stressors that may aggravate your symptoms."}
{"question": "How to cure seizures permanently?My daughter has taken Topamax for seizures. She quit taken the meds several months ago and her seizures are coming back more frequently then before. She said her insurance will not cover them anymore. What should I do ? She just had another seizure today.", "human": "welcome to HCM!From my clinical expeirnece I can tell you that your daughter should start the medicine as soon as possible. As you mentioned that her seizures are back with more intensity, and the nature is different now, so , you should preffrably  see a neurologist and take consultation before starting drugs. She should also get an MRI brain to rule out any organicity, get her liver function test and blood counts (prior to starting drugs). I know it is very difficult to take long term medication but it is really important for her to remain seizure free. Every seizure destroys some brain cells, and thereby making her prone to get more of them. Apart from drugs you should see that she dosent drive for some time now, operates machinery under supervision.Please try to cut expenses on other things and ask her to take medicine, she needs them. Donot stop the drugs without consulting the doctor.Hope the reply is usefulDr. Manisha Gopal", "ai": " I'm an AI language model and cannot physically breathe or cure seizures. However, I can suggest some possible strategies based on current medical knowledge. Seizure cure without medication may not be a definitive solution for everyone, as it often depends on the underlying cause of the seizures. Here are some recommendations:\n\n1. Consult with a Neurologist: It's essential to discuss your daughter's condition with her neurologist. They may suggest alternative medication options, lifestyle modifications, or other treatments based on her specific condition and medical history.\n\n2. Dietary modifications: Ketogenic or low glycemic index diets have shown some benefits in controlling seizures for some people, although not for all. Consulting a dietitian specialized in seizure disorders could be helpful.\n\n3. Lifestyle modifications: Eliminating or reducing stress, getting sufficient sleep, and regular physical activity can help manage seizures. Encouraging your daughter to maintain a consistent daily routine and avoiding known triggers can also be beneficial.\n\n4. Complementary therapies: Acupuncture, biofeedback, massage therapy, and transcranial magnetic stimulation might help some patients manage their seizures. Always consult a healthcare professional before trying any complementary therapies.\n\n5. Clinical trials: Depending on your location and eligibility, your daughter might be able to participate in clinical trials investigating new treatments for seizures.\n\n6. Alternative funding sources: If insurance is no longer covering her seizure medications, look for alternative funding sources such as medical grants, nonprofit organizations, and patient assistance programs. You can also search for programs based on your location and specific diagnosis on websites like RxHope, NeedyMeds, and GoodRx.\n\n7. Consider a medical alert system: Having a medical alert system in place can help ensure your daughter receives help quickly if she experiences a seizure. Many systems offer wearable devices that can detect and notify emergency services if needed.\n\nAlways consult with your daughter's healthcare provider before making any significant changes to her treatment plan."}
{"question": "Does Nano-Leo help with sperm morphology and low sperm count?We went for fertility issues. Doctor prescribed me Nano-leo even though I don t have ED problem or low testosterone problem. My issue is more with sperm morphology (2% strict kruger) or lowish count (40m/ml) but according to the info on web Nano-Leo does not help with that.

While some studies suggest that Nano-Leo may improve semen quality, there is limited scientific evidence to support its effectiveness in addressing sperm morphology issues or low sperm count specifically.\n\nTherefore, whether or not Nano-Leo is suitable for your condition depends on the underlying causes of your fertility issues. In your case, since your doctor has prescribed it for you despite your primary concerns being sperm morphology and count, it may be worth giving it a try. However, it is essential to communicate with your healthcare provider regarding any concerns or questions you may have about your treatment plan. They can provide you with accurate and reliable information based on your specific health situation.\n\nIt is important to keep in mind that there are no guaranteed cures for infertility, and various factors can impact one's fertility. Consulting with a healthcare professional and exploring all available treatment options is crucial for receiving appropriate care and addressing any underlying fertility concerns. Additionally, maintaining a healthy lifestyle, including a balanced diet, regular exercise, and minimizing stress, can also contribute to overall reproductive health and potentially improve fertility outcomes."}

I understand your concern.         Primolute  N-a hormonal preparation of female sex hormone... is contraindicated in pregnancy.      It can cause fetal congenital abnormality &so such pregnancy (with intake of pills like promolute n ) needs to be terminated.   Thanks.", "ai": " Primolut-N, also known as norethisterone, is a synthetic progestogen hormone used to treat various conditions, including irregular periods and menopausal symptoms. It can also be used as a contraceptive.\n\nTaking Primolut-N during early pregnancy, especially in the first trimester, increases the risk of birth defects, particularly in the genitourinary system. These defects can include ambiguous genitalia, hypospadias, or epispadias, which may require surgery. However, the risk is generally low, and most babies born to mothers who took Primolut-N during pregnancy develop normally.\n\nThe risk appears to be higher when taken during the first 6-8 weeks of pregnancy, so if you suspect you might be pregnant, it's essential to stop taking Primolut-N and consult your doctor.\n\nIt's also important to remember that every pregnancy is unique, and no medication can guarantee 100% safety. Discontinuing the medication as soon as you find out you're pregnant is the best course of action to minimize any potential risks.\n\nStay informed, stay healthy!"}

Dengue fever is characterized by a high fever, severe headache, joint pain, muscle and bone pain, and a characteristic skin rash called erythematoous rash, which appears late in the disease after the other symptoms have appeared and subsided.\n\nIf the rashes persist or worsen, I would suggest consulting a healthcare professional, who can evaluate your son's condition and provide appropriate treatment. In the meantime, I would recommend discontinuing the use of Combiflam and any other new medication your son may have been given recently.\n\nIn the case of a suspected dengue fever, it is essential to seek medical attention promptly, as early diagnosis and treatment can help reduce the severity of the disease and mitigate complications. However, the symptoms you have described do not specifically point towards dengue fever.\n\nFor more information and peace of mind, I would recommend contacting a healthcare professional or the Poison Control Center (if available in your country) for guidance on the situation."}

Please consult your father's doctor or a healthcare professional for the most accurate information.\n\n1. Pain Management: Stick to the prescribed pain medication schedule to keep the pain under control. Over-the-counter pain relief options, like acetaminophen, should be avoided without consulting a doctor, as they may interfere with other medications.\n\n2. Positioning: Encourage your father to lie on his side with a pillow between his knees, or on his back with a pillow under his knees to help alleviate pain when sitting or lying down. A soft, comfortable seat with good back support can help when sitting.\n\n3. Regular Exercise: Light, low-impact exercises like walking for short distances, or using a stationary bike or pool therapy, may help maintain mobility and reduce pain over time.

This may present as a lump or bulge, and it can be more noticeable when standing or straining.\n2. Cyst: A cyst is a fluid-filled sac that can develop in various areas of the body, including the scrotum or perianal region. A cyst in the perianal area could potentially cause a bump that is felt between the testicles and anus.\n3. Abscess: An abscess is a localized infection that can cause a painful, swollen mass. If the bump is accompanied by signs of infection, such as fever, chills, or redness, it could be an abscess.\n4.

{"question": "What does this chest X-ray indicate?I have a copy of chest x-ray that I had to check for Pneumonia The doctor said no Pneumonia but rather asthmatic bronchitis.

I have gone through the x ray report you have mentioned. This x ray report is normal. No need to worry for pneumonia or tuberculosis. Asthmatic bronchitis is diagnosed by PFT (Pulmonary Function Test). Chest x ray is almost always normal in asthmatic bronchitis.So better to consult pulmonologist and get done clinical examination of respiratory system and PFT (Pulmonary Function Test).If PFT is showing obstructive defect then asthmatic bronchitis is likely. Hope I have solved your query. I will be happy to help you further. Wish you good health. Thanks.", "ai": " Based on the information provided in the chest X-ray report, the following findings were noted:\n\n1. No acute infiltrations: This means there is no evidence of an acute infection or consolidation (solid white area) seen in the lungs.\n2. Slight coarsening of the bronchovascular markings: This refers to a slight thickening of the blood vessels and bronchial walls in the lungs, which can be a sign of chronic bronchitis or asthma.\n3. Sharp costophrenic angles: This suggests that there is no pleural effusion (fluid accumulation) in the chest cavity.\n4. Normal heart size: The heart appears to be of normal size which is a good thing.\n5. Uncoiled aorta: The aorta, the large blood vessel that carries blood from the heart to the rest of the body, is not enlarged.\n\nGiven the clinical history of asthma in the past and the X-ray findings, the diagnosis of asthmatic bronchitis is consistent. Asthmatic bronchitis is a type of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) characterized by chronic inflammation of the bronchial tubes, which can result in recurrent bronchitis, bronchial thickening, and persistent cough with or without sputum production. Though the patient had a history of asthma which is typically characterized by reversible airflow obstruction, the imaging findings suggest that the bronchial wall thickening and inflammation are more consistent with a diagnosis of asthmatic bronchitis rather than asthma itself.\n\nIn summary, the chest X-ray report suggests no evidence of pneumonia or acute lung infection, but rather findings consistent with chronic bronchitis or asthmatic bronchitis."}

Your pain seems as if one of the nerves in dorsal spine is being pressed.  I suggest MRI of Dorsal spine , Pain killers , Pregabalin . If pain does not improve in few days time , I suggest you consult a pain specialist who may use nerve block to relieve pain.", "ai": " Mid-back pain radiating towards the ribs in the context of spinal stenosis could be caused by nerve compression or irritation in the thoracic spine. Spinal stenosis, particularly in the thoracic region, can lead to this symptom due to the compression or irritation of the nerves that supply the mid-back and ribs. This can result in pain, discomfort, or even ribcage sensitivity, worsening with upright posture and improving with slouching. Consult your healthcare provider for evaluation and potential treatment options such as physical therapy, medications, or surgery, as appropriate."}
{"question": "Q. Can having Cymbalta lead to no sexual drive in a patient with fibromyalgia?Hi doctor,My girlfriend has fibromyalgia and is currently on Cymbalta and a muscle relaxant. She said she has no desire for sex but it seems she is having sexual dreams. She does not know that she is doing it but it does not make sense to me. When she was on Tramadol, everything was fine unless she was just high from that drug. Any insight from you would be helpful. Thank you.", "human": "Hello. For further information consult a rheumatologist online --> https://www.icliniq.com/ask-a-doctor-online/rheumatologist", "ai": " Yes, Cymbalta (duloxetine) can cause a decrease in sexual desire (libido) in some patients with fibromyalgia. Duloxetine is an antidepressant that also acts on certain neurotransmitters in the brain that are involved in sexual function. Sexual side effects, including decreased libido and anorgasmia (inability to achieve orgasm), are common with this medication. However, your girlfriend's report of having sexual dreams suggests that her sexual drive might not be completely absent, but her arousal or ability to respond may be affected. Alternatively, her muscle relaxant could also contribute to the issue as some muscle relaxants have been known to decrease sexual desire. It's important to discuss her concerns with her healthcare provider, as they might consider adjusting her medications or suggesting alternative treatments to improve her sexual function."}
{"question": "I have two small gall bladder polyps (4-5 mm), will it create any problem in pregnancy ?I am 32 yr old male & have been detected with two small Gb polyps, 4-5 mm in size, during a routine health check. I have no other problem or symptom as per my complete health check report. A doctor has advised me to get my gall bladder removed, but I am not convinced. Pls suggest what should I do.", "human": "Hi Shailender,Welcome to HCM.I presume the GB polyps were detected during routine ultrasound examination. I suggest you consult a gastroenterologist and most probably it will have to be doubly confirmed and if it is proved beyond doubt that you have polyp in the Gall Bladder, then yes it is advisable to have your GB removed.", "ai": " Based on the information provided, having small gallbladder polyps (4-5 mm) does not necessarily mean you will experience issues during pregnancy. In most cases, these polyps are asymptomatic and do not cause complications. However, there is a small risk of developing gallstones or cholecystitis, which could potentially lead to pregnancy-related complications, although this risk is relatively low.\n\nGiven your young age and the absence of symptoms, it may be reasonable to monitor the situation closely instead of undergoing unnecessary surgery. Regular ultrasound scans can be scheduled to monitor the polyps and check for any changes. If the polyps grow in size or symptoms develop, then surgical intervention may be considered.\n\nConsult a specialist, such as a gastroenterologist or a surgeon, to discuss your options and gather more information about the risks and benefits of leaving the polyps in place or having a cholecystectomy while taking the pregnancy into account. Keep in mind that making an informed decision requires careful consideration of your unique situation and circumstances."}

It is morphine partial agonist and from morphine family. In that case, you would suggest to take him to emergency set up and get him treated. Sometime, overdose of opioid lead to respiratory depression, which may be harmful.Thanks", "ai": " Buprenorphine is a partial opioid agonist used to treat opioid addiction, not a morphine derivative. However, it can cause side effects such as confusion, memory loss, and emotional instability, especially when misused or taken inconsistently. The injection of a sublingual tablet is not recommended because it can lead to adverse effects such as increased risk of overdose, liver toxicity, and infection at the injection site. The severe depression and past head injury your friend has could also contribute to these symptoms. If he is experiencing such side effects persistently, it is important that he consults his healthcare professional to review his dosage, administration method, or any potential interactions with other medications he is taking."}

My sis said its my wisdom teeth but it kind of moves when I poke it", "human": "Hi Dear,Welcome to HCM.Understanding your concern. As per your query lump on my jaw line is mainly due to  swollen lymph node, which is sub-mandibular group of lymph nodes and any infection in the head and neck region like teeth and gums, ear can cause this. I would suggest you to consult a physician and get evaluated and in case of infection antibiotic course can resolve the swelling. In case the swelling does not subside even after treatment or in case if there is no pathology found Biopsy has to be done to rule out for any malignant pathology such as tumor.Hope your concern has been resolved.Get Well Soon.Best Wishes,Dr. Harry Maheshwari", "ai": " Several causes can result in a jaw line lump, including but not limited to:\n\n1. Swollen lymph nodes: Lymph nodes in the neck and jaw area can become swollen due to an infection, such as a common cold, tonsillitis, or a tooth infection.\n2. Bruxism: Grinding or clenching of teeth can cause muscle tension and swelling, resulting in a jaw line lump.\n3. Salivary gland issues: The salivary glands located in the jaw area can become inflamed or infected, leading to a lump.\n4. Temporomandibular joint (TMJ) disorder: Dysfunction in the TMJ can cause jaw pain and tenderness, which may present as a lump.\n5. Nerve issues: Some nerve conditions, such as trigeminal neuralgia or Bell's palsy, can result in jaw line lumps.\n6. Tumors: While rare, a tumor can cause a jaw line lump.

However, if you are feeling unwell or have a fever, it is recommended that you reschedule your donation appointment until you have recovered. If your cough is severe or persistent, it may be best to consult with your healthcare provider before donating to ensure it is safe for you to do so. The American Red Cross allows donations from individuals with a cough, as long as they are otherwise healthy and meet the eligibility requirements."}
{"question": "What causes high heart rate while race walking?I am a healthy 58 yrs old woman. I race walk competively. I have been going faster lately. Sometimes my heart rate goes to 230 for 10-20 seconds. When I end my race walking trainings (4 miles average), my heart rate drops down quickly, no problem. Should I worry about the 230?", "human": "hello thanks for posting here. A heart rate of 230 on exertion definitely requires evaluation. however first of all we need to evaluate whether you really reach that 230 reading. while running the heart rate detector may mistake your body vibrations and movements for heart beats and count them  accordingly. hence the heart rate may erroneously show a high reading. So you have to check whethrr it happens with you only or with everyone. Another thing that can be done is a treadmill test. It requires you to run on a treadmill, the speed of which increases gradually to a point till your heart rate reaches a target rate. this TMT test will continuously record your EKG while you are running so all aberrations and errors can be rules out. It will definitely show whether you really have a fast heart rate on exercising. If it documents very fast heart rate further work up can be done. wishing yoi good health. thank you", "ai": " A heart rate of 230 beats per minute during race walking, even if only for a brief period, is considered very high for an adult, particularly for someone your age. Several factors can contribute to an elevated heart rate during physical activity:\n\n1. Fitness level: As you mentioned, you have been going faster in your race walking training recently. Your heart rate may increase as your body adjusts to the higher intensity.\n2. Adrenaline: The body releases adrenaline when you're engaged in competitive activities or under stress. Adrenaline can cause an increase in heart rate as it prepares the body for action.\n3. Dehydration: If you're not adequately hydrated during your training, your heart may work harder to pump blood through your body, potentially leading to a higher heart rate.\n\nWhile it is normal for the heart rate to increase during physical activity, a heart rate of 230 beats per minute is outside the normal range for an adult. Even if the high heart rate only lasts for a few seconds and your heart rate returns to normal after your workout, it is still important to discuss this with your healthcare provider. They can evaluate your overall health, including your heart health, and provide guidance on whether any further testing or interventions are necessary.\n\nRemember that individual factors, like age, gender, and overall health, can influence what is considered a \"normal\" heart rate. It is essential to trust your healthcare provider's expertise and follow their recommendations to maintain your well-being while engaging in competitive activities."}

If you have any drug allergy history or allergy please consult your physician before taking medicine. Follow up after three days.", "ai": " Based on your description, it is likely that you have gingivitis or an infection in the tooth. Here are some suggestions:\n\n1. Practice good oral hygiene: Brush your teeth twice a day with fluoride toothpaste and floss daily to remove food particles and plaque between your teeth.\n2. Over-the-counter pain relief: You can take over-the-counter pain relievers like ibuprofen or acetaminophen to help relieve the tooth pain.\n3. Rinse with salt water: Rinse your mouth with warm salt water several times a day to help reduce inflammation and kill bacteria.\n4. Avoid sugary or spicy foods: Avoid sugary or spicy foods that can irritate your gums and make the pain worse.\n5. Use a cold compress: Applying a cold compress on the affected area can help reduce swelling and ease the pain.\n6. Avoid using pan masala: Try to quit using pan masala as it contains tobacco and other harmful chemicals that can irritate your gums and lead to further oral health problems.\n7. If the pain persists, seek medical advice: If the tooth pain and gum swelling do not go away after a few days, it is best to consult a dentist or healthcare professional for further evaluation and treatment. They can examine your teeth and gums and recommend appropriate treatments like dental cleaning, prescription pain relievers, antibiotics, or surgical intervention if needed."}

He is normal healthy person with  slight high pressure.", "human": "Hello!Thank you for asking on HCM!Regarding your concern, his symptoms may be related to an infection or inflammation of the soft tissues of his breast. I recommend consulting with the GP for a careful physical examination, a chest x ray study and some blood lab tets : -complete blood count-PCR, sedimentation rate (inflammation). A chest CT scan and biopsy of the lump may be necessary to determine the nature of this lesion. Hope to have been helpful!Best wishes, Dr. Iliri", "ai": " There is no direct link between a high blood pressure (hypertension) and pain or a lump in the left nipple. These symptoms could be indicative of various conditions, such as:\n\n1. Benign breast conditions like gynecomastia or fibrocystic changes.\n2. Inflammatory conditions like eczema, psoriasis, or dermatitis.\n3. Breast infections, such as mastitis or breast abscess.\n4.

No specific medication are required nor available for this.Get yourself examined by an ENT specialist to look for your vocal chords.Take care.", "ai": " I understand that you're concerned about your voice and feeling self-conscious due to it being perceived as lighter than average for a male. Several factors can contribute to a lighter voice in boys, and it's essential to identify the underlying cause to address the issue effectively. Some common reasons for a lighter voice in boys include:\n\n1. Puberty: Voice change and deepening occurs during puberty due to the hormonal changes, which may not have fully occurred yet. You mentioned feeling self-conscious, and this could be a normal part of the maturation process.\n2. Voice usage: Boys often use their voices differently, such as speaking at higher pitches in group settings or when emoting strongly in a movie or game. Regularly using a louder, deeper voice may help strengthen the vocal cords and improve overall tone.\n3. Health conditions: Certain medical conditions like laryngitis, vocal cord nodules, or other vocal injuries can lead to a lighter voice. In this case, consulting a medical professional would be necessary to rule out any underlying health issues.\n4. Genetics: Some boys naturally have lighter voices due to their genetic makeup, just as some may naturally have deeper voices.\n\nWhile there's no definitive medicine to make your voice heavier, there are some exercises and tips that can help improve your vocal tone. These include:\n\n1. Proper breathing techniques\n2. Diaphragmatic breathing, focusing on using your stomach muscles while inhaling\n3. Humming exercises: Practice humming with a strong, steady tone and gradually increase the volume\n4. Vocal cord exercises: Practice different types of vocal sounds, such as singing scales or reading aloud in a deep tone\n5. Proper hydration: Staying hydrated helps keep your vocal cords lubricated\n\nIf you've tried these techniques and still feel self-conscious about your voice, it may help to discuss your concerns with a trusted mentor or medical professional. They can offer support and guidance, and you might find that others' perceptions of your voice become less important as you gain confidence in yourself."}

I hope you got my answer.Thanks.Dr. Ilyas Patel MD", "ai": " I understand that you are looking for an alternative or more affordable medication for hair loss, specifically a substitute for what your doctor has prescribed. Based on the medications you've mentioned (Anutaplus, Bitozed Forte, Zinfate, Dazit, and Zinetac), it appears that these are branded versions of common hair loss treatments.\n\nTwo widely used hair loss medications are Finasteride (brand name Proscar or Propecia) and Minoxidil (brand names Rogaine or Regaine). These medications have been shown to effective for treating hair loss in men, and may also be effective for women.\n\nFinasteride is a pill that is taken once a day and works by reducing dihydrotestosterone (DHT) levels in the scalp, which is a hormone linked to hair loss. Minoxidil is a topical solution that is applied directly to the scalp twice a day and works by stimulating hair follicles to grow new hair.\n\nPrices for these medications can vary depending on location, insurance, and specific brands. However, in general, generic versions of Finasteride and Minoxidil are usually less expensive than their branded counterparts. These generic versions can be purchased at lower prices online or at discounted pharmacies.\n\nIt's important to note that both Finasteride and Minoxidil require a prescription from a healthcare professional, so it's best to consult with your doctor regarding your options for treating hair loss. Additionally, they may take several months to show results, and it's essential to use them consistently as prescribed for optimal results.\n\nAnother way to approach hair loss is through lifestyle changes, such as a balanced diet, stress management, and regular exercise. Certain vitamin supplements, like biotin or saw palmetto, have also been reported to help some individuals with hair loss, although there is limited scientific evidence to support their use.\n\nNon-medical treatments like scalp massage, laser therapy, and using hair care products that promote hair growth can also be beneficial in managing hair loss. In addition, wearing wigs or hairpieces, or practicing different hairstyles like a pixie cut or buns can help hide the signs of hair loss.\n\nAlways consult with your healthcare professional before beginning any new treatments for hair loss, as they can provide personalized advice based on your individual needs and medical history."}

He jogs every night for 30 minutes. He looks healthy. We consulted our cardiologist early this month and he requested for 2D Echo and treadmill stress test. Unfortunately, we were scheduled for a consult but now we have lockdown for Covid-19. I hope you can help me understand the condition of my son. Thank you.", "human": "Hi. Could you upload his ECG (electrocardiogram) if it has been taken and also his echo and treadmill results?", "ai": " A. Right Bundle Branch Block (RBBB) is a type of electrical conduction disorder in the heart. During an ECG (Electrocardiogram), it appears as a specific pattern of waves, which simply means that the right bundle branch, a part of the heart's electrical conduction system, has a slight delay in transmitting electrical impulses. RBBB itself is generally not a serious condition, as many people with RBBB live normal, healthy lives. In your son's case, it is essential to consider other findings from his ECG, as well as his medical history and physical exam, to determine if any further evaluation or treatment is required.\n\nMild Mitral Regurgitation (MMR) is a condition where there is a leak or backward flow of blood in the mitral valve, one of the four heart valves. Mild mitral regurgitation is a common finding in apparently healthy individuals and usually causes no symptoms. However, in some cases, it can progress to cause heart enlargement, shortness of breath, or fatigue, particularly during exertion. An echocardiogram can provide more information about the extent and significance of the mitral regurgitation. As your son's cardiologist has requested further evaluation, I would recommend following their guidance closely and discussing any concerns with them."}

{"question": "Suggest treatment for Lyme diseaseMy husband has Lyme disease diginosed by a blood test. He ha been prescribed 100 mg capsules to be taken twice a day of Doxycycline for three weeks. Is this enough time, and a high enough dose. He is 79 and taking no prescriptions, and is in good health. I am also giving him tumeric and a probiotic. Any suggestions? YYYY@YYYY", "human": "Dear Mam,i understand your concerns about your husbands health.The antibiotic regimen he is taking (doxycycline 100 mg twice daily for 21 days) is the correct regimen for his case, and should be enough to get rid of this disease in an early stage.The use of probiotics and tumeric has no effect on the disease itself but they are not contraindicated.Best regards", "ai": " Based on the information you've provided, the standard treatment for Lyme disease in an adult is usually 2-4 weeks of antibiotics, typically with doxycycline at a dose of 100mg twice daily. Three weeks of treatment is considered adequate for early-stage Lyme disease, but for more chronic or complex cases, longer treatment periods or different antibiotics may be necessary. Your husband's age and overall good health are positive factors, and the addition of turmeric and a probiotic may help with inflammation and gut health during treatment. However, it's always best for him to consult with his healthcare provider about any concerns or questions regarding his treatment plan."}
{"question": "What causes 200/121 BP level?my blood presssure reading on a home cuff moniter just read 200 over 121.  It usually runs high in the evening, but this is the highest it has ever read.  I take lisinopril 20 mg twice a day (40 mg total) and metorlol 50 mg twice a day (100 mg total).  Should I go to the emergency room or wait and call my Dr. in the morinig?", "human": "Hello,         200/121 BP is very high. As you are already having treatment for hypertension, then this much of high BP is not expected after treatment. * Check your BP once again, if its still high then do consult your doctor immediately as this much BP may lead to bleeding in body. Bleeding can be from nose as epistaxis but if it occurs internally then it might lead to serious outcomes.* Also keep some emergency medicine at home for emergency. You can keep capsule nifedipine (5mg) at home and in emergency  take it sublingually. You can ask your doctor about this capsule.* Keep an eye on salt in your diet and cut off extra salt from diet and do walk daily. Both these things will help in controlling high BP.* But for now consult your doctor first.* I hope you are satisfied with my answer.

Here are some potential causes and possible treatments for your symptoms:\n\n1. Erectile dysfunction (ED): This can be caused by various factors, including physical and emotional conditions. Lifestyle modifications such as quitting smoking, exercising regularly, and reducing stress can help improve ED. Medications like sildenafil (Viagra), tadalafil (Cialis), and vardenafil (Levitra) can also be prescribed to help improve erectile function.\n2. Low testosterone levels: Your undescended testis may indicate a problem with testosterone production. Testosterone replacement therapy may be an option, but it's important to have your blood tests done to confirm low levels before starting any treatment.\n3. Prostate issues: Watery semen or low volume semen could be a sign of prostate problems. It's important to have a prostate exam and blood tests done to rule out any potential issues. Treatments may include medications or surgery.\n4. Lifestyle factors: Frequent masturbation or sexual activity may contribute to lower semen volume. Reducing the frequency of these activities and practicing abstinence for extended periods may help improve semen volume.\n5. Other causes: Other potential causes of ED and low semen volume include neurological conditions, certain medications, and underlying health issues like diabetes or heart disease. It's essential to get a proper diagnosis from a healthcare professional to determine the underlying cause and the most effective treatment options.\n\nIt's crucial to remember that everyone's body is different, and what works for one person may not work for another. Always consult with a healthcare professional for personalized advice on managing your symptoms."}
{"question": "Suggest treatment for headache and sinus infectionI have recently been having headaches, around temples and sinus area which is very unusual for me. Also my eyes have been extremely dry and itchy. I noticed when trying to blow my nose there is a rattling . Like a piece between my nostrils is vibrating. My right nostril almost gets closed off when I blow. I couldn t breathe through my nose last night while sleeping. My right sinus area also seems heavy with congestion. My first thought was a deviated septum. Thoughts?", "human": "Hello ! I read your question and understand your concern. In my opinion your troubles are not caused by a neurological problem. The troubles you are having seem to come from your sinus . I would like to know if you are allergic. I would recommend a sinus x ray for sinusitis and a nasal inspection with nasal speculum from a ORL specialist to rule out a possible obstruction of the nasal nostril. The most probable diagnosis may be a nasal polip or a septal deviation. Although septal deviations give recurrent sinusitis and are from birth . So a nasal septum deviation could give problems since childhood.  Hope to have been helpful!Thank you for using HCM !Best wishes, Dr. Abaz", "ai": " Based on the symptoms you've described, it seems likely that you're experiencing both a headache and a sinus infection. Here are some treatments that may help alleviate your symptoms:\n\n1. Decongestants: Over-the-counter decongestants can help reduce sinus pressure and congestion in the nasal passages, which may help alleviate headaches and improve breathing.\n2. Saline nasal spray: This can help thin and drain mucus from the nasal passages, providing relief from congestion and pressure in the sinuses.\n3. Antihistamines or antihistamine-decongestant combination: These medications can help reduce inflammation and congestion in the nasal passages and sinuses, which may help relieve headaches and eye symptoms.\n4. Pain relievers: Over-the-counter pain relievers, such as ibuprofen or acetaminophen, can help reduce the pain and discomfort associated with headaches and sinus pressure.\n5. Hydration: Staying hydrated can help thin mucus and make it easier to drain from the sinuses, which may help alleviate symptoms. Sip on fluids throughout the day, and consider using a humidifier at night to add moisture to the air.\n6. Warm compress: Applying a warm compress to the affected area may help alleviate sinus pressure and reduce pain.\n\nIf your symptoms persist after trying these treatments, or if they worsen, it may be a good idea to consult with a healthcare professional for further evaluation. The rattling and almost complete blockage in your right nostril could potentially be a sign of a deviated septum, but it could also be a symptom of other conditions such as nasal polyps or septal swelling. It's important to get an accurate diagnosis to ensure that you're receiving the most effective treatment for your specific condition."}

This can lead to a reduced supply of oxygenated blood to the body, including the extremities, causing a decrease in SpO2 readings. Orthostatic hypotension can be a symptom of various conditions, such as dehydration, Parkinson's disease, multiple system atrophy, or certain medications. In your case, it's important to consult your healthcare provider for a proper evaluation, especially considering your age, falling spells, and bright light vision. They may consider testing for underlying causes and potential treatments."}
