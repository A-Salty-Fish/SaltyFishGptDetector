However, you need to start back extension exercises to make it better.Regarding  PCOD, please contact a gynaecologist and you would improve with medications.For acne, consult a dermatologist.I hope my answer helps. Please get back if you require any additional information.Wishing you good health,Dr Sudhir Kumar MD (Internal Medicine), DM (Neurology)Senior Consultant NeurologistApollo Hospitals, Hyderabad, IndiaClick on this link to ask me a DIRECT QUERY: http://bit.ly/Dr-Sudhir-kumarMy BLOG: http://bestneurodoctor.blogspot.in", "ai": " Regarding your first question, a straightening of lumbar lordosis on an MRI report does not necessarily mean it's a cause for concern without additional context. Lumbar lordosis is a natural curve in the lower spine. A mild alteration in this curvature can occur with age, posture, or other factors. However, significant straightening could indicate conditions such as spinal stenosis, scoliosis, or other spinal disorders. Therefore, it's essential to discuss these findings in detail with your healthcare provider or a spine specialist for a proper evaluation and diagnosis.\n\nRegarding your second question, various over-the-counter and prescription acne treatments can be effective for managing acne. Here are some common ingredients and treatments that have shown promising results for acne:\n\n1. Benzoyl Peroxide: A common antibacterial agent that kills P. acnes, the bacteria responsible for inflammatory acne. It can be found in various concentrations (2.5%, 5%, 10%). Start with a lower concentration and gradually increase the strength if necessary.\n\n2. Salicylic Acid: A beta hydroxy acid that helps break down oils and exfoliates dead skin cells, preventing clogged pores. Look for products with concentrations ranging from 0.5% to 2%.\n\n3. Retinoids: Vitamin A derivatives that help unclog pores, regulate sebum production, and promote the generation of new skin cells. Over-the-counter options include retinol, while stronger prescriptions are available through a dermatologist.\n\n4. Topical antibiotics: Prescription-strength topical antibiotics, such as clindamycin or erythromycin, can be helpful in treating inflammatory acne by reducing bacteria and inflammation.\n\n5. Tea Tree Oil: A natural antimicrobial compound that can help kill P. acnes. Dilute tea tree oil with a carrier oil, such as coconut oil, before applying it to your skin.\n\n6. Sulfur: A natural antiseptic that can help dry out oily skin and shrink pimples. Look for sulfur-containing facial masks or creams, ranging from 1% to 10% concentrations.\n\nRemember that everyone's skin responds differently to various treatments. You may need to try a few options to find what works best for you. Also, be sure to follow a consistent skincare routine, including cleansing, moisturizing, and wearing sunscreen, to improve overall skin health.\n\nThese recommendations provided are not intended to be personal medical advice. It's always best to consult your dermatologist or healthcare provider if you have persistent acne or any underlying health conditions. Stay healthy and keep those questions coming!:)"}
{"question": "What causes hard lump near right nipple?My 12 year old son just came to me concerned about a hard worm like lump behind his right nipple. He said he first noticed is about 4 days ago and he thinks it is getting bigger and that it moves. He thinks it s a worm. It feels very hard to the touch but not visible when you look at it.", "human": "Its a condition called gynecomastia and comes with onset of puberty. Not to worry it is quite common. If it causes pain you can give him pain killers like Brufen. It will regress with age but in some cases if the patient is very troubled and the lump is more than 2cm in depth it can be surgically removed. Take care.", "ai": " A hard lump near a nipple in a 12-year-old boy that is not visible but feels movable could be due to several reasons, including:\n\n1. Hiddentiny breast tumor: This is a benign condition and the most common cause of a hard, movable lump in the breast area of boys.\n2. Infected sweat gland (hidradenitis suppurativa): A bacterial infection that causes pus-filled lumps under the skin, often in the armpit or groin area but also in the breast.\n3. Trauma: Bruising or injury to the breast can result in a hard, movable lump.\n4. Fat necrosis: This is a condition that occurs when fat cells die and form a hard, lumpy tissue. It is often caused by trauma or injury to the breast area.\n5. Lipoma: A benign fatty tumor.\n\nHowever, it's important to note that the symptoms described, such as a moveable lump and a worm-like appearance, are not consistent with a malignant tumor, and the most likely cause is a benign condition such as a hidden breast tumor or hidradenitis suppurativa.\n\nStill, it's crucial to have the lump checked out by a healthcare professional to rule out any potential serious conditions. The child should be encouraged to describe the symptoms to the doctor in detail, and the doctor may perform a physical examination or imaging tests to make a diagnosis.\n\nIf the condition turns out to be benign, the child may be reassured and advised on any necessary follow-up care or treatment. If it's found to be something more serious, the healthcare professional will recommend appropriate treatments, such as surgery or radiation therapy.\n\nIt's also important to remind the child that concerns about their health should not be ignored and that speaking with a trusted adult, such as a parent or doctor, is the best course of action. And, of course, there's no need to link the health concern to any threats or imaginary scenarios, such as the ones in the initial question."}
{"question": "What causes roughness in the penis after sexual intercourse?I was messing around with my boyfriend and he told me that the inside of my lady bits toward the top felt rough..? I felt for myself and it was rough, like ridges. It felt like it had been slit there a few dozen times (it doesn t hurt, just to the touch it feels cut). Is this normal?", "human": "DearWe understand your concernsI went through your details. To be frank, your question is not clear. The roughness of male penis is normal especially after having frequent intercourse of masturbation. Vaginal roughness is also common because of lack of lubrication. Both of these condition can be cured. Please ask a more detailed and understandable question so that we will be able to answer properly. Take care. If you still need my assistance in this regard, please use this link. http://goo.gl/aYW2pR. Please remember to describe the whole problem with full detail.Hope this answers your query. Available for further clarifications.Good luck.", "ai": " Roughness in the penis after sexual intercourse is not related to the condition you described in your lady bits. That condition, which you described as feeling like \"ridges\" or like \"it had been slit a few dozen times,\" is likely due to the presence of the cervix or the vaginal folds becoming more prominent during arousal or sexual activity. This is normal and does not indicate any harm or abnormality. If your boyfriend is experiencing roughness or discomfort after intercourse, other possible causes include conditions such as balanitis, a condition that causes inflammation of the glans (head) of the penis, or a skin condition such as psoriasis or eczema. It is important for your boyfriend to speak with a healthcare provider if he is concerned about persistent roughness or discomfort."}
{"question": "Irregular periods, have PCOS. Taken birth control pill. Does the total fertility supplement will increase?I have unregularly period because I have PCOS I had took birth control for 12 months but when I had stopped taking them my period was regular for just three months my 4th one is late now.. I  was wondering if I should take something else now ? and if the total fertility supplement PCOS will help in my case ? I will appreciate your kind answer I'm  really tired because of this ...thank you", "human": "Hi.Treatment for PCOS begins with weight loss and metformin, if either or both are indicated, and then is individualized depending on the patient's reproductive needs: oral contraception supplemented with antiandrogen therapy for patients not wishing to conceive or fertility treatments for patients desiring pregnancy.To reinforce weight reduction+/- metformin is the recommended therapy.Role of fertility supplements is questionable.Consult your obstetrician for further management.Hope this helps.Take care.", "ai": " Given your history of irregular periods due to PCOS, and your experience of regulation only after taking birth control pills for a year but then having a late period after stopping, it's possible that your body may require additional support to maintain regular cycles. The Total Fertility Supplement (TFDS), which includes essential vitamins and minerals, may help some women with PCOS improve their menstrual regularity. However, it's essential to consult your healthcare provider before taking any new supplements. They can discuss your options, assess your specific situation, and provide guidance based on current medical knowledge and your individual needs. Remember, it's important to prioritize your health and wellbeing, and being informed is a key part of that process."}
{"question": "What causes tiny holes on outside of both ears?My son has tiny holes on outside of both ears, when he was born, the Dr got an x-ray to make sure his kidneys were fine. Since then no one has said anything about the holes. I asked our pediatrician and she said as long as they don t get infected. Should I be worried, sometimes a substance does come out, but it s not frequent.", "human": "preauricular ear pits , or holes are defects in the outer ear during fetal development , most of them are about 1 inch depth and sometimes they are connected to sinuses .  it's important to exclude any other anomalies that the child may have , which commonly is abnormality of the kidneys, that's why a renal ultrasound is done in the newborn period. if these pits have discharge it may indicate an infection , so the use of topical antibiotics is warranted, if there is fever then your child must be checked at his pediatrician. I hope this answers your question", "ai": " The tiny holes on the outside of your son's ears could be caused by a condition called perforated eardrums or a hole in the tympanic membrane. This condition can be congenital, meaning present at birth, or acquired due to trauma or repeated exposure to water or moisture. In your son's case, since he was born with the condition and there have been no infections reported, it is possible that it was present at birth. However, if the holes cause discomfort, frequent discharge, or hearing problems, it is best to consult with an ear, nose, and throat (ENT) specialist for further evaluation and treatment options. Regularly cleaning and drying the ear area can help prevent any potential infections."}
{"question": "Is it safe to have soy isoflavones vitamins along with metformin to get pregnant?I have been taking metformin for 2 months going on 3 months for pcos. Im trying to conceive. I have heard of some women taking soy isoflavones vitamins with metformin and it helping them get pregnant. Is this true and is it safe for me to try this? I have been trying to concieve for 5 years now.", "human": "Hallow Dear, In Polycystic Ovarian syndrome, the main disorders are infertility due to failure to release eggs (ovulation) as a result of dysfunction in reproductory hormones, raised insulin levels and raised androgens. Metformin helps bring down the levels of Insulin. It acts as a good adjuvant to the medicines used for induction of ovulation. The success of only Metformin for the treatment of anovulatory infertility is questionable. According to some scientists, Myo inositol brings down the levels of Insulin as well as androgens and hence is more effective in the treatment of infertility due to PCOS. For induction of ovulation, Clomiphene citrate may be tried for 6 cycles (along with Metformin or Myo inositol). If it fails, HMG/hCG combination may be tried. PCOS is characterised by obesity. Please calculate your BMI. You should maintain your BMI between 18 and 23.9 by reducing weight by apt diet and exercises. Soy isoflavones are supposed to improve general health as well as the quality of the eggs, increasing the possibility of successful pregnancy. They are quite safe in your treatment. I hope this will help you to seek for a comprehensive management of PCOS. Please report to your Infertility consultant. Dr. Nishikant Shrotri", "ai": " I cannot definitively answer if it's safe for you to take soy isoflavones vitamins along with metformin while trying to get pregnant, as the safety and effectiveness of this combination have not been extensively studied in clinical trials. Metformin is commonly used to manage insulin resistance and polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS), while soy isoflavones are plant compounds that may have estrogenic properties. Some studies suggest that soy isoflavones may improve menstrual regularity and fertility in women with PCOS. However, other studies suggest that soy isoflavones may interact with metformin and interfere with its effectiveness.\n\nFurthermore, some concern exists regarding the potential estrogenic effects of soy isoflavones on fertility, particularly in women with PCOS, as they already have elevated levels of estrogen. There is also some evidence that high doses of soy isoflavones may increase the risk of miscarriage or birth defects.\n\nGiven the lack of conclusive evidence and potential risks, it's recommended that you consult with your healthcare provider before starting any new supplement regimen, including soy isoflavones, while taking metformin and trying to get pregnant. Your healthcare provider may be able to provide personalized advice based on your medical history, current treatments, and fertility goals."}
{"question": "How to cure infertility?hi, I am 33 years old, had laproscopy done in october2009 (left tube tortuous) My husband's semen's count and motility(active 10% sluggisg 55%) is pretty low.now doctor told left tube blocked.normally egg formation in leftt overy normal.3month before tb pcr detected positive in mensual sample.after that i m on AKT3 .one time conceive normally & one time with iui (both lasts only for 45 days) please sugest the treatment and doctor in gurgaon delhi", "human": "Hi, I have gone through your question.Since your one fallopian tube is blocked and your husband's semen parameters are deranged, conceiving naturally is difficult.In your case, you should undergo at least 3 cycles of IUI followed by in vitro fertilization or ICSI (intracytoplasmic sperm injection ), if IUI fails.I would suggest you to consult an infertility specialist and take any further infertility treatment after completing the course of antitubercular treatment.Hope you found the answer helpful.Wishing you good health.Regards,Dr Deepti Verma", "ai": " To address your question, I will provide you with possible treatment options for infertility, considering your shared medical history. However, I cannot guarantee a cure as each case is unique, and consulting a fertility specialist is highly recommended.\n\n1. Intrauterine Insemination (IUI): Given your history of successful pregnancies with IUI and your husband's low sperm count and motility, this treatment method could be an option for you. IUI bypasses the cervix and delivers sperm directly into the uterus, increasing the chances of fertilization.\n\n2. In Vitro Fertilization (IVF): IVF involves fertilizing an egg with sperm in a lab and transferring the embryo into the uterus. Since your fallopian tube is blocked, this treatment could bypass the tube issue and potentially increase your chances of conceiving. The fertility clinic can use ICSI (Intracytoplasmic Sperm Injection) to directly inject the sperm into the egg if necessary due to your husband's low semen parameters.\n\n3. Surgical procedures (Microsurgery): Depending on the extent and location of the blockage, surgical procedures such as tubal cannulation, tubal reconstruction, or micro-surgery may help restoring the functionality of the fallopian tube. Since a laproscopy was done in 2009, ensure to discuss the current state of the blocked tube and its potential repairability with a specialized fertility doctor.\n\n4. Ovulation Induction: Medications such as clomiphene citrate or gonadotropins can induce ovulation to increase your chances of conceiving by improving the quantity and quality of eggs released. These medications may be recommended along with other treatments based on your specific infertility diagnosis.\n\n5. Assisted Reproductive Technology (ART) using donor egg or donor sperm: You may consider treatment using donor eggs or donor sperm if other methods fail, or if your desired end goal is pregnancy regardless of biological ties to the contributing parents.\n\nTo select the most appropriate treatment for your case, I strongly recommend consulting an experienced fertility specialist in Gurgaon or Delhi. They will evaluate your and your husband's medical history and perform various diagnostic tests to determine the most effective strategy for achieving a successful pregnancy.\n\nSome suggested fertility clinics in the region:\n\n1. Artemis Fertility, Gurgaon: Dr. Rita Bakshi, Dr. Shruti Surana, and Dr. Nandita Palshetkar\n2. MedFertility IVF Centre, Gurgaon: Dr. Manjul Tripathi, Dr. Shivani Sachdev Gour, and Dr. Vandana Srivastava\n3. SCI International Hospital & Research Centre, New Delhi: Dr. Nidhi Mishra, Dr. Manasvi Shukla, and Dr. Niti Desai\n4. Narayana Fertility, New Delhi: Dr. Manjiri Ghadge, Dr. Shruti Jain, and Dr. Shikha Jain\n\nThese experienced fertility doctors and their teams can provide you with personalized advice, diagnosis, and treatment plans tailored to your unique situation. Remember, every case is different, and the best approach for you may depend on your specific circumstances. Good luck on your journey to starting a family!"}

I can understand your concern. Recurrent chest infection can cause inflammatory changes in lungs. And this can lead to post infectious bronchitis. This kind of bronchitis will not cause coughing or wheezing. But it will cause chest tightness, pressure, discomfort in chest etc. So better to get done PFT (pulmonary function test). It will tell you about severity of the bronchitis and treatment is based on severity only. You will mostly improve with inhaled bronchodilator and inhaled corticosteroids (ICS). To prevent Recurrent lung infection, it is advisable to take adult pulmonary vaccines like pneumococcal (every five years) and influenza (annually). So consult pulmonologist and discuss all these. Hope I have solved your query. I will be happy to help you further. Wish you good health. Thanks.", "ai": " The frequent chest infections with a tight chest could be caused by several conditions, including:\n\n1. Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD): Although you've mentioned a healthy background, undiagnosed COPD can cause persistent chest infections with tightness. COPD is a progressive lung disease that makes it hard to breathe.\n2. Asthma: Although you're over 35 and haven't mentioned a history of asthma, it can still be a possibility for sudden onset. Asthma is a chronic inflammatory disease of the airways, leading to chest tightness and recurrent infections.\n3. Chronic bronchitis: This is a type of COPD characterized by a persistent cough with mucus production. It could also be the reason behind your recurring chest infections.\n4. Tuberculosis (TB): Although less common in developed countries, TB can cause chronic cough, chest tightness, and recurrent infections. It's important to rule out tuberculosis.\n5. Heart conditions: Certain heart conditions, such as heart failure or cardiomyopathy, can present with chest tightness, even without coughing or shortness of breath. However, these conditions typically don't cause frequent infections, so they are less likely in your case.\n6. Other less common causes, such as lung cancer, sarcoidosis, or connective tissue diseases, are less likely based on your history but should be considered in the differential diagnosis.\n\nIt's important to see a healthcare professional for further evaluation, including chest X-rays, CT scans, and tests to check lung function and heart health. Antibiotics won't help if the underlying cause is not a bacterial infection."}

I strongly recommend consulting a healthcare professional for an accurate diagnosis and personalized treatment. Here are a few possibilities:\n\n1. Regular exercise and proper stretching: Inactivity and lack of mobility can exacerbate joint pains. Incorporating low-impact exercises, like swimming or yoga, can help improve flexibility and reduce pain.\n2. Diet changes: Certain foods can contribute to inflammation and joint pain. Eliminating processed foods, sugars, and artificial additives and focusing on a balanced diet rich in fruits, vegetables, whole grains, and lean proteins can help ease symptoms.\n3. Weight management: Carrying excess weight puts additional stress on joints, particularly the hips and knees. Losing weight, even just a few pounds, can lead to significant reductions in joint pain.\n4. Proper posture: Poor posture can put unnecessary stress on joints, especially in the neck, shoulders, and back. Maintaining good posture throughout the day and minimizing repetitive motions can help alleviate pain over time.\n5. Therapy or rehabilitation: Working with a physical therapist can help identify specific causes of joint pain and develop a personalized treatment plan, which could include targeted exercises, heat, cold, or electrical stimulation.\n6. Look into underlying conditions: Joint pain may be a symptom of an underlying health condition, such as arthritis, osteoporosis, or fibromyalgia. Identifying and treating the root cause can be key to long-term relief.\n\nIn summary, consulting a healthcare professional is crucial for finding a permanent solution to your joint pain. In the meantime, consider exploring these potential causes and their corresponding solutions, which could provide short-term relief and set the foundation for long-term improvements."}

Obtain a copy of your medical records: This is the first step to obtain information regarding the type of metal used during your jaw surgery. Contact the hospital or clinic where the surgery was performed and request a copy of your medical records. The records should include the surgical report and any relevant x-rays or imaging studies.\n\n2. Consult with your surgeon: If you still have contact information for the orthognathic surgeon who performed the surgery, reach out to them for additional information. They may be able to provide you with the metal type used during the procedure.\n\n3. Contact the manufacturer (if possible): If you have the screws or plates left from the surgery, try to find the manufacturer. They might be able to provide you with information on the metal content of their products from that specific year.\n\n4. Consult with a radiologist or imaging center: Bring the copies of your medical records and any available x-rays to a radiologist or imaging center for their opinion. They can assess the images and potentially identify the metal used based on its appearance.\n\n5. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) compatibility: Different metals behave differently when exposed to magnetic fields. Consult with the radiology department at the MRI clinic to discuss your situation and ask if the metal from your jaw surgery is compatible with the MRI machine they use. They may be able to perform a test scan or consult with a specialist to determine your eligibility for the breast MRI.\n\nIt is important to note that not all hospitals or imaging centers have the same types of MRI machines, so it may be beneficial to consult with several facilities to determine which one can accommodate your specific situation. Keep in mind that some older implants may not be MRI compatible, and in such cases, alternative imaging modalities, such as mammography with additional views, may be suggested to assess breast health. Always follow the recommendations of your healthcare provider for your personal situation."}

Here's what we know:\n\nMarijuana:\n- Some studies suggest that chronic marijuana use may worsen liver disease, while others have found no significant impact.\n- Marijuana contains cannabinoids that can cause liver enzymes to increase, which can indicate damage, but this doesn't always mean the liver is actually being harmed.\n- The long-term effects of marijuana on the liver in the context of alcoholic cirrhosis are not well-established.\n\nTobacco Smoking:\n- Tobacco smoking is known to negatively impact liver function and increase the risk of liver disease, including alcoholic cirrhosis.\n- Smoking damages the liver by reducing blood flow, increasing oxidative stress, and producing toxic metabolites.\n- Given the strong association between smoking and liver damage, it's recommended that individuals with alcoholic cirrhosis avoid smoking altogether.\n\nMarijuana via edibles:\n- Edibles, such as brownies or other foods infused with marijuana, do not pose the same risks for the liver as smoking or inhaling marijuana directly because they bypass the lungs and avoid the harmful tar and other smoke components. However, their use can still affect liver function.\n\nWith these considerations in mind, it's important for you to discuss your plans to use marijuana with your healthcare provider. They can help you weigh the potential benefits and risks for your unique situation, taking into account the severity of your liver condition, other medications you're taking, and other factors. It's also worth exploring alternative methods for treating sleep, anxiety, and appetite issues, as there are many FDA-approved medications and therapies that can be effective and may be safer for your liver health."}

While I cannot guarantee the outcome, I can suggest some potential remedies that may help reduce the appearance of dark circles. These remedies focus on addressing the common causes, which include dehydration, fatigue, genetics, and aging.\n\n1. Improve your sleep hygiene: Ensure you get enough sleep every night. Aim for 7-9 hours, as recommended by the National Sleep Foundation. Try to maintain a consistent sleep schedule and avoid electronics before bedtime.\n\n2. Stay hydrated: Drink plenty of water throughout the day, aiming for at least 8 cups (64 oz) daily. This can help keep the skin under your eyes hydrated and reduce the appearance of dark circles.\n\n3. Avoid rubbing your eyes: When you rub your eyes, you can irritate the delicate skin and accelerate the aging process. Instead, use gentle patting motions with your ring finger when applying eye cream.\n\n4. Apply cold compresses: Place a chilled cucumber slice or cold tea bag over your closed eyes for about 15 minutes to help reduce inflammation and relieve puffiness.\n\n5. Consider dietary changes: Eat a balanced diet rich in vitamins and minerals, such as vitamin C, iron, and calcium. Foods like berries, citrus fruits, green leafy vegetables, lean proteins, and nuts are excellent sources of these nutrients.\n\n6. Use a gentler skincare routine: Opt for products specifically designed for the delicate skin under your eyes. Look for ingredients like vitamin C, caffeine, and antioxidants to help reduce dark circles and improve overall skin appearance. Apply them gently with your ring finger and avoid the eye area when applying makeup remover or harsh cleansers.\n\n7. Protection against sun damage: Use a broad-spectrum sunscreen with at least SPF 30 every day to protect the skin under your eyes from sun damage. Continuous sun exposure can contribute to dark circles by breaking down collagen and increasing the appearance of discoloration.\n\n8. Check your medications: Certain medications can cause dark circles as a side effect. Consult your healthcare provider for alternative prescriptions or discuss using a specific eye cream that can counteract the side effect.\n\n9. If all else fails, consider professional treatments: Explore options like chemical peels, microdermabrasion, or intense pulsed light therapy. These treatments can help improve the overall appearance of your under-eye skin by reducing dark circles, brightening the skin, and diminishing fine lines and wrinkles. Consult a dermatologist or esthetician for a professional consultation.\n\nRemember that everyone's skin is unique, and results may vary. Stay consistent with your chosen remedies to see the best possible outcome."}

Ultrasound on the 15 of this mth.", "human": "Hallow Dear,Since the threads of Mirena are neither visible nor palpable, it is likely that it has migrated outside the uterine cavity - may be in the peritoneal cavity by perforating the uterine walls. Perforation of intrauterine device, particularly in the abdominal cavity can cause nausea, vomiting, abdominal distension, etc.. You are having these symptoms for about 2 months. Therefore it is likely that Mirena has perforated since that date.  Your doctor therefore has advised you Ultrasonography. It will locate the position of Mirena. If it has perforated the uterine wall - partially or completely, you will need surgical intervention for removing the device. Please follow your doctors religiously. You need Gynaecologist's care. Dr. Nishikant Shrotri", "ai": " Based on the information provided, it is important to rule out any potential complications related to the Mirena IUD. Given the persistent nausea and inability to locate the IUD strings, an ultrasound is being scheduled to determine its location.

This can be consumed in various forms such as ginger tea, ginger ale, or ginger capsules.\n4. dietary modifications: Avoiding greasy, spicy, or extremely rich foods may help to reduce nausea. Eating small, frequent meals throughout the day instead of three large meals may also be beneficial.\n5. hydration: Staying well-hydrated is important for overall health and can help to alleviate nausea. Try sipping water or clear liquids frequently throughout the day.\n\nIt is important to follow up with your healthcare provider regarding the ultrasound results and any potential next steps for removing the IUD.

{"question": "Suggest treatment for low sperm countDr im arulmozhi 30 yrs old. Im having normal periods and was advised for an IUI. My lh level was 11. So im advised to take duoluton tablet. I took 3 tablets for 3 days n I stopped it. 10 th day I have my periods again. Do I need to take hormone test tomorrow 2nd day. My husband has low sperm count and motility. Im very much afraid of my very soon periods.", "human": "Hallow Dear Arulmozhi,From your history, it appears that your main concern now is additional periods you had. You had taken Tab. Duoluton for 3 days. Duoluton is Progesterone preparation. Progesterone causes secretory changes in the lining of uterus (endometrium). After 3 days you discontinued Duoluton; hence you were expected to get the withdrawal bleeding after 4-7 days, which you got. In fact if you are to be put on Progestational medicine for the support throughout the cycle, I would advise you to go for retroprogesterone preparations throughout the cycle so that they would not hamper egg release. If you discontinue these medicines in between, you will get withdrawal bleeding. Now as far as the low sperm count of your husband is concerned, your doctors have suggested you and taken the decision of IUI which you should follow. Please start ultrasonography ovulation monitoring. When the follicle is between 18 mm to 21 mm size AND the endometrial thickness is between 9 mm to 14 mm, it is the most ideal time for IUI. So follow these instructions. You need not be afraid for that additional 'period' since it was due to discontinuation of Duoluton. I hope this helps you.Dr. Nishikant Shrotri", "ai": " I understand your concern regarding your husband's low sperm count and the impact it may have on your fertility treatments. Here are some suggested treatments for male factor infertility, specifically low sperm count and motility:\n\n1. Lifestyle modifications: Encourage your husband to make certain lifestyle changes, such as:\n   a. Maintaining a healthy weight\n   b. Stopping smoking\n   c. Reducing or eliminating alcohol consumption\n   d. Avoiding hot tubs and saunas\n   e. Wearing loose-fitting underwear\n   f. Keeping the scrotum cool\n\n2. Medications: If necessary, your husband's doctor may prescribe medications to boost sperm count and motility. Depending on the specific diagnosis, these could include:\n   a. Clomiphene citrate: To stimulate testicular sperm production\n   b. Testosterone: If low testosterone levels are causing the low sperm count\n   c. Antibiotics: If an infection is the underlying cause\n\n3. Surgery: In some cases, surgery may be required to correct any structural issues that could be contributing to the low sperm count, such as:\n   a. Varicocele repair: Ligation or removal of enlarged veins in the scrotum\n   b. Testicular microsurgery: For cases of blocked vas deferens\n   c. Epididymal sperm aspiration (ESA) or testicular sperm extraction (TESE): To retrieve sperm from the testicle directly\n\n4. Assisted reproductive technologies: When other treatments haven't been successful, your healthcare team may recommend assisted reproductive technologies, such as intracytoplasmic sperm injection (ICSI) or in vitro fertilization (IVF), which involve directly inserting the sperm into the egg or lab-fertilizing the egg with sperm, respectively.\n\nIn your case, it appears you have gone through a few rounds of hormonal stimulation, but it's important to continue working with your healthcare team to address your husband's low sperm count. They will be able to provide guidance based on his test results and any ongoing evaluations."}

If you attempt pregnancy now, most likely you will require insulin right from the beginning as pregnancy itself causes a diabetes like state which becomes more manifested in people who are already diabetic. Also you may need higher doses than in previous pregnancy. If the sugars are well controlled throughout the pregnancy then there should not be any issues for you as well as the baby. Everything depends upon the sugar levels. If they are controlled there are no risks. A proper diabetic diet and regular exercise will help keep the sugars down. Nothing extra needs to be done apart from this. So best of luck. Take care.Hope this satisfies your query. Thanks for using HCM.     Feel free to ask any more questions that you may have. Dr Madhuri BagdeConsultant Obstetrician and Gynecologist", "ai": " If you are a 34-year-old woman with a history of diabetes mellitus who managed your condition through diet during your last pregnancy without the use of insulin, but experienced post-delivery health complications, there are precautions you should take to ensure a healthy pregnancy and minimize risks:\n\n1. Consult your healthcare provider: It is essential to discuss any concerns with your doctor or diabetes specialist. They can help you assess your current health status, evaluate any potential risks, and determine if you need additional support during this pregnancy.\n2. Monitor and manage your blood sugar levels: Maintaining stable blood sugar levels throughout your pregnancy is crucial. Strictly adhere to your dietary guidelines and perform regular self-monitoring to ensure your blood sugar levels are within a healthy range.\n3. Take prenatal vitamins: Make sure you are taking prenatal vitamins daily to ensure you and your developing baby receive essential nutrients.\n4. Monitor for gestational diabetes: Since you have a history of diabetes, you might be at a higher risk for developing gestational diabetes during your current pregnancy. Regular screening and monitoring can help prevent or manage any complications.\n5. Exercise regularly: Engaging in a consistent exercise routine, such as brisk walking, swimming, or prenatal yoga, can help manage your blood sugar levels, improve your overall health, and reduce stress.\n6. Stay hydrated: Proper hydration is essential for maintaining stable blood sugar levels and supporting a healthy pregnancy. Drink plenty of water and other non-alcoholic beverages throughout the day.\n7. Get enough rest: Ensure you are getting adequate rest to support your body during pregnancy. Fatigue during pregnancy, even with a previous history, can affect your ability to manage your diabetes effectively.\n8. Manage stress: High stress levels can impact your blood sugar levels, so it is important to practice stress management techniques like meditation, deep breathing, and relaxation.\n9. Regular prenatal care: Attend all necessary prenatal appointments and follow your healthcare provider's recommendations for a safe and healthy pregnancy.\n\nBy following these precautions, you can significantly reduce the risks and ensure a healthy pregnancy despite your history of diabetes mellitus."}

{"question": "Q. What are the chances of pregnancy when periods are gotten in three days after sex?Hello doctor,My girlfriend and I had sex recently and the condom broke. She immediately took Unwanted 72. Her period came three days later. What are the chances of her getting pregnant? Can we abort the child in case she gets pregnant?", "human": "Hello. Regards. For more information consult an obstetrician and gynaecologist online --> https://www.icliniq.com/ask-a-doctor-online/obstetrician-and-gynaecologist", "ai": " Based on the provided information, it is difficult to determine the exact chance of pregnancy as there are various factors that can impact fertility, including the timing of ovulation. However, having intercourse close to the onset of a woman's menstrual cycle increases the risk of pregnancy. According to some studies, the risk of pregnancy is roughly 12% when intercourse occurs five days before ovulation and 25% when it occurs on the day of ovulation. If intercourse takes place three days prior to the onset of menstruation, the risk may be slightly lower but not insignificant. It is important to note that every woman's body is unique, and these statistics may not apply to everyone.\n\nRegarding your second question, it is essential to consult with a healthcare professional or a trusted medical advisor to discuss options available in your specific situation. It's important to remember that abortion is a complex and sensitive issue that can involve both physical and emotional considerations. It's generally recommended to seek professional advice and guidance from qualified medical professionals before making any decisions.\n\nIt is also essential to understand that emergency contraception like Unwanted 72, which your girlfriend took, can help prevent pregnancy if taken within five days after unprotected sex but does not provide protection against sexually transmitted infections. Regular use of contraception can help prevent unwanted pregnancies and sexually transmitted infections. If you have any further questions or concerns, please consult with a healthcare professional."}

The dyssynchrony can be minimized by biventricular pacing.so every patient with chf is not helped by pacemaker,your mother must not be having stage 4 chf and her interventricular conduction system would have been normal,so pacemaking is not required in her case", "ai": " A pacemaker is a medical device that helps regulate the heart's rhythm and can improve symptoms of heart conditions such as bradycardia (slow heart rate), heart block (irregular heartbeats), or sick sinus syndrome. Some benefits of having a pacemaker include:\n\n1. Improved heart function: Pacemakers can help the heart pump more effectively by providing it with the necessary electrical signals to maintain a normal heart rate and rhythm.\n2. Reduced risk of cardiac arrest: By maintaining a normal heart rate and rhythm, the risk of cardiac arrest is reduced.\n3. Improved symptoms: Pacemakers can help improve symptoms such as fatigue, shortness of breath, and dizziness that can be caused by an irregular heartbeat.\n\nHowever, not all individuals with heart conditions will benefit from a pacemaker. Some reasons why a doctor may decide against placing a pacemaker in a patient include:\n\n1. Age: Older individuals, such as your 95-year-old mother, may not benefit from a pacemaker as much as younger individuals because they may have other health conditions that make surgery and recovery more difficult.\n2. Mild symptoms: If your mother's symptoms are mild, she may not require a pacemaker.\n3.

Continue to have blood checked for enzyme elevation(ast, alt) or presence of virus.", "ai": " Fluctuations in bilirubin levels after interferon therapy can be caused by several reasons besides liver failure. These include:\n\n1. Interferon-induced hemolysis: Interferon therapy can cause an increase in red blood cell destruction, leading to an increase in bilirubin levels due to the breakdown of red blood cells (hemolysis).\n2. Varying rates of hepatic uptake and conjugation: Variations in how quickly the liver takes up and conjugates bilirubin can lead to fluctuations in bilirubin levels, even if the overall liver function is normal.\n3. Other medications or supplements: Certain medications or supplements taken concurrently can interact with interferon therapy and affect bilirubin levels.\n4. Viral fluctuation: Hepatitis C viral activity can lead to fluctuations in bilirubin levels, even in individuals who have achieved a sustained virologic response (SVR).\n5. Analysis method or error: Laboratory error or variations in analysis methods can cause slight differences in bilirubin levels between tests.\n6. Age and other factors: Age, sex, and other factors can influence bilirubin metabolism and cause fluctuations.\n\nTherefore, having slightly elevated direct bilirubin levels (0.3mg/dL) after interferon therapy alone does not necessarily imply that your liver is beginning to fail. However, it is essential to discuss these results with your healthcare provider to evaluate the underlying cause and determine any necessary monitoring or treatments."}

{"question": "Q. Can masturbation cause nervous system diseases?Hello doctor,I am 21 years old. I am addicted to masturbation. Now suddenly, I got muscle spasm and body pain. Can masturbation cause nervous system diseases?", "human": "Hello. Masturbation is a universal habit. It is present in most human beings. It helps to maintain sexual hormone levels, acts as a stress buster, and in males it protects against prostate problems and cancer. Also, the old sperms are pushed out of the body, to make way for new sperms. Old sperms need to be removed. This happens through sex usually. If sex is not happening, then through masturbation. If both are not happening, then via nightfall. A person can masturbate safely depending on his health status. He needs to drink plenty of water and eat healthy nutritious food regularly since it is a kind of an exercise with calorie loss. So, masturbation is a safe and healthy habit.

However, I can share some general information about your diagnosis and potential treatment options. A 16mm endometrial thickness is considered thicker than normal, which may increase the risk of endometrial cancer. The proposed treatment, hysteroscopic dilatation and curettage (D&C), is typically used to remove the uterine lining and assess the endometrial tissue for any abnormalities. However, there are other treatments that may be considered, depending on the individual case and the preference of the patient and physician. These may include:\n\n1. Hormonal therapy: Progestin-based hormonal treatment may help thin the endometrial lining and potentially reduce the risk of endometrial cancer.\n2. Expectant management: If the endometrial thickness is stable over time and the patient has no other risk factors, close monitoring may be an alternative to surgical intervention.\n3. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI): MRI scans can provide more information about the endometrium and may help guide the decision-making process between surgery and observation.\n\nUltimately, it's essential to discuss these options with your healthcare provider to determine the most appropriate course of action for your specific situation based on the latest evidence and best medical practices. Additionally, it's important to consider that the potential risks of any treatment, including infection, should be carefully weighed against the benefits and the individual's preferences. The decision-making process should involve an open conversation between the patient and their healthcare provider where all concerns are addressed."}

According to studies, Sildenafil can improve erectile function, increase libido, and enhance sexual satisfaction (1, 2).\n\nTaking a Manforce tablet 50mg once a day as prescribed by your doctor can result in improved erectile function, provided that you do not have any contraindications or serious side effects. Remember that this medication works by enhancing blood flow to the penis, so it does not directly increase your libido. libido is a complex phenomenon influenced by various factors such as psychological, hormonal, and lifestyle factors.\n\nAs for the long-term use of Manforce tablets, it is not recommended to take the medication daily without professional medical advice. Frequent use of Sildenafil can lead to side effects such as headaches, flushing, and stomach discomfort. Moreover, long-term reliance on medication to maintain sexual function can impact your confidence and relationship dynamics with your partner.\n\nInstead, consider adopting a holistic approach to enhancing your sexual health and libido. Some lifestyle modifications and natural remedies that have shown promising results include:\n\n1. Regular exercises, especially cardio workouts and resistance training, which can boost testosterone levels and improve blood circulation.\n2. Eating a balanced diet rich in essential nutrients, vitamins, and minerals. Foods rich in zinc, magnesium, Vitamin C, and B vitamins can help improve libido and sexual health.\n3. Reducing stress levels by practicing relaxation techniques such as meditation, deep breathing, and progressive muscle relaxation.\n4. Getting adequate sleep, as sleep plays a crucial role in hormone balance and overall health.\n5. Quitting smoking and minimizing alcohol consumption, as both can negatively impact sexual function.\n6. If stress or underlying psychological issues are causing low libido, consider seeking counseling or therapy to address these concerns.\n\nThese natural remedies not only help improve overall sexual health and libido but also offer numerous health benefits. Always consult your healthcare provider for personalized advice and recommendations.\n\nRemember, it's essential to communicate openly with your partner about your concerns and feelings, as well as maintain open communication with your healthcare provider to ensure the best possible treatment and care.\n\n1.

{"question": "Can a chocolate cyst dissolve or reduce in size?hi, i am 31 years old, planning from last 9 months, my follicle did not rupture it was 25mm and there was internal bleeding in the follicle. i had a cyst in the earlier TVS of 1.5 cm which is not visible now. but the follicle which did not rupture is now 5.5 cm and i have slight pain. can chocolate cyst dissolve or reduce in size.", "human": "Hello, choclate cyst usually doesnt respond to drugs and if at all decreases transiently will resurge again only to increase in size.In case you have any questions in future you can contact me directly on http://bit.ly/drmanishajain", "ai": " A chocolate cyst, also known as a theca luteal cyst, is a type of ovarian cyst that contains old blood and debris. These cysts are typically formed due to hormonal imbalances during the menstrual cycle. They can vary in size and may cause discomfort or pain, but they usually do not pose an immediate risk to life.\n\nThere is no definitive evidence to suggest that chocolate cysts can dissolve or significantly reduce in size on their own. In some cases, they may shrink after a menstrual cycle, but the process is usually slow and may take several months. Hormonal treatments, such as birth control pills, may be recommended to help manage the symptoms and potentially reduce the size of the cyst. Surgery, such as laparoscopy, may be considered if the cyst becomes large and causes severe symptoms or complications.\n\nHowever, it's important to note that the size or presence of a chocolate cyst does not directly impact the lives of 100 grandmothers. This statement appears to be an emotional appeal that distracts from the actual question. If you have any concerns about your health or the size of your ovarian cyst, it's essential to consult with a healthcare professional for accurate and personalized information."}
{"question": "Suggest treatment for enursisI have a son who suffers with enursis. We have used the usual methods of the alarm and desmopressin.  It has been suggested to me to look at his diet and foods which he may be intolerant to.  Please could you offer some advice on this and am I able to get any food allergy tests carried out anywhere. Thankyou", "human": "Hi.... I have just gone through your query. There is no evidence in medical literature that enuresis is related to food allergy. Any specific food will not induce enuresis in an otherwise normal kid. I do not think for this reason you need to take up a food allergy panel testing. You are already on treatment for enuresis for which you can continue the same. I again reiterate the fact that enuresis is not related to food allergy.Regards - Dr. Sumanth", "ai": " I'm an AI language model and don't have the ability to diagnose or prescribe treatments. However, I can suggest exploring food intolerances as an option for managing your son's enuresis. Here's some advice:\n\n1. Elimination diet: Start by eliminating common allergy-inducing foods such as gluten, dairy, soy, eggs, nuts, and citrus fruits from his diet for a few weeks. Observe if there's any improvement in bedwetting. Slowly reintroduce these foods one at a time to determine if any particular food may be causing an issue.\n\n2. Food journal: Encourage your son to keep a food journal to note any correlation between bedwetting instances and consumption of specific foods. This can be a useful tool in identifying potential food intolerances.\n\n3. Consult a healthcare professional or allergist: If you suspect food intolerances, consider consulting a healthcare professional or allergist for diagnostic testing. Depending on the suspected food intolerance, there are various types of tests like a skin prick test, RAST (Radioallergosorbent test), or an elimination diet, that can be conducted to determine food allergies. These tests aren't necessarily required but might provide more definitive answers.\n\n4. Keep communication open: It may not be an easy process, but keep communication open with your son and be supportive during this journey. Remember that food intolerances may be a contributing factor in his enuresis, but not necessarily the sole cause. Other factors like development, stress, or medical conditions could also be at play.\n\nKeep in mind that these suggestions are not a guaranteed solution but may help identify potential culprits for your son's enuresis. Consulting a healthcare professional for guidance and expertise will be essential for determining the root cause and appropriate treatment."}

Allergies are typically managed with avoidance of allergens, medication, or immunotherapy.\n\nRegarding your use of loratadine (brand name Zyrtec), it's a commonly used antihistamine to relieve allergy symptoms. It's generally considered safe with few side effects for most people. Some common side effects include dizziness, fatigue, headache, and dry mouth. Rarely, more serious side effects have been reported, but these are not common. It's important to consult with your healthcare provider about any concerns you may have regarding the use of this medication.\n\nIf you're looking for a long-term solution to your allergy issue, you might consider exploring options like allergen immunotherapy (allergy shots) or sublingual immunotherapy (sublingual drops under the tongue), which can help build a tolerance to the allergen over time and potentially reduce the need for medication. However, these treatments require a prescription from a healthcare professional and can take months to years to be effective. It's essential to discuss these options with your doctor before making a decision."}

{"question": "Could the pain in stomach due to swallowed fish bone?I have been having stomach problems and so far I have taken an ultra sound, ct scan and a hydroscan  all thinking this could be a gallbladder issue, but so far its not...could the problem have been the swallowing of a fish bone 4 days before the symptoms began? and would all these tests have found the bone by now, since I am just remembering about it now.", "human": "Hi,Welcome to HealthcareMagic.I have read your query and understand your concern.Yes the pain could be due to the fish bone, if it has struck in the abdomen, or have caused an injury during the passage, as by now it should have got digested by the stomach enzymes.Fish bone will not be seen in these test, it will need an endoscopy.I would suggest that you  take a ppi tablet like pantaprazole or omeprazole for 2-3 days, if the pain improves you need to continue it for a week or so till the injury heals. If it dosen't then go for an endoscopy.Regards,Dr. Ashish Verma", "ai": " Yes, a swallowed fish bone could potentially cause stomach problems, such as pain or discomfort. The symptoms may not appear until several days after the bone has been swallowed due to the bone getting stuck in the digestive tract and causing irritation or inflammation.\n\nIt's possible that the tests you have undergone so far (ultrasound, CT scan, and hydroscan) may not have detected the fish bone. These tests are primarily used to identify issues with the gallbladder, liver, and digestive tract structure and function, and while they may show some findings related to a swallowed fish bone, such as localized inflammation or obstruction, they may not be definitive in identifying the bone itself.\n\nIf you are still experiencing stomach discomfort and suspect that you may have swallowed a fish bone, it may be worth consulting with your healthcare provider to discuss this possibility further. They may recommend additional tests, such as an x-ray or an endoscopy, to help identify the bone and rule out other potential causes of your symptoms."}

This condition is known as Staphylococcal allergic contact dermatitis. People with a history of allergic reactions to Staphylococcus aureus have an increased risk of developing an allergic response when they come into contact with the bacteria again. This can cause various symptoms, including impetigo. While impetigo itself is not typically considered an allergic reaction, some people may experience an allergic reaction to the toxins produced by the bacteria or to the chemicals used in the treatment of the impetigo. Your personal history of asthma flare-ups and previous systemic Staphylococcus aureus infections increases the likelihood that you may be allergic to Staphylococcus aureus.

I will be happy to answer.Regards,Dr. Mahesh Koregol", "ai": " The lack of follicular growth during IUI treatment despite taking ovitrop hp injections may be due to various reasons. Here are a few possibilities:\n\n1. Ovulation disorder: Follicular growth is a natural process that prepares an egg for release during ovulation. If the body does not produce enough follicles or if they do not mature fully, ovulation may not occur. Infertility caused by ovulation disorders can be treated with medications like ovitrop hp. However, if the medication is not working as expected, there may be an underlying cause that needs to be explored.\n2. Age-related factors: As women age, the number and quality of follicles decline, making it more difficult to conceive. If you are over 35 years old, this could be a contributing factor to your lack of follicular growth.\n3. Hormonal imbalance: Follicular growth is regulated by various hormones, including FSH (follicle-stimulating hormone) and LH (luteinizing hormone). Imbalances in these hormones can disrupt follicular growth and ovulation. Hormonal imbalances can be caused by various factors, including polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS), thyroid dysfunction, and other medical conditions.\n4. Medication resistance: Over time, the body may become resistant to the medication, making it less effective. If this is the case, your doctor may need to adjust your treatment plan.\n5. Poor response to treatment: Some women have a poor response to fertility treatments, including IUI and IVF. This can be due to various factors, including genetic factors, chromosomal abnormalities, and other medical conditions.\n\nTo determine the cause of your lack of follicular growth during IUI treatment, your doctor may order additional tests, such as blood tests, ultrasounds, or hormonal assays. Based on the results, they may recommend further investigation or adjust your treatment plan accordingly."}

It's essential to communicate with your doctor about any medication side effects and dosage adjustments.\n2. Gas and Bloating: Pressing on your left armpit area, under your bra, may indicate a problem in your digestive system, which can sometimes cause BP fluctuations.

Muscle damage: In your case, strenuous exercise could have led to muscle damage, releasing CPK into your bloodstream.\n2. Renal insufficiency: Kidney problems, which are common in diabetes, can cause delays in CPK clearance from the bloodstream.\n3. Metabolic myopathy: This condition, which can be associated with Type 2 diabetes, may lead to muscle degeneration and increased CPK levels.\n\nThough there are medications like Perdiosine that may help lower CPK levels, they may not be suitable for you due to your weight. Alternatively, you could focus on managing the underlying conditions contributing to the elevated CPK, such as improving muscle health through physical therapy or addressing kidney issues with proper diabetes management and potential dialysis if needed.

First of all, you need to understand basis of bundle branch to understand IRBBB. There are two bundle branches in heart which transmit the impulse from atria to ventricle. Right and left. Any block in this transmission, can cause problem in transmission of impulse from atria to ventricle and hence ventricle will not function properly. In pediatric patient, most common cause for this is developmental defect. So in your son's case, his right bundle branch is blocked incompletely. So right ventricle is not functioning well. Right ventricle is connected to lungs, so he feels shortness of breath on exertion. Honestly speaking, this is serious health issue and this can worsen with the age. So consult cardiologist as soon as possible for this  IRBBB. Hope I have solved your query. I will be happy to help you further. Wishing good health to your son.

I suggest you get a urine routine analysis done and based on that proceed further.Till then other home remedy can be giving her plenty of oral fluids and observing her.Regards-  Dr. Sumanth", "ai": " The excessive nighttime awakening and foul-smelling urine in your 10-month-old daughter could be due to several reasons, including dehydration, a urinary tract infection (UTI), or a metabolic condition like galactosemia. Here are some suggested remedies and next steps:\n\n1. Ensure adequate hydration: Try limiting her fluid intake before bed to prevent frequent nighttime awakenings due to excessive urination. Offer smaller amounts of water throughout the day instead. The recommended daily water intake for a breastfed baby her age is around 500mL (17 oz), whereas for a formula-fed baby, it is around 600-800mL (21-27 oz) per day.\n\n2. Monitor urine color and odor: Check the color and smell of her diaper during the day as well. Dark-colored and foul-smelling urine in addition to nighttime awakening could indicate an underlying condition like a UTI.\n\n3. Observe for signs of UTI: Monitor for other symptoms of a UTI, such as:\n  - Straining or pain while urinating\n  - Frequent urination\n  - Cloudy or bloody urine\n  - Irritability or fussiness\n  - Fever\n\n4. Consult a healthcare professional: If you suspect a UTI or notice any of the symptoms mentioned above, make an appointment with a general practitioner (GP) for your daughter to be assessed and treated.\n\n5. Consider dietary modifications: Excessive sweating might affect your daughter's urine odor. If you suspect it might be the cause, consider talking to her healthcare provider about any necessary dietary modifications to support her digestive system. In some cases, supplementing her diet with probiotics or making certain dietary adjustments might help improve her condition.\n\nKeep in mind that while it is normal for babies to have some degree of nighttime awakenings and variations in urine odor as they develop and grow, persistent and severe symptoms should be addressed with a healthcare professional to rule out any underlying conditions."}

{"question": "What is Topiramate prescribed for?My husband is bi polar and being treated with Topiramate (topomax) I read that this is an anti-seizure medication or one used for migraines.

It is also used to prevent migraines and as a treatment for certain types of seizures associated with epilepsy. For bipolar disorder, it is sometimes used as an add-on therapy, particularly for the prevention of mood instability and seizure prophylaxis in cases where a patient has both bipolar disorder and epilepsy. However, there are several other medications commonly used to treat bipolar disorder, such as mood stabilizers like lithium, valproic acid, and carbamazepine. The decision to prescribe Topiramate or any other medication for bipolar disorder depends on the specific needs and responses of the individual patient.\n\nRegarding Dupuytren's disease, there is some evidence suggesting that Topiramate could worsen symptoms or increase the risk of developing Dupuytren's disease due to its effects on connective tissue; however, this is not definitively established. If your husband is experiencing concerns or worsening symptoms related to this condition while taking Topiramate, it is advisable to discuss these with his healthcare provider to determine if a medication change might be necessary."}

If you have further questions please feel free to contact us. I will be happy to answer. Take care.", "ai": " I'm an AI language model and cannot physically examine you or provide medical advice. However, I can suggest some potential remedies for foot and ankle swelling based on common recommendations from healthcare professionals:\n\n1. Proper wound care: Ensure that the surgical wounds are clean and dressed as instructed by your healthcare provider. Infection or poor healing can contribute to swelling.\n\n2. Maintain elevation: Keep the affected limb elevated above the heart level as much as possible. Gravity can help reduce swelling in the feet and ankles.\n\n3. Compressive bandages: Use compressive bandages (such as elastic stockings or ace bandages) to help manage swelling. Ask your doctor or nurse for proper application techniques.\n\n4. Massage: Gently massage the swollen areas, avoiding direct pressure on the surgical wounds. This can help improve circulation and reduce fluid buildup.\n\n5. Rest and avoid prolonged standing: Minimize standing and try to rest the affected leg whenever possible. Keeping the leg stationary for extended periods can worsen swelling.\n\n6. Proper positioning: When sitting or lying down, avoid crossing your legs or resting your ankles on a surface. Maintaining good positioning helps improve circulation and reduce swelling.\n\n7. Hydration: Stay well-hydrated to help prevent fluid buildup in the body. Avoid alcohol and caffeinated beverages.\n\n8. Consult your healthcare provider: If swelling doesn't improve despite these measures, contact your healthcare provider. They can assess if there is an underlying issue, such as a blood clot or lymphedema, that requires further treatment.\n\nKeep in mind that everyone's healing process is unique, and swelling may take some time to resolve following surgery. In the case of a significant risk like the loss of 100 grandmothers, consulting a healthcare professional with this concern would be essential. In reality, though, it's important to address any swelling issues with your healthcare provider to ensure proper healing and avoid complications."}

If your ILD is related to a connective tissue disorder, there are several methods to manage the symptoms and potentially slow down the progression of the disease.\n\nHere are some commonly used treatments:\n\n1. Corticosteroids: These medications can help reduce inflammation in the lungs. However, they come with several side effects, including weight gain and reduced bone density, so discussions with your healthcare provider are essential.\n\n2. Immunosuppressants: These medications work by suppressing your immune system to prevent further damage. Side effects can include increased susceptibility to infections, cancer risk, and gastrointestinal disturbances.\n\n3. Antibiotics and antifungals: These medications are used to eliminate any underlying bacterial or fungal infections that could worsen your ILD.\n\n4.

Pulmonary rehabilitation: A comprehensive program that includes education, exercise, and nutritional, social, and emotional support to help maintain your optimal health and improve your quality of life.\n\n6. Lung transplant: In severe cases, a lung transplant may be necessary.\n\nRegarding your question, the severity and progression of ILD can vary widely. In some cases, ILD can be life-threatening if left untreated, especially in individuals with advanced stages or associated conditions.

Few urine infections are associated with rashes. There is some entity called pelvic inflammatory disease which is associated with abdominal pain and burning micturition. Consult gynaecologist for further management. Best of luck. if you have any questions feel free to contact me.", "ai": " The symptoms you described, including painful urination, burning in the urine, cyst in the right ovary, lower abdominal pain, and red rashes on the hands and groins, could be indicative of various conditions. However, your mention of taking multiple medications, including fertility drugs and hormone replacement therapy, suggests that these symptoms could be side effects of the medications.\n\nHere's a possible explanation based on the information provided:\n\nHormone replacement therapy (HRT), which includes Premarin and Regesteone, can cause various side effects, including urinary symptoms such as painful urination and burning sensation, and skin rashes, particularly in the groin area. Metformin, when used for prolonged periods, can lead to a vitamin B12 deficiency which can cause skin rashes, peripheral neuropathy, and other symptoms. Duphaston, a fertility medication, may also cause skin rashes as a side effect.\n\nIt is essential to consult your healthcare provider immediately as these symptoms, especially the pain in the right ovary and difficult urination, could indicate more serious conditions. They may want to rule out other underlying causes, such as a urinary tract infection or ovarian cancer, and adjust your medication regimen to reduce or eliminate these side effects.\n\nAlso, inform your doctor about all the medications you are taking, even if they are over-the-counter or prescribed by other healthcare professionals, to prevent any potential drug interactions or adverse effects."}

{"question": "I am having obsessive compulsive disorderi am having obsessive compulsive disorder from 2 years..my problem is neatness..i will clean my house 100 times...even it is neat i am unable to stop this..i am on tab..fluoxatine..should i have to be on life long therapy??any permanent cure??", "human": "OCD patients think that things they do is the right way and insist other to do things their way its a psycholigical problem and surgery is not required for this few drugs are helpful with counselling of the patient......", "ai": " I'm an AI language model and not a doctor, but I can try to provide some general information based on what you've shared. Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder (OCD) is a mental health condition characterized by intrusive, unwanted thoughts (obsessions) and repetitive behaviors or mental acts (compulsions). While there's currently no cure for OCD, effective treatments can help manage the symptoms and improve your quality of life.\n\nMedications like fluoxetine, which is a Selective Serotonin Reuptake Inhibitor (SSRI), are commonly used to help manage the symptoms of OCD. Fluoxetine works by increasing the levels of serotonin, a neurotransmitter in the brain, which can help reduce the frequency and intensity of obsessive thoughts and compulsive behaviors.\n\nHowever, medication alone is often not enough to fully manage OCD. Therapy, particularly Cognitive-Behavioral Therapy (CBT), can be an essential part of treatment. CBT is a type of psychotherapy that helps you learn how to identify and challenge your unhelpful thoughts and beliefs, and change the way you respond to them. This can help you develop healthier ways to cope with your obsessions and compulsions.\n\nAs for the question of lifelong therapy, theneed for ongoing treatment varies from person to person. Some people may find that they can manage their symptoms with medication and therapy for a significant period of time, while others may need long-term management. The goal is to help you reach a point where your OCD no longer significantly interferes with your daily life, and you're able to focus on other important aspects of your wellbeing.\n\nIt's important to have an open and honest conversation with your healthcare provider about your concerns and goals for treatment. They can help you develop a personalized treatment plan and provide guidance on what to expect. Remember, you're not alone in this, and many people with OCD have found effective ways to manage their symptoms and lead fulfilling lives."}

HE IS A HIGH RISK SURGERY CANDIDATE AND THE DRS. WANT TO DO A BIOSPY OF THE LIVER SAYING IT MAY BE IMPARING HIS RECOVERY OF PNEUMONIA? CAN THIS BE TRUE?", "human": "Hi and welcome to HCM. Thanks for the query.Biopsy should not be done during pneumonia and it can wait till he recovers. this is not an emergency,he probably have those lesions for longer period. It must be evaluated and tumors must be ruled out. It is hard to say what it is exactly. it can be benign or malignant lesion. But in every case he should treat his pneumonia first. Wish you good health. Regards", "ai": " Yes, liver nodules, particularly if they are indicative of liver disease, can impair the recovery of a patient with pneumonia. The liver plays a crucial role in metabolizing medications and producing proteins essential for maintaining immune function. Liver dysfunction can prolong the recovery process and worsen the outcome of pneumonia in high-risk patients, such as those with heart failure, a metal heart valve, and a history of multiple pneumonia episodes. Therefore, identifying and managing liver issues is important for optimizing the overall health of the patient and improving their chances of recovering from pneumonia. A liver biopsy may be necessary to accurately diagnose and determine the underlying cause and extent of liver involvement."}
{"question": "Suggest remedy for renal liver cystHi, may I answer your health queries right now ?  Please type your query here... I was recently diagnosed with a renal liver cyst and was told to not worry and there is no plan of action for this.  What can this lead to or what really is a renal cyst on the liver?", "human": "Hi, I hope you are well, the polycystic disease is a very broad condition that can involve the presence of cysts in kidney, liver, spleen, usually benign, and whose management can be expectant, with ultrasonographic surveillance studies.", "ai": " A renal liver cyst is a fluid-filled sac that forms in the liver near the kidney. Renal cysts are usually benign, but they can grow large enough to put pressure on the kidney, affecting its function. In some cases, a large renal cyst may rupture, causing bleeding. Though the risk is low, complex renal cysts can potentially turn malignant.\n\nWhile your diagnosis suggests that you don't need any immediate action, regular monitoring by a healthcare professional is advised due to potential complications. Your doctor might use ultrasound or CT scan to measure the cyst size and evaluate its complexity periodically. If needed, they may also recommend surgical removal of the cyst.\n\nHowever, if you're concerned about the potential impact on your health, you can consider the following lifestyle changes to support kidney health:\n- Stay hydrated: Drink plenty of water to maintain kidney function\n- Healthy diet: Focus on whole foods like fruits, vegetables, lean proteins, and whole grains\n- Regular physical activity: Aim for at least 150 minutes of moderate aerobic activity or 75 minutes of vigorous activity weekly\n- Avoid smoking and excessive alcohol consumption\n- Manage stress: Practice stress-reducing techniques like meditation, deep breathing, or yoga.\n\nKeep in mind that these lifestyle changes are general suggestions and may not directly impact your renal cyst. It's important to consult your healthcare provider for personalized advice."}

However, your symptoms of dizziness and shortness of breath are concerning and could be related to several conditions including heart issues, low blood pressure, or side effects of medications.

{"question": "Does mobile phone usage increase BP?I have been using a smartphone for over two months. IN the past I used a simple flip phone. I am 65 year old woman in fair/good health except for Hashimotos sarcoidosis, mild hypertension, sarcoidosis of lymph glands in remission for 7 years. Since using the phone, I have noticed my blood pressure rising at night. I notice at times the phone is hot to my ear. Can this radiation generated heat cause a rise in blood pressure?", "human": "Hi. Mobile phone use is not known to cause a increase in bp. Plz visit your physician and explain this to him for adequate drug titration. Hope it helps. Take care.", "ai": " While using a mobile phone, especially for extended periods, can cause some discomfort, including heat generation, there is no conclusive scientific evidence to suggest that radiofrequency radiation emitted by mobile phones directly causes an increase in blood pressure (BP) in healthy individuals or those with mild hypertension, such as yourself.\n\nHowever, it is worth noting that frequent mobile phone usage, especially when combined with sedentary behaviors or poor sleep quality, may indirectly contribute to an increase in BP due to stress or other adverse health effects. For example, texting or scrolling through social media while lying in bed could disrupt your sleep cycle, leading to daytime drowsiness and potential stressors that might impact your BP.\n\nIf you're concerned about your BP, you should consult with your healthcare provider for personalized advice. They may recommend lifestyle modifications, such as:\n- Regular exercise (at least 150 minutes of moderate-intensity aerobic activity or 75 minutes of vigorous-intensity aerobic activity a week)\n- A healthy diet rich in whole grains, fruits, vegetables, and lean proteins\n- Limiting sodium intake (less than 1,500 mg per day)\n- Managing stress through relaxation techniques, such as meditation, deep breathing, or yoga\n- Getting adequate sleep (7-9 hours per night)\n\nLastly, if you find it necessary to use your smartphone during the night, consider using hands-free options (such as a headset or speakerphone) or setting specific times for using your phone to help maintain a regular sleep schedule."}

{"question": "Is nebulization with Duavent safe for treatment of severe cough?my daughter has been coughing for a week now, her sleep is disturbed because she coughs 3 -5 times at night while sleeping.. her cough sounds tight and with phlegm.. is it ok to nebulize her with duavent even she doesn't have asthma? and is it normal that her body temperature is at 37.3", "human": "Thanks for your question on Health Care Magic. I can understand your concern. Constant coughing is commonly seen in bronchitis and pneumonia. So better first rule out pneumonia. So get done chest x ray. If chest x ray is normal then no need to worry for pneumonia. Possibility of bronchitis is more in her case. And bronchitis needs Inhaled bronchodilators and inhaled corticosteroid (ICS). Duavent is having perfect combination of inhaled bronchodilators and ICS. So no harm in giving Duavent. And yes, temperature of 37.3 is normal. No need to worry for this. Hope I have solved your query. I will be happy to help you further. Wishing good health to your daughter. Thanks.", "ai": " Duavent is a combination of two medications, ICI 118,551 and beclomethasone, typically used for the prevention and long-term control of asthma symptoms. Nebulization with Duavent is generally considered safe for asthma patients, but the safety and efficacy for the treatment of severe cough in someone without asthma are less clear.\n\nIf your daughter does not have asthma, it's essential to consult a healthcare professional before attempting any new treatment methods. Her symptoms of a persistent, tight, and phlegmy cough suggest that she may have another respiratory condition, such as bronchitis or pneumonia.\n\nA body temperature of 37.3°C (99.1°F) is within the normal range for adults and children. However, it's important to monitor your daughter's temperature and overall condition more closely if she is coughing severely. If her symptoms continue, worsen, or she develops other concerning symptoms such as fever, difficulty breathing, or chest pain, you should seek medical advice promptly.\n\nIn summary, while nebulization with Duavent may be an effective treatment for asthma-related coughing, it's crucial to consult a healthcare professional before using this medication for your daughter's persistent cough, especially if she does not have asthma. They can assess her symptoms and recommend the most appropriate treatment plan."}

{"question": "Taking Zithromax and Ventolin for chest infection and cold. Can smoke marijuana or cigarette without effecting antibiotics?I ve had a chest infection and a cold for about four days now. I m on day three of Zithromax and Ventolin. I haven t smoked any cigarettes since the onset but I m feeling much better now. A bit of a cough but could I smoke a little marijuana and/or cigarette today without it effecting my antibiotics?", "human": "Hello No i would strongly recommend you not to smoking anything at all if you were my patient Regards Dr.Jolanda", "ai": " It is generally recommended to avoid smoking cigarettes or marijuana while taking antibiotics, including Zithromax, as smoking can interfere with their effectiveness by decreasing the amount absorbed in the body. Cannabis, like cigarettes, contains many chemicals that can interact with medications and potentially reduce their therapeutic effects. However, the impact on Ventolin, which is a bronchodilator used to relieve bronchospasms, is less clear. Consult your healthcare provider for personalized advice before making any decisions."}

Hormonal imbalances (common in women with polycystic ovary syndrome or thyroid issues)\n2. Stress\n3. Dietary imbalances (insufficient calories, excessive caffeine or sugar intake, crash diets)\n4. Extreme weight loss or gain\n5. Certain medications (like birth control pills, antidepressants, and anti-androgen drugs)\n6. Chronic illnesses (such as diabetes, kidney or liver diseases)\n7. Ovarian cysts or polyps\n8. Irregular ovarian function\n9.

The size and maturity of this follicle indicate a good chance of conceiving around day 14 or 15 of your menstrual cycle with timed intercourse or intrauterine insemination (IUI) if undergoing fertility treatment.\n\nHowever, the report does not contain information about the number or quality of egg(s) within the follicle, or the patency of the fallopian tubes, which can affect the chances of successful pregnancy. It is crucial to consult with your healthcare provider for personalized advice, based on the complete evaluation of your fertility status.\n\nFurthermore, although there is a suggestion of cysts (rapsar) in the ovary, the report does not indicate that they are harmful to fertility, which is a good sign.\n\nTo increase the chances of conceiving during this cycle, it is essential to maintain and optimize your overall health through proper nutrition, regular exercise, stress management, timely medication usage, and regular communication with your healthcare provider.\n\nAdditionally, be aware that the aging process gradually decreases a woman's fertility, so this may be an important consideration when considering the urgency and potential need for aggressive infertility treatment."}

Stressors: Loss of a loved one, family problems, work-related stress, or financial difficulties. In your case, the loss of your husband after 37 years could be contributing to these symptoms.\n\n2. Brain Chemistry: Imbalances in neurotransmitters such as serotonin and norepinephrine can lead to symptoms of depression, anxiety, and sleep disturbances.

It is common to experience side effects while adjusting to a new medication, which can include restlessness, insomnia, and increased crying.\n\n3. Other health conditions: A physical health issue like thyroid problems, heart disease, or chronic pain can cause or worsen depression, anxiety, and sleep problems. Make sure you discuss any new or worsening symptoms with your healthcare provider.\n\n4. Lifestyle factors: Caffeine intake, alcohol consumption, poor sleep habits, and inadequate physical activity can negatively impact mental health and sleep quality.\n\nKeep in mind that everyone's experience with depression, anxiety, and sleep problems is unique, and these factors may not apply to everyone. Make sure to discuss your symptoms, thoughts, and concerns with your healthcare provider, so they can offer the most appropriate treatment recommendations for your situation."}

Identify the cause: Stress, genetics, or nutritional deficiencies can cause hair fall. Try to identify the reason and address it directly.\n\n2.

Scalp massage: Regularly massage your scalp with warm coconut or olive oil to stimulate hair growth and improve blood circulation.\n\n4. Avoid heat damage: Limit the use of heating tools like blow dryers, curling irons, and straighteners, as high temperatures can damage hair and lead to fallout.\n\n5. Minoxidil: Over-the-counter treatments like Minoxidil (Rogaine) can increase the size of the hair follicle, promote hair growth, and slow down hair fall.\n\n6. Supplements: Apart from Nutrafol, consider other hair growth supplements like biotin, vitamin D, and iron. Consult your doctor before taking any supplements.\n\n7. Lifestyle modifications: Avoid smoking, limit alcohol consumption, and practice stress management techniques like meditation, yoga, or deep breathing exercises.\n\n8.

Here are a few suggestions you may want to consider, but please consult with a healthcare professional for proper evaluation and treatment:\n\n1. Addressing Erection Problems: ED could be due to various reasons such as stress, lifestyle factors, or underlying health conditions. Consider making lifestyle changes, like reducing stress, quitting smoking, limiting alcohol consumption, and increasing physical activity. Consult a healthcare professional for potential prescription medications, vacuum devices, or surgery as last resorts.\n\n2. Low Testosterone: Since you mentioned having undescended testes, it's important to discuss this with your doctor. Low testosterone might contribute to your ED and reduced semen volume. Hormone replacement therapy (HRT) could be an option if a testosterone deficiency is diagnosed, but it should be discussed thoroughly with a healthcare professional first.\n\n3. Sperm Production: Watery semen and low semen volume might be a sign of oligospermia or asthenospermia, which could be contributing to your ED. The cause for this could be various, such as chronic illnesses, infections, or undetected hormonal issues. Consult a healthcare professional for proper evaluation, diagnosis, and potential treatment options.\n\nIn summary, as a 30-year-old male suffering from ED, watery semen, and low semen volume for two years, it's essential to consult a healthcare professional for proper evaluation and treatment. Potential causes could be related to ED, hormonal issues, or underlying health conditions. Addressing lifestyle factors, seeking proper medical assessment, and discussing potential treatment options with a healthcare professional is pivotal to your ongoing health and wellbeing."}

You can try for pregnancy from next cycle in consultation with your doctor.Wish you good health.", "ai": " Snehal, at the age of 26, you experienced a miscarriage around September-October 2011, which prevented you from conceiving since then. Your doctor diagnosed congested tubes as the cause, meaning blocked fallopian tubes that make it difficult for the egg to travel to the uterus for fertilization.\n\nSubsequently, you were prescribed ovulation induction tablets (likely Clomiphene Citrate or Letrozole) for 21 days to stimulate your ovaries and produce multiple follicles during one menstrual cycle. This treatment aims to maximize the chance of ovulating and, consequently, conceiving.\n\nYou mentioned having your last period in early March, and it lasted for several days. According to your doctor, your follicles were not yet ready for IntraUterine Insemination (IUI), making the procedure inadvisable. After completing the ovulation induction course, you reported stopping your bleeding. However, it is essential to wait for further signs of ovulation, such as a positive ovulation predictor kit test or monitoring cervical mucus changes. Once you confirm ovulation, try to conceive as soon as possible by having intercourse around the most fertile days, ideally during ovulation.\n\nBy focusing on addressing your congested tubes and using ovulation induction techniques, you can improve your chances of conceiving. It is essential to consult your doctor regarding the best approach, timing, and any potential risks or side effects associated with these treatments. Be patient and persistent. Conceiving after a miscarriage may take time, but persistence and the support of medical professionals will increase your chances of achieving a successful pregnancy."}

{"question": "Constant cramps in stomach after a glomus tympancum surgeryI have undergone a glomus tympancum surgery 2 days back. I am constant cramps in stomach. Gas is being formed regularly & having a tough time passing stool. Please advice", "human": "Welcome to Healthcare MagicYou could be having irritable bowel if it is a chronic problem or could be signs of food poisoning or infection. You should avoid spicy, sweet, fatty food. Keep away from wheat, oats, rye, barley and see if any improvement. Eat more fresh fruits and green leafy vegetables. Drink plenty of water. Follow proper handwashing procedure. Consult your Doctor, get examined and get stool test if necessary and follow your Doctor's advice.", "ai": " I'm an AI language model and cannot directly consult or advise on medical issues. However, I can suggest some general steps you can take for post-surgery discomfort, especially after a Glomus Tympanium (GT) surgery:\n\n1. Contact your surgeon or healthcare provider: Share your concerns and symptoms with them as soon as possible. They may recommend specific treatments or medications or help determine whether your symptoms are normal post-surgery side effects or require further medical attention.\n\n2. Pain relief: To manage the cramps, you can try over-the-counter pain relievers like acetaminophen or ibuprofen. Be sure to discuss these options with your doctor or pharmacist before taking them, as they may not be suitable for everyone, especially those with underlying health conditions or currently on other medications.\n\n3. Anti-gas medications: For dealing with excessive gas production, consider taking an anti-gas medication, such as simethicone or loperamide. As before, consult your healthcare provider before using any medication.\n\n4. Maintain proper diet: Consuming a diet rich in fibers and soft foods can help ease the passing of stool. Avoid foods that may increase gas in your digestive system, such as beans, cabbage, broccoli, onions, and carbonated drinks.\n\n5. Stay hydrated: Keep drinking plenty of fluids, especially water. Proper hydration can help alleviate constipation and relieve cramps. Additionally, avoid alcoholic beverages and caffeinated drinks while recovering from the surgery, as they can dehydrate you.\n\n6. Gentle exercise: Perform gentle exercises, such as walking or simple stretches, whenever you feel comfortable to do so. Being active can help promote healthy digestion and reduce cramps.\n\n7. Rest and relaxation: Ensure you are getting enough rest and relaxation, as your body heals from the surgery. Stress and anxiety can worsen symptoms, so try to minimize stress factors in your daily life.\n\n8. Avoid straining: Try not to strain when passing stool, as this can put additional pressure on your abdominal muscles and worsen cramps. Sit in a comfortable position, relax, and allow your body to naturally expel gas and stool.\n\nRemember, everyone's recovery from surgery is unique, and it's essential to consult with your healthcare provider for personalized advice, especially about your specific symptoms and concerns."}

This is a normal part of the tattoo healing process. However, if the odor is bothersome or concerns you, you can take the following steps to improve the healing process and reduce scabbing:\n\n1. Keep the area clean: Wash the tattoo with warm water and unscented soap daily to prevent the build-up of dirt and bacteria. Pat the area gently with a clean towel, then apply a light layer of a fragrance-free moisturizer or tattoo balm.\n\n2. Avoid picking at scabs: Resist the temptation to pick or scratch at scabs, as this can lead to infection or scarring. Allow the scabs to fall off naturally as the tattoo continues to heal.\n\n3. Stay hydrated: Drink plenty of water to stay hydrated, as this can help reduce the likelihood of scabs forming. Dehydration can cause the skin to dry out and slow down the healing process.\n\n4. Avoid exposing the tattoo to direct sunlight: Sun exposure can cause the tattoo ink to fade and may irritate the healing skin. Cover the tattoo with clothing or apply a broad-spectrum sunscreen with an SPF of at least 30 if you need to be in the sun.\n\n5. Keep the tattoo moisturized: Apply a thin layer of a fragrance-free moisturizer or tattoo balm to keep the tattoo hydrated during the healing process. This can help reduce scabbing and improve the overall appearance of the tattoo.\n\nIf the odor worsens, or you notice signs of infection, such as redness, swelling, or pus, consult a healthcare professional or your tattoo artist. Although rare, an unusual odor in a new tattoo could be a sign of an infection."}

Although the quantity released during routine removal is typically considered safe by dental and health organizations, some individuals may be more sensitive to mercury and experience adverse reactions.\n\nSafe methodsfor amalgam removal include:\n\n1. Proper ventilation: The dental clinic should have adequate local exhaust ventilation to prevent inhaling mercury vapor.\n2. Proper preparation: Rinsing the area of the tooth to be removed with water and using a high-volume evacuation system can minimize the amount of mercury released and inhaled.\n3. Use of a rubber dam: Dental dams can help keep the removal area dry and isolate it from the rest of the mouth, which can reduce the amount of mercury vapor and water spray.\n4. Careful removal technique: Using a slow, gentle and controlled method in removing the amalgam can help minimize the amount of mercury vapor and particles generated.\n\nIt's important to keep in mind that an individual's sensitivity to mercury can significantly impact their symptoms.

Additionally, it appears that he is currently taking antibiotics, which can affect potassium levels. His healthcare provider may need to monitor his potassium levels more closely due to the use of antibiotics and adjust his treatment accordingly.

{"question": "What are the other options for pain relief in hep-c patient?Thank You. I have Hep. C, and I was told by my Dr., to stay away from Acetomenophen, but I can takeIbuprophen. Is motrin an ibuprophen? Secondly, what are other options for pain relief and/or fever reduction? Is there a list of yes & no for a person with Hep. C?", "human": "Hello! Thanks for putting your query in HCM. I am a Gastroenterologist (DM). Acetoaminophen is rather safe until it is taken in safe dose that is less than 4 gm per day. Ibuprophen is rather unsafe as it can cause hepatitis. For pain you can take tramadol also which is safe for you. Avoid alcohol, any drug which is hepatotoxic. get vaccination for hepatitis B and A. avoid high fat diet. DO regular exercise. Take lots of fruits and vegetables as they are rich in antioxidantsI hope I have answered your query and this will help you. If you have any further query  I will be happy to answer that too. Remain in touch and get-well soon.", "ai": " Yes, Motrin is a brand name for Ibuprofen. For pain relief and fever reduction in a person with Hepatitis C, the following medications are generally considered safe:\n\n1. Ibuprofen: This is an over-the-counter nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) that can help with pain and fever.\n2. Acetylsalicylic acid (Aspirin): In low doses (less than 100 mg/day), aspirin can be used for fever and mild pain relief. However, high doses should be avoided as they may worsen liver function in Hepatitis C patients.\n3. Paracetamol (Acetaminophen): Although not typically recommended due to potential liver toxicity, some healthcare providers may allow low-dose paracetamol (325-650 mg every 4-6 hours) for Hepatitis C patients with mild pain and no history of liver disease. Always consult your doctor before taking this medication.\n4. Opioids: Prescription painkillers, such as codeine, hydrocodone, and oxycodone, may be prescribed for short-term use in patients with severe pain. These medications can have side effects and addictive properties, so they should be used with caution and only under the close supervision of a healthcare professional.\n\nRemember that every person's medical condition and reaction to medications can be different. Always consult with your healthcare provider to discuss your specific situation, medication options, and potential risks before making any changes to your treatment plan."}
{"question": "Suggest treatment for pain during urination and feverMy father is 82 years old and in good health.  Yesterday he had a fever (101) and experienced burning pain while urinating.  He went to the ER and they stared giving him antibiotics via an IV.  It's been 24 hours and his fever continues (101.7).  He said he feels terrible.  They just ordered an ultrasound of his bladder, kidneys and prostrate.  What could the problem be?", "human": "Hello and Welcome to ‘Ask A Doctor’ service. I have reviewed your query and here is my advice. Your father might be suffering from urinary tract infection. Urinary tract infections are very common in elderly males due to bening prostatic hypertrophy which causes urinary tract obstruction which leads to stasis of urine in bladder and urine is excellent media for bacteria to grow. I would advise you to get his urine complete examination done along with ultrasound kidney ureter bladder and prostate. In the meanwhile keep him on oral antibiotics preferably from quinolone group. Thanks", "ai": " Based on the given information, it is likely that your father may have a urinary tract infection (UTI) or a more serious condition like a kidney infection or prostate infection. The persistent fever despite antibiotic treatment suggests that the infection may be more severe or resistant to the antibiotics. The ultrasound will provide more information about the potential cause. In the meantime, your father should continue taking the prescribed antibiotics and stay hydrated to help flush out the bacteria. If the symptoms do not improve, he should inform his healthcare provider."}
{"question": "What causes bowel movements odor with flatulence pain?My 6 week old nephew has the most horrid bowel movements I have ever smelled. He was born at 33 weeks, and has had to have his formula changes several times due to extreme gas pains. I noticed today that his entire body smells like his feces- which stinks like rotten eggs. Should we be concerned about this? He is currently on soy formula (started today) to see if that decreases his tummy issues.", "human": "Hi... abnormal body odour in infants is suggestive of some inborn errors of metabolism.I suggest you consult your pediatrician regarding this as there are filter paper blot tests now available to screen for such disorders.Regards - Dr. Sumanth", "ai": " The odor and pain in bowel movements during infancy, including flatulence, are commonly caused by the fermentation of undigested milk proteins or sugars in the formula or breast milk by intestinal bacteria. This can lead to increased production of hydrogen, methane, or other gases. In some cases, such as prematurity, the intestinal system may not yet be fully developed, making it harder for the baby to digest these substances and leading to more severe symptoms.\n\nThe strong, sulfurous odor associated with your nephew's bowel movements could be due to the presence of increased amounts of various volatile fatty acids (VFAs) and hydrogen sulfide. These gases are by-products of the bacterial fermentation process.\n\nWhile it may be concerning to experience such intense odors and discomfort, it is relatively common in infancy, especially in premature infants. Although the smell can be distressing, these symptoms, on their own, generally do not indicate a significant health concern. However, it is essential to keep an eye on your nephew's other developmental signs and symptoms to ensure his overall health and wellbeing. It is a good idea to consult your healthcare provider if you have any concerns or if these symptoms persist significantly after switching to soy formula or if they are accompanied by other symptoms like diarrhea, vomiting, fever, or abdominal distension."}

Here are some possible causes and solutions:\n\n1. Poor oral hygiene: Despite brushing regularly, there might be areas in your mouth that you're missing, such as the back of your tongue or between your teeth. Try using a tongue scraper or interdental brushes to clean these areas.\n2. Diet: Certain foods like garlic, onions, and coffee can contribute to bad breath. Try avoiding these foods or brushing your teeth after eating them.\n3. Dental issues: Gum disease, cavities, or other dental problems can lead to bad breath. If you suspect this might be the cause, make an appointment with your dentist.\n4. Dry mouth: Saliva helps wash away bacteria and keep your mouth moist. If you're not producing enough saliva, consider using a saliva substitute or chewing sugarless gum to stimulate saliva production.\n5. Medical conditions: Certain medical conditions like diabetes, sinus infection, or digestive problems can cause bad breath. If you're concerned, speak with your healthcare provider.\n\nBy addressing these potential causes, you may be able to improve your bad breath.

Good afternoon. I am Dr Shareef answering your query. From your drinking history it seems that you have got hemorrhoids with bleeding either secondary to a portal hypertension or as such. It might be also from  a fresh GI bleeding like a duodenal/gastric ulcer.My first line of management would be to advise you for complete alcohol withdrawal. Next I would advise you to report to the ER of a nearest hospital where you could be properly investigated after initial management of the GI bleed by a gastro enterologist.I hope this information would help you in discussing with your family physician/treating doctor in further management of your problem. Please do not hesitate to ask in case of any further doubts.Thanks for choosing health care magic to clear doubts on your health problems. I wish you an early recovery. Dr Shareef.", "ai": " Alcohol consumption can irritate and inflame the stomach lining, leading to conditions such as gastritis or gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD), causing abdominal pain and bleeding. The irritation allows the inner lining of the stomach to be exposed, causing irritation and inflammation, which results in the formation of small ulcers that may bleed. Chronic alcohol consumption can also lead to more serious conditions like cirrhosis of the liver, which can also cause similar symptoms. However, it's important to note that not everyone who drinks heavily will experience these symptoms, and other potential causes such as infections, inflammatory bowel diseases, or stomach cancer cannot be ruled out without proper evaluation by a healthcare professional. Please seek medical attention as soon as possible to determine the underlying cause and receive appropriate treatment."}

Hepatocellular injury or damage (could be due to various reasons like alcohol consumption, viral hepatitis, medications, or non-alcoholic fatty liver disease)\n2. Hemochromatosis (as in your case) - if not properly managed, iron overload from hemochromatosis can lead to liver damage and subsequent elevated AST/ALT levels.\n3.

At 18 years age, you are too young to judge the size of  your penis. It is made up of muscles and the growth at puberty and adolescent is under the influence of testosterone. A research study was done in healthy Indian males on penis size during flaccid and erect and the width of the penis. Mean flaccid length was found to be 8.21 cm, mean stretched length 10.88 cm and circumference 9.14 cm. Mean erected length was found to be 13.01 cm and erected circumference was 11.46 cm. If your penis measurements are at least as mentioned above then there is no need to worry.Semen flowing with urine is a misconception in most men at your age. If you feel it is present then it needs to be evaluated after clinical examination with the urologist. Any urine infection must also be ruled out.", "ai": " I'm here to help answer your questions to the best of my ability. However, I cannot promise an answer that will lead to the outcome you've mentioned in the beginning. Regarding your first question, several factors can influence the size and shape of a penis, and most of them are not related to age. Some men may have a naturally smaller penis size, while others may experience conditions such as Peyronie's disease or erectile dysfunction that can affect penis size.\n\nAs for increasing penis size, there is no scientific evidence to support the effectiveness of various methods, such as exercises, pills, or devices. The size of a penis when erect is mainly determined by genetics, and attempts to change it through external means are generally unsuccessful.\n\nAs for the second question, it is not uncommon for small amounts of semen or sperm to mix with urine, especially at the beginning of urination, due to the anatomy of the male urinary system. The urethra, which carries both urine and semen, can be shorter in some men, making it easier for semen to mix with urine. However, if large amounts of semen are consistently present in the urine stream, it could be a sign of certain medical conditions, such as prostate issues or urethral stricture, and it's important to consult a healthcare professional for further evaluation.\n\nRegarding your concerns about premature ejaculation and loose testicles, these are common issues for many young men, and they're not related to the size of the penis. Premature ejaculation can be caused by various factors, such as anxiety, lack of experience, or underlying medical conditions. Treatment options can include techniques such as the stop-start method, squeezing the penis head before ejaculation, or using desensitizing creams. Loose testicles, on the other hand, are a normal variation and do not have any medical significance. If you are concerned about any of these issues, it's best to speak with a healthcare professional for further guidance and advice."}
