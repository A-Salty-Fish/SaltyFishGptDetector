I understand your concern.         Primolute  N-a hormonal preparation of female sex hormone... is contraindicated in pregnancy.      It can cause fetal congenital abnormality &so such pregnancy (with intake of pills like promolute n ) needs to be terminated.   Thanks.", "ai": " I am an AI language model and not a doctor, but I can try to provide you with some information based on available medical data.\n\nPrimolut-N (norethisterone) is a synthetic progestogen hormone that is often used in birth control pills to prevent ovulation and thin the uterine lining. However, it can also be used to treat various conditions during pregnancy, such as prolonged bleeding or threatened miscarriage.\n\nStudies have shown that taking Primolut-N at the beginning of pregnancy (before the 9th week) is unlikely to cause harm to the baby. However, if taken later in pregnancy, especially in the second and third trimesters, it can have some risks.\n\nThe risks associated with Primolut-N use during pregnancy include:\n\n1. Increased risk of preterm labor and delivery\n2. Fetal weight gain and macrosomia (large baby)\n3. Hypoglycemia (low blood sugar) in the newborn\n4. Breast engorgement in the mother\n\nIf you took Primolut-N unknowingly before realizing you were pregnant, it is important to discuss this with your healthcare provider. They can assess the situation, consider the timing and duration of the use, and provide you with appropriate guidance.\n\nKeep in mind that every pregnancy is unique, and the potential risks and benefits of medication use during pregnancy must be balanced against the individual situation. Your healthcare provider is the best source of information for your specific circumstances."}

Take care Regards,Dr. Dorina Gurabardhi, General & Family Physician", "ai": " I cannot definitively answer whether your chest pain is related to the intake of Clindamycin and Oxycodone without conducting a thorough examination or reviewing your medical history. However, I can share some information that may help you better understand the potential risks associated with these medications.\n\nClindamycin is an antibiotic that is sometimes associated with gastrointestinal (GI) side effects, including abdominal pain, diarrhea, and nausea. In rare cases, Clindamycin can cause serious GI conditions such as Clostridium difficile-associated diarrhea (CDAD). While chest pain is not a common side effect, it is possible that your GI symptoms could be causing referred pain in your chest.\n\nOxycodone is an opioid pain medication that is sometimes associated with side effects such as respiratory depression, dizziness, and constipation. Rarely, opioids can cause heart-related side effects such as arrhythmias or chest pain.\n\nIt is important to note that chest pain can have many different causes, including heart conditions, lung conditions, and gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD). Therefore, it is crucial that you contact your healthcare provider as soon as possible to report your symptoms. They may recommend further testing to evaluate the underlying cause of your chest pain.\n\nIn the meantime, you can take the following steps to help manage your symptoms:\n\n1. Continue taking your medications as prescribed, but do not increase the dosage without speaking to your healthcare provider.\n2. Avoid taking large or frequent doses of opioids, as this can increase the risk of side effects.\n3. Stay hydrated by drinking plenty of water or other clear fluids.\n4. Eat smaller, more frequent meals throughout the day instead of large meals.\n5. Avoid caffeine, alcohol, and other substances that can irritate your GI tract.\n6. Practice deep breathing exercises to help reduce anxiety and improve oxygenation to your body.\n\nI hope this information is helpful.

These tips should not replace professional medical advice and you should consult with your healthcare practitioner for personalized recommendations.\n\n1. Medications: Follow your doctor's prescribed dosages for your Levolin inhaler and other medications. If your symptoms persist or worsen, consider discussing additional treatment options with your healthcare provider.\n\n2. Allergy Management: Try to avoid known allergens to reduce the severity and frequency of symptoms. Implementing allergy-proof measures, such as using an air purifier, regularly changing bedding and filters, and washing linens in hot water can help alleviate symptoms caused by dust allergies.\n\n3. Cold-Weather Protection: Dress appropriately for cold weather to prevent cold-related exacerbations. Layer up, wear a hat, scarf, gloves, and consider using a face mask while outdoors.\n\n4. Humidifier: Using a humidifier at home can help keep the air moist, making it less likely for your airways to dry out and become irritated.\n\n5. Breathing exercises: Practicing breathing exercises, such as pursed-lip breathing, may help you expel air effectively from your lungs and manage your breathing during an episode, reducing the sensation of shortness of breath.\n\n6. Avoid triggers: Identify and avoid any other triggers that exacerbate your symptoms, such as smoke, strong perfumes, or high-pollen environments.\n\n7.

{"question": "What are the side effects of changing the medication?I am cuurently and permanently on warfarin, and in one week s time I am to undergo surgery to have tor tendons repaired in my right shoulder.

I have been on warfarin for three years since a mechanical aortic valve was implanted during open heart surgery.What side effects should I expect? Thankyou", "human": "Hello, Clexane is a medicinal product used to prevent the formation of coagules like Warfarin, therefore the adverse effects are hematomas, tend to bleed, hematoma in the site of injections. In adequate dose should not have major problems, there are adverse effects seen in blood test only, but in addition to that it is a pretty safe medicinal product. Hope I have answered your query. Let me know if I can assist you further. Regards,Dr. Jose Mero Santana, General & Family Physician", "ai": " Changing from warfarin to enoxaparin (Glexane) prior to surgery involves some risks and potential side effects. Enoxaparin is a low molecular weight heparin, which is an anticoagulant similar to warfarin but works differently in the body. Here are some potential side effects and risks associated with the use of enoxaparin:\n\n1. Bleeding: Since enoxaparin is an anticoagulant, the risk of bleeding, especially at the injection site, is a common side effect. Your healthcare provider will closely monitor your bleeding risk and adjust your dosage accordingly.\n\n2. Hematoma: Enoxaparin can increase the risk of hematoma formation (bruising) at the surgical site, especially if you receive an injection close to the surgical site.\n\n3. Thrombosis: Although unlikely, there is a small risk of developing a blood clot while on enoxaparin, although it is generally considered less than the risk with warfarin due to the better predictability of its effects.\n\n4. Anaphylaxis: Although rare, an allergic reaction to enoxaparin, in the form of anaphylaxis, can occur. Signs of an allergic reaction include trouble breathing, hives, or swelling of the face, lips, tongue, or throat.\n\n5. Heparin-induced thrombocytopenia (HIT): Although more common with unfractionated heparin, there is a risk for HIT with enoxaparin as well. This condition can cause low platelet counts, which may lead to bleeding complications. Your healthcare provider may monitor your platelet count while on enoxaparin.\n\n6. Spinal or epidural hematoma: If you have a history of spinal surgery or have a spinal puncture during your procedure, using an anticoagulant like enoxaparin may increase the risk of a spinal or epidural hematoma. This is a rare but serious complication that can cause paralysis.\n\n7. Hemorrhage: The risk of severe or life-threatening internal bleeding is low but not completely eliminated while taking enoxaparin.\n\n8. Osteoporosis: Long-term use of low-molecular-weight heparin, as in your case, may increase the risk of osteoporosis and fractures. However, the risk is generally considered lower than the risk of complications associated with warfarin therapy.\n\nYou should discuss these risks in detail with your healthcare provider before undergoing the temporary switch to enoxaparin prior to your shoulder surgery. They will be able to provide you with the most accurate and up-to-date information based on your medical history and current condition."}

Bleeding after sex during pregnancy can be concerning, and it is important to discuss this issue with your healthcare provider.\n\nAn early intrauterine pregnancy (IUP) can increase the risk of bleeding during pregnancy, especially if the pregnancy is not yet viable. The fact that you have been diagnosed with an early IUP and are experiencing bleeding after sex may be a sign of an implantation bleed or other complications.\n\nHowever, it's essential to remember that each pregnancy is unique, and numerous factors can influence the risk of complications. Therefore, it's crucial to speak with your healthcare provider about the specifics of your case and any concerns you may have.\n\nBased on the information you've provided, it seems that your healthcare provider has suggested repeating the ultrasound in two weeks to assess fetal viability further. You should consider following this recommendation, as this will give you and your healthcare provider more information about the status of the pregnancy.\n\nIt's important to keep in mind that experiencing bleeding during pregnancy does not necessarily mean you will lose the baby. Many women have healthy pregnancies despite some bleeding. However, if the bleeding is heavy, persistent, or accompanied by other symptoms such as severe cramping, back pain, or a foul-smelling discharge, you should contact your healthcare provider immediately.\n\nIn the meantime, you may want to try some strategies to minimize the risk of bleeding during sex. These could include using a lubricant, avoiding deep penetration, and positioning yourself in a way that is comfortable for both you and your partner.\n\nIf you have further concerns, it may be helpful to speak with your healthcare provider or a healthcare professional for personalized advice regarding your situation."}

Maintain a Balanced Diet: Consuming a diet rich in vitamins and minerals, particularly iron, zinc, and biotin, can help support healthy hair growth.\n2. Hair Care: Be gentle with your hair whenwashing, brushing,or combing. Try using a wide-tooth comb or a gentle hairbrush to minimize breakage. Wash your hair with a gentle shampoo and conditioner, avoiding hot water, which can strip the scalp of essential oils. Try not to tie your hair too tightly in a ponytail or bun.\n3. Stress Management: High levels of stress can lead to hair fall. Practice relaxation techniques such as deep breathing, meditation, or yoga to help manage stress levels.\n4. Hair Styling and Heat: Limit the use of hot styling tools like curling irons, flat irons, and blow dryers. When using these tools, use a heat protectant spray to minimize damage.\n5. Consider other Treatments: Speak with your doctor about other hair loss treatments, such as topical Minoxidil, prescription medication, or PRP (Platelet-Rich Plasma) therapy. Be sure to discuss the potential side effects and benefits of each option. If you're taking any medications, discuss any potential hair loss side effects with your doctor.\n\nAdditionally, if you have been using Nutrafol for four months without noticing any improvement, it may be worth considering other treatments or discussing this with your doctor to explore alternative options.

A bronschopy may be required after the HRCT scan.Blood tests: Complete hemogram, Liver function tests, ACE level, IgE, Urea Creatinine, ANA, ANCA are also required.A treatment plan can be decided only after these tests are done.I hope that was useful.Best Wishes.", "ai": " I'm an AI language model and unable to provide medical advice directly. However, I can help you understand the information you've been given and provide some general information about the condition you're describing.\n\nBronchitis is an inflammation of the bronchial tubes, which carry air to the lungs. It's often caused by a respiratory infection, such as a cold or the flu. Allergic asthma and bronchitis can overlap, as allergens can trigger bronchitis in people with asthma. Hilar lymphadenopathy refers to an enlargement of the lymph nodes at the hilum (the point where the bronchus and blood vessels enter the lung). This can be a sign of infection or inflammation.\n\nThe treatment for bronchitis with bilateral hilar lymphadenopathy typically involves addressing both the infection and the underlying asthma. Here are some general recommendations:\n\n1. Asthma Management: It's important for your sister to continue using her asthma medications as prescribed by her healthcare provider. This may include quick-relief inhalers for symptomatic periods and long-term control medications to manage asthma symptoms and prevent flare-ups.\n\n2.Antibiotics: If her healthcare provider suspects a bacterial infection, she may prescribe antibiotics. These are most effective when taken as directed by her healthcare provider.\n\n3. Bronchodilators: These medications can help to improve breathing by relaxing muscle bands around the bronchial tubes, making it easier to breathe.\n\n4. Inhaled steroids: Corticosteroid inhalers can help reduce inflammation in the airways, which can improve symptoms of both asthma and bronchitis.\n\n5. Other Medications: Depending on the severity of her symptoms, your sister's healthcare provider may prescribe additional medications, such as oxygen therapy, mucolytic agents to thin mucus, or cough suppressants if a persistent cough is a problem.\n\n6. Lifestyle changes: Encouraging your sister to quit smoking if she smokes, avoid environmental irritants, maintain good hygiene, and stay hydrated may also help to improve her symptoms.\n\n7. Follow-up appointments: Regular follow-up appointments with her healthcare provider are essential for monitoring her progress, adjusting her treatment plan as needed, and preventing future flare-ups.\n\nIf you have any more questions about her condition, I encourage you to speak to her healthcare provider directly. They will be best equipped to answer any specific concerns you may have.\n\nYou can send an email to YYYY@YYYY for more information and ask for clarification on the radiology report and further steps in her treatment plan from her healthcare provider."}
{"question": "By mistake I took 5 Normaxin out of them after dinner, What are the effects ?Hi, I have abdominal pain and I was advised to take Normaxin for 10 days(before dinner), however by mistake I took 5 out of them after dinner, do I need to buy another 5 to cover this ? What are the effects of this mistake ?", "human": "HelloThanks for your query.  NORMAXIN   contains chlordiazepoxide + clidinium bromide ,it is used commonly for irritable bowel syndrome .It is advisable to take medicine one hour before meal or two hour after for better absorption.If you have got the relief than there is no need to repeat it.  ‘Hope I have answered your query, I will be available to answer your follow up queries, “Wish you Good Health and trouble free speedy recovery”", "ai": " Normaxin is an antibiotic used to treat various bacterial infections. The active ingredient in Normaxin is amoxicillin. Taking 5 Normaxin tablets after dinner instead of before, as prescribed, does not pose an immediate danger, but it could potentially reduce the effectiveness of your treatment.\n\nAmoxicillin works by interfering with the bacterial cells' ability to build a protective wall. Normally, amoxicillin is absorbed best when taken on an empty stomach, or at least 30 minutes before meals. If you took Normaxin with food, it might take longer for your body to absorb the full dose of the medication. This delay in absorption might mean that your body does not maintain a consistent level of the antibiotic in your system throughout the day. If your body does not maintain a consistent level of the antibiotic, it may not be as effective in killing the bacteria causing your infection.\n\nHowever, taking an occasional dose after a meal is unlikely to significantly affect the outcome of your treatment. If you are concerned about this incident and its potential impact on your treatment, you should discuss it with your healthcare provider or pharmacist. They can provide you with advice based on your individual circumstances. Remember, it's always best to follow your prescribed dosage instructions to ensure that your infection is fully treated and to minimize the risk of developing antibiotic resistance."}

While your son's endurance and ability to complete the run without getting winded are impressive, it's essential to keep in mind the American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) recommendations for children's physical activity.\n\nThe AAP advises that children between the ages of 6 and 12 should engage in at least 60 minutes of moderate-to-vigorous physical activity daily. Running four miles can be considered vigorous activity, especially for a 10-year-old.\n\nTo help ensure your son's safety and promote optimal development, consider the following:\n\n1. Proper warm-up and cool-down: Make sure your son does a warm-up before running and a cool-down after running to prevent injuries and help his muscles recover.\n2. Hydration: Encourage him to drink plenty of water before, during, and after runs to stay properly hydrated.\n3. Proper nutrition: Make sure your son is receiving a balanced diet rich in nutrients to support his activity level and growth.\n4. Rest day: Encourage your son to have at least one day per week where he engages in light physical activity, such as walking, biking, or swimming, but does not run.\n5. Monitor for signs of overtraining: Listen for any complaints of pain, soreness, or exhaustion. Overtraining can lead to injuries, decreased performance, and poor health.\n\nIf you notice any concerning symptoms or have concerns, consult your son's healthcare provider for advice on his running routine. Remember, all children develop differently, and it's vital to prioritize their overall health and well-being."}

It has been two days and the swelling is just decreasing now after a day of rest and leg elevation.  I took my bp about 20 min ago and it was 137/92.  I am on meds to control my bp but have had more salt intake the last few days than normal.  Will i be ok?", "human": "Hello, Thanks for posting your query on Healthcare Magic...* Brief Answer: you need to lessen your salt intake and follow up blood pressure accurately.*Explanation: My opinion is that high blood pressure on many occasions is an indication for control .That happens on many levels. First, be sure that high blood pressure is not secondary to any other diseases as Cushing or renal failure.Then ,Diet with low salt and less fat content is crucial. Exercise and other healthy activities are also a mean to control blood pressure. If all that dose not help, medications are a must .That is usually decided by your doctor according to your condition and comorbidities .Some drugs that are perfect for patients are not necessary good for others.Regular blood pressure monitoring is as important as starting treatment so that we could assess efficacy of the medication we started.I suggest my patients the following : low salt in diet and exercise .The information provided by you is not sufficient to provide a good opinion. If someone comes to me with this condition I would ask them about *Conclusion: I suggest you avoid high heels and check out salt content of every item you eat or drink.   If you have any further questions I will be happy to help, If not, you can close the discussion and rate the answer. Wish you good health.", "ai": " I'm an AI language model and not a doctor, but I can help you understand some general information about salt intake and blood pressure. Your experience of swelling after a high salt intake and high heels indicates that you may be experiencing edema, which can be a symptom of fluid retention. When you consume excess salt, your body holds onto more fluid, which can increase blood volume and put additional pressure on your blood vessels, potentially worsening high blood pressure.\n\nHowever, it is important to note that individual responses to salt intake can vary greatly. For some people, even short-term increases in salt intake can lead to significant blood pressure elevations, while for others, the effect may be minimal. In the long term, a high salt diet is known to increase the risk of high blood pressure and heart disease.\n\nThat being said, one or two days of higher-than-usual salt intake is unlikely to cause irreversible damage to your cardiovascular system. Your body has some mechanisms for regulating fluid balance and adjusting blood pressure. Your blood pressure reading of 137/92 is still within the normal to high-normal range. If you continue to experience persistent swelling, however, it would be a good idea to monitor your blood pressure closely and discuss this with your healthcare provider. They may recommend adjustments to your lifestyle or medications to help manage your blood pressure and prevent complications.\n\nLastly, it's important to remember that there are many factors that can influence blood pressure, including stress, physical activity, and medications. If you're concerned about your blood pressure or experiencing unusual symptoms, consult your healthcare provider for personalized advice."}

However, if you have concerns about preterm labor or delivery, it's essential to communicate those concerns with your healthcare provider. They can evaluate your individual situation and determine if further monitoring or interventions are necessary. Additionally, having a family history of preterm birth increases the risk, but it does not mean it will definitely occur. Factors like maternal age, pregnancy complications, and lifestyle choices also play a role. Regular prenatal care is crucial for identifying and managing any potential risk factors, ensuring the best possible outcome for both you and your baby."}
{"question": "Suggest medication to slow down racing thoughtsMy husband has some white matter. His mind is very good. His memory is amazing, but his brain races. He gets around good.

As you have told me, your husband is suffering from racing thoughts, this might be a part of his personality which is right from his childhood causing racing thoughts and also behaving based on those thoughts. One modality of getting better from this is to regularly exercise at least 2 to 3 days per week and have regular walks in the morning time so that the neurotransmitter levels in the brain get normal and the neurotransmitters responsible for pleasure also increases in his brain so that he feels better, then his racing thoughts will come down.

Feel free to ask any further questions.Thank you", "ai": " I'm an AI language model and not a doctor, but I can suggest some medications that are commonly used to help manage racing thoughts and decreased attention span, also known as attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). These medications are believed to help increase the levels of certain neurotransmitters in the brain that contribute to focus and impulse control. However, they should only be taken under the supervision of a healthcare professional, as they can have side effects and interactions with other medications. Some of these medications include:\n\n1. Methylphenidate (Ritalin): This is a central nervous system stimulant that can help improve focus, decrease impulsivity, and reduce racing thoughts. It works by increasing the availability of dopamine and norepinephrine in the brain.\n\n2. Amphetamines (Adderall): Similar to methylphenidate, this medication is also a central nervous system stimulant that increases the availability of dopamine and norepinephrine in the brain. It's often prescribed for the treatment of ADHD.\n\n3. Atomoxetine (Strattera): This is a non-stimulant medication that works as a selective norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor, which can help improve attention and focus without the stimulant effects.\n\nKeep in mind that the effectiveness of these medications can vary from person to person. It's also important to note that medication should ideally be used in combination with other strategies, such as lifestyle changes (regular sleep schedule, healthy diet, physical activity, stress management), and therapeutic interventions (psychotherapy, cognitive-behavioral therapy). Your husband should discuss these options with his healthcare provider to determine which one might be best for him."}
{"question": "Should I undergo a blood transfusion or take an iron pill for low ferritin level?Hi I recently been diagnosed as severely anaemic my ferritin level is at four and I was wondering what should I do them is taking iron pills enough or should I be getting a blood transfusion of some kind or shots or something?", "human": "Hello,  So if you have symptoms of anaemia like breathlessness and severe fatigue, or if you are unable to take iron tablets,  transfusion is indicated. Otherwise, you can take iron tablets. Else, you can take injectable iron also. Hope I have answered your query. Let me know if I can assist you further. Take care Regards,Dr Deepak Sundriyal, Oncologist", "ai": " A ferritin level of 4 ng/mL indicates very low iron stores in the body, and you may be experiencing symptoms of anemia such as fatigue, shortness of breath, and pale skin. Iron supplements can help increase your iron levels, but in your case, given the severe anemia, a blood transfusion might be necessary to replace your lost red blood cells more quickly.\n\nYour healthcare provider is the best person to determine whether iron pills alone or a blood transfusion are appropriate for you. They will consider several factors, including the severity and cause of your anemia, your overall health, and any other medical conditions you may have.\n\nA blood transfusion would provide an immediate boost in your hemoglobin and red blood cell levels, helping relieve symptoms associated with severe anemia. However, it carries risks such as a reaction to the blood, infection, and the potential for the development of antibodies against donor blood. Iron pills take longer to work, but they carry fewer risks and can help build up your iron stores over time.\n\nYour doctor will consider the pros and cons of each option based on your individual health situation and make a recommendation accordingly.

He is in football and my concern is also germs from the locker room...could he have caught something.", "human": "Hi...by what you quote I feel that your son might be having a post viral skin peeling or dry skin (idiopathic). I suggest using emollient ointment or creams for this. If still not better - I suggest you to upload photographs of the same on this website, so that I can guide you scientifically.  Skin conditions are best diagnosed only after seeing directly. Regards - Dr. Sumanth", "ai": " I'm not a doctor, but I can try to help you understand some common causes of skin peeling in children based on the information you've provided. However, I strongly recommend consulting a healthcare professional for an accurate diagnosis.\n\nSkin peeling on a child's hands and feet, especially between the toes, can be caused by several conditions. Some of the most common include:\n\n1. Athlete's foot: A fungal infection that causes itching, redness, peeling, and cracking of the skin, usually between the toes. While it doesn't always itch, your son might still have Athlete's foot if he has been sharing towels or walked barefoot in damp areas.\n2. Hand, foot, and mouth disease: A viral illness that can cause painful sores in the mouth and a rash on the hands and feet. The rash usually starts as small red spots that become blisters and eventually peel. It typically isn't itchy but can be uncomfortable, and it doesn't spread from person to person through contact with affected skin.\n3. Eczema: A chronic skin condition that causes dry, scaly, itchy patches that can also blister and peel when scratched or exposed to irritants. This condition isn't contagious and isn't typically associated with sports activities.\n4. Dry skin: In some cases, peeling skin can be a result of dryness. It's essential to maintain good skin hydration by using a gentle fragrance-free moisturizer on a daily basis.\n\nDespite the causes mentioned above, all of them are generally not serious and can be treated with appropriate care. However, Athlete's foot might involve antifungal treatment, while Hand, foot, and mouth disease usually resolves on its own within 7-10 days. Eczema and dry skin require long-term moisturization and, in some cases, additional treatments.\n\nAs for your concern about germs from the locker room, remind your son to shower immediately after practice, using an antifungal foot powder or cream, if it becomes apparent he has Athlete's foot. Also, encourage him to keep his personal belongings separate from his teammates' items to prevent the spread of infection. If it is indeed Hand, foot, and mouth disease, they might need to stay home from practice until they are no longer contagious, typically after 5 days. If the cause is dry skin or eczema, keeping the skin moisturized with fragrance-free lotion should be enough to help manage the symptoms.\n\nIn summary, while skin peeling on the hands and feet of a child can be concerning, most causes are not serious and can be effectively treated. I highly recommend consulting a healthcare professional for an accurate diagnosis and appropriate treatment."}

{"question": "Q. How can brown teeth due to fluoride be treated?Hi doctor, My probleam is my tooth and the color of my tooth is completly brown, this happen becouse of flouride. Based on this is possible to remove brown colour to white and how much does it cost?", "human": "Hi. I have seen the picture attached along with your complaint (attachment removed to protect patient identity). You have severe dental fluorosis along with severe external stains. It is definitely possible to get whiter teeth with the help of dental veneers. Firstly the procedure includes complete thorough cleaning of the stains. Secondly the teeth visible in your smile zone will have to be prepared (ground slightly on the front surfaces) to fix in the dental veneers. Coming to the cost of the procedure,there are two types of veneers. One is composite veneers which has to be done in the clinic manually by the dentist. But this has short life and a major disadvantage of discoloration. Two, ceramic dental veneers which have to be made in the laboratory and then fixed on the prepared teeth. Ceramic ones are much suitable for you as it can long last and hide the brownish colour of your present teeth to a greater extent but this is expensive than composite ones. Ceramic veneers have different price ranges and it depends on your dentist and the laboratory. Discuss with the your dentist about it and choose your best suited range.", "ai": " I am not a doctor, but I can try to help you understand the possible treatments for brown discoloration of teeth caused by fluoride. It is important to consult with a dental professional for an accurate diagnosis and personalized treatment plan.\n\nFluoride is essential for maintaining strong teeth, but when an individual is exposed to excessive amounts, it can lead to a condition called fluorosis. The severity of fluorosis can range from barely noticeable white spots to severe brown or black staining.\n\nThe most common Treatment for fluoride-induced brown tooth discoloration is tooth whitening. There are two types of tooth whitening: in-office and at-home.\n\n1. In-office tooth whitening: This is performed by a dental professional and can provide the fastest results. It usually involves the application of a high-concentration bleaching gel, along with the use of a special light or laser to enhance the whitening effect. The cost of in-office tooth whitening can range from $450 to $1,500 or more, depending on the dentist's fees and the level of discoloration.\n\n2. At-home tooth whitening: This is done using custom-made whitening trays and bleaching gel that is provided by a dental professional. The patient applies the gel to their teeth using the trays for a specified amount of time each day. At-home whitening typically takes longer to produce results than in-office treatment, but it is less expensive, with costs ranging from $100 to $600 or more.\n\nIt is important to keep in mind that tooth whitening may not be effective for all cases of fluorosis. In severe cases, other treatments such as veneers, crowns, or dental bonding may be necessary. These procedures can be more expensive, with costs ranging from $800 to $3,000 per tooth or more.\n\nIt is recommended that you consult with a dental professional for an accurate assessment of your tooth discoloration and the most suitable treatment for your situation."}
{"question": "Suggest tests to confirm difficulty in conceptionAm 2years old in marriage, and i have not been able to conceive i went for an HSG and everything turn normal, my husband was diagnosied with pus cell- can this be transmitted, what is the cause of it, after treatment is there gurantee of conceiving please help.", "human": "Hi, I think your husband can be treated by antibiotics course for 7 to 10 days. Generally it will not affect you. There will be no problem in conceiving.  Be in contact with your husband every 2 to 3 days after your periods stop.  You can try like that for 3 cycles.  If it doesn't work then you can go for IUI.  Hope I have answered your question. Regards Dr khushboo", "ai": " I'm an assistant and not a doctor, but I can provide some suggestions based on the information you've shared. These tests and evaluations may help confirm potential causes of your difficulty in conceiving:\n\n1. Ovulation test: A simple at-home ovulation test or an ovulation blood test from your healthcare provider can confirm if you're ovulating regularly.\n2. Semen analysis: Your husband's semen analysis results showed the presence of pus cells, indicating an infection. A repeat semen analysis after completing treatment can help confirm clearance of the infection.\n3. Hysterosalpingogram (HSG) dye recall test: This test checks for the presence of dye in the pelvic cavity after an HSG. If dye is still present, it might mean there's a blockage preventing the dye from leaving the body, which can impact fertility.\n4. Endometrial biopsy: Your healthcare provider can perform a biopsy of the endometrium to rule out any conditions, such as endometriosis or polyps, that could impact your ability to conceive.\n5. Karyotyping: A karyotyping test, which examines the chromosomes, can be done to rule out any chromosomal abnormalities affecting fertility.\n6. Testing for various conditions: Your doctor may suggest testing you and your husband for conditions like polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS), thyroid disorders, and other factors that could impact fertility.\n\nAfter treating your husband's infection, there is no guarantee of conceiving immediately. However, resolving his infection may contribute to potentially improving your chances of becoming pregnant. It's important to consult your healthcare professional for advice on your personal situation."}

However, it is important to note that there are other potential causes for these symptoms, so it is always best to consult with your doctor for an accurate diagnosis. If your symptoms persist or worsen, be sure to follow up with your healthcare provider for further evaluation."}

It commonly presents with white, curd-like lesions that may be painful or cause discomfort when eating or swallowing. However, in some cases, thrush may leave behind an uncomfortable texture on the oral mucosa even after treatment.\n\nOther potential causes of a rough texture on the roof of the mouth include:\n\n1. Oral lichen planus: This is a chronic inflammatory condition that can cause white, lacy, or smooth patches on the oral mucosa. In some cases, it can also present with a rough, sandpapery texture.\n2. Burns or trauma: If you have accidentally burned or traumatized the roof of your mouth, it could cause a rough, sandpaper-like feeling for a few days or weeks.\n3. Dry mouth: A lack of saliva can lead to a rough, dry feeling on the roof of the mouth. Dry mouth can be caused by various medications, medical conditions, or lifestyle factors.\n4. Vitamin deficiencies: Deficiencies in vitamins like B12, iron, or folic acid can sometimes lead to a rough texture on the roof of the mouth.\n5. Leukoplakia: This is a benign oral condition characterized by the development of white or gray plates on the oral mucosa. Leukoplakia can present with a rough, sandpaper-like surface, although it typically does not cause pain or discomfort.\n\nIf you're concerned about the rough texture on the roof of your mouth, it's best to consult with your dentist or healthcare provider.

Hope I have answered your query. Let me know if I can assist you further.", "ai": " I'm not a doctor, but I can try to provide some general information based on the symptoms and test results you have shared. The watery and green stools in your son, especially with the recent addition of pus cells and mucous in the stool test report, could be signs of a possible side effect of Omeprazole or an underlying condition related to the silent reflux.\n\n1. Omeprazole side effects: One potential side effect of Omeprazole is diarrhea. However, the persistent watery, green stools, along with the presence of pus cells and mucous in the stool, can indicate a more serious issue. It would be best to consult with your healthcare provider to discuss alternative treatments for your son's silent reflux, as Omeprazole may not be the best option for him.\n\n2. Underlying conditions: The symptoms your son is experiencing and the test results may suggest a possible infection, such as a bacterial or parasitic infection. Since silent reflux does not always cause obvious symptoms, it may be worth considering whether there could be an underlying infection contributing to his condition. Your healthcare provider can discuss appropriate tests to rule out any infections and recommend an appropriate treatment plan.\n\n3. Diet modifications: Making dietary changes can help relieve symptoms and make stools more solid. Consider eliminating potential irritants such as cow's milk, soy, eggs, and wheat from your son's diet temporarily to observe if there is any improvement. In addition, increasing the amount of solid foods in his diet, especially rice cereal and bananas, can help make his stools more formed.\n\n4. Probiotics: Probiotics may help maintain a healthy balance of beneficial bacteria in the gut and improve digestion. Although not a cure, they may provide some relief to your son's diarrhea symptoms. Consult with your healthcare provider about using probiotics suitable for infants.\n\n5. Frequent feedings: Maintaining a frequent feeding schedule can help your son better manage his reflux and improve bowel movements. This may also help with constipation, which can make the stools watery.\n\nIt's important to discuss these concerns with your healthcare provider as soon as possible to ensure that your son receives an accurate diagnosis and appropriate treatment. They may recommend additional tests or consultations with a specialist to address the underlying cause of his symptoms."}

Sebaceous gland hyperplasia is a non-cancerous overgrowth of the sebaceous gland, which produces oil for the skin. It often appears as a small, yellow or white, raised bump with a visible pore. The clear liquid discharge might be sebum or oil.\n\nA cyst, on the other hand, is a closed pocket filled with fluid, pus, or other material that can occur anywhere in the body. Cysts can be caused by various factors, including bacterial infections, clogged pores, or trauma. They may be tender, painful, or painless, and they can range in size.\n\nRegardless of the exact cause, if you're concerned about the bump or if it's causing you distress, I would recommend speaking with a healthcare professional, such as a dermatologist or a family doctor. They can examine the bump and help determine the cause, and recommend appropriate treatment if necessary.\n\nTreatment options for a sebaceous gland hyperplasia might include topical creams, such as retinoids or salicylic acid, or surgical removal. Treatment for a cyst may depend on its cause and size, and could include antibiotics for bacterial infections, drainage for abscesses, or surgical removal.\n\nIt's important to remember that everyone's body is different, and what's normal for one person might not be normal for another. If you have concerns about a persistent bump or discharge, it's always best to speak with a healthcare professional. They can help answer your questions and put your mind at ease."}

A mole on the gums is not an uncommon finding, especially in children. The presence of a mole does not necessarily indicate a dental problem or cause toothache. However, I would recommend making an appointment with a dental specialist, such as a pediatric dentist or an oral surgeon, to have the mole checked out. They will be best equipped to evaluate the mole and determine if any further action, such as removal, is necessary based on its size, appearance, and location. In the meantime, you can help alleviate any discomfort your daughter is experiencing by having her practice good oral hygiene, including brushing her teeth gently twice a day and flossing daily.

I can only imagine how difficult and emotional this experience must be for you.\n\nOvarian cysts are common and many women will experience them at some point in their lives. Most cysts are benign and do not cause any issues with fertility. However, if you have large cysts or cysts that cause pain or other symptoms, they may interfere with ovulation or implantation of a fertilized egg.\n\nEndometriosis is a chronic condition that affects the reproductive system. It can cause pain, inflammation, and scarring, which can make it difficult to conceive. In some cases, endometriosis can lead to infertility.\n\nIf you have not already, I would recommend speaking with your healthcare provider about your symptoms and your goals for starting a family.

You need an Urgent Surgery to see the damage and repair the intestines , and hernia.", "ai": " I'm not a doctor, but I can try to help you understand some possible causes of redness and heat around the navel based on the information you've provided. Let's discuss a few possibilities:\n\n1. Hernia: Although you mentioned that your hernia went away 13 months ago, it's still important to consider this condition as a potential cause, especially if it recurs without prior warning. If the redness, heat, and tenderness are localized to the hernia area, it could be a sign of an incarcerated or strangulated hernia. The former occurs when the intestine gets trapped in the hernia, while the latter is a more serious condition where blood flow to the intestine is cut off.\n2. Infection: Infections, such as peri-umbilical cellulitis (an infection of the skin and fat around the navel), can result in redness, heat, and tenderness around the navel.\n3. Irritation or injury: Direct contact with irritants or injury to the navel area could lead to redness and heat. It's essential to consider if you've recently had any contact with harsh chemicals or abrasion.\n4. Other possible causes: Redness and heat around the navel can also be attributed to less common conditions such as inflammatory bowel disease or an underlying medical condition like diabetes.\n\nAs your symptoms have recently developed, it's crucial that you consult a healthcare professional to determine the cause and appropriate treatment. They may conduct a physical exam and order additional tests, as needed. If you suspect the symptoms are related to a hernia, your doctor may recommend an ultrasound, CT scan, or other diagnostic procedures to assess the situation. Until then, try to avoid straining or lifting heavy objects and wear loose-fitting clothing around the affected area to minimize discomfort."}

At 18 years age, you are too young to judge the size of  your penis. It is made up of muscles and the growth at puberty and adolescent is under the influence of testosterone. A research study was done in healthy Indian males on penis size during flaccid and erect and the width of the penis. Mean flaccid length was found to be 8.21 cm, mean stretched length 10.88 cm and circumference 9.14 cm. Mean erected length was found to be 13.01 cm and erected circumference was 11.46 cm. If your penis measurements are at least as mentioned above then there is no need to worry.Semen flowing with urine is a misconception in most men at your age. If you feel it is present then it needs to be evaluated after clinical examination with the urologist. Any urine infection must also be ruled out.", "ai": " I'm here to help answer any questions you may have to the best of my ability. However, it's important to note that I cannot provide advice on how to increase penis size or address the issue of sperm mixed with urine without a thorough medical examination. These issues are often complex and can be caused by various underlying health conditions, so it's essential that you consult with a healthcare professional for accurate information and treatment options.\n\nAs for your concerns about premature ejaculation, this is a common issue, especially among young men. There are several things you can try to help improve control over ejaculation, such as:\n\n1. Pelvic floor exercises: These exercises can help strengthen the muscles that control ejaculation and improve sexual function. You can learn how to do these exercises from a healthcare professional or by doing some online research.\n2. Techniques for delaying ejaculation: There are various techniques that can help you learn to control when you ejaculate, such as the \"squeeze\" technique and \"stop-start\" technique. These methods involve learning to recognize the signs of approaching ejaculation and then taking steps to delay it.\n3. Communication with your partner: Discussing your concerns with your partner and working together to find solutions can be beneficial. They may be able to provide emotional support and help you feel more relaxed during sexual activity, making it easier to last longer.\n4. Medication: In some cases, medication may be prescribed to help manage premature ejaculation. Your healthcare provider can advise whether this is a suitable option for you.\n5. Therapy: In some cases, underlying psychological issues may be contributing to premature ejaculation. Speaking with a therapist can help you identify and address these issues.\n\nIt's important to remember that sexual function and size are not the only markers of overall health and wellbeing. Focusing too much on these concerns can lead to unnecessary stress and anxiety, so be sure to take care of yourself in other ways as well. Regular exercise, a healthy diet, and adequate sleep can all contribute to better sexual health and overall wellbeing.\n\nRegarding your question about sperm flowing with urine, this is a condition called retrograde ejaculation, which occurs when semen is released backwards into the bladder rather than out of the body during ejaculation. This is a common condition and is usually not a cause for concern, but it can be a symptom of other underlying medical conditions, so it's important to have it checked out by a healthcare professional if you're concerned.\n\nI hope this information is helpful. I wish you all the best in addressing your concerns and improving your sexual health and wellbeing. If you have any further questions, please don't hesitate to ask."}

Jock itch, or Tinea cruris, is a common fungal infection that affects the groin area. The black-colored rash you're experiencing could be due to scratching or friction, which can cause blood to pool and give the appearance of a bruise or dark discoloration.\n\nFirst, I would recommend avoiding the use of anti-dandruff shampoo in the groin area, as it may contain harsh ingredients that could irritate the skin or disrupt the natural balance of your body's microbiome. Instead, use a gentle, anti-fungal cream or ointment specifically formulated for treating jock itch. Some common active ingredients in these products include clotrimazole, miconazole, or terbinafine.\n\nHere are some steps you can take to help treat your jock itch:\n\n1. Keep the area clean: Wash the affected area daily with mild soap and warm water. Gently pat dry with a clean towel.\n2. Use a fungicidal powder: Apply a powder such as talcum or cornstarch to the area to help keep it dry and prevent friction.\n3. Apply an antifungal cream: Apply the anti-fungal cream or ointment twice daily, as directed by the label or your healthcare provider. Be sure to cover the entire affected area, including the inner thighs.\n4. Wear loose-fitting clothing: Avoid tight-fitting underwear, jeans, or other clothing that can trap moisture and promote the growth of the fungus.\n5. Practice good hygiene: Wash your underwear, towels, and bed sheets in hot water to kill any remaining fungus.\n6. Avoid sharing personal items: Do not share towels, athletic equipment, or other personal items that can spread the fungus from person to person.\n\nIf your symptoms do not improve after a few weeks of treatment, or if they worsen, seek medical advice from a healthcare provider. They may be able to prescribe a more potent antifungal medication or provide other treatments to help you get rid of the infection."}

A biopsy is a medical procedure in which a small sample of tissue is removed from the body for laboratory analysis. It's often used to help diagnose various conditions, including unknown bumps or growths in the liver. However, the decision to perform a liver biopsy depends on several factors, such as the size and number of the growths, the results of imaging tests, and the patient's overall health.\n\nRegarding your specific situation, since the bumps or growths are described as \"unknown\" and not typical cancer or non-cancer bumps, a biopsy may be necessary to make a definitive diagnosis. However, the absence of a portal vein in your liver might complicate the procedure and increase the risk of complications. Your healthcare provider would need to assess the risks and benefits of a liver biopsy in your case and discuss other potential diagnostic options with you.\n\nIt's important to note that while I have provided some general information about liver biopsies and the consideration of such a procedure, only a qualified healthcare professional can provide you with accurate information based on your individual medical situation. I would recommend consulting with your healthcare provider for personalized advice and recommendations."}

{"question": "Thin walled gallbladder, intense shadowing mobile echoes in lumen. Treatment?Hi I'm 37 y/o. I was examined in upper abdomen. Results was the gallbladder is normal in size and configuration.  The wall is not thickened.  There are about three intense shadowing mobile echoes in the lumen, the largest measuring is 8mm. The common bile duct and intrahepatic ducts are unremarkable. Is there is medicine intake to dissolve it?", "human": "Hi,Thanks for writing in hcm.From the description which you have given the diagnosis seems to be gall stones. You can try dissolution treament provided the stones are soft and do not exhibit post acoustic shadowing which your report does not mention. If this fails then the treatment in symptomatic cases is cholecystectomy.Regards", "ai": " Based on the information you have provided, the findings on your ultrasound scan suggest the presence of gallstones in your gallbladder. Gallstones are small, hard deposits that can form in the gallbladder and are common, especially in older adults and people with certain health conditions.\n\nThe treatment for gallstones depends on their size and number, as well as any symptoms you may be experiencing. In some cases, small gallstones cause no symptoms and do not require treatment. However, larger stones or stones that cause symptoms, such as abdominal pain, may require intervention.\n\nIf you are experiencing symptoms, your doctor may recommend medication to help dissolve the gallstones, or they may recommend surgical removal of the gallbladder. Gallbladder removal (cholecystectomy) is a common procedure used to treat gallstones, and it can be performed using laparoscopic surgery, which is a minimally invasive procedure.\n\nThe medication used to dissolve gallstones is called ursodeoxycholic acid (UDCA). It works by breaking down the cholesterol in the gallstones, allowing them to pass through the bile duct and be eliminated from the body. UDCA can take several months to dissolve larger gallstones, and not all gallstones can be completely dissolved with this medication.\n\nIf you are experiencing symptoms, such as severe abdominal pain, jaundice, or fever, you should contact your doctor right away for further evaluation and treatment. If you have small stones with no symptoms, your doctor may recommend keeping an eye on them and having regular follow-up ultrasound scans to monitor their size and number.\n\nYou should also ask your doctor about any dietary modifications or lifestyle changes that can help prevent gallstones from forming in the future. These may include avoiding foods high in saturated and trans fats, maintaining a healthy weight, and staying hydrated."}

However, it is essential that you consult with a healthcare professional for an accurate diagnosis. The symptoms you describe may be associated with the following conditions:\n\n1. Kidney Stones: Kidney stones can cause severe pain, often described as a sharp, cramping sensation. A moving lump may be due to the stone's position shifting within the kidney.\n2. Urinary Tract Infection (UTI): UTIs can cause pain in the kidney area, along with other symptoms such as fever, chills, and frequent urination. However, a lump is not typically a symptom of a UTI.\n3. Renal Cysts: Renal cysts are fluid-filled sacs that can develop in the kidneys. They can be painless but may cause pain if they rupture or grow significantly in size. A moving lump could be due to the cyst's size or position.\n4. Kidney Cancer: While rare, kidney cancer can cause a lump or mass in the kidney, and this, combined with kidney pain, could be a symptom. However, kidney cancer typically does not present with bright yellow urine, so this symptom may not be related to kidney cancer.\n5. Other Conditions: Other conditions that could cause kidney pain and a moving lump include pyelonephritis, nephritis, and other kidney diseases.\n\nIt is important that you consult with your healthcare provider to determine the underlying cause of your symptoms. They may recommend imaging tests, such as an ultrasound or CT scan, to help diagnose the cause of your pain and lump. Bright yellow urine can be a sign of dehydration, but given your other symptoms, it's best to have a professional evaluation."}

The lymph nodes in this area are called the submandibular and submental nodes, and they help to filter lymph and remove potential infections from the salivary glands, neck, and head.\n\nThe presence of lymph nodes in this area is not unusual, and it is not uncommon for people to feel them or notice them, especially when they are swollen or tender. Swelling or soreness of the lymph nodes can be caused by various factors, including infection, inflammation, or trauma.\n\nIf you are experiencing persistent or severe soreness or swelling of the lymph nodes under your jaw or chin, it is a good idea to speak with your healthcare provider. They can help determine the cause of the swelling and recommend appropriate treatment, if necessary.\n\nIt is important to note that while the presence of swollen lymph nodes in this area is usually not a cause for concern, they can sometimes be a sign of a more serious condition, such as cancer. However, the risk of cancer in young, healthy adults like yourself is relatively low.\n\nIf you are worried about your lymph nodes, it is a good idea to avoid touching or manipulating them excessively, as this can cause unnecessary discomfort and potentially introduce bacteria, leading to an infection. Instead, practice good oral hygiene, including brushing and flossing regularly, to help keep the salivary glands and surrounding tissue healthy and reduce the risk of infection."}

Regards,Dr. Khushboo Priya", "ai": " I am an assistant and not a doctor, but I can try to provide you with some general information that may help you in your decision-making process regarding planning a pregnancy while living with epilepsy. Please keep in mind that it is crucial to consult your healthcare provider about your individual situation.\n\n1. Stability of seizure control: The most important factor in considering pregnancy while having epilepsy is the stability of your seizure control. In general, it is recommended to maintain seizure freedom for at least one year before trying to conceive. However, the specific recommendations can vary depending on the type, frequency, and severity of seizures, as well as the individual's response to treatment.\n\n2. Medication safety during pregnancy: It is essential to discuss the safety of your current medication(s) with your healthcare provider, as some epilepsy medications can increase the risk of birth defects or other complications during pregnancy. Your provider may suggest adjusting your medication regimen to ensure the best possible outcome for both you and your future baby.\n\n3. Risk vs. benefits: It's important to weigh the risks and benefits of having a baby at that point in your life. While it's understandable that family pressure can be high, it's essential to consider your personal health, the potential impact on your seizure control, and the wellbeing of a future child.\n\n4. Prenatal care and regular check-ups: Prenatal care and regular check-ups are critical during pregnancy for both the mother and the unborn child. Regular communication with your healthcare provider about your epilepsy, medication, and seizure history will help ensure close monitoring throughout the pregnancy and delivery.\n\n5. Emotional support: The decision to start a family can be emotionally challenging, especially for those living with a chronic condition like epilepsy. Seek the support of your loved ones, your healthcare provider, and support groups to help you navigate this decision and cope with any stress or concerns that may arise.\n\nIn conclusion, I strongly advise consulting with your healthcare provider before making any decisions regarding pregnancy. They can review your medical history, current seizure control, available medications, and specific risks, helping you make the best choice for your individual situation."}

Eczema can occur anywhere on the body, including the torso, face, and arms.\n2. Allergic Reactions: Food allergies or reactions to certain materials like detergents, soaps, or fabrics can cause rashes. Since there's no mentioned fever or itchiness, it's less likely to be an allergic reaction, but it's still a potential cause.\n3. Viral Infections: Viral infections like Fifth Disease or Roseola can cause a rash that may look like pinpricks or small raised bumps, sometimes accompanied by a low-grade fever. These infections are usually accompanied by other symptoms, such as a runny nose, cough, or sore throat.\n4. Heat Rash: A heat rash occurs when the skin becomes irritated due to excessive sweating and overheating. It's more common in hot, humid weather and can cause red, prickly spots or small blisters.\n5. Food Sensitivities: While true food allergies are rare, food sensitivities can cause skin rashes. Common culprits include dairy, eggs, soy, wheat, and nuts.\n\nYou should consult your pediatrician for a proper evaluation and diagnosis.

Yes it can cause pacemaker malfunction. So its advisable to get it checked and if required programmed again.Take Care", "ai": " Placing a strong magnet near a pacemaker or implantable cardioverter-defibrillator (ICD) can disrupt the device's normal functioning. The magnetic field produced by the magnet can cause the pacemaker or ICD to deliver inappropriate paces or shocks, which can be harmful to the patient. The degree of interference and potential harm depends on several factors, including the strength of the magnetic field, the proximity and duration of exposure, and the specific type of device.\n\nIf you accidentally exposed your pacemaker or ICD to a strong magnet for a few hours, it could have caused temporary or even permanent damage, depending on the factors mentioned above. Some devices may resume normal functioning once the magnet is removed, while others may require reprogramming or replacement. However, it is crucial to have your device checked by a healthcare professional as soon as possible to assess the extent of any damage and to ensure your safety.\n\nSymptoms of pacemaker or ICD malfunction after magnetic exposure may include:\n\n* Skipped beats, palpitations, or tachycardia (rapid heart rate)\n* Shortness of breath or breathing difficulties\n* Chest pain or discomfort\n* Lightheadedness, dizziness, or syncope (fainting)\n* Unusual sensor readings (if applicable)\n\nIf you're concerned about magnetic interference with your pacemaker or ICD, it's best to avoid placing strong magnets near the device.

If you are concerned about your symptoms, it is recommended that you consult a healthcare professional for an accurate diagnosis and appropriate treatment.\n\nAs for your issue with controlling your masturbation habit, it's important to remember that everyone's relationship with sexual activity is unique. While it's normal to have sex drives and urges, compulsive or excessive behavior can impact your daily life and relationships. If you feel that your masturbation habit is causing distress or negatively affecting your personal or professional life, you may benefit from seeking support from a mental health professional or sex therapist. They can help you identify the underlying causes of your behavior and develop strategies to manage your sexual urges in a healthy and balanced way."}

Wondering if this could be apple allergy. Could never eat apples due to swelling lips and tongue but can eat them off our tree with none of that but now has rash", "human": "YES ACCORDINGLY APPLE ALLERGY AS ANYTHING CA REACT AT ANY TIME SUDDENLY SO CAN USE ANTI ALLERGICS FOR 3 WK TO CLEAR THIS APPLY ANTIALLERGIC CREAM LOCALLYAND AVOID IT IN FUTURE TO PREVENT ALLERY IN FUTURE", "ai": " While it is possible that your husband could be experiencing an allergic reaction to apples, the symptoms you have described (rash on the feet, chest, and arms) are more consistent with a type of skin reaction, rather than an allergic reaction limited to the oral cavity.\n\nAllergic reactions to apples typically involve symptoms such as itching or tingling in the mouth, lips, and throat, swelling of the lips, tongue, and throat, difficulty breathing, and hives. If your husband has a history of allergic reactions involving these symptoms when consuming apples, then it is certainly worth considering that he may have an apple allergy. However, if the primary symptom is a skin rash, it may be worth exploring other potential causes, such as contact dermatitis (an allergy to a substance that comes into direct contact with the skin, such as latex, metals, or certain plants), or an infection or other medical condition.\n\nIf your husband's symptoms are causing concern, it would be best for him to see a healthcare professional for an evaluation. The healthcare professional can help determine the underlying cause of the symptoms and recommend appropriate treatment options. It's important to note that self-diagnosis can be risky, and it's always best to consult a healthcare professional for advice on medical conditions."}
{"question": "How to increase my serum albumin levels?I have just had a blood test that showed that I have serum albumin at 33g/l. I had the test because I'm on ppi's for acid reflux and had heard that prolonged use of these drugs caused other issues. I have very low B12, 51ng/l and have started a course of injections. But looking at my test results I see that my serum albmin is also low. No one has mentioned this to me. What do I do about improving the levels?", "human": "Dear I read your scenario .PPI do nothing to your albumine .just take Aminoleban infusion which will maintain your albumin level. After taking this infusion then repeat the serum albumin it should be in the normal range .you should take food rich in protein.hope you get well soon if you any problem regarding this then you can ask me otherwise you should go to concern doctor near toyou. thanks.", "ai": " Serum albumin is a protein produced by the liver that helps maintain oncotic pressure in the blood and transport various substances throughout the body. A low serum albumin level (hypoalbuminemia) can be caused by several factors, including liver disease, malnutrition, chronic inflammation, and certain medications (such as diuretics and PPIs).\n\nIn your case, since you are on long-term PPI therapy and have a low serum albumin level, here are some suggestions to help boost your albumin levels:\n\n1. Eat a well-balanced and nutritious diet with a focus on adequate protein intake. Aim for approximately 1.2-1.5 grams of protein per kilogram of body weight each day. If you find it challenging to get enough protein from food alone, consider adding high-protein supplements to your diet under the guidance of your healthcare provider.\n2. Consider reducing or tapering off your PPI medication under the supervision of your doctor. Since prolonged use of PPIs has been linked to low serum albumin levels, it's essential to discuss this issue with your doctor and explore alternative options, such as proton pump inhibitor (PPI) holidays or alternative treatments for acid reflux that don't involve PPIs.\n3. Address any nutritional deficiencies, particularly B12, to help improve overall health and boost albumin production. Maintain a consistent injection schedule for your B12 injections and report any inconsistencies or issues to your healthcare provider.\n4. Manage any underlying health conditions that could contribute to low serum albumin levels, such as chronic inflammation or liver disease. Ensure you follow a personalized treatment plan provided by your doctor.\n5. Refrain from smoking and limit alcohol consumption, as both habits can contribute to liver damage and decreased albumin production.\n6. Stay hydrated and ensure you consume sufficient fluids daily to help maintain an adequate volume of blood plasma, which carries albumin.\n7. Consult your doctor about any medications you are taking that may be contributing to low serum albumin levels, as there might be alternative treatments or dosages that could help mitigate the side effects.\n8. Regularly follow up with your healthcare provider to monitor your serum albumin levels and address any concerns or adjust treatment plans accordingly."}
{"question": "Is pregnancy,related with frequent urination,nausea and enlarged breast?My husband had a vasectomy 4 years ago for the past 2 weeks I have had pregnancy symptoms including urinating a lot, tender and enlarged breasts, feeling nauseous and now my period is 2 days late. I took a test last week it was negative.  I have a slight white discharge. Could I be pregnant?", "human": "Hello, and I hope I can help you today.Pregnancy symptoms vary widely between women, and the symptoms of irregular hormones (which can also delay your period) are very similar to the symptoms of pregnancy.  Women sometimes don't ovulate at the same time as usual, and other factors, such as weight changes, travel, and stress, can also make your cycle abnormal.Furthermore, in your particular case, your husband has been sterilized.  And you had a pregnancy test that was negative, which is just as accurate as the ones in a doctor's office.So I think you do not have to worry about being pregnant.To be totally secure about your husband's sterility, he could get a sperm count done to make sure the vasectomy worked, if you would find that reassuring.I hope I was able to adequately answer your question today and that my advice was helpful.Best wishes,Dr. Brown", "ai": " It is important to note that I am an AI language model and cannot diagnose or provide medical advice. I can, however, help you understand the symptoms you have described and when to seek medical assistance.\n\nThe symptoms you have described, such as frequent urination, tender and enlarged breasts, feeling nauseous, and a late menstrual period, are common symptoms of pregnancy. However, these symptoms can also be caused by other conditions, such as hormonal imbalances or urinary tract infections.\n\nAdditionally, a negative pregnancy test does not necessarily rule out pregnancy, especially if it was taken too early in the cycle. It is recommended to wait until a week after a missed period before taking a pregnancy test for accurate results.\n\nYou also mentioned a slight white discharge. If this discharge is accompanied by itching, burning, or a foul smell, it may be a sign of a bacterial infection, such as a yeast infection or a urinary tract infection.\n\nIf you are concerned about your symptoms, it is recommended to speak with a healthcare professional for a proper evaluation. They can conduct tests to rule out or confirm a pregnancy and other potential causes of your symptoms. It is important to seek medical advice if you are experiencing persistent or severe symptoms or if you have concerns about your health or that of a potential pregnancy."}

Hope I have answered your question, if you have doubt then I will be happy to answer. Thanks for using health care magic. Wish you a very good health.", "ai": " I'm an AI language model and not a doctor, but I can try to help you understand the information related to your question. Myonate Cellcept (mycophenolate mofetil) is a commonly used immunosuppressive drug for the treatment of various autoimmune diseases including Systemic Lupus Erythematosus (SLE) and Immune Thrombocytopenia Purpura (ITP).\n\nIt's important to note that the diagnosis of SLE can sometimes be challenging, and the involvement of multiple specialists, including rheumatologists, hematologists, and nephrologists, is often necessary. Based on the information you provided, your son's case seems complex, as some doctors suspect SLE, while others suggest Chronic ITP.\n\nAs for the safety of taking Cellcept for SLE, numerous studies suggest that mycophenolate mofetil is an effective and relatively safe treatment option for SLE, especially when used in combination with other immunosuppressive drugs and/or corticosteroids. Mycophenolate mofetil has shown significant benefits in decreasing disease activity and improving clinical outcomes in SLE patients, particularly in those who have not responded well to conventional therapies.\n\nWith regards to your son's treatment, I would recommend consulting a rheumatologist or a specialist in the field of autoimmune diseases for a thorough evaluation. They might run additional tests to confirm the diagnosis or rule out other possibilities. Once a definitive diagnosis is made, they'll be able to provide personalized treatment recommendations, including the use of Cellcept and other medications.\n\nAs for where to take your son for further treatment, I would suggest consulting a renowned hospital or medical center with a strong focus on autoimmune diseases. These institutions often have specialized teams of doctors and researchers dedicated to the diagnosis and treatment of SLE and related conditions. Some possible options include:\n\n1. Johns Hopkins Arthritis Center – Baltimore, MD, USA\n2. Mayo Clinic – Rochester, MN, USA\n3. Cleveland Clinic – Cleveland, OH, USA\n4. National Institute of Arthritis and Musculoskeletal and Skin Diseases (NIAMS) - Bethesda, MD, USA\n\nThese institutions are globally recognized for their expertise in autoimmune diseases and have extensive experience in managing complex cases. Remember to consult with your primary doctor or insurance provider to determine the feasibility of traveling to these institutions for treatment.\n\nLastly, regarding your daughter's treatment, it's important that her condition is closely monitored by her healthcare team. Regular follow-up appointments and check-ups are essential to ensure her SLE is well controlled and to address any potential complications or side effects of her treatment.\n\nI hope this information is helpful. If you have any further questions, feel free to ask! As always, I would recommend consulting a healthcare professional for any medical concerns and not relying solely on information provided online."}

{"question": "Being Asthmatic, what can excessive phlegm despite clear chest X-ray indicate?I am asthmatic, and have severe allergies. I have had this of an on bout with excess mucus that causes me to cough so bad I gag. It is a sporadic thing too. I am filling cups with it. I got a chest xray and lungs were clear. I have gone to er and doc and they said it is probably an ENT thing. I hope so because it is so irritating.", "human": "Hello.Thank you for asking at HCM.I went through your history and would like to make following suggestions to you:1. Chest X-ray is usually clear in asthma and it is a good sign for you.2. I would agree with your doctor as common cause of excessive phlegm in allergy patients is sinusitis, which is an ENT thing.3. Of course, sinusitis requires patience while treatment. I usually suggest my such patients regular intranasal corticosteroids for 2-3 weeks, regular montelukast and regular steam inhalation.4. I also suggest my such patients plenty of warm fluids during day, a healthy diet and avoidance of dusts, smokes and air pollution as much as possible.5. Personally, I would also suggest you allergy testing which will help you identify your allergies and the measures to avoid them.Hope above suggestions will be helpful to you.Should you have any further query, please feel free to ask at HCM.Wish you the best of the health.Thank you & Regards.", "ai": " Excessive phlegm or mucus production despite a clear chest X-ray in an asthmatic patient can indicate several conditions other than a simple upper respiratory tract infection or seasonal allergies. Here are a few possibilities:\n\n1. Postnasal drip: It could be due to an excess mucus production in the sinuses that drains down the back of the throat, causing irritation and coughing. This is often referred to as postnasal drip. You might want to consider seeing an ENT specialist for a thorough examination of your nose and sinuses.\n\n2. Gastroesophageal Reflux Disease (GERD): Asthmatics have an increased risk of GERD due to their weakened esophageal sphincter and frequent use of medications like inhaled corticosteroids, which can relax the lower esophageal sphincter. GERD causes the stomach acids to flow back into the esophagus, causing irritation and phlegm production.\n\n3. Chronic bronchitis: Excessive phlegm production could also be a sign of chronic bronchitis, which is characterized by a long-term cough with phlegm. Asthma and chronic bronchitis can coexist, making it important for your healthcare provider to differentiate between the two conditions.\n\n4. Asthma-associated bronchiectasis: Bronchiectasis is a condition where the airways in the lungs become damaged and widen, making it easier for mucus to collect and be difficult to expel leading to chronic cough and phlegm production. In some cases, asthma can cause bronchiectasis due to chronic inflammation and infections.\n\n5. Allergic bronchopulmonary mycosis (ABPM): ABPM is a condition where an allergic reaction causes fungal growth in the respiratory system, leading to chronic inflammation, excessive mucus production, and persistent cough. This condition is uncommon, but it is worth considering if other causes have been ruled out.\n\n6. Medications: Certain medications, such as ACE inhibitors and beta-blockers, can cause mucus production. If you have recently started any new medications, discuss this with your healthcare provider.\n\n7. Smoke and environmental exposure: Exposure to smoke and other environmental irritants can worsen asthma symptoms, including increased mucus production. Try to identify any potential triggers and avoid them as much as possible.\n\nIt is essential to work closely with your healthcare provider to find the cause of your excessive phlegm production. Although it may be an ENT issue, it is crucial to investigate other potential causes to ensure appropriate treatment."}

It is important to have it checked out by a healthcare professional to rule out any potential underlying conditions.\n\nThere are several possible causes of toe numbness, some of which are harmless and some of which are more serious. These include:\n\n1. Peripheral neuropathy: This is a type of nerve damage that can affect the feet and toes. It can be caused by various underlying conditions, including diabetes, alcoholism, and certain medications.\n2. Pinched nerve: A pinched nerve in the foot can cause numbness, tingling, or pain in one or more toes. This can be caused by wearing tight shoes or by having a foot structure that puts pressure on the nerve.\n3. Injury: Injury to the toe or nerve can cause numbness. This can include bruising, fractures, dislocations, or other injuries.\n4. Poor circulation: Poor circulation in the legs and feet can cause numbness and tingling. This can be caused by conditions such as peripheral artery disease, varicose veins, or deep vein thrombosis.\n5.

Infections (bacterial, viral, or parasitic): These are the most common causes of diarrhea in children. Infections might come from contaminated water or food, or contact with an infected person. Rotavirus and norovirus are common viruses that cause diarrhea in infants and young children.\n\n2. Food intolerances or allergies: Lactose intolerance, as your child's doctor mentioned, is a common cause of diarrhea in infants. Intolerances to other foods, such as soy, wheat, or dairy products, can also lead to diarrhea.\n\n3. Malabsorption conditions: Your child's healthcare provider mentioned that your son may not be absorbing water in his bowels. This could be due to specific malabsorption conditions, such as celiac disease or cystic fibrosis.\n\n4.

As far as my knowledge goes, Primolut should not be prescribed as a progesterone supplement during pregnancy. This can cause virilization of a female fetus if used at the stage of organogenesis. It can also adversely effect the differentiation of the male sex organs. There are other, safer progesterone supplements like Duphaston, that can be used when needed. Please check with your doctor once again if the drug has been correctly prescribed or not. Since you are spotting, it is essential to take absolute bed rest, avoid all stressful situations and have regular follow up to know the pregnancy status. If the cause of the previous pregnancy loss can be known, it would be more useful. Hope this helps.", "ai": " I cannot definitively answer your question as I am not a doctor and do not have all the necessary information about your specific situation. However, I can provide some general context about Primolut Depot (medroxyprogesterone acetate) and spotting during pregnancy.\n\nPrimolut Depot is a progestin hormone medication that is sometimes prescribed to women at risk of miscarriage due to a history of recurrent miscarriages or threatened miscarriages. It is used to support the pregnancy by thickening the uterine lining and promoting the continued growth of the fetus.\n\nSpotting during early pregnancy can have various causes, including hormonal changes, implantation, cervical irritation, or an underlying condition. In your case, your doctor may have considered the possibility of an underlying condition or recurrent miscarriage based on your history. The use of Primolut Depot may be part of a broader treatment plan aimed at improving the chances of a successful pregnancy.\n\nThat being said, the safety of Primolut Depot during pregnancy, especially in the early stages, is a matter of ongoing debate among healthcare professionals. Some studies suggest that its use may increase the risk of specific birth defects, such as cleft lip or palate, while other studies do not find such an association.\n\nIt is essential to discuss any concerns you have with your healthcare provider, as they can provide you with the most accurate and up-to-date information based on your specific situation. Your healthcare provider may also be able to recommend alternative treatments or monitor your pregnancy more closely to minimize any potential risks.\n\nUltimately, the decision to use Primolut Depot or any other medication during pregnancy should be made in consultation with your healthcare provider, based on the best available evidence and your individual circumstances. It is important to remember that every pregnancy is unique, and what may be the best course of action for one woman may not be suitable for another.\n\nI hope this information is helpful, and I wish you all the best in your pregnancy.

Regular physical activity: Your friend should aim for at least 30 minutes of moderate-intensity aerobic activity, such as brisk walking, most days of the week. He can also incorporate strength training exercises two or more days a week.\n5. Managing stress: High stress levels can contribute to high BP. Encourage your friend to find ways to manage stress, such as meditation, deep breathing, yoga, or other relaxation techniques.\n6. Limit alcohol: Alcohol can increase BP and make it harder to manage. Encourage your friend to limit his alcohol intake to no more than one drink per day (for men) or no more than half a drink per day (for women).\n7. Quit smoking: If your friend smokes, encourage him to quit. Smoking can damage the lining of the arterial walls, making it harder for blood to flow freely, and can increase BP.\n8. Manage cholesterol: If your friend has high cholesterol, encourage him to eat a healthy diet rich in fruits, vegetables, whole grains, lean proteins, and healthy fats. He may need to take medications to help lower his cholesterol levels.\n9. Regularly monitor BP: Your friend should regularly check his BP at home and record the readings to share with his healthcare provider. This will help the provider adjust medications as needed.\n10. Support network: Encourage your friend to join a support group for people with high BP. This can help him connect with others who are going through the same experience, learn new ways to manage his condition, and stay motivated.\n\nThese steps can help your friend manage his high BP, but it's important that he talks to his healthcare provider about what's best for his individual situation."}

However, I can suggest some precautions and general advice based on the information you have provided.\n\n1. Inhaled Concentrated Cleaning Solution: The inhalation of concentrated cleaning solutions can cause irritation to the respiratory system. Symptoms may include coughing, wheezing, shortness of breath, and chest pain. In your case, a sore throat could also be a symptom. If you have inhaled cleaning solution, remove yourself from the area immediately and ensure adequate ventilation. Drink plenty of water to help flush out the chemicals. If symptoms persist or worsen, seek medical attention.\n\n2. Sore Throat: A sore throat can have various causes, including chemical irritation from cleaning solutions, bacterial or viral infections, or other conditions.

I can provide you with some general information about non-related kidney transplants, hospitals that perform such transplants, and the required documents. However, please note that the specifics, including costs, may vary between hospitals and locations.\n\nNon-related kidney transplants, also known as living donor transplants from unrelated individuals, are more complex than related donor transplants. Usually, people turn to kidney transplant organizations, transplant centers, or living donor networks to find a suitable donor. These organizations often facilitate the matching process between donors and patients based on various factors such as blood type, size, and other health conditions.\n\nRegarding hospitals, some well-known transplant centers in the United States that offer non-related kidney transplants include:\n\n1. University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA) Medical Center: The UCLA Transplant Center is one of the busiest and most successful transplant programs in the world. They have a large volume of non-related kidney transplants.\n2. Johns Hopkins Hospital: The Johns Hopkins Transplant Center is a world-renowned transplant program with a focus on research, innovation, and advanced clinical care. They have a significant experience in non-related kidney transplants.\n3.

They have a high success rate in non-related kidney transplants.\n\nAs for the documentation and costs involved, it is important to note that these can vary significantly. Generally speaking, the required documentation includes:\n\n1. Medical records and reports\n2. Blood and urine test results\n3. X-rays, CT scans, and other imaging reports\n4. Proof of insurance coverage or ability to pay\n5. Identification documents (e.g., passport, driver's license)\n\nThe cost of a non-related kidney transplant can range from $200,000 to $600,000 or more, depending on various factors, such as the hospital, the specific medical requirements, and the length of your hospital stay. Keep in mind that transplant costs often include post-transplant care and medications.\n\nIt's essential to discuss the financial aspects and necessary documentation with the transplant center of your choice. They can provide you with the most accurate and up-to-date information.\n\nI hope this information helps you on your journey. If you have any further questions, please don't hesitate to ask."}

Bile duct complications: The bile ducts can become inflamed or obstructed due to scarring or scar tissue formation, leading to pain in the right abdomen. This condition is known as post-cholecystectomy syndrome or bile duct injury. The pain may worsen in the afternoon due to increased digestive activity.\n2. Infections: Although a UTI (urinary tract infection) is less common after gallbladder removal, it is still a possibility, especially if you have symptoms like frequent urination, fever, or chills. However, based on your description, it seems more likely that the pain is related to your recent surgery.\n3. Incisional pain or hernia: Pain at the incision site or a hernia can cause right abdominal pain. This pain usually worsens with movement or pressure on the abdomen.\n4. Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS): IBS can cause abdominal pain and discomfort, particularly in the right side of the abdomen. Symptoms can be worsened by certain foods, stress, or physical activity.\n5.

They may recommend additional tests, such as an ultrasound, CT scan, or endoscopy, to help determine the underlying cause of your symptoms. In the meantime, you can try managing your symptoms with over-the-counter medications like ibuprofen or acetaminophen. Applying heat to your abdomen and avoiding spicy or greasy foods may also provide some relief."}
{"question": "Should I be worried about my SGOT and SGPT high levels? What are the diet suggestions?Hi doctor,My SGOT is 75 and SGPT is 145. I am not taking alcohol at all.

You should take low fat diet with high amount of protein and sugar. Avoid alcohol. Consult your doctor and start treatment according to cause.Hope I have answered your question, if you have any doubts then contact me at bit.ly/Drsanghvihardik, I will be happy to answer you.Thanks for using health care magic.Wish you a very good health.", "ai": " I am an artificial intelligence and I cannot diagnose or provide medical advice, but I can help you understand what SGOT and SGPT are and what their high levels might mean.\n\nSGOT (Serum Glutamate Oxaloacetate Transaminase) and SGPT (Serum Glutamate Pyruvate Transaminase) are enzymes found in the liver. Their levels in the blood can be indicators of liver function and damage. High levels of these enzymes can be a sign of liver disease, including hepatitis, cirrhosis, or other conditions that cause liver damage.\n\nHowever, the fact that you are not consuming alcohol should ease some concerns, as alcohol is a common cause of elevated SGOT and SGPT levels. It's also worth noting that your SGOT level is only slightly elevated, while your SGPT is moderately elevated.\n\nRegarding dietary suggestions, there are some foods that can help support liver health. Here are a few:\n\n1. Leafy green vegetables: These provide a good source of fiber, vitamin K, and antioxidants, which can help support liver function.\n2. Nuts and seeds: These are rich in healthy unsaturated fats, fiber, and antioxidants. Walnuts, in particular, have been shown to have liver-protective effects.\n3. Fruits, especially citrus fruits: Fruits provide essential nutrients, vitamins, and antioxidants, which can help protect the liver from damage.\n4. Beets: Beets contain betaine, a nutrient that helps support the liver and improve bile production.\n5. Lean protein: Consuming adequate protein is important for maintaining liver health, but try to limit saturated fat and processed meats.\n6. Water: Staying hydrated is important for overall health, and the liver plays a role in metabolizing water.\n\nIt's also important to avoid processed and sugary foods, as well as excessive consumption of alcohol and caffeine. If your liver enzymes remain elevated despite making lifestyle changes, it may be worth consulting a healthcare professional to rule out any underlying medical conditions."}

Wish you good health.RegardsDr SundarPsychiatrist", "ai": " I'm not a doctor, but I can try to help answer some of your questions based on the information provided. It is normal for people to have concerns about their health at times, especially as we age or if we have a family history of certain diseases. However, your constant fear of developing a disease, particularly at a young age and focusing on specific body parts, could be a sign of a psychiatric condition known as hypochondriasis or health anxiety.\n\nRegarding your concern about prostate cancer, prostate cancer is a disease that primarily affects older men, with the majority of cases being diagnosed after the age of 60. It is rare for someone your age to develop this condition. I would encourage you to try and focus on maintaining a healthy lifestyle which includes regular exercise, a balanced diet, adequate sleep, and avoiding harmful lifestyle habits such as smoking and excessive alcohol consumption.\n\nIf your anxiety is impacting your daily life and causing significant distress, it may be helpful to speak to a mental health professional such as a psychologist or counselor. They can help you develop coping strategies to manage your anxiety and provide you with the necessary resources and support. It is important to remember that anxiety is a treatable condition, and with the right support and intervention, you can learn to manage and reduce your symptoms.\n\nI hope this information is helpful.

{"question": "Suggest treatment for Lyme s diseasei am trying to find ut the range for ebv tests? i have blood work showing positive ana, positive ebv and 4 lyme disease band indicators...i have a spinal tap tomorrow and have not heard back from my doctor...is this lymes disease...what is the treatment?", "human": "HiLyme's disease is a bacterial infection , hence antibiotics are given for the treatment.Lyme disease is best treated in the early stages. Early treatment is a simple 14 to 21 day course of oral antibiotics. This can eliminate all traces of infection. Medications used to treat Lyme disease are:  1.  doxycycline for adults and children older than 8 years old   2.  cefuroxime and amoxicillin for adults, younger children, and women who are nursing or breast-feedingHope this information was of help.Thank you.", "ai": " Based on the information you have provided, it is important to note that a positive ANA (anti-nuclear antibody) test and a positive EBV (Epstein-Barr virus) test do not necessarily indicate Lyme disease. These tests can indicate the presence of other conditions or infections. The presence of 4 Lyme disease band indicators on your blood work is significant, but a definitive diagnosis of Lyme disease typically requires a reliable diagnostic test such as a Western blot or ELISA test on a specifically collected Lyme disease antibody sample, or preferably, a confirmed diagnosis by a healthcare provider based on clinical symptoms and response to antibiotic therapy.\n\nAs for the range for EBV tests, there isn't a specific \"range\" for EBV test results like there is for other laboratory tests, as normal values can vary from one laboratory to another. Your doctor will interpret your test results based on their clinical judgment and the context of your symptoms and overall health.\n\nRegarding Lyme disease treatment, if your doctor confirms a diagnosis, the usual treatment is a course of antibiotics, often for several weeks. The specific antibiotics and duration of treatment may depend on the severity of the disease and the patient's individual response. It's important to follow your doctor's instructions carefully and make sure to complete the entire course of antibiotics to ensure successful treatment. If you have any concerns about your treatment plan, it's best to discuss them with your healthcare provider.\n\nAs for your spinal tap, this procedure is typically used to diagnose certain types of infections, such as meningitis, or to monitor conditions like multiple sclerosis. In the context of Lyme disease, a spinal tap may be considered if there are signs of meningitis or other central nervous system involvement. Your doctor will be able to discuss the results of the spinal tap and any additional treatment options with you if necessary."}

There is fluctuation as you suggested, of the blood tests. I don't think your liver shows signs of trouble at this time. Continue to have blood checked for enzyme elevation(ast, alt) or presence of virus.", "ai": " Fluctuations in bilirubin levels after interferon therapy for hepatitis C can have various causes. While an elevation in direct bilirubin could be a sign of worsening liver function, other factors can also contribute to the fluctuation:\n\n1. Interferon treatment itself can cause transient increases in bilirubin levels due to hepatic injury or immune-mediated mechanisms.\n2. Concomitant medications used during treatment, such as acetaminophen or statins, can increase bilirubin levels.\n3. Underlying conditions like Gilbert's syndrome, a common condition affecting bilirubin metabolism, can result in intermittent elevations in bilirubin levels without any significant liver damage.\n4. Frequent or repeated blood testing can result in falsely elevated bilirubin levels due to hemolysis, the destruction of red blood cells, leading to an increase in unconjugated bilirubin.\n\nTo better understand the cause of the fluctuation in your bilirubin levels, you should discuss these possibilities with your healthcare provider and request further investigation, if necessary. They can consider ordering tests to assess liver function more comprehensively, evaluate concomitant medications, and discuss any symptoms you may be experiencing. Ultimately, ongoing monitoring and communication with your healthcare team will help ensure that any changes in your liver function are promptly detected and addressed."}

It's essential to check for these potential causes and manage them accordingly under the guidance of her healthcare provider.\n\n3. Aging process: Memory decline is a natural part of aging, and it can be more pronounced in the context of a previous thyroid condition.\n\n4. Medication interactions: Levothyroxine might interact with other medications she's taking, affecting its efficacy or absorption. Inform her healthcare provider about all current medications to rule out potential drug interactions.\n\n5. Inadequate dosage: If her healthcare provider decides to lower the dosage of Levothyroxine, it's possible that her thyroid function and memory recovery might not be optimally supported. Explore this option with her doctor to determine whether adjusting the dosage could be beneficial or consider alternative treatments if necessary.\n\n6. Psychological factors: Stress and emotional conditions can exacerbate memory loss. Addressing her emotional health and wellbeing can help support memory recovery.\n\n7. Post-surgical complications: Some cases might involve post-surgical complications, such as infections or other issues, that can delay memory recovery. Ensure her healthcare provider is well-informed about any complications that arise during this recovery period.\n\nSpeak with her healthcare provider to discuss her concerns and explore additional testing or treatment options to help support her memory recovery."}

Other possibilities include infections, hernias, or even a kidney stone. However, these are only possibilities based on the information provided, and only a healthcare professional can provide a definitive diagnosis.\n\nIf you are experiencing severe abdominal pain, especially with associated fever, loss of appetite, and vomiting, I strongly recommend you consult a healthcare provider immediately as these symptoms could be a sign of a serious condition that requires urgent medical attention. In the meantime, try to rest and minimize movement as much as possible to alleviate the discomfort.\n\nHere are some things you can try at home to provide relief:\n\n1. Apply a warm compress to the affected area to help reduce cramps and relax the muscles.\n2. Avoid consuming foods that may cause bloating or gas, such as beans, cabbage, broccoli, or carbonated beverages.\n3. Drink plenty of fluids, especially water, to help prevent dehydration due to vomiting or diarrhea.\n4. Try over-the-counter pain relievers like acetaminophen or ibuprofen as directed on the packaging, but be sure to consult with your healthcare provider before taking these medications, especially if you have chronic medical conditions or take other medications regularly.\n5. Eat small, frequent meals throughout the day to help minimize the discomfort associated with eating larger meals.\n6.

They are formed whenEndometriosis tissue grows on the ovarian surface and forms a cyst. These cysts do not typically dissolve or reduce in size on their own, as they are not fluid-filled follicles that normally develop and rupture during ovulation.\n\nHowever, there are treatments available to help manage chocolate cysts, including:\n\n1. Hormonal therapy: Hormonal medications, such as birth control pills, can help manage the symptoms of endometriosis and potentially shrink chocolate cysts. However, they do not often eliminate the cysts entirely.\n2. Surgical intervention: Laparoscopic surgery is the most effective treatment for chocolate cysts. During surgery, the cysts are removed along with any endometriotic tissue. This can provide long-term relief, but there is a risk of recurrence.\n\nIt's important to note that if you have a chocolate cyst and are experiencing pain or other symptoms, you should speak with your healthcare provider to discuss your treatment options. They can help you determine the best course of action based on the size and location of the cyst, as well as your overall health and personal preferences."}

Hope I have solved your query. I will be happy to help you further. Wish you good health. Thanks.", "ai": " It's important to note that I'm an AI language model and not a doctor, but I can suggest some possible causes for your breathing difficulty based on the information you've provided. These suggestions are not definitive and should not be relied upon for medical advice. Here are some common reasons for breathing difficulty, especially in your age group:\n\n1. Anxiety or stress: This is a common cause, especially in young people. When you're stressed or anxious, your body may respond by increasing your heart rate and breathing rate, making you feel like you're not getting enough air. This can be particularly noticeable if you're doing intense physical activity or preparing for a test or other stressful event.\n2. Asthma: Asthma is a chronic condition that can cause difficulty breathing, especially during physical activity or when exposed to certain triggers. It's important to note that you mentioned having a minor heart murmur when you were young, but asthma is not typically associated with heart conditions.\n3. Allergies: Allergies to environmental factors such as pollen, mold, pets, or food can cause difficulty breathing, especially during allergic episodes.\n4. Exercise-induced bronchoconstriction (EIB): EIB is a condition that can make it hard to breathe during or after physical activity. It is also known as exercise-induced asthma. This condition causes the airways to narrow, making it difficult to get enough air into your lungs.\n5. Structural issues: Structural issues with the rib cage, such as scoliosis, can make it difficult to breathe efficiently. Although you didn't mention any back pain, spinal issues can sometimes cause breathing difficulties.\n\nHowever, since you mentioned a minor heart murmur when you were young, it would be a good idea to consult your doctor and discuss your symptoms with them to rule out any potential heart-related causes. Even though your condition doesn't appear to be serious at the moment, it's crucial to keep your healthcare professional informed about your symptoms. While it might be an anxiety or stress-related issue, there's no way to know for sure without consulting your doctor."}

Does she have wheezing after walking? Does she have chest pain, palpitation, excessive sweating, etc? However, from your given history, I would like to make following suggestions to your sister:1. If she has other allergies or wheezing, asthma is very likely. In that case, I would prescribe her salbutamol inhaler on as-and-when-neede basis. I would also suggest her allergy testing so that she may identify the substances which are causing troubles to her and to avoid them. Regular breathing exercise will help her.2. Were I treating her, I would suggest her to get her hemoglobin levels done. If they are low, they can cause breathing problem after heavy work/exercise. In that case, iron, folic acid, vitamin B12 and other nutrition supplements will be useful.3. If any of above is not there, I would like to ask her symptoms in great detail to know whether she needs a cardiac evaluation. As she is young (29 years), anemia and asthma are more common possibilities rather than cardiac disease. However, it is important to diagnose the cause of her breathlessness.Hope above answer will be helpful to you.Should you have any further query, please feel free to ask at HCM.Wish you sister the best of the health.Thank you & Regards.", "ai": " Based on the information provided, yes, your sister's symptoms are suggestive of asthma, particularly in the early stages. Asthma is a chronic respiratory condition that causes inflammation and narrowing of the airways, making it difficult to breathe, especially during physical activity or when exposed to triggers like cold air, allergens, or stress. However, only a definitive diagnosis from a healthcare professional can confirm the presence of asthma. Your sister should continue following her doctor's treatment plan and consider getting allergy testing to identify potential triggers. Adopting asthma management strategies, such as using a preventer inhaler regularly and avoiding known triggers, may help alleviate symptoms. Regular follow-ups with her doctor are essential to monitor her progress and adjust the treatment plan as needed."}

However, lymph nodes can also be a sign of an underlying health issue, so it's important to understand the potential causes and when to seek medical attention.\n\nCommon causes of swollen or tender lymph nodes in the armpit include:\n\n1. Infection: Lymph nodes can become swollen or tender in response to an infection in the body, such as a respiratory infection, ear infection, or a bacterial or viral infection in the skin.\n2. Allergies: Allergic reactions can cause swelling and tenderness in the lymph nodes.\n3. Physical activity: Vigorous exercise or repetitive movements can cause temporary swelling or tenderness in the lymph nodes.\n4. Cancer: While less common than the other causes, persistent swelling or tenderness in the lymph nodes can be a sign of an underlying cancer, such as breast cancer or lymphoma.\n\nTo help determine if you should be concerned about the swollen lymph nodes in your armpit, consider the following factors:\n\n1. Persistence: If the swelling and tenderness have been present for more than a few weeks, it's worth getting them checked out by a healthcare provider.\n2. Size: If the lump is larger than 1 centimeter (about 0.4 inches), it's a good idea to get it checked out.\n3. Symptoms: If you notice other symptoms such as unexplained weight loss, fever, night sweats, or a persistent cough, it's important to seek medical attention.\n4. Pain: If the pain is severe or persistent, or if you notice that the lump is hard or fixed in place, it's a good idea to get it checked out.\n5.

However, in the absence of any other concerning symptoms or risk factors, it's also possible that the swollen lymph nodes are a normal response to an infection or other benign cause. If you do notice any changes in the size, shape, or tenderness of the lymph nodes, monitor them closely and consider getting them checked out by a healthcare provider to be on the safe side."}

However, I can provide some general information about the treatment options for an ovarian cyst or mass.\n\nThe treatment for a lump on the ovary depends on the size, location, and characteristics of the cyst or mass, as well as the symptoms experienced by the patient. In many cases, smaller cysts that cause no symptoms can be monitored with regular ultrasounds to ensure they do not grow or become problematic.\n\nHowever, larger cysts or those that cause symptoms such as pain or bloating may require surgical intervention. Sometimes, these surgeries can be performed on an outpatient basis as same-day procedures. Other times, the patient may need to stay in the hospital overnight for observation.\n\nThe most common surgical procedure for removing an ovarian cyst is called a laparoscopy. During this procedure, the surgeon makes several small incisions in the abdomen and uses a small camera to view the cyst. The cyst is then removed using specialized instruments. In some cases, the entire ovary may need to be removed if the cyst is large or if it is determined that it is not functioning properly. This procedure is called a salpingo-oophorectomy.\n\nIt is important for your daughter to follow up with her healthcare provider to discuss the specific details of her condition and treatment options.

However, your other liver function tests, including ALT, AST, albumin, and ALP, are within normal ranges, which indicates that your liver function is mostly normal.\n\nElevated bilirubin levels can have various causes, including hepatocellular damage, hemolysis (destruction of red blood cells), or obstruction of the bile ducts. Rosuvastatin is a statin medication that can occasionally cause liver damage, but it is usually mild and reversible, and the onset is typically within the first months of use.\n\nGiven the relatively mild elevation of bilirubin levels in your case, the normal liver function tests, and the fact that you have used rosuvastatin for only a month, it is generally recommended to continue taking the medication but to monitor your liver function periodically. You might consider taking a liver protection medication such as ursodeoxycholic acid or silibinin, but this should be decided in consultation with your doctor based on your individual medical history and risk factors.\n\nHowever, if you experience any symptoms of liver damage, such as jaundice, dark urine, light-colored stools, nausea, vomiting, or abdominal pain, you should stop taking rosuvastatin and consult your doctor right away.\n\nIn any case, I strongly advise you to consult with your doctor or pharmacist for personalized medical advice based on your individual situation.

Please advise me.", "human": "Hi there,Only if your platelet count is less than 20000/cmm you will need treatment in the form of steroids. Otherwise there is no need to treat thrombocytopenia. If APLA is incidentally detected, no treatment is need for that.You are at higher risk of developing clots in blood vessels. Hence in high risk situations you will need thromboprophylaxis.Please consult a rheumatologist, and get tested for autoimmune conditions such as SLE. You may need a treatment, if found positive.With regards,Dr. Girish Kamat", "ai": " I'm an AI language model and not a doctor, but I can suggest some medications that are commonly used to treat thrombocytopenia associated with Antiphospholipid Syndrome (APS). Before starting any new medication, it's important to consult with your healthcare provider and discuss the potential benefits and risks for your specific situation. Here are some medications that might be considered:\n\n1. Aspirin or other non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs): Low-dose aspirin (81-325 mg/day) is often used to prevent clotting and reduce the risk of thromboembolic events in APS patients with thrombocytopenia. However, high-dose aspirin should be avoided because it can actually reduce platelet function and worsen the thrombocytopenia.\n2. Acetylsalicylic acid (ASS) and warfarin: In some cases, your doctor may recommend combining low-dose aspirin with a blood thinner like warfarin to provide additional protection against clotting. Warfarin works by inhibiting the activity of clotting factors, including factor VII, IX, and X.\n3. Thrombocytopenia-specific medications: In severe cases of thrombocytopenia, your doctor may recommend drugs like eltrombopag (Revolar-XL) or romiplostim (Nplate) to stimulate the production of platelets. These medications are usually reserved for patients who have low platelet counts despite other treatments.\n4. Immunosuppressants: In some cases, your doctor may recommend immunosuppressant drugs like corticosteroids, azathioprine, or cyclophosphamide to help reduce the production of the abnormal antibodies causing your thrombocytopenia.\n\nIt's important to remember that each person's case is unique, so your doctor may recommend a different treatment plan based on your specific situation and medical history. Always follow your doctor's advice and report any side effects or concerns promptly."}

The symptoms of RLS usually worsen at rest, such as lying down, and can be quite painful. RLS can affect people of all ages, including young children. It is more common in adults, but early onset before the age of 20 is not uncommon.\n2. Growing pains: Growing pains are cramp-like pains or aches in the muscles or bones, typically in the legs, that occur without an obvious cause. Growing pains are common in children, especially during periods of rapid growth. They are usually more noticeable at night and can cause shaking or involuntary movements in the legs.\n3. Seizures: Seizures are abnormal electrical activity in the brain that can cause various symptoms, including shaking or twitching of the legs. Seizures can occur during sleep and can be accompanied by pain. However, this is less common than other causes.\n4. Neurological conditions: Other neurological conditions, such as cerebral palsy or muscular dystrophies, can cause shaky or twitchy legs while lying down.

{"question": "Suggest treatment for low sperm countDr im arulmozhi 30 yrs old. Im having normal periods and was advised for an IUI. My lh level was 11. So im advised to take duoluton tablet. I took 3 tablets for 3 days n I stopped it. 10 th day I have my periods again. Do I need to take hormone test tomorrow 2nd day. My husband has low sperm count and motility. Im very much afraid of my very soon periods.", "human": "Hallow Dear Arulmozhi,From your history, it appears that your main concern now is additional periods you had. You had taken Tab. Duoluton for 3 days. Duoluton is Progesterone preparation. Progesterone causes secretory changes in the lining of uterus (endometrium). After 3 days you discontinued Duoluton; hence you were expected to get the withdrawal bleeding after 4-7 days, which you got. In fact if you are to be put on Progestational medicine for the support throughout the cycle, I would advise you to go for retroprogesterone preparations throughout the cycle so that they would not hamper egg release. If you discontinue these medicines in between, you will get withdrawal bleeding. Now as far as the low sperm count of your husband is concerned, your doctors have suggested you and taken the decision of IUI which you should follow. Please start ultrasonography ovulation monitoring. When the follicle is between 18 mm to 21 mm size AND the endometrial thickness is between 9 mm to 14 mm, it is the most ideal time for IUI. So follow these instructions. You need not be afraid for that additional 'period' since it was due to discontinuation of Duoluton. I hope this helps you.Dr. Nishikant Shrotri", "ai": " I'm an artificial intelligence and not a doctor, but I can try to help you understand some possible treatment options for your husband's low sperm count and your current hormonal situation. It's important to consult with your healthcare provider for personalized medical advice.\n\nRegarding your hormonal cycle, when you were advised to take Duoluton tablets, it was likely to stimulate your ovaries to release a mature follicle for intrauterine insemination (IUI). Given that you had a period after taking the pills, it suggests that the follicle did not fully mature and release an egg. The reason for this could be related to your husband's low sperm count, or other possible factors.\n\nAs for your husband's low sperm count and motility, there are several treatment options that may be considered. Some common therapies include:\n\n1. Lifestyle modifications: Your husband may be advised to adopt certain lifestyle changes to improve his sperm quality and quantity. This could include quitting smoking, reducing alcohol consumption, limiting caffeine intake, maintaining a healthy weight, improving diet, and reducing stress.\n\n2. Medications: Your husband may be prescribed medications to boost sperm production. Clomiphene citrate and gonadotropins are common options. These medications can help stimulate the production of testosterone and follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) to increase sperm production.\n\n3. Surgery: In some cases, surgery may be recommended to correct underlying issues that could be affecting sperm production, such as varicoceles or blocked tubes.\n\n4. Assisted reproductive techniques: If your husband's sperm count and motility remain low despite other treatments, you may consider using assisted reproductive techniques such as intracytoplasmic sperm injection (ICSI) or in vitro fertilization (IVF) with ICSI. These procedures involve directly injecting a single sperm into an egg to achieve fertilization.\n\nTo get started with any of these treatments, it's essential to consult with a fertility specialist. They can assess your husband's condition, identify the underlying causes of the low sperm count, and recommend the most appropriate treatment options. Additionally, they can help you navigate the hormonal cycle and timing of IUI procedures."}

Avoid massaging.If the pain persists, visit a doctor and get it examined.Hope this answers your question, thank you.", "ai": " The sensation of an air bubble and piercing pain in the lower back can have several possible causes, some of which are more serious than others. Here are some potential explanations, but I strongly recommend consulting a healthcare professional for an accurate diagnosis:\n\n1. Gas or bloating: This is the most common cause of discomfort that might be confused with an air bubble. The sensation of gas or bloating can often be felt in the lower back when there is a buildup of gas in the abdominal cavity, which puts pressure on the muscles and nerves in the area. This feeling can be particularly noticeable while sitting or standing for prolonged periods.\n2. Muscle strain or sprain: If you have recently lifted a heavy object, done an intense workout, or experienced a sudden jolt, you may have injured your lower back muscles or ligaments. This can cause aching, pain, or a sensation of an air bubble. In these cases, rest, ice, compression, and elevation (RICE) can help alleviate the symptoms.\n3. Herniated disc: A herniated disc occurs when the soft, gel-like center of a spinal disc bulges out and presses on surrounding nerves or tissues. This can lead to radicular pain, numbness, or a tingling sensation in the lower back and legs. If you suspect a herniated disc, seek medical advice, as this condition may require specific treatments, such as physical therapy or surgery.\n4. Other spinal conditions: Apart from herniated discs, other spinal conditions, such as degenerative disc disease or spinal stenosis, can also cause lower back pain, with or without an air bubble sensation. If your symptoms persist or worsen, it's essential to consult a healthcare professional to rule out more serious underlying conditions.\n\nTo alleviate lower back pain in the interim, try incorporating gentle stretches, applying heat or cold to the affected area, practicing good posture, and avoiding prolonged periods of sitting or standing. If the pain persists, consult your doctor for a proper diagnosis and an appropriate treatment plan."}

A result of Bilirubin total: 1.62 is considered within the normal range for adults. However, having Microbacterial TB can affect liver function, and it's essential to monitor it closely.\n\nGiven that you were recently diagnosed with Microbacterial TB, it's important to follow your doctor's advice and complete the prescribed treatment course. AKT4 is an antibiotic used to treat TB, specifically for the treatment of Mycobacterium abscessus complex infections.\n\nHowever, having a liver disorder, such as Microbiliary TB, can sometimes cause liver damage. In some cases, the liver can recover once the underlying infection is treated. But in others, the damage may be permanent or worsen.\n\nI would recommend following up with your doctor to discuss the LFT results and any concerns you may have.

It can affects multiple family members.  This is worse during the dry and cold winter months and improves hot, humid climate. As with the progression of age it tends to improve. For the treatment part you apply petroleum gelly just after bath when the body is still wet or can use urea-containing creams which are useful by binding water to superficial layers of skin. There are certain skin peeling creams known as Keratolytic creams and certain oral treatments which can be discussed with your doctor to get the best of the relief.Hope to provide you with best information.Dr Sanjay K Kanodia (MD - Skin)", "ai": " I'm not a doctor, but I can suggest some general tips for managing dry skin based on common advice and personal experience. It's important to note that everyone's skin is different, and what works for one person may not work for another.\n\n1. Moisturize regularly: Use a moisturizer that is specifically formulated for dry skin after bathing or showering while your skin is still damp. Applying moisturizer on damp skin can help seal in moisture. You may need to apply it multiple times a day if necessary.\n2. Hydrate from within: Make sure you are drinking enough water throughout the day to stay hydrated. Aim for at least 8 cups (64 ounces or 1.9 liters) of water per day. Other hydrating beverages like herbal tea and coconut water can also help.\n3. Avoid long, hot showers: Long, hot showers can strip your skin of natural oils and make dryness worse. Try taking shorter showers with lukewarm or cooler water instead.\n4. Use gentle, fragrance-free products: Harsh soaps, detergents, and fragrances can further irritate and dry out your skin. Use gentle, fragrance-free cleansers and laundry detergent for your body and clothes.\n5. Use protective layers during cold weather: In colder months, protect your skin with layers: wear gloves, hats, scarves, and other protective clothing to shield your skin from the elements.\n6. Avoid scratching or rubbing: Dry skin can be itchy and uncomfortable, but resist the urge to scratch or rub as this can further damage your skin.\n7. Apply oils and creams before bed: Applying oils or creams before going to bed can help moisturize your skin overnight. Try using a rich, emollient moisturizer or facial oil containing ingredients like jojoba oil, shea butter, or aloe vera.\n8. Consider seeing a dermatologist: If your dry skin persists despite trying these remedies, it may be helpful to consult a healthcare professional or dermatologist for further evaluation and potential treatment options, such as prescription-strength moisturizers or other topical treatments.\n\nIt's worth noting that dry skin may be an inherited condition, and it can take some time and effort to find the best routine to manage it. I hope this information is helpful and that you are able to find relief for your dry skin concerns. If you have any further questions or concerns, I would recommend consulting a dermatologist or healthcare professional."}
{"question": "How long does it take to recover from a sprained foot?I sprained my foot on Friday. I stepped on what I thought was lawn. Instead I was a bit on the lawn, but the outside of my foot snapped down into a trough. My foot has been swollen since Friday. Today is Thursday. Kept ice on it for 24 hours. Bruising started after that, Now bruising is spreading. It is really dark on my toes. Pain is on outside of my foot, not on my ankle.", "human": "Hello, You have sustained twisting injury to foot which may lead to sprain or minor fracture in foot bones. Diagnosis needs to be confirmed by doing x-ray of the involved foot anteroposterior and oblique views to rule out bony abnormalities. If x-ray is normal RICE therapy is needed which means Rest Ice application Compression bandage and Limb Elevation. Tab Diclofenac sodium twice a day for pain relief and tab Chymoral forte twice a day for swelling reduction is required. If x-ray shows fracture Below knee slab may be given. If X-ray is abnormal please consult orthopedic surgeon nearby your area. Hope I have answered your query. Let me know if I can assist you further.", "ai": " A sprained foot can take anywhere from a few weeks to several months to fully recover, depending on the severity of the injury. For mild sprains, it can take around 2-4 weeks for the swelling and bruising to subside, and for normal activities to be resumed. More severe sprains, especially those involving complete or partial ligament tears, can take longer, often 4-12 weeks or even more, to heal completely. Since you mentioned that your pain is on the outside of your foot, not on your ankle, it suggests that you may have sprained the lateral ligaments of your foot, which could fall into the moderate to severe range.\n\nIn your case, since you stepped into a trough unexpectedly, it suggests that your injury might not be quite as simple as a typical sprain. There could be damage to the bones or other soft tissues in addition to the ligament sprain. It's also possible that you have a contusion (bruise) of the foot as well, which could contribute to your symptoms.\n\nGiven this, I would recommend getting evaluated by a healthcare professional to get a definitive diagnosis and treatment plan. They may recommend specific treatments like immobilization, physical therapy, or even surgery, depending on the severity of the injury, and can provide you with an accurate estimate of the recovery timeline. It's important to remember that trying to rush the healing process can actually set you back and increase the risk of complications.\n\nIn the meantime, continue to follow the R.I.C.E. (Rest, Ice, Compression, and Elevation) principles, which can help manage symptoms and promote healing. This means avoiding putting any weight on the foot, keeping it iced and elevated as much as possible, wearing a supportive brace or wrap to help immobilize the injured area, and avoiding activities that cause pain or discomfort.\n\nStay positive and be patient with your recovery process! Your foot will thank you in the long run."}
{"question": "What causes consistent bad breath?I have consistent bad breath even after just brushing my teeth. I brush longer than anyone, use mouthwash, I do not smoke nor drink alcohol and all to no avail. I drink a lot of diet soda and have an intolerance to milk. Is this what is creating my consistent bad breath?", "human": "Its good that you are maintaing your oral hygeine. Bad breaths are also caused by carious teeth that either need simple fillings or root canal treatment (rct) or by calculus deposition that won't get resolved by manual brushing or mouth wash. I would suggest that you undergo a thorough dental examination at the earliest. Hope this answers your query.", "ai": " Consistent bad breath, also known as halitosis, can have various causes. While poor oral hygiene is a common culprit, it's not the only one. Here are some possible causes of your bad breath that might be worth exploring:\n\n1. Dry mouth: Saliva helps wash away bacteria and food particles in your mouth. If you have a dry mouth due to various reasons such as medications, breathing through your mouth, or certain medical conditions, it can lead to bad breath.\n2. Gum disease: Even if you brush thoroughly, gum disease can cause bad breath. Gum disease occurs when the gums become inflamed and infected, leading to pockets where bacteria can thrive.\n3. Tongue coating: The tongue can harbor bacteria, dead cells, and food debris, especially on the back of the tongue. Brushing your tongue regularly can help reduce bad breath caused by tongue coating.\n4. Oral infections: Infections in the mouth, including tooth decay, abscesses, and periodontal disease, can lead to bad breath.\n5. Medical conditions: Certain medical conditions can cause bad breath, including diabetes, liver disease, and respiratory infections. Your healthcare provider can help determine if any underlying health conditions are contributing to your bad breath.\n6. Diet: Some foods, such as garlic, onions, and spices, can cause bad breath. Also, consuming large amounts of sugar-free diet drinks can lead to dry mouth, which can contribute to bad breath.\n7. Intolerances and digestive issues: While you mentioned an intolerance to milk, it's worth noting that digestive issues, including lactose intolerance, can lead to bad breath due to the fermentation of undigested food in the gut.\n\nIf you're concerned about your consistent bad breath, it may be worth scheduling an appointment with your dentist or healthcare provider to rule out any underlying causes. They may be able to recommend specific treatments or suggest lifestyle changes to help improve your oral health and reduce bad breath."}

It's important to consult with your healthcare provider for accurate information based on your specific situation.\n\nMotility issues in semen refer to the ability of sperm to move effectively towards an egg for fertilization. A low motility count can be a reason for infertility. Treatment options depend on the underlying cause, which could be due to several factors, including infections, structural issues, or chronic health conditions. Here are some common treatments for motility issues:\n\n1. Antibiotics: Infections, such as urinary tract infections (UTIs), prostatitis, or epididymitis, can contribute to low sperm motility. Antibiotics are often used to treat infections and improve sperm quality. If your healthcare provider diagnosed an infection, it's crucial to complete the full course of antibiotics prescribed to you.\n\n2. Antioxidants: Conditions like varicoceles, environmental factors, and oxidative stress can damage sperm. Antioxidant supplements, such as L-carnitine, L-arginine, Coenzyme Q10, and zinc, may help protect sperm from oxidative damage and improve motility. Always consult with your healthcare provider before beginning any new supplements.\n\n3. Surgery: Surgeries like varicocelectomy, where the varicoceles (enlarged veins) in the scrotum are removed, can help improve sperm quality and motility in some cases.\n\n4. Lifestyle modifications: Certain lifestyle factors, such as smoking, alcohol consumption, stress, and obesity, may negatively impact sperm motility. Making lifestyle changes, like quitting smoking, reducing alcohol consumption, managing stress, and maintaining a healthy weight, can help improve overall sperm health.\n\n5. Assisted reproductive technologies: Techniques like intracytoplasmic sperm injection (ICSI) and in vitro fertilization (IVF) involve directly injecting sperm into an egg or fertilizing an egg in a laboratory, respectively. These methods can help bypass issues with poor motility, enabling fertilization to occur.\n\nIt's important to note that the success of treatment options depends on the underlying cause of the motility issue. Always consult with a healthcare professional for accurate information, and ask about any potential risks and side effects that may come with a specific treatment."}

So consult a oral physician and get yourself examined to rule out the above said conditions.The burning sensation can be solved by maintaining the tongue hygiene, using topical antifungal like clotrimazole 1% ointment 3-4times daily for a week, and topical anesthetic and analgesic like 2%lignocaine gel, apply 3-4times daily for a week. Do saline gargling.I hope my answer will help you, take care.", "ai": " Fissured tongue, also known as scalloped tongue or placate tongue, is a condition characterized by deep longitudinal grooves or cracks on the tongue surface. The exact cause of fissured tongue is not known, but several factors have been suggested to contribute to it, including genetics, dehydration, geographic region, and certain medical conditions.\n\nRegarding your concern about Zenzedi (cenicriviroc) and its potential relationship to your fissured tongue, there is currently no definitive evidence to suggest that this medication directly causes this condition. However, some medications can cause oral side effects, such as tongue pain or altered taste sensation. If you suspect that Zenzedi is contributing to your tongue symptoms, it would be a good idea to discuss this with your healthcare provider. They may recommend alternative treatments, adjusting the dosage, or monitoring the situation closely.\n\nIn the meantime, several strategies can help relieve tongue discomfort:\n\n1. Keep your mouth moist by sipping water, using saliva substitutes, or sucking on ice chips.\n2. Avoid spicy, acidic, or irritating foods that exacerbate tongue sensitivity.\n3. Practice good oral hygiene, including brushing gently with a soft-bristled toothbrush and a non-alcoholic mouthwash.\n4. Use a tongue scraper to clean the grooves on your tongue.\n5. Apply a topical anesthetic, such as Orajel or Anbesol, to help alleviate pain.\n6. Consider using a tongue compressor or massager to help relieve tension and promote healing in the tongue grooves.\n7. Stay hydrated and eat a well-balanced diet to ensure your body has the necessary nutrients for healing.\n\nThese remedies may help alleviate your tongue pain to some extent. However, if your symptoms persist or worsen despite these measures, it's important to consult with a healthcare provider or a dentist for further evaluation and potential treatment options."}
{"question": "Can Metaline destroy the remaining adrenal gland?I had my right adrenal gland removed because of a tumour on the cortex...the histolics show a small spot in the centre of clear cells .not divided ..they are tslking about using Metaline ? as a precaution measure ..will this destroy my one remaining Adrenal Gland ??", "human": "Hi and welcome to Healthcaremagic. Thank you for your query. I am Dr. Rommstein and I will try to help you as much as I can. It will not destroy your adrenal gland but it may causes certain changes in hormonal levels. You should check your cortisol andaldosteron levels if you plan to take it frequently. I hope I have answered you query. If you have any further questions you can contact us.Kindly regards. Wish you a good health.", "ai": " Metaline, also known as mitotanone or L-3,6,9-triiodo-2-(p-hydroxybenzylidene)amino-1,2,3,6-tetraiodo-naphthalen-1-ol, is a medication that belongs to a class of drugs called aromatase inhibitors. It is primarily used for the treatment of certain types of hormone-sensitive cancers, such as breast and endometrial cancers.\n\nThe use of Metaline for the prevention of adrenal gland tumors in people who have already had one adrenal gland removed is not a standard practice and is considered off-label use. The decision to use Metaline in this context would depend on the specific circumstances of your case, including the type and size of the remaining adrenal gland tumor, the likelihood of it growing or spreading, and the potential benefits and risks of treatment.\n\nIt is important to note that Metaline acts by inhibiting the enzyme aromatase, which is involved in the production of estrogen and androgens from androgens. The adrenal glands produce small amounts of androgens and estrogen, but the majority of these hormones are produced by the ovaries in women and by the testes in men. Since the primary function of the adrenal glands is not related to hormone production in the same way that the ovaries and testes do, it is unlikely that Metaline would destroy the remaining adrenal gland if used as a precautionary measure.\n\nHowever, it is essential to discuss the potential risks and benefits of using Metaline in your specific situation with your healthcare provider, as they can provide you with more accurate information based on your medical history and current condition. They can also help you weigh the potential risks and benefits of treatment and make an informed decision."}

However, it's important for your niece to continue communicating with her healthcare provider for personalized recommendations. Here are a few suggestions:\n\n1. Keep the area clean: Encourage your niece to maintain good hygiene in the affected area by gently washing with warm water and a mild, fragrance-free soap. Pat the area dry after washing.\n\n2. Use a sitz bath: Soaking the affected area in a warm sitz bath can help alleviate discomfort and promote healing. Make sure the water is not too hot, as this can irritate the skin.\n\n3. Apply a cool compress: Applying a cool compress to the affected area may help reduce pain and inflammation. Use a clean washcloth and apply ice packs or cold compresses for 15-20 minutes at a time, a few times a day.\n\n4.

Be sure to follow the recommended dosage and frequency on the label.\n\n5. Use protective underwear: Have your niece wear cotton underwear, or use gauze pads covered with non-stick bandages, to protect the blisters and prevent irritation from clothing or sanitary products.\n\n6. Stay hydrated: Encourage your niece to drink plenty of fluids, such as water, clear broths, or sports drinks with electrolytes, to help replenish fluids lost due to illness and diarrhea. A well-hydrated body can help improve overall health and speed up the healing process.\n\n7. Avoid tight clothing and irritants: Encourage your niece to wear loose-fitting clothing made of natural fibers (like cotton) to avoid irritating the affected area. Also, avoid the use of harsh soaps, detergents, or any potentially irritating products in the genital area.\n\nIt's important to emphasize that each individual case may be different, so it's essential to consult a healthcare professional for personalized recommendations.

Thank you.", "ai": " A hard lump on the forehead following a fall is not necessarily a sign of a serious condition, but it is important to monitor it and ensure that it is healing properly. The presence of a lump after a fall can be due to various reasons, such as a contusion (bruise), hematoma (collected blood), or even a fracture, although the latter is less common. The medical professionals at the Accident and Emergency (A&E) department made an assessment based on the circumstances and their clinical judgment. If you are still concerned, you may want to follow up with your doctor. However, if you notice any worsening symptoms such as increased pain, swelling, or numbness, or if the lump seems to be growing in size, you should seek medical attention as soon as possible. In general, if you had a significant fall and are unsure about your injuries, it is always a good idea to err on the side of caution and consult a healthcare professional."}

I would also go for a routine stool test for ova and cyst and treat it if positive. If no relief with these steps, I would refer you to a gastro enterologist for a possible endoscopic evaluation of your intestinal tract.I hope this information would help you in discussing with your family physician/treating doctor in further management of your problem. Please do not hesitate to ask in case of any further doubts.Thanks for choosing health care magic to clear doubts on your health problems. Wishing you an early recovery. Dr Shareef.", "ai": " I'm not a doctor, but it seems like you are experiencing symptoms that could be associated with gastrointestinal issues, such as irritable bowel syndrome (IBS), food intolerance, or even an infection. Your symptoms of fever, headache, and abdominal pain suggest that there might be an underlying issue that requires medical attention.\n\nGiven your history of abdominal problems and current symptoms, it would be important to consult with a healthcare professional for a proper diagnosis. They may conduct tests to rule out potential causes, such as infections, inflammatory conditions, or food intolerances.\n\nIn the meantime, you could try the following to help alleviate your symptoms:\n\n1. Stay hydrated: Drink plenty of water or clear fluids to avoid dehydration, especially if you're experiencing diarrhea.\n2. Rest: Get enough rest and avoid physical activities that might worsen your symptoms.\n3. Avoid certain foods: Triggers for abdominal symptoms can include caffeine, spicy foods, dairy products, or gluten. Try avoiding these foods to determine if they are contributing to your symptoms.\n4. Small, frequent meals: Eating smaller, more frequent meals rather than larger meals may help alleviate symptoms.\n5. Over-the-counter medications: For symptomatic relief, you may consider taking over-the-counter medications such as antipyretics for your fever, analgesics for the headache and pain, and antacids for nausea and heartburn.\n\nHowever, it's essential to consult a healthcare professional for proper diagnosis and treatment recommendations. If your symptoms worsen, persist for an extended period, or are accompanied by severe abdominal pain, difficulty breathing, or chest pain, seek immediate medical attention.\n\nRegarding your statement about hypoglycemia, it would be worth discussing this condition with your healthcare professional, as it can have symptoms that overlap with those you have described. Hypoglycemia is usually accompanied by symptoms such as dizziness, confusion, and sweating, so if these symptoms are present, be sure to bring them to your healthcare professional's attention as well."}

Should I be worried about it being more than just a little bit of pain along with anxiety..", "human": "Thanks for your question on Healthcare Magic. I can understand your concern. Yes, these symptoms can be due to anxiety. But better to rule arrhythmia (rhythm disturbances in heart) because it can also cause chest pain, faster heart beats etc. So consult doctor and get done ecg, 2d echo and Holter monitoring (24 hours continuous recording of ecg). If all these are normal then no need to worry for arrhythmia or other heart diseases. Stress and anxiety can also cause similar symptoms. So consult psychiatrist and get done counselling sessions .

{"question": "Suggest treatment for kidney stones and fat filtration in liverDear doctor ,during the sonography, the doctor found kidney stone in both kidney as well as fat filtration in liver frade 1,how can i came over from this problem , i was suffer last one month, doctor perscribed me, two tab of livfit and sobolime syrup", "human": "Hi,Thanks for writing in.Fatty liver can be due to increased fat consumption, alcohol intake and also a normal occurrence in some people who are over weight or have a family history. It is important to know your blood cholesterol levels and I suggest you get Lipid profile test done and discuss the report with your doctor. The lipid profile test result will tell the cholesterol levels in your blood and the risk of heart disease. You should have low oil diet and make a fitness plan.For kidney stones it is important to know the size of stones and if they are causing obstruction. You can send in your report for a detailed discussion. Alternatively you can consult an urologist. You should drink lots of water and fluids and pass urine frequently.", "ai": " I'm an AI language model and not a doctor, but I can suggest some general information about the treatments for kidney stones and fat filtration in the liver based on available medical knowledge. however, I would recommend you to follow your doctor's prescription and advice, as each case is unique and requires individualized treatment.\n\nFor kidney stones:\n\n1. Pain relief: Over-the-counter pain medicines, such as ibuprofen or acetaminophen, can help manage the pain. Your doctor may also prescribe stronger pain medication for severe cases.\n2. Hydration: Drinking plenty of water can help pass smaller stones and prevent new ones from forming. The American Urological Association recommends drinking about 2.5 to 3 liters (about 91 to 101 imperial cups) of water a day.\n3. Medications: Your doctor may prescribe medications to help relax the muscles in your urinary tract, making it easier to pass the stones. These include alpha blockers and calcium channel blockers.\n4. Extracorporeal shock wave lithotripsy (ESWL): This noninvasive procedure uses high-energy shock waves to break the stone into smaller pieces, which can then be passed in your urine.\n5. Surgery: In some cases, a doctor may recommend surgery to remove large or complex kidney stones.\n\nFor fat filtration in the liver (Frasier syndrome or cholestatic cirrhosis)\n\n1. Medications: Your doctor may prescribe ursodeoxycholic acid (UDCA), a bile acid, to help dissolve some of the cholesterol in your bile. Other medications may be used to manage symptoms such as itching and fluid buildup.\n2. Diet: Your doctor may recommend a low-fat diet to help the liver process bile more effectively. Avoiding foods high in cholesterol and saturated fats can be helpful.\n3. Supplements: Your doctor may recommend taking certain vitamin and mineral supplements to ensure you're getting the nutrients your body needs.\n4. Surgery: In severe cases or when other treatments are not effective, a liver transplant may be recommended.\n5. Lifestyle changes: Maintaining a healthy weight, avoiding alcohol, and getting regular exercise can all help support liver health.\n\nAgain, these suggestions are based on general medical knowledge and should not replace individualized advice from a healthcare professional. It's important to follow your doctor's instructions carefully and consult them with any questions or concerns."}
{"question": "Is it possible to get pregnant with tilted cystic ovaries ?my uterus is tilted is there any procedure that will fix it i am wanting to have kids already and im scared it wont happen im 24 about 128 pounds and i do have cists on my ovaries my periods are abnormal as well", "human": "welcome to healthcaremagicyou should get check up and get investigated for infertility and be on treatment till you get resultyour partner is also tobe examined and semen analysis donetilting of uterus is no problem and does not come in way of pregnancy", "ai": " Yes, it is possible to get pregnant with tilted cystic ovaries or a tilted uterus. Both conditions do not necessarily prevent pregnancy, but they might increase the risk of certain complications, such as an ectopic pregnancy, which occurs when a fertilized egg implants outside the uterus, usually in a fallopian tube.\n\nA tilted uterus, also known as a retroverted uterus, is when the uterus tilts backward toward the cervix, instead of forward toward the abdomen. This condition does not directly impact fertility but might cause discomfort during sexual intercourse or menstruation.\n\nCystic ovaries, on the other hand, are ovaries containing follicular cysts. These cysts are harmless most of the time and do not typically affect fertility. However, large cysts might obstruct the fallopian tubes, which could potentially hinder the sperm's contact with the egg, causing infertility.\n\nYour symptoms, particularly abnormal periods, may signal other conditions, such as endometriosis or polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS), that might impact your fertility. You may want to consult a healthcare professional to assess your condition thoroughly.\n\nAs for the procedures to treat your tilted uterus, there are several options:\n\n1. Oral medication: Hormonal medications, such as estrogen and progesterone, might help relax the uterine muscles and shift its position over time.\n\n2. Pessary: A pessary is a device that can be inserted into the vagina to help keep the uterus in a more stable position.\n\n3. Surgery: In some cases, hysterectomy or myomectomy (removal of fibroids or myomas) may be recommended to correct a severely tilted uterus or other structural issues.\n\nHowever, it is essential to discuss the pros and cons of these treatments with your healthcare provider before choosing the best option for you, particularly with regards to your pregnancy goals.\n\nRemember that the age factor is essential when considering pregnancy, as fertility declines with age. If you are 24 and worried about your infertility chances due to your medical conditions, it would be a good idea to consult a fertility specialist to discuss your options. They may recommend specific treatments, such as intrauterine insemination (IUI) or in vitro fertilization (IVF), to help you reach your goal of having a child."}
{"question": "What causes tightening sensation in the pelvic area during pregnancy?Hi I m 6 week and 2 day pregnant I m getting this thighting feeling at my pelvis area is quite discomfort special when I need to go to toilet I m really worried because I had two miscarrieges already this one quite different pregnancy to my others pregnancy is it normal.", "human": "HI,    Thanks for the query. I understand your concern.  -  IT's natural for you to be worried following two miscarriages. But in my view, when you already know that your pregnancy is normal.. you should not be psychologically stressed... taking care is needed, but stress & tension can have adverse effect of pregnancy.   * Actually frequency of urination& frequent urge ( may be taken as tightening .. is normal in early pregnancy, due to pressure of growing fetus presses on  the urinary bladder. .. as a result there is no complete empting of bladder & the symptoms.   - Try to pass urine in  forward bendsng position with hands resting on knee. This relieves pressure on bladder.. it empties completely & there is no frequent urge& stretching!   *  If you are not relieved with this -    Please consult your treating doctor, tell about your tightening before urination. he will advise you-     - Get urine checked for any infection/ HSG/ Progesterone  assessment to determine hormonal sufficiency  & will prescribe needful medicines .   * Actually you had 2 abortions in past.. routinely such patients are given Progesterone supplements ( as a preventive measure ) till 12-14 weeks are completed.    You can discuss with your doctor about the supplements ( actually you must be already been prescribed  ).. . As the hormone supports pregnancy , your tension would be relieved.   Thanks.", "ai": " I'm not a doctor, but I can try to provide some information on this topic based on my research. A tightening sensation in the pelvic area, also known as \"pelvic pressure\" or \"round ligament pain,\" is a common symptom during pregnancy. This feeling is often described as a dull ache or cramp, similar to menstrual cramps, and it can be more noticeable when changing position or moving around a lot.\n\nThe cause of pelvic pressure during pregnancy is related to the hormonal and physical changes that occur in the body. The ligaments of the pelvis and lower abdomen begin to relax and stretch, allowing the uterus to expand and make room for the growing fetus. This process can put extra strain on the ligaments and muscles, leading to discomfort and tension in the pelvic area.\n\nPelvic pressure can be more noticeable during the second trimester and is often worse on one side than the other. It can also be exacerbated by activities such as standing for long periods, lifting heavy objects, or constipation. While it can be uncomfortable, pelvic pressure is generally considered a normal symptom of pregnancy and does not indicate a serious problem, unless it is accompanied by other symptoms such as vaginal bleeding, severe abdominal pain, or fever.\n\nIf you are experiencing discomfort in your pelvic area during pregnancy, try practicing relaxation techniques such as deep breathing or taking a warm bath to help alleviate the tension. You can also try changing positions frequently, taking short walks, or doing gentle stretches to help ease the discomfort. It's also important to maintain good posture, avoid heavy lifting, and eat a nutritious diet to ensure a healthy pregnancy.\n\nIf you are concerned about your symptoms or have a history of miscarriages, it's always a good idea to consult with your healthcare provider. They can evaluate your individual situation and provide you with personalized advice and reassurance."}

Cold sores are common to appear outside if the mouth and would be my  possible diagnosis with your descritption. Typically they are contagious and of viral origin.

Presription anti-viral medications such acyclovir and famciclovir work best when taken during the first two days of the symptoms appearing. Avoid acidic and spicy foods. Cold packs and gels with benzocaine or other numbing ingredients may offer relief. Benadryl is a good antihistamine to reduce swelling and calm symptoms of spreading inflammation.I hope my suggests help your daughter to feel better soon.

The persistent swelling and large sore on the corner of her mouth, even after the use of an antihistamine like Benadryl, suggests that it might be an infection or an allergic reaction to something other than an insect bite. Other possible causes could include trauma to the mouth, oral herpes (cold sores), oral thrush, or a canker sore. It's important for your daughter to follow up with her healthcare provider for further evaluation and treatment. They may want to perform additional tests or adjust her medication as needed. If the symptoms worsen, you should seek further medical attention. In the meantime, you can try to keep the affected area clean and comfortable by rinsing it with warm water and gently dabbing it with a soft cloth. Avoiding spicy or acidic foods, smoking, and using harsh toothpastes could also help alleviate discomfort."}

The posterior (back) part of the soft palate is where the tonsillar tissue extends, and tonsilloliths can form there as well.\n\nThe sore throat could be due to several causes, including:\n\n1. Oral trauma from the wisdom tooth removal procedure.\n2. Oral bacteria spreading from the extraction site.\n3. Inflammation or infection of the tonsils or pharynx (throat).\n4. Irritation from the hard bumps on the soft palate.\n\nIf you're concerned about the hard bumps or the sore throat, I would recommend contacting your dentist or oral surgeon to schedule a follow-up appointment. They can examine your mouth and determine if any further treatment is necessary.\n\nIt's also important to practice good oral hygiene, including brushing and flossing regularly and rinsing your mouth with an antimicrobial mouthwash. This can help reduce the risk of infection and other oral health issues.\n\nIn the meantime, you can try some home remedies to alleviate the sore throat, such as drinking plenty of fluids, gargling with salt water, and using a humidifier to add moisture to the air. Avoiding spicy or acidic foods and smoking can also help soothe an irritated throat."}

It's important to consult with your child's pediatrician or neurologist for personalized advice, as they have a complete understanding of your child's medical history and current condition. Below are some suggestions based on the information provided:\n\n1. Speech Therapy: Your child's difficulty in speaking could be due to several factors, including side effects of medications, developmental delays, or an underlying condition. Speech therapy is a valuable resource in addressing and improving speech difficulties. Consult with your child's doctor about referring your son to a speech-language pathologist.\n\n2. Monitor Hyperactivity: Hyperactivity is a common side effect of some seizure medications, including Eptoin. Keep track of your child's hyperactivity levels, and discuss any concerns with their doctor.

In the meantime, you can try using a saliva swallowing technique or using a bib to keep clothes clean.\n\n4. Create a Consistent Daily Routine: Consistency in daily routine can help your child feel more secure and reduce some of the challenges that come with seizures and developmental delays. Plan regular meal times, bedtimes, and activities, and stick to the routine as best as possible.\n\n5. Social Environment: Provide your child with opportunities to interact with children their age, and ensure they have positive experiences. This can have a positive impact on their speech development and overall development. You might consider joining a support group for parents of children with developmental delays or speech disorders.\n\n6. Educate Yourself: Research seizure disorders, developmental delays, speech disorders, and the medications your child is taking. Being informed will help you better understand your child's condition and provide them with the best care possible.\n\nRemember, it's vital to consult your child's doctor for personalized advice regarding their health concerns before making any significant changes or implementing new interventions."}

Is there something wrong with her bones? and I can i give her something to help her grow better and faster?", "human": "Hi, If the doctors who examined her told you not to worry means she is in the right growth velocity. No need to worry. growth will occur up to 18 years so no need to worry. You can give protein-rich food to help her grow. Hope I have answered your query. Let me know if I can assist you further. Regards,Dr. Rajmohan, Pediatrician", "ai": " I'm an AI language model and not a doctor, but I can suggest some general advice based on available information. It's normal for children to grow at different rates, and some children may appear shorter than their peers at a given age. This doesn't necessarily mean there's a problem with their bones or growth.\n\nA healthy diet rich in nutrients, particularly calcium and vitamin D, is essential for bone health and overall growth. You can encourage your daughter to consume plenty of fruits, vegetables, lean proteins, and low-fat dairy products. A balanced diet, along with regular physical activity, can promote healthy growth and development.\n\nIt's essential to remember that genetic factors play a significant role in determining a child's height. Parents can influence their child's growth through nutritious eating and providing ample opportunities for physical activity, but genetics ultimately determines how tall a child will grow.\n\nAlso, consider having regular check-ups with your doctor to ensure your daughter's overall health and development are on track. If your doctor determines that there's a cause for concern, they may recommend further testing or treatments.\n\nHormonal treatments or growth-stimulating medications are not recommended for children experiencing delayed growth unless there's a medical condition proven to be causing the issue. These treatments involve risks and should only be considered in consultation with a healthcare professional.\n\nLastly, remember that everyone grows and develops at their own pace, and focusing on your child's height may create undue stress and pressure. Encouraging a healthy lifestyle and providing love and support are the best ways to help your child grow into a healthy and happy young adult."}

{"question": "Q. Apart from extraction, is there any way to manage swelling due to wisdom tooth eruption?Hi doctor,I have an inflamed gum at end of the jaw and showed to different dentists. They said it is the wisdom tooth coming out in the wrong position so it has to be extracted. I am not comfortable with extraction. Is there any other solution to reduce the swelling?", "human": "Hello. Wisdom teeth or third molars are usually the last ones to erupt. During the eruption time, there are some inflammation and redness in gum pad known as pericoronitis. If the orientation of the tooth is not in a proper path, the dentist decides to extract it. This is a universally accepted method because there is no sufficient space in the jaw for the tooth to come out. If the tooth was left as it is, it can cause more problems in the future. So I suggest you go for extraction. This is the best way to cure your problem, do not be panic because the whole procedure will be performed under local anesthesia.", "ai": " I'm an AI language model and not a doctor, but I can suggest some home remedies and tips that might help reduce swelling due to wisdom tooth eruption besides extraction:\n\n1. Ice packs: Applying an ice pack on the affected area for 15-20 minutes intervals can help reduce swelling and alleviate pain.\n2. Over-the-counter pain relievers: Non-prescription pain killers like ibuprofen and acetaminophen can help reduce inflammation and pain.\n3. Saltwater rinses: Mixing a teaspoon of salt in lukewarm water and rinsing your mouth several times a day can help reduce bacteria and inflammation.\n4. Warm compress: Applying a warm compress to the affected area for 10-15 minutes can help improve blood flow and reduce swelling.\n5. Eating soft foods: Chewing hard foods can put extra pressure on the affected area and aggravate swelling. Eating soft foods like yogurt, pudding, and mashed potatoes can help reduce the pressure on the gums.\n6. Proper oral hygiene: Maintaining good oral hygiene is essential to prevent infection and reduce inflammation. Brush gently around the affected area, floss carefully, and rinse your mouth regularly.\n\nHowever, keep in mind that extracting a wisdom tooth is often the best solution to prevent further complications and alleviate symptoms. Talk to your dentist about your concerns and explore all your options before making a decision."}

Coughing up blood with phlegm and vomiting can be concerning symptoms, especially in a young child. These symptoms could indicate a number of conditions, some of which may be serious.\n\nCoughing up blood with phlegm, also known as hemoptysis, can be a sign of various respiratory conditions, including bronchitis, pneumonia, or even more serious conditions like tuberculosis or lung cancer. Vomiting due to coughing can be a result of the intense coughing displacing the stomach contents or a sign of an underlying medical condition.\n\nHowever, it is essential to note that I cannot diagnose your child based on the information provided. If your child is experiencing these symptoms, it is crucial to consult a healthcare professional right away. Your child may require further testing, such as a chest X-ray or blood tests, to determine the underlying cause of these symptoms.\n\nIn the meantime, make sure your child stays hydrated by offering small sips of fluid frequently. You can also try to soothe their cough with over-the-counter cough suppressants, but be sure to follow the instructions carefully and consult your child's doctor before giving any medication.\n\nI hope this information helps you in some way, but please do not hesitate to seek medical advice as soon as possible."}
{"question": "Can rapid heart rate cause damage to heart?my husband is 40 yrs old He has wolfe parkinsons white. In May he had an attack which his heart rate was 280 bpm. for around 5 hours. since then he had surgery to correct and remove the extra electrical pathways. he recently went for his post term check up and they say his lower heart has damage. is this from the rapid heart rate? can he get better? and what else can occur due to this syndrome?", "human": "Hello, Yes, faster heart rate, it persists for a long time like over years, can cause myocardial fatigue which ultimately results in tachycardia-induced cardiomyopathy. Yes, some patients if taken care properly with medication and precautions do improve up to some extent but 100% recovery is not very common. Hope I have answered your query. Let me know if I can assist you further. Regards,Dr. Bhanu Partap,Cardiologist", "ai": " Wolfe-Parkinson-White (WPW) syndrome is a heart condition that involves an extra electrical connection between the atria and ventricles, which can lead to rapid heart rates, known as paroxysmal supraventricular tachycardia (PSVT). A rapid heart rate, such as the one your husband experienced (280 bpm), can put additional stress on the heart, potentially causing damage to the muscle over an extended period of time. This damage is typically referred to as myocardial ischemia or infarction, and it can manifest as weakness, shortness of breath, or chest pain. However, the extent of the damage can vary among individuals, and some people with WPW may not experience any problems with their hearts despite having prolonged rapid heart rates.\n\nIt's important to note that the damage to your husband's heart was diagnosed during a post-surgery checkup. The connection between his rapid heart rate during the WPW episode and the subsequent heart damage is not clear, as there could be contributing factors, such as the length and frequency of the episodes, the presence of underlying heart conditions, and the effectiveness of the treatment. Your husband's healthcare professionals will be able to provide you with more specific information regarding his case based on his medical history, tests, and follow-up evaluations.\n\nAs for improving the condition and preventing further damage, a few steps can be taken:\n\n1. Proper management of episodes: Your husband should learn how to recognize and manage WPW episodes on his own. Techniques include taking deep breaths, applying cold water to the face, or performing the Valsalva maneuver (bearing down as if having a bowel movement) to reduce the severity or duration of an episode. If an episode is especially prolonged or severe, your husband should seek medical attention.\n\n2. Medications: If your husband is prone to frequent or prolonged WPW episodes, medications may be prescribed to help prevent or terminate them. These may include beta blockers, calcium channel blockers, or other anti-arrhythmic agents.\n\n3. Catheter ablation: A catheter ablation procedure can be performed to destroy the extra electrical connection between the atria and ventricles, effectively treating WPW and preventing further rapid heart rates. This procedure may be recommended if medications are not effective in controlling WPW episodes.\n\n4. Regular follow-ups: Your husband should schedule regular follow-up appointments with his healthcare professional to monitor his heart health and ensure that his condition is well-managed. This will include routine check-ups, blood tests, and possibly EKGs or cardiac imaging studies.\n\nRegarding the potential complications of WPW syndrome, some individuals may experience the following:\n\n1. Stroke or transient ischemic attack: Rapid heart rates increase blood pressure and can cause blood clots to form, potentially leading to a stroke or transient ischemic attack. This risk may be higher for individuals with other contributing factors such as hypertension, diabetes, or a family history of stroke.\n\n2. Heart failure: Prolonged rapid heart rates can weaken the heart muscle over time, making it less effective at pumping blood throughout the body. This can lead to heart failure symptoms, including shortness of breath, swelling, and decreased energy levels.\n\n3. Cardiac arrest: Severe or prolonged rapid heart rates can ultimately lead to cardiac arrest, where the heart stops beating effectively, causing a complete loss of blood circulation to the body.\n\nOverall, it's important for your husband to understand the risks and management strategies associated with WPW syndrome to reduce the likelihood of further damage or complications. Communicating openly with his healthcare professional and closely following their recommendations will be key in ensuring his long-term heart health."}

Wish your kid good health.Dr. Sumanth MBBS., DCH., DNB (Paed).,", "ai": " Red spots on the soles of an infant's feet, especially if they are not itchy or painful, are usually benign and can be caused by a few different conditions:\n\n1. Infantile Hemangiomas: These are common benign (non-cancerous) vascular tumors that can develop in the skin, and can appear as red or pink spots or patches, often with a raised or bluish center. They are usually not itchy or painful, and hemangiomas on the sole of the foot are quite common. They typically do not require treatment, but your child's pediatrician may monitor their growth.\n\n2. Erythrma Multiforme: This is a skin condition that can cause red, circular, or target-shaped lesions on the skin, including the soles of the feet. It is often preceded by a viral or bacterial infection, and can be associated with a loss of appetite and increased urination. While it can be concerning to see, most cases of erythrama multiforme are mild and resolve on their own. However, it is important to have your child evaluated by a healthcare professional to rule out more serious causes.\n\n3. Heat Rash or Prickly Heat: This is a common condition that can cause small, flat, red spots to develop on the skin, including the soles of the feet, after prolonged exposure to excess heat or sweating. This can be associated with increased urination and loss of appetite due to dehydration. Signs of more severe heat exhaustion, such as dizziness, excessive thirst, or rapid heart rate, should be evaluated by a healthcare professional.\n\n4. Incontinentia Pigmenti: This is a rare condition characterized by red, blistering rashes, followed by pigment changes in the skin and iris of the eye. It is important to note that this condition usually presents with other symptoms such as seizures, tooth abnormalities, and developmental delays, in addition to the rash.\n\nGiven your child's increased urination and loss of appetite, it is important to have these symptoms evaluated by your child's pediatrician to rule out any underlying medical conditions. Your pediatrician may be able to provide you with further information or refer you to a specialist if necessary."}

My blood pressure is never low so I m wondering if it s my medication?", "human": "Hello,I think you should check your blood pressure and blood sugar too. Low blood sugar can cause these symptoms and if you are a diabetic taking medication or insulin can be causing this. It doesn't seem related to thyroid issues.Hope I have answered your question. Let me know if I can assist you further. Regards,Dr. Olgeta Xhufka, General & Family Physician", "ai": " Dizziness and blurred vision are not common side effects of Thyroxine (levothyroxine), a medication used to treat hypothyroidism (underactive thyroid gland). However, there are a few possible explanations for your symptoms:\n\n1. Hypotension (low blood pressure): Even though you mentioned that your blood pressure is normally not low, it's important to rule out this possibility. Dizziness, blurred vision, and fainting can be symptoms of low blood pressure. Make sure to get your blood pressure checked regularly, especially when experiencing these symptoms.\n\n2. Hyperthyroidism or Thyrotoxicosis: Thyroxine replacement is used to treat hypothyroidism. However, in some cases, an overreaction of the thyroid gland to the medication can result in hyperthyroidism or thyrotoxicosis. Symptoms of hyperthyroidism include dizziness, rapid heartbeat, tremors, and blurred vision.\n\n3. Medication interactions: Thyroxine can interact with other medications you're taking. Some possible medications that can cause dizziness and blurred vision as side effects include diuretics, antihypertensives, and antidepressants. Make sure to inform your doctor about all the medications you're currently taking.\n\n4. Other factors: Dizziness and blurred vision can have various causes, including but not limited to dehydration, infections, eye problems, and anxiety. If you rule out the above possibilities, consult your doctor to investigate other possible causes.\n\nYour doctor may consider adjusting your Thyroxine dosage, checking your thyroid function tests, and performing a thorough physical examination to evaluate the potential causes of your symptoms. Additionally, they may recommend monitoring your blood pressure or conducting additional tests to rule out other underlying conditions."}
{"question": "Suggest alternative medicine for ciplatrimI was prescribed Ciplatrim with other drugs to assist with my anxiety, depression & binge eating.

If you are at present taking any slimming medication purchased in South Africa that contains sibutramine (Reductil, Ectiva or Ciplatrim), please contact the prescribing doctor or your pharmacist and discuss the risks associated with taking the remaining pills in your possession. 4. A multi-disciplinary approach, including dietary, medical and psychotherapeutic methods, should be undertaken to manage obesity.PS. Use safer options for weight loss such as a balanced, low-fat, low-glycaemic index (GI) diet and regular exercise. It may take longer and you may need to exercise greater self-control, but this is one way of losing weight safely and sensibly.", "ai": " I'm glad you're looking for alternative options, but I must clarify that I cannot prescribe or recommend specific alternative medicines without consulting with a qualified healthcare professional who is familiar with your individual medical history, diagnosis, and current treatment plan.\n\nRegarding Ciplatrim, also known as Cipralex or Escitalopram, it was reportedly withdrawn from the South African market due to supply-chain issues, not safety concerns. The manufacturer, Lundbeck South Africa, could not provide a definite reason for the withdrawal.\n\nAs for alternative medicines, several classes of antidepressants may be prescribed to help manage anxiety, depression, and compulsive eating, such as:\n\n1. Selective Serotonin Reuptake Inhibitors (SSRIs):\nInstead of Ciplatrim/Escitalopram, other SSRIs like fluoxetine (Prozac), sertraline (Zoloft), and paroxetine (Paxil) might be suitable options. These medications can help regulate mood, improve appetite control, and reduce anxiety symptoms.\n\n2. Tricyclic Antidepressants (TCAs):\nThese older antidepressants, such as imipramine (Tofranil) or clomipramine (Anafranil), have shown effectiveness in treating depression and OCD-like symptoms associated with binge eating.\n\n3. Monoamine Oxidase Inhibitors (MAOIs):\nMoclobemide (Aurorix), a reversible MAOI, is a possibility. These medications work by inhibiting the breakdown of certain neurotransmitters, leading to increased levels of these chemicals in the brain.\n\n4. Norepinephrine and Dopamine Reuptake Inhibitors (NDRIs) or Noradrenergic and Specific Serotonergic Antidepressants (NaSSAs):\nBupropion (Aplenzin, Wellbutrin), a non-SSRI antidepressant, has shown promise in managing both depression and binge eating. It acts by inhibiting the reuptake of norepinephrine and dopamine, two neurotransmitters known for their role in mood regulation and reward pathways.\n\n5. Atypical antipsychotics:\nQuetiapine (Seroquel) and olanzapine (Zyprexa) are often used as mood stabilizers and can be helpful in treating anxiety, depression, and compulsive eating. They work by blocking dopamine and serotonin receptors.\n\n6. Herbal and natural remedies:\nSt. John's wort and L-theanine are popular natural supplements for anxiety and depression. However, it's important to consult a healthcare professional before starting any new supplements, as they can interact with other medications and have potential side effects.\n\nAs always, I cannot stress enough the importance of consulting a healthcare professional before starting or discontinuing any medication or alternative treatment. They can best evaluate your current situation and provide you with a personalized treatment plan. Keep in mind that I am just an AI and cannot diagnose, prescribe, or provide medical advice.

However, I can provide some general context about these products and their possible uses.\n\nClear gel, also known as a clear facial sunscreen or sunblock, is an essential component of any skincare routine, especially for individuals with tanning concerns. Prolonged sun exposure can cause hyperpigmentation, which results in darkened patches on the skin, making it appear tanned. Clear gels provide broad-spectrum protection against both UVA and UVB rays, preventing sun damage and helping to maintain an even skin tone.\n\nHydrating creams, like Hyde cream, are crucial for maintaining skin health and addressing dullness. Dullness in the skin occurs when the skin lacks hydration and cells do not turnover evenly. A hydrating cream can help address this by providing essential hydration to the skin and promoting a smoother, more radiant complexion. It is especially beneficial to use at night when the skin is in recovery mode.\n\nHowever, every person's skin is different, and treatments that work for one may not work for another. If you are not satisfied with the results from the clear gel and Hyde cream, it is essential to consult your doctor to discuss alternative options. There are a wide range of skincare products and treatments that can address various concerns such as tanning, dullness, and acne spots. Working with a healthcare professional is essential to determine the best course of action for your unique situation."}

It's essential to consult with your healthcare provider for personalized medical advice.\n\nRegarding your first question, yes, Motrin is a brand name for Ibuprofen, which is an NSAID (Non-Steroidal Anti-Inflammatory Drug) commonly used for pain relief and reducing fever. Acetaminophen (Tylenol) is another type of pain reliever and fever reducer, but it may not be an ideal option for people with Hepatitis C due to the potential risk of liver damage, especially if the liver function is already compromised.\n\nFor alternative pain relief options, consider the following:\n\n1. Paracetamol (Acetaminophen): Your doctor may recommend a short-term use of paracetamol at a lower dose if your liver function is stable. Always consult your provider regarding the proper dosage and frequency.\n\n2. Opioids: In some cases, your doctor might prescribe opioid pain medications, such as codeine or oxycodone, to manage severe pain. However, these drugs come with risks, including addiction, and should only be used under a doctor's supervision.\n\n3. Corticosteroids: In certain situations, your doctor might suggest corticosteroids to reduce inflammation and pain, but these medications have potential side effects, and their use should be closely monitored.\n\n4. Topical pain relievers: Over-the-counter topical creams, gels, or patches containing ingredients like menthol, capsaicin, or lidocaine can provide localized pain relief without affecting liver function.\n\n5. Acupuncture: This ancient Chinese practice involves inserting fine needles into specific points on the body to stimulate energy flow and promote healing. Acupuncture may help alleviate pain and has few side effects.\n\n6. Massage and physical therapy: Gentle massage and other forms of physical therapy, such as heat or cold packs, may help reduce muscle tension and pain.\n\n7. Mind-body techniques: Practicing relaxation techniques like deep breathing, meditation, or progressive muscle relaxation can help manage pain and stress.\n\nYour doctor can help you determine the best pain relief option for your specific situation based on your medical history and current liver function. Keep in mind that everyone's experience with Hepatitis C is unique, so it's crucial to discuss your symptoms and treatment options with your healthcare provider."}

This issue could be related to various conditions. Here are some possibilities, but it's vital to consult a healthcare professional for a proper diagnosis:\n\n1. Medications: Some medications can cause stools to appear gel-like. For instance, psyllium husk (Metamucil), a common fiber supplement, can make stools gelatinous when taken with insufficient water. Similarly, certain antibiotics and antidepressants might produce this effect.\n\n2. Dietary fiber supplements: As mentioned earlier, some fiber supplements, especially if not taken with enough water, can cause gel-like stools.\n\n3. Intestinal motility disorders: Chronic intestinal conditions like irritable bowel syndrome (IBS), chronic constipation, and gastroparesis can affect the normal movement of food through the intestines, resulting in altered stool consistency. Gel-like stools can be a symptom of these conditions.\n\n4. Dairy intolerance: Having an intolerance to lactose or other milk sugar in dairy products can lead to this type of stool. Gel-like stools can result from the fermentation of undigested lactose in the large intestine.\n\n5. Inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD): IBD, including Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis, can cause changes in bowel habits and stool consistency, including producing gel-like stools.\n\n6. Bacterial overgrowth: Bacterial overgrowth, especially in the small intestine, can result in bowel disturbances and impacted stools, which may appear gelatinous.\n\nTo confirm the underlying cause of your gel-like stools, consult with your healthcare professional or a gastroenterologist, who can perform various diagnostic tests or refer you to a specialist as needed."}

{"question": "How to treat dry skin,bumps and itchiness in pubic area after shaving?Hey, Im a very sexually active person and I masturbate alot. Around my pubic area there is dry skin and I feel bumps deep in my skin. I shave about every couple of weeks. If its itching and I have puss bumps every once in a while and my skin looks abnormal from time to time might there be something wrong or is this normal who are like me?", "human": "Thanks for asking in healthcaremagic forumIN short: Go for trimming of pubic area by trimmerExplanation: Shaving can cause boils/itching, so the best method is to use trimmer and trim the pubic hair. By trimming you will get rid of itching and boils for ever, unless you injure while trimming. Hope this helps you. Please let me know.", "ai": " I cannot definitively diagnose a condition based on the information provided, but I can suggest some common causes and solutions for the symptoms you're experiencing in the pubic area after shaving.\n\n1. Dry skin: Shaving can strip the skin of natural oils, leaving it dry and sensitive. Moisturize regularly, ideally after shaving, to keep the skin hydrated. Look for fragrance-free lotions or creams specifically designed for sensitive skin.\n2. Bumps (folliculitis): Shaving can irritate hair follicles, leading to bumps, redness, and sometimes pus-filled pimples (folliculitis). To prevent folliculitis, avoid shaving too closely, shave gently, use a clean, sharp razor, exfoliate before shaving, and avoid using hot water. If you experience frequent or severe folliculitis, consider switching to hair removal methods other than shaving, such as waxing or laser hair removal.\n3. Itching: Dry skin, irritation from shaving, or the presence of yeast or bacteria can cause itching. Consider applying a fragrance-free lotion or antiperspirant containing hydrocortisone to help alleviate itching. Wear breathable, dry clothing and avoid tight-fitting garments.\n4. Abnormal or discolored skin: Shaving can sometimes cause temporary discoloration or roughness. Regular exfoliation, using a gentle exfoliating cream or scrub, can help improve the appearance of the skin. If discoloration persists, it may be a sign of a more serious condition, such as a skin infection or hormonal imbalance. Consult a healthcare professional for evaluation.\n\nIt's normal to experience some degree of dryness, bumps, and itching after shaving, especially if you masturbate frequently, as friction from your hands can irritate the skin. However, if your symptoms are severe, persistent, or accompanied by pus, large bumps, or unusual discoloration, seek medical advice from a healthcare professional. They may recommend further testing or treatment, depending on the underlying cause."}
{"question": "Suggest medication to control hair fall and dandruffHello Sir,I am Mina from Hyderabad, I work in an MNC and got very hectic schedule every day.

Please suggest me good and effective medicines and Hair oil or hair tonic for hair loss.ThanksMina", "human": "Hi Mina,,,Welcome to HCM- Yes and dandruff both can be the cause of hairfall..- For dandruff use Keraglo-AD shampoo along with keraglo-AD stay on   lotion at night time over the scalp.- If not able to take a nutritious diet than you may go for hair vitamin   supplement like Cap. Keraglo-Eva once a day after food.- Try not to take stress,,, include exercise of 30 minutes a day in your   regime it will help you destress also.Hope this will help", "ai": " Hello Mina, I'm sorry to hear about your hair fall concerns and the added stress of a hectic work schedule. I'd be happy to help you find some effective solutions foryour hair problems.\n\nFor hair fall, you can consider the following medications:\n\n1. Minoxidil (Rogaine): Minoxidil is an FDA-approved medication for pattern baldness in both men and women. It works by stimulating the hair follicles, promoting hair growth, and preventing hair loss.\n2. Finasteride (Propecia, Proscar): Finasteride is an FDA-approved medication for male pattern baldness. It works by inhibiting the conversion of testosterone to dihydrotestosterone (DHT), which is a major cause of hair loss.\n3. Vitamins and Minerals: Deficiencies in vitamins and minerals like biotin, iron, zinc, and vitamin D can lead to hair loss. Taking a multivitamin supplement or a specific hair growth supplement can help address these deficiencies.\n4. Anti-androgenic medications: For women with hair loss related to hormonal imbalances, anti-androgenic medications like Spironolactone and Flutamide may be recommended.\n5. Herbal remedies: Some herbs like Saw Palmetto, Ginseng, and Nettle have been found to slow down hair loss and promote hair growth. However, it's important to consult with a healthcare professional before taking any herbal remedies.\n\nFor dandruff, you can try the following medications and treatments:\n\n1. Anti-dandruff shampoos: Over-the-counter anti-dandruff shampoos containing ingredients like Ketoconazole, Piroctone Olamine, Tea Tree Oil, or Zinc Pyrithione can help control dandruff.\n2. Tar-based shampoos: Prescription tar-based shampoos can be effective in treating severe cases of dandruff.\n3. Dietary changes: A diet rich in essential fatty acids, B vitamins, zinc, and iron can help reduce dandruff.\n4. Apple cider vinegar rinse: Mix equal parts of apple cider vinegar and water, and use it as a final rinse after shampooing. The acidity of the vinegar can help control the pH balance of the scalp and reduce dandruff.\n\nFor hair loss and dandruff, you can also consider using hair oils like coconut oil, Bhringraj oil, or Jojoba oil to nourish your scalp and hair. These oils can improve blood circulation, control dandruff, and promote hair growth. You can also try a hair tonic like Wave Set Mud, which contains natural ingredients that promote hair growth and help control dandruff.\n\nIt's important to note that everyone's hair concerns are unique, and what works for one person may not work for another. I would recommend consulting with a healthcare professional or a trichologist to determine the underlying cause of your hair loss and dandruff and to find a personalized solution that suits your needs.\n\nI hope this information helps you in managing your hair concerns. If you have any further questions, please don't hesitate to ask."}
{"question": "Suggest remedies for scabbing due to tattoosHi, I have 5 day old tattoo. It is covering a large section of my upper and lower arm. The tattoo is quite dense so there is allot of scabbing. It seems to be healing well and there is no sign of infection, however, there is a very odd odour. It does not smell foul, just unpleasant, almost like a squished insect, as bizarre as that may sound. What could be causing this, also, is is cause for concern?", "human": "Hello ,I understand your concern.

If you have allergy, body is trying to react on paint and try to remove the paint.I advice you to maintain the hygiene. frequent cleaning can help improve the condition.Avoid direct sunlight to the skin. this can cause allergic reaction more prominent.Please wear cotton clothes only. polyester clothes can cause more allergic reaction.I will be happy to answer your further concern you can contact me here or you can contact me on bit.ly/DrArunWe wish you a best health at healthcare magic. Thank you,Dr. Arun TankIf you are satisfied with my answer rate me as five star and close the answer", "ai": " I cannot definitively determine the cause of the odd odor coming from your tattoo without examining it in person. However, I can suggest some possible causes and remedies for the scabbing.\n\n1. Scabbing is a normal part of the tattoo healing process. The ink particles penetrate the epidermis, causing a wound, and as the skin heals, the scabs form to protect the new tattooed skin. However, if the scabs are excessive, itchy, or causing discomfort, you can take the following steps to alleviate the issue:\n\n- Keep the tattoo moisturized: Use a fragrance-free, hypoallergenic lotion or aftercare balm specifically formulated for tattoos. Apply the product two to three times a day to keep the tattoo hydrated and help prevent scabbing.\n- Refrain from picking or scratching the scabs: Allow the scabs to heal naturally, as picking or scratching can lead to infection and delayed healing.\n\n2. The odd odor from your tattoo may be due to a few possible reasons:\n\n- Plasma: During the tattooing process, small amounts of plasma may rise to the surface. Plasma is the straw-colored liquid that forms when blood clots. This may cause a slight odor.\n- Ink: Some tattoo inks contain impurities or preservatives that can produce an odor as they break down during the healing process.\n- Excessive Sweating: Sweat may mix with the tattoo ink and cause an odor as it sits on the skin.\n\n3. Although the odor is not foul, it may be cause for concern. I would recommend contacting your tattoo artist or a medical professional for further evaluation. They may be able to provide more insight into the issue and ensure that the tattoo is healing properly and free from infection. It's always better to err on the side of caution when dealing with potential health concerns."}
{"question": "Q. What do right bundle branch block and mild mitral regurgitation mean?Hello doctor,My 18-year-old son got an ECG and blood tests last month as a requirement for medical screening. He jogs every night for 30 minutes. He looks healthy. We consulted our cardiologist early this month and he requested for 2D Echo and treadmill stress test. Unfortunately, we were scheduled for a consult but now we have lockdown for Covid-19. I hope you can help me understand the condition of my son. Thank you.", "human": "Hi. Could you upload his ECG (electrocardiogram) if it has been taken and also his echo and treadmill results?", "ai": " I'd be happy to help explain the conditions your son was diagnosed with based on the information you have provided.\n\nRight Bundle Branch Block (RBBB) is a type of electrical conduction disorder, which means that the electrical signals in the heart do not travel through the right bundle branch in a normal way. This can result in a slight delay or abnormality in the electrical signal as it travels through the heart, which may show up on an electrocardiogram (ECG) as a specific pattern. This condition is usually benign and does not typically cause any symptoms or harm unless it is associated with other heart abnormalities, such as a structural problem with the heart. In your son's case, the presence of RBBB was likely an incidental finding on his ECG and does not necessarily mean that there is any underlying heart condition.\n\nMild Mitral Regurgitation (MMR) is a type of heart valve dysfunction, specifically affecting the mitral valve in the heart. The mitral valve separates the left atrium (upper chamber) from the left ventricle (lower chamber) of the heart. When the heart contracts, the mitral valve closes to prevent the backflow of blood from the left ventricle into the left atrium. With mild mitral regurgitation, there is some leakage of blood from the left ventricle back into the left atrium during contraction, but this leakage is usually small and does not cause significant symptoms or harm in most cases. This condition is often observed in older adults or those with certain underlying heart conditions, but in your son's case, it is unclear what may be causing the MMR, as additional investigations will be needed to determine the severity and underlying cause of this finding.\n\nI would recommend that you follow up with your cardiologist as soon as possible to discuss these findings and any next steps for further evaluation and management. In the meantime, it may be reassuring to know that both RBBB and Mild Mitral Regurgitation are relatively common findings and are often benign. However, as your son's cardiologist has identified these conditions, it is important to follow their recommendations for further evaluation to ensure that there are no underlying heart conditions that require treatment. I hope this explanation was helpful, and please let me know if you have any further questions. Stay safe!"}
{"question": "What is the treatment for cancer in chest cavity and aorta?My dad was just told he has cancer in his chest cavity and it is in a ribbon fashion and is around his aorta, just wondering how often this happens. Havent done a biopsy yet, scheduling one for him! I know it s very serious, just need to know what to expect?", "human": "If your dad was told he has cancer in his chest cavity then u must immediately do CT scan of chest with contrast.Also if a space occupying lesion is found in his chest cavity then biopsy from that lesion along with immunohistochemistry test to determine the primary site is necessary.I would also recommend he does a CT scan of abdomen and Bone Scan to find which stage of cancer he is in.RegardsDR De", "ai": " I'm an assistant and not a doctor, but I can try to help you understand some general information about the treatment options for cancer that has spread to the chest cavity and aorta. Please keep in mind that this information is not a substitute for professional medical advice, and your dad should consult with his healthcare team for specific recommendations.\n\nMalignant mesothelioma is a common type of cancer that forms in the lining of the chest cavity, known as the pleura. When it spreads to the aorta, it's a rare but serious complication. The treatment for this condition often involves a multimodal approach, which may include a combination of surgery, chemotherapy, and radiation therapy.\n\n1. Surgery: Depending on the extent of the tumor and its location, your dad's healthcare team may recommend surgical intervention. Surgeries like pleurectomy, decortication, or extirpation can be used to remove as much of the tumor as possible. However, these surgeries can be complex, and the risks, benefits, and potential outcomes will vary from person to person.\n\n2. Chemotherapy: Chemotherapy is often used as a systemic treatment to help kill any remaining cancer cells and prevent further growth or spread of the disease. There are several chemotherapy drugs that may be used, and the specific combination and dosage will depend on your dad's individual needs. Chemotherapy can be administered intravenously, orally, or through a catheter, and the duration of treatment will depend on the response to therapy and the individual's overall health.\n\n3. Radiation therapy: Radiation therapy, also known as radiotherapy, can be used to help shrink the tumor and alleviate symptoms like pain or difficulty breathing. This therapy can be delivered externally, using a machine to direct targeted radiation beams to the affected areas, or internally, by placing radioactive seeds directly into the tumor. The duration of treatment can vary from a few days to several weeks.\n\n4. Multimodal therapy: In cases where the tumor is large or has spread extensively, a combination of treatment modalities may be used, such as surgery followed by chemotherapy and/or radiation therapy.\n\nIt's important to note that the treatment for mesothelioma involving the aorta is complex and requires a high level of expertise. Therefore, it's essential that your dad is treated at a specialized cancer center where he will have access to experienced healthcare professionals and state-of-the-art facilities.\n\nAs for the frequency of this condition, it is relatively rare. According to the American Cancer Society, only about 3,000 new cases of mesothelioma are diagnosed each year in the United States, and only a small percentage of those cases have tumors that extend to the aorta. It is usually caused by asbestos exposure.\n\nI'm here to help answer any questions you may have, but I encourage you to speak with your dad's healthcare team regularly for the most accurate and up-to-date information regarding his diagnosis and treatment options. This conversation can be a starting point for your family to better understand his condition and what lies ahead."}

Please suggest what I should do now?", "human": "Hello. From your description, it is clear that you have inflammation of foreskin and glans penis, which is called balanoposthitis in medical parlance. Usually, this does not occur in normal persons, if one can keep the undersurface of foreskin clean once a day. However, cleaning the same during inflammation is difficult. So you need to take antibiotics as well as anti-inflammatory agents for a week and then, can undergo circumcision as you have a tight foreskin. It is not a life-threatening condition. Please get back to me if you need any more clarification.", "ai": " I'm an AI language model and not a doctor, but I can suggest some general steps you can take based on the information provided. However, please consult with your healthcare professional for personalized advice.\n\n1. Keep the area clean: Wash your penis with warm water and mild soap daily to maintain hygiene. After washing, dry the area thoroughly to prevent moisture buildup.\n2. Practice good hygiene: Wear clean underwear and loose-fitting clothing to allow air circulation and minimize irritation.\n3. Apply a topical corticosteroid: Over-the-counter or prescription topical corticosteroid creams can help reduce inflammation and itching. Be sure to follow the instructions provided with the cream.\n4. Use a moisturizing emollient: Apply a moisturizing cream or oil to the affected area daily to help soothe inflammation and maintain skin moisture.\n5. Practice gentle cleaning: When cleaning under the foreskin, use gentle circular motions instead of pulling the foreskin back forcefully. This can help minimize irritation and discomfort.\n6. Consider circumcision: If your doctor believes that your symptoms are due to phimosis or a tight foreskin, they may suggest circumcision as a long-term solution. Circumcision involves the surgical removal of the foreskin, which can help alleviate symptoms and improve hygiene.\n7. Avoid irritating substances: Avoid using harsh soaps, detergents, or fragrant products on the affected area. Additionally, avoid using harsh chemicals, such as pool chlorine or hot tub chemicals, as they can irritate the skin and exacerbate symptoms.\n8. Practice safe sex: Use condoms during sexual activity to protect against STIs and reduce irritation caused by friction.\n9. Take prescribed medication: If your healthcare professional has prescribed medication, be sure to take it as directed to address the underlying cause of your symptoms.\n10. Consider wearing a compression ring: A compression ring, also known as a Dorsal Fin, can help alleviate pain caused by balanoposthitis by keeping the foreskin retracted. However, it is not a long-term solution and should only be used under medical supervision.\n11. Maintain a healthy lifestyle: Regular exercise, a balanced diet, and stress management can help improve overall health and support the body's natural ability to fight infection and promote healing.\n\nIt is essential to follow your healthcare professional's recommendations for managing your symptoms. If your condition worsens or you experience severe pain, consult your doctor for further evaluation and treatment."}

But combined hormonal pills usually prevent the pregnancy. And also PCOD can recur. So lifestyle modifications, maintaining ideal body weight etc are important in treating PCOD. You can use the apcod sachets and other drugs recommend by your doctor. They won't prevent pregnancy and also ovashield helps in ovulation induction. Let your husband undergo seminal analysis once to rule out the male factor problem. Then you can go for follicular study and can plan intercourse around the time of ovulation. This will increase the possibility of pregnancy. Take care.", "ai": " I'm sorry to hear about your struggle with getting pregnant despite having Polycystic Ovary Syndrome (PCOS) and trying various medications. It's important to note that I am an AI language model and not a doctor, but I can provide some general information and suggestions based on the data provided.\n\nFirstly, I understand that the diagnosis of PCOS and attempting to conceive can be a complex and emotionally challenging process. It's important to have open and ongoing communication with your healthcare provider about your concerns and treatment options.\n\nRegarding your current treatment plan, you are taking medications such as apcod sachets, ovaashield tabs, and folvite tabs for ovulation support. Ovulation induction with medication can be an effective treatment for PCOS-related infertility. However, it may take time, and the success rate can vary depending on individual factors.\n\nHere are some things that you can do to improve your chances of getting pregnant:\n\n1. Work closely with your healthcare provider: Discuss the effectiveness of your current treatment plan and any side effects you may be experiencing. Your healthcare provider may recommend adjusting your dosage, adding or removing medications, or exploring other treatment options, such as intrauterine insemination (IUI) or in vitro fertilization (IVF).\n\n2. Monitor your ovulation: You can use ovulation prediction kits or other methods like basal body temperature charting to help determine when you are most fertile. Intercourse during this time can increase the chances of getting pregnant.\n\n3. Adopt a healthy lifestyle: Maintaining a healthy weight, eating a balanced diet, getting regular physical activity, and managing stress can all improve your overall fertility health and increase the chances of getting pregnant.\n\n4. Consider seeking support: The journey to getting pregnant can be emotionally challenging, and it's important to have a support system in place. Consider joining a fertility support group or working with a therapist to help you cope with the stress and emotional aspects of infertility.\n\nRemember, every individual is unique, and there is no one-size-fits-all answer to this question. Your healthcare provider is the best resource for your situation, and they can help you navigate your treatment options and provide personalized guidance. I wish you the best of luck on your journey to getting pregnant."}

However, please keep in mind that you should consult a healthcare professional for an accurate diagnosis. The symptoms your husband is experiencing, popping sensation at the base of the skull, dizziness, and fainting, are often associated with several conditions. Here are some possibilities:\n\n1. Vertebrobasilar insufficiency: This condition is caused by reduced blood flow to the vertebral-basilar system, which supplies the brainstem and cerebellum. The lack of blood flow can lead to symptoms such as popping or cracking sounds in the neck, vertigo, dizziness, and even syncope (fainting).\n2. Migraine with aura: Some people experience aura symptoms before a migraine, which may include visual symptoms (like seeing flashing lights or zigzag lines), sensitivity to light and sound, and vertigo or dizziness. This can sometimes be accompanied by a popping sound.\n3. Benign positional vertigo (BPV): This condition usually causes brief, intense episodes of dizziness or vertigo that are triggered by specific head movements or positions. This might not explain the popping sensation, but it can contribute to the overall symptoms.\n4. Other less common causes: There may be other, rarer conditions that could cause these symptoms, such as a brainstem tumor or a condition called \"cervicogenic dizziness.\"\n\nIt's important to remember that your husband has already undergone several tests, and they didn't find anything abnormal. However, some conditions may not be detectable with these tests alone. It would be best to discuss these possibilities with his healthcare professional and consider any additional tests or treatments that they may suggest."}

So do not worry about duration if the kid is active.Regards - Dr. Sumanth", "ai": " Recurring fevers in an infant, particularly one that persists despite the use of fever-reducing medications like acetaminophen (Tylenol) and ibuprofen (Motrin), can be concerning. While I'm not a doctor and cannot diagnose your infant based on the information provided, I can help you understand some possible causes.\n\nFever in infants can be caused by a variety of conditions, including infections (bacterial, viral, or parasitic), chronic conditions, or even side effects of vaccinations. Recurring fevers could indicate an ongoing infection that is not fully responds to antibiotics, a persistent viral infection, or an underlying medical condition.\n\nIt's important to follow up with your infant's pediatrician as soon as possible if their fever continues or recurs despite treatment. They may want to perform additional tests to determine the cause, such as blood tests, urine tests, or imaging studies. In the meantime, make sure your infant stays hydrated and is getting enough fluids to prevent dehydration, which can worsen the effects of a fever.\n\nPossible causes of recurring fevers include:\n\n1. Urinary tract infections (UTIs): These infections can cause recurring fevers, especially in young girls.\n2.

However, you should consult a healthcare professional for an accurate diagnosis.\n\nA cough that starts in the throat and becomes chesty could be a sign of several conditions, including the common cold, the flu, allergies, or something more serious like bronchitis or asthma. A bad taste in the mouth could be a side effect of certain medications, or it could be related to infections such as postnasal drip from a cold or the flu, gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD), or dental issues.\n\nWhile the flu is a common cause of both a cough and a bad taste in the mouth, these symptoms on their own do not necessarily indicate the flu. The presence of other symptoms, such as fever, body aches, and fatigue, would be more indicative of the flu. However, given the recent spread of the flu, it's still a possibility.\n\nIf you're concerned about your symptoms, I would recommend calling your healthcare provider or scheduling an appointment to discuss your concerns. They can evaluate your symptoms and determine if further testing is necessary. In the meantime, you can try some general measures to help alleviate your symptoms, such as drinking plenty of fluids, using a humidifier, avoiding irritants like smoking or strong perfumes, and gargling with salt water to soothe a sore throat.

PE can be treated with various methods, and the most effective one often depends on the underlying cause. Here are some common methods to treat PE:\n\n1. Techniques to delay ejaculation:\n- Squeeze technique: Masturbate until you feel close to ejaculating, and then stop and rest for a few minutes before continuing. Repeat this process several times to train your body to delay ejaculation.\n- Stop-start method: During sexual intercourse, when you feel you are about to ejaculate, withdraw and start again. Repeat this process until you are ready to continue penetration.\n- Edging: Masturbate until you reach the point of no return (where you are about to ejaculate), then stop. Wait until the urge to ejaculate has passed, and then start again. Repeat this process several times to help condition your body to last longer in sexual activities.\n\n2. Sexual exercises:\n- Pelvic floor exercises: These exercises strengthen the muscles in your pelvic area, which can help you control your ejaculation. Contract and hold the muscles for a few seconds, then release, and do this several times. Repeat this exercise several times a day.\n\n3. Lifestyle modifications:\n- Reduce stress: Engage in relaxation techniques like meditation, yoga, or deep breathing exercises.\n- Increase physical activity: Regular exercise can improve blood flow to the sex organs and help reduce stress.\n- Healthy diet: Eat a balanced diet and avoid foods and drinks that can negatively impact your sexual health.\n\n4. Medications:\nIf the above methods do not work, your doctor may prescribe medications like selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) or phosphodiesterase-5 inhibitors (PDE-5 inhibitors) to help delay ejaculation.\n\n5. Counseling:\nSometimes, psychological factors like anxiety or relationship issues can contribute to PE. In such cases, seeking help from a sex therapist or counselor can be beneficial.\n\nIt's essential to consult a healthcare professional for a proper diagnosis and treatment plan, as each case is unique. Your doctor can help determine the underlying cause of your PE and recommend the most effective solution. It is important to remember that treatment can take time, and patience is required."}

Common treatments include:\n\n1. Medications: Several types of medications are used to treat RA, including nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs (DMARDs), and biologic agents.\n2. Physical therapy: Regular exercise, such as swimming or walking, can help maintain joint mobility and strength.\n3. Joint protection: Using assistive devices, such as braces or canes, and modifying daily activities can help reduce stress on affected joints.\n4. Lifestyle modifications: Maintaining a healthy weight, getting enough rest, and practicing stress management techniques can help improve symptoms.\n\nWhile RA cannot be cured, early and effective treatment can help slow down the progression of joint damage and improve long-term outcomes. Your healthcare provider will work with you to develop an individualized treatment plan based on the severity of your condition.

Hope this answers your query. Available for further clarifications.Good luck. Take care.", "ai": " I'm not a doctor, but I can provide you some general information that might help. However, it is essential to consult with a healthcare professional, such as a urologist or a sexual health specialist, to receive an accurate diagnosis and personalized treatment recommendations.\n\nThe condition you're describing is called Peyronie's disease. It is characterized by the formation of scar tissue in the penis, leading to a curvature and causing pain during intercourse. Overindulgence in masturbation during your teenage and early adult years might have aggravated this condition by disrupting normal penis development or causing excessive strain on the penis tissues.\n\nSeveral treatments, both medical and surgical, can help alleviate symptoms and correct the curvature. Here are some options that have shown promising results:\n\n1. Medications: Pharmaceutical treatments like collagenase injections (Xiaflex), oral tablet (Verapamil), or topical agents can help break down scar tissue, reducing the curvature. Your doctor may perform an ultrasound to identify the location of the plaque and determine the most appropriate treatment for your condition.\n\n2. Physical therapy: Certain exercises, such as penile traction devices and stretching, have been shown to help straighten the penis and improve the flexibility of the corpora cavernosa (the erectile tissue in the penis). Working with a healthcare professional to develop a customized therapy plan can bring optimal results.\n\n3. Surgery: In severe cases, surgery may be the best option to correct the curvature and eliminate pain during intercourse. Different surgical procedures can be employed, such as penile implant, plaque removal, and grafting techniques. Consult a healthcare professional to discuss the potential risks and benefits of this treatment option.\n\n4. Lifestyle modifications: Incorporating a healthy lifestyle into your routine can also help ease the discomfort caused by Peyronie's disease. Some recommendations include:\n- Quitting smoking\n- Reducing alcohol intake\n- Practicing stress management techniques (relaxation, meditation, yoga, etc.)\n- Eating a balanced diet\n\nIt is essential to follow your healthcare professional's recommendations carefully and stick to your treatment plan to achieve the best possible results. Remember, everyone's condition is unique, and what works for one person might not work for another. Therefore, it is crucial to consult with a trusted healthcare provider for accurate information and a personalized treatment plan."}

Dob 05/12/2010 have notive a difference in apperance for a couple of weeks but didn t think any thing of it until the DR. exam to day that discovered the large difference", "human": "Both look same as always a little difference matters less importance. as long as there is no pain and swelling or redness.", "ai": " A significant size discrepancy between the two testicles in a 1-year-old can be a cause for concern, as it may indicate an underlying condition. One possible cause is a condition called testicular microlithiasis, which is characterized by the presence of small, calcium deposits in the testicle, causing it to feel harder and possibly be larger than the normal testicle. However, testicular microlithiasis is usually asymptomatic and found incidentally, and the size difference in your child's case may be due to other causes, such as:\n\n1. Developmental differences: Testicles develop at different rates in the womb and can continue to grow at different paces after birth. This difference in growth rate may lead to a noticeable size discrepancy.\n2. Inguinal hernia: An inguinal hernia is a condition where the intestine pushes through the muscle wall in the groin, often causing a swelling or bulge. This swelling can be confused with a larger testicle.\n3. Varicocele: A varicocele is a dilated vein in the testicle, which can make it feel larger and look darker.\n4. Hydrocele or spermatocele: These are fluid-filled cysts that can form in the testicle or the tunica vaginalis, the sack that holds the testicle. Hydroceles are more common in infants and can cause the affected testicle to feel larger than the normal one.\n5. Torsion or twisting of the testicle: This condition occurs when the testicle twists off its blood supply, causing it to swell and feel larger. It can be painful, and the testicle may also appear red or darker in color.\n6. Malignancy: However, in rare cases, a noticeable difference in testicle size in an infant can be a sign of a testicular tumor.\n\nIt is important to consult a pediatrician or a pediatric urologist to evaluate the size difference and determine the underlying cause. The doctor may perform a physical examination and order imaging studies, such as ultrasound, to help make a diagnosis. Treatment may vary depending on the underlying cause, but early diagnosis and intervention can improve outcomes and prevent complications."}

It needs no treatment unless and until a child is symptomatic. I would recommend you to go for urine culture and sensitivity report before starting antibiotics as it is a more definitive test for urinary tract infections. As such, most common reason for fever in this age is self limiting viral infections which need just symptomatic treatment like acetaminophen for fever. Hopefully this will help you.

This is based on normal reference ranges for urine analysis in children. However, a sudden fever without an apparent cause warrants further evaluation, and your child's doctor has already prescribed antibiotics, likely due to the presence of bacteria in the urine.\n\nIt's crucial to follow the doctor's recommendations for treatment and complete the full course of antibiotics prescribed. If your child's symptoms persist, worsen or if you have any concerns, don't hesitate to contact your child's healthcare provider. It's essential to remember that every child is unique, and their medical situation may differ from another child's.

For further information consult a paediatrician online -->https://www.icliniq.com/ask-a-doctor-online/paediatrician", "ai": " Thank you for reaching out to me with this concern. Based on the provided information, I would recommend observing the infant's symptoms closely and considering surgical repair once they reach an appropriate age and weight, typically around 12-18 months old.\n\nAn inguinal hernia in a 3-month-old infant is not usually an emergency situation, but it is essential to monitor for potential complications such as incarceration or strangulation of the hernia contents.\n\nThe following symptoms require immediate evaluation and potential surgical intervention:\n\n1. Pain, swelling, or redness in the groin area\n2. A visible bulge or mass in the groin\n3. Signs of bowel obstruction, such as vomiting, diarrhea, decreased appetite, or inconsolable crying\n4. Abnormal behavior, such as excessive irritability or difficulty feeding\n5. Lack of improvement or progression of symptoms\n\nAssuming the infant remains symptom-free, you can consider scheduling surgery once they meet the following criteria:\n\n1. An adequate weight gain (around 12-15 lb or 5-7 kg)\n2. A stable growth pattern\n3. Adequate feeding and swallowing abilities\n4. The absence of significant complications\n\nRegular follow-up appointments with your pediatrician or a surgeon will help determine the optimal time for hernia repair.\n\nI strongly recommend keeping a close eye on the infant's condition and discussing any concerns with your healthcare provider promptly. If you notice any concerning symptoms or have questions, do not hesitate to contact your healthcare team for guidance.\n\nIn the meantime, you may help your colleague support their son by practicing the following measures:\n\n1. Keep the affected area clean and free from soiling\n2. Avoid lifting heavy objects, especially with the affected side\n3. Encourage proper diapering techniques to minimize pressure on the hernia\n4. Ensure proper positioning to reduce strain on the hernia\n\nI hope this information helps provide some clarity on managing your colleague's son's inguinal hernia. Please do not hesitate to reach out if you have any further questions or concerns.\n\nPlease note that this information is meant for informational purposes only and should not replace personalized medical advice from a qualified healthcare professional."}

The optimum blood pressure range for young, healthy adults, as per the AHA guidelines, is less than 120/80 mmHg.\n\nHowever, having a systolic blood pressure of 133 mmHg, which is slightly above the optimum range, is generally not a cause for concern for a healthy 23-year-old man who engages in regular physical activity. It is important to note, however, that maintaining a healthy blood pressure is crucial for overall cardiovascular health.\n\nRegular exercise, a balanced diet, and avoiding unhealthy habits such as smoking and excessive alcohol consumption can all contribute to maintaining a healthy blood pressure. If you have concerns about your blood pressure or any other health-related issues, it's always a good idea to consult with a healthcare professional for a comprehensive evaluation.\n\nHere are some tips to further support maintaining a healthy blood pressure:\n\n* Keep up the regular exercise routine: aim for at least 150 minutes of moderate-intensity aerobic activity or 75 minutes of vigorous-intensity aerobic activity per week.\n* Maintain a balanced diet rich in fruits, vegetables, lean proteins, and whole grains. Limit your intake of saturated and trans fats, sodium, and processed foods.\n* Stay hydrated by drinking plenty of water.\n* Manage stress through relaxation techniques, such as deep breathing, meditation, and progressive muscle relaxation.\n* Avoid smoking and limit your alcohol consumption.\n* Consider getting your blood pressure checked routinely by your doctor or healthcare professional during annual check-ups.\n\nRemember, being proactive about your health and taking steps to maintain a healthy blood pressure can help reduce your risk for developing cardiovascular diseases later in life."}

However, I can help you understand some possible causes of the lack of emotional feelings you're experiencing in your relationship based on information provided by mental health professionals and research.\n\n1. Trauma: Traumatic experiences, such as emotional or physical abuse, can lead to a decrease in emotional responsiveness. The brain may shut down emotional processing as a coping mechanism to protect itself.\n2. Depression: Depression can affect your ability to feel emotions, making it difficult to experience pleasure or sadness. You may also have trouble responding to situations as you typically would.\n3. Complex PTSD: If you've experienced a prolonged traumatic event, you might develop complex PTSD, which can affect various aspects of your life, including emotional processing. Symptoms may include intense emotional reactions to specific triggers, dissociation, and emotional numbness.\n4. Relationship issues: If you've been in a prolonged toxic or emotionally abusive relationship, your brain might learn to shut down emotions as a coping mechanism. This can make it challenging to feel emotions outside of that relationship.\n5. Burnout: Constant emotional exhaustion can lead to emotional numbness. This is common in caregivers, individuals in high-stress jobs, or those dealing with chronic health issues.\n\nWhile I cannot diagnose you, I recommend speaking with a mental health professional about your symptoms. They can help you determine the underlying cause and provide appropriate treatment, such as therapy or medication.\n\nIn the meantime, consider practicing self-care activities that promote emotional healing, such as journaling, meditation, yoga, or engaging in activities that bring you pleasure. Building healthy relationships with supportive people can also help improve your emotional well-being."}

Are there any other natural ways to stop the stinging?", "human": "Hello, Infective causes like urethritis or urinary tract infection must be ruled out. A urine culture is required to look for any signs of infection. If there is any fractures of infection, antibiotics must be started. Nothing much to worry as most of the cases respond well to antibiotics. Hope I have answered your query. Let me know if I can assist you further. Take care Regards,Dr. Shinas Hussain", "ai": " While it's understandable that you may feel embarrassed, it's important to address potential health concerns, including this stinging sensation during urination after masturbation. In some cases, it could be a sign of a urinary tract infection (UTI), but other causes such as irritation or injury are also possible.\n\nHere are some natural ways to help alleviate the discomfort and may help prevent UTIs:\n\n1. Stay hydrated: Drink plenty of water to help flush bacteria out of your system.\n2. Cranberry juice: Consume cranberry juice or cranberry tablets, as the fruits may help prevent bacteria from adhering to the urinary tract walls.\n3. Avoid caffeine and alcohol: These substances can irritate the bladder and worsen symptoms, so it's best to avoid them.\n4. Probiotics: Incorporate probiotics into your diet to help maintain the balance of bacteria in your urinary tract.\n5. Cleanliness: Ensure proper hygiene, especially when wiping from back to front after using the toilet and after masturbating.\n6. Avoid tight clothing: Wear loose-fitting clothing and breathable underwear to promote air circulation and prevent bacterial growth.\n7. Urinate frequently: Empty your bladder regularly to prevent bacteria from accumulating.\n8. Warm bath: Soaking in a warm bath can help alleviate discomfort.\n\nHowever, if your symptoms do not improve or if they worsen, you should consider visiting a healthcare professional. A UTI, if left untreated, can lead to more significant health issues, and your healthcare provider can provide you with proper diagnosis and treatment.\n\nIt's important to remember that seeking medical help is a necessary part of taking care of your health and well-being. The embarrassment or discomfort you may feel is temporary, but neglecting potential health issues can lead to long-term consequences."}

Udiliv 300 (pioglitazone) is a thiazolidinedione medication that is often used to treat non-alcoholic fatty liver disease, a common type of fatty liver in which the accumulation of fat is not caused by alcohol consumption.\n\nThere are several other medications that have been used to treat non-alcoholic fatty liver disease, including:\n\n1. Vitamin E: High doses (400-800 International Units per day) of vitamin E have been shown to improve liver function and reduce liver fat in people with non-alcoholic fatty liver disease.\n2. Omega-3 fatty acids: Supplements of omega-3 fatty acids (such as fish oil) have been shown to have beneficial effects on liver fat and inflammation in non-alcoholic fatty liver disease.\n3. Statins: Statins are medications commonly used to treat high cholesterol, but they have also been shown to improve liver enzymes and reduce liver fat in people with non-alcoholic fatty liver disease.\n4. Metformin: Metformin is a medication commonly used to treat type 2 diabetes, and it has also been shown to have beneficial effects on liver function and liver fat in people with non-alcoholic fatty liver disease.\n5.

If you are unable to obtain Udiliv 300 or the other medications you are currently taking, you should speak with your healthcare provider to explore alternative options. You may be able to obtain a prescription for a similar medication or a medication that is available in your new location. It is also a good idea to research the availability and costs of medications where you will be living and to consider bringing an adequate supply of medication with you if possible. Finally, maintaining a healthy lifestyle, including a nutritious diet, regular physical activity, and avoiding alcohol consumption, will be important steps to help manage your fatty liver disease."}

However, I can provide some guidance on how you might be able to find out.\n\nIt's true that titanium was commonly used for orthognathic surgery implants beginning in the late 1990s due to its biocompatibility and other favorable properties. However, other metals such as stainless steel were also used.\n\nTo determine the metal used in your implants, you will need to contact the surgeon or dental professional who performed the surgery or consult the medical records from that time. This may involve contacting the hospital or clinic where the surgery was done and requesting a copy of your medical records. Be prepared to provide personal information such as your full name, date of birth, and the date of the surgery.\n\nIf you're unable to obtain this information, you may want to consider consulting with your current healthcare provider or radiologist to discuss the possibility of having the MRI with the metal implants. Most MRI machines are designed to work with titanium, stainless steel, and other commonly used medical implant materials. However, certain parts of the scanner may not be compatible and may require special shielding or adjustments to minimize any potential interference. Your healthcare provider or radiologist can assess the situation and help determine if any special precautions are necessary.\n\nIt's important to remember that having orthognathic surgery with implants does not necessarily preclude you from having an MRI. Most cases can be accommodated with the proper precautions and adjustments."}

Regards:Dr Deepak Patel, MD Pediatrics", "ai": " It is generally not recommended to bring a 15-month-old child to a hookah bar due to several potential risks:\n\n1. Secondhand smoke: Hookah bars are known for their indoor smoking of flavored tobacco, and the large volumes of smoke can be harmful to young children who are still developing their lungs and respiratory systems. Secondhand smoke can cause breathing problems, ear infections, and other health issues.\n2. Exposure to adults consuming alcohol: Hookah bars often sell alcoholic beverages, and young children should not be exposed to adults who are drinking. This can lead to accidents, injuries, or unintentional ingestion of alcohol.\n3. Loud music and noise: Hookah bars can be loud and chaotic environments, which can be overwhelming for young children. This can cause stress, anxiety, and even physical discomfort.\n4. Potential choking hazards: Hookah pipes, coins, and small tobacco bowls can pose choking hazards for young children. Additionally, the food and sweets often served at hookah bars may not be suitable for infants and toddlers.\n\nGiven these risks, it is generally safer to leave your 15-month-old at home if you plan to attend a friends and family night at a hookah bar. If you do decide to bring him, make sure to keep a close eye on him at all times, avoid letting him come into contact with tobacco smoke, and be mindful of the potential choking hazards in the environment. Additionally, consider bringing a stroller or carrying your child in a sling to help keep him calm and comfortable in the loud environment. Ultimately, it is important to prioritize your child's safety and well-being above your desire to socialize."}

{"question": "What causes itching all over the body on taking tab Ovares?Hai i am a Ayur doctor, one of my patient who was eager to concieve visited a infertility specialist (she is Dm2 & Htn under control with PCOS) who prescribed Tab Ovares tid since 3 months and she has been facing itching all over her body with increased itch at the cervical area. pls guide me?", "human": "Hi,I read your query and I understand your concerns.Following is my reply:1) you must be allergic to it.2) change the brandLet me know if you have anymore questions.Regards,Dr. Mahesh Koregol", "ai": " Ovarian hormonal medication like Ovares (clomiphene citrate) is commonly used to stimulate ovulation in women with infertility issues, including PCOS. Itching all over the body, also known as pruritus, is not a common side effect of this medication. However, some women may experience itching, particularly in the genital area or breasts, during their menstrual cycle or while taking ovulation-inducing drugs like clomiphene.\n\nThe exact cause of itching during Ovares use is not well understood. It may be related to hormonal changes, allergic reactions to the medication, or other underlying conditions. In some cases, itching may be a sign of an ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome (OHSS), which is a potential side effect of ovulation induction. OHSS can cause fluid accumulation in the abdomen, which may lead to symptoms such as itching, bloating, and abdominal pain.\n\nIf your patient's itching is severe or accompanied by other symptoms such as difficulty breathing, swelling, or weight gain, it may be a sign of OHSS. In this case, she should see her infertility specialist or seek emergency medical care immediately.\n\nTo manage mild itching, your patient can try the following measures:\n\n1. Apply a cool compress or take a lukewarm bath to soothe the itchy skin.\n2. Avoid tight clothing and use breathable fabrics.\n3. Use a fragrance-free, hypoallergenic lotion or cream to moisturize the skin.\n4. Avoid spicy or hot foods, caffeine, and alcohol, as they can worsen itching.\n5. Talk to her doctor about switching to a different medication or adjusting the dosage of Ovares.\n\nIt's important for your patient to communicate her symptoms to her infertility specialist as soon as possible, as they may need to adjust her treatment plan to address the underlying cause of the itching."}

The Depo Provera shot is a form of long-acting contraception, and one of its common side effects is irregular menstrual bleeding, which can make it difficult to determine if you're pregnant.\n\nIf you have missed your injection and have not yet started your period, there are a few ways to check if you're pregnant, although none are foolproof:\n\n1. Home pregnancy test: One of the most reliable methods is to take a home pregnancy test. It's best to take it about a week after you have missed your period, but you can take it earlier if you have consistent symptoms of pregnancy, such as breast tenderness, fatigue, or nausea. Keep in mind that some tests may not be sensitive enough to detect pregnancy early, so you may need to take it again a week later if the result is negative but you still suspect you're pregnant.\n2. Consult your healthcare provider: If you're unsure about the results of a home pregnancy test or if you have other symptoms, you can consult your healthcare provider for a blood test to confirm pregnancy. This test can detect pregnancy earlier than a home urine test and with greater accuracy.\n\nIt's important to note that missing a Depo injection does not automatically mean that you're pregnant, but it may increase the risk of an unintended pregnancy. If you're concerned or have missed more than one injection, it's important to speak with your healthcare provider to discuss your options and explore alternative methods of contraception."}

The child may experience some discomfort or swelling around the surgical site, and the area may feel tender to touch. These symptoms are usually temporary and can be managed with over-the-counter pain relievers, rest, and apply ice.\n\nOnce the pins are removed, the doctor may recommend using a brace or cast for a short period to provide support and allow the surgical incisions to heal properly. The recovery time after pin removal can vary depending on the individual case, but it typically takes several weeks to return to normal activities.\n\nIt's important to note that the bone has grown around the pins, so the fracture has healed, which is a positive sign. The child's progress will be monitored closely by the doctor to ensure that the bone has healed properly and that there are no complications.\n\nIf your son experiences any significant pain, swelling, or other concerns after the pin removal, you should contact your doctor to discuss these symptoms and determine if any further treatment is needed."}
{"question": "Can Pred Cort be given to a child for impetigo?Hi, my daughter is 19 months and was diagnosed with Impetigo. She was given an oral antibiotic and ointment expecting the bumps to heal as antibiotic would kill bacteria.

Difficult to comment on skin lesions without examining .Hope this answers your question. If you have additional questions or follow up questions then please do not hesitate in writing to us. I will be happy to answer your questionsTake care.", "ai": " Prednisolone, or Pred Cort as it is sometimes called, is a corticosteroid medication that is often used to reduce inflammation and suppress the immune system. In the case of impetigo, it may be prescribed to help reduce the redness, swelling, and itching associated with the infection, particularly if it is severe or has spread extensively.\n\nHowever, the use of corticosteroids in young children, particularly under the age of two, can carry some risks. The American Academy of Pediatrics recommends that corticosteroids be used with caution in this age group due to the potential for side effects such as growth suppression, behavioral changes, and increased susceptibility to infections.\n\nFurthermore, the fact that new lesions are continuing to appear despite the use of antibiotics raises some questions. Impetigo is usually caused by staphylococcus or streptococcus bacteria, and antibiotics are effective at killing these bacteria. It is important to follow the dosage and duration of the antibiotic as prescribed by your child's doctor to ensure that the bacteria are fully eradicated.\n\nIf new lesions are continuing to develop, there are a few possible explanations. One possibility is that the initial diagnosis was inaccurate, and there is another underlying cause for the rash. Another possibility is that the bacteria are resistant to the antibiotic being used. Your child's doctor may consider taking a culture of the bacteria to determine if this is the case and to identify which antibiotic would be most effective.\n\nIf the diagnosis is confirmed as impetigo and the antibiotic is not effectively controlling the infection, then the use of a corticosteroid such as prednisolone may be considered to help reduce the inflammation and speed up the healing process. However, it is essential to discuss the risks and benefits of this approach with your child's doctor and to carefully follow their instructions regarding dosage and duration of the medication. Additionally, it may be helpful to keep the area clean and covered with a bandage to prevent the spread of the infection to other areas."}

Keep in mind that this does not constitute medical advice and you should always consult with a healthcare professional for an accurate diagnosis.\n\nRectal cancer and its treatment, including radiation and chemotherapy, can cause a number of side effects. Rectal radiation therapy may damage healthy cells in the rectum and cause diarrhea, which can lead to changes in the normal bacteria in the intestines. This disruption in the balance of gut bacteria may result in a discharge with an unusual odor. Also, any discharge could be influenced by the presence of a tumor.\n\nHowever, there are other potential causes for these symptoms, such as infections, especially infections from bacteria like Clostridium difficile (C. diff), which can cause severe diarrhea with persistent foul-smelling stools and discharge. This type of infection is more likely to develop when a person takes antibiotics, which are commonly used to manage side effects of cancer treatment.\n\nIt's important to talk to your father's healthcare team about these symptoms, as they may need to adjust his treatment or take steps to resolve any underlying infections. They may also recommend probiotics to help restore the bacterial balance in the gut.\n\nRemember, always trust the advice of medical professionals regarding your father's health and treatment."}

{"question": "How can a dog bite infection be treated?I was bit by my own dog.....not a deep bit at all. However, he has nipped at me a couple of times in the past and each time I ve had to get antibiotics because it got infected....and this bite seems to be getting infected. My skin is extremely sensitive. I have some Bactrim DS left from an ear infection and I am wondering if I can take that for this skin infection?", "human": "Hello,Sorry to hear that you were bitten by a dog.  It is reassuring knowing you were bitten by your own dog as opposed to a feral dog because wild dogs carry much more bacteria and even rabies.  The use of antibiotics for prophylactics is controversial.  The first-line oral therapy is amoxicillin-clavulanate. For higher-risk infections, a first dose of antibiotic may be given intravenously.  Bactrim is a medicine that is used in various animal bites but it is not the first choice based on the types of bacteria generally contained in dog bites.  However, if you are to use it, you need to get a full dosage and not just whatever is left over from a previous infection.", "ai": " I cannot provide you with definitive medical advice, but I can offer some general guidance based on the information you have provided. It is important that you consult with a healthcare professional or a veterinarian for proper assessment and treatment of a dog bite infection.\n\nRegarding your question about using Bactrim DS for a dog bite infection, since you mentioned that it was prescribed for an ear infection, I assume it is an antibiotic recommended by a healthcare professional for you in the past. If the bacteria causing the infection are the same, it might be appropriate for you to use the remaining Bactrim DS for the current dog bite infection. However, it's essential to consult with your healthcare professional or veterinarian before starting any new antibiotic regimen to ensure it is safe and effective for your specific situation.\n\nIn the meantime, you can take the following steps to care for the injury and potentially prevent further infection:\n\n1. Clean the wound: Wash the bite area gently with warm water and mild soap, and pat the skin dry with a clean towel. Avoid using hydrogen peroxide or alcohol as they can irritate sensitive skin.\n\n2. Apply an antibiotic ointment: Apply a thin layer of an over-the-counter antibiotic ointment (without neomycin or bacitracin as they may cause an allergic reaction) to the wound to help prevent infection.\n\n3. Cover the wound: Cover the wound with a sterile bandage to keep it clean and prevent dirt and debris from entering. Change the bandage daily or as needed.\n\n4. Monitor for signs of infection: Keep an eye on the wound for signs of infection, such as redness, swelling, increased pain, or pus. If you notice any of these signs, contact your healthcare professional or veterinarian immediately.\n\nIt's important to address any potential infection promptly, as untreated dog bite infections can lead to more severe complications, including the spread of the infection to other parts of the body and the development of sepsis.\n\nIn the long term, try to understand why your dog has been biting you and take steps to address the underlying cause, such as providing more exercise, training, or socialization, to improve their behavior and reduce the risk of future bites."}

Hemoglobin is a protein in red blood cells that carries oxygen from the lungs to the body's tissues. The hematocrit, which is the percentage of red blood cells in the blood, is also low at 34.8%.\n\nAnemia, which is a condition where the body does not have enough healthy red blood cells to carry oxygen effectively, can be caused by iron deficiency. However, there are other causes of anemia as well, such as vitamin B12 or folate deficiency, or chronic diseases such as kidney disease or rheumatoid arthritis.\n\nIf you are experiencing symptoms of anemia, such as fatigue, weakness, shortness of breath, or pale skin, it would be a good idea to consider taking an iron supplement or making dietary changes to increase your iron intake. However, if you are feeling well and your symptoms do not align with anemia, it's important to consider other causes and discuss any concerns with your nurse practitioner. They may consider ordering additional tests, such as a ferritin level or a reticulocyte count, to further evaluate your iron status.\n\nIt's also important to consider other factors that may impact your iron status, such as your diet, menstrual status, or any underlying medical conditions. If you are unsure about the need for iron supplements based on your test results and symptoms, you may want to ask your nurse practitioner for more information and clarification.

These cells are commonly found in the pelvic cavity, particularly in women, and can react in response to various stimuli such as inflammation or injury.\n\nThe report also mentions that these cells have enlarged and crowded nuclei. While enlarged nuclei are generally a sign of cellular atypia or malignancy, it's important to keep in mind that reactive mesothelial cells can have enlarged nuclei as a response to irritation or inflammation.\n\nThe report further states that these cells are positive for calretinin and negative for Ber-EP4. Calretinin is a marker commonly expressed in mesothelial cells as well as some other types of cells, including some breast cancer cells. Ber-EP4 is a breast cancer marker.\n\nGiven your history of triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC), the presence of atypical cells with enlarged nuclei, and a positive result for calretinin, there's a possibility that these cells may represent metastatic breast cancer. However, a definitive diagnosis would require further evaluation, such as a biopsy to confirm the diagnosis.\n\nIt's essential to discuss these findings with your healthcare provider, as they can provide you with the most accurate interpretation of your cytology report and recommend any necessary follow-up tests or treatments."}

Ferritin levels that are too high can indicate certain conditions. One example is hemochromatosis, which is when your body absorbs too much iron. Hope I have answered your query. Let me know if I can assist you further.", "ai": " A high ferritin level indicates an elevated level of iron stores in the body. Ferritin is a protein that binds to and stores iron, and its levels in the blood reflect the amount of stored iron in the body.\n\nYour mom's high ferritin levels, despite having stopped taking iron supplements, could be due to a few reasons:\n\n1. Pre-existing high iron stores: Ferritin levels can remain high for several months even after stopping iron supplementation if the body already had high iron stores to begin with. This is often the case in people who have taken iron supplements for an extended period of time or have a condition that causes increased iron absorption or decreased iron utilization.\n2. Ongoing blood loss: If your mom is experiencing ongoing blood loss, her body may need to compensate by producing more ferritin to maintain adequate iron levels. This could be due to a variety of causes, such as menorrhagia (heavy menstrual bleeding), gastrointestinal bleeding, or other conditions that cause chronic blood loss.\n3. Other causes of high ferritin: There are several other conditions that can cause high ferritin levels, such as infections (particularly viral infections), chronic inflammatory conditions, and some types of cancer. Your mom's doctors may consider these possibilities based on her other symptoms and medical history.\n\nIt's important that your mom follows up with her healthcare provider to discuss the meaning of her high ferritin levels and to rule out any underlying causes. She may need further testing or evaluation to help identify the cause and appropriate next steps."}
{"question": "Suggest treatment for overlapping toes deformity in childrenI m a nursing student. While observing a youtube video, also saw overlapping toes deformity bilaterally on child. Child was undernourished and very small for age. Not familiar with this birth defect. Surgery was off the table at that time. What are possible treatments?", "human": "the most common reason for toes to be deformed at a young age is a tendon imbalance between the flexors and extensors of the foot. for example, having a high arch or a cavus type foot, leads to the extensor tendons bowstringing and hammertoe formation. Using a custom orthotic from a foot and ankle specialist may help balance deforming forces. others have advocated taping the toes in an improved position but I never tape children's toes as it potentially can strangulate the toes and cause gangrene. with a certain type of flatfoot, the fourth and fifth toes turn inward due to imbalance of intrinsic tendons of the foot. although these may be cosmetically unappealing I would never consider surgery until all growth plates close after around 18 years of age, and usually don't ever cause negative symptoms", "ai": " I'm not a doctor, but I can suggest some common treatments for overlapping toes deformity (also known as overlappingdigits or overlapping toenails) in children, which may be appropriate if surgery is not an option at the moment. The goal of these treatments is usually to correct the deformity, improve foot function and prevent complications. Some possible options that might be considered include:\n\n1. Stretching exercises: Parents and children can practice toe exercises and stretches to help align and straighten toes. It's essential to ensure these activities are done correctly and are comfortable for the child. A healthcare professional or physical therapist can demonstrate the appropriate techniques.\n\n2. Taping or splinting: Custom-made splints or taping methods may be used to realign and hold the toes in a correct position while they adapt to the new position. This approach can be effective for mild to moderate deformities.\n\n3. Proper footwear: Fitting the child with properly-fitted shoes that offer adequate support and wide enough toe boxes can help alleviate discomfort and prevent further toe deformities. Parents should look for shoes with a high arch and a wide toe box to accommodate the overlapping toes.\n\n4. Orthotics: Prescription orthotics like toe spacers or corrective shoes may be used to help align the toes and promote proper foot function. These are typically custom-made based on the child's foot assessment by a podiatrist or orthotist.\n\n5. Nutritional support: As the child was undernourished, providing appropriate nutrition and ensuring they have a balanced and sufficient diet can help support growth and development. This, in turn, might have an impact on the progress of the deformity.\n\n6. Occupational therapy: Therapies like occupational therapy may be recommended to help improve the child's overall dexterity and adaptability, especially if the deformity affects their ability to perform daily activities.\n\nRemember that each child is unique and may require a personalized treatment plan based on the severity and complexity of their condition. Consult a healthcare professional for an accurate assessment and proper guidance."}

Wishing for a quick and complete recovery. thank you.", "ai": " I'm an AI language model and not a doctor, so I cannot provide definitive medical advice. However, I can share some information about brain zaps and anxiety that may help you better understand your symptoms and discuss them with your healthcare provider.\n\nBrain zaps are a phenomenon characterized by brief, rhythmic sensations in the head, often described as electrifying shocks or tremors, which can be accompanied by dizziness and unsteadiness. The cause of brain zaps is not fully understood, but they are commonly reported as a side effect of discontinuing or reducing certain medications, particularly antidepressants like Welbutrin and Selexa, as well as benzodiazepines.\n\nA cold and anxiety may be related to the discontinuation of your medications, as well. The cold may be a result of a decrease in your body's ability to regulate temperature due to the reduction in medication, which can impact the function of your thyroid or other hormonal systems. The anxiety may be a side effect of the reduced dosage of Selexa or the discontinuation of Welbutrin, both of which are used to treat mental health conditions, such as depression and anxiety.\n\nIt's important to note that everyone's response to medication and withdrawal can vary widely. The symptoms you are experiencing may not be directly related to each other, and it's possible that the cold and anxiety are unrelated to your medications altogether.\n\nIf you are feeling anxious and unable to manage your symptoms, it may be helpful to speak with your healthcare provider. They may be able to discuss alternative treatment options, adjust your medication dosages, or recommend supportive measures, such as relaxation techniques, to help you cope. If you have experienced a significant worsening of symptoms, it may be necessary to consider seeking emergency medical attention.\n\nIn general, when discontinuing or adjusting medications, it's a good idea to work closely with your healthcare provider to ensure a smooth transition and minimize the risk of adverse effects. Sudden discontinuation or drastic dosage reductions can be challenging for the body and may increase the likelihood of experiencing withdrawal symptoms, like brain zaps, as well as other potential side effects.\n\nAs you work through this process, it may be helpful to focus on self-care and supportive measures to help manage your symptoms and improve your overall well-being. This might include getting plenty of rest, eating a healthy diet, practicing stress management techniques, such as deep breathing exercises or progressive muscle relaxation, and engaging in activities that bring you joy and help you feel calm and relaxed.\n\nIt's also important to remember that discontinuing or adjusting medications is a complex process, and it may take some time to find the right balance that works best for you. Be patient and compassionate with yourself as you work through this process, and don't hesitate to reach out to your healthcare provider if you have any concerns or if your symptoms worsen."}
{"question": "How can allergies be permanently cured?Hi , my name is Ahmer & i m allergic since i m a teenager. i dont know what am i allergic to but i have done many courses prescribed by specialists & nothing. My allergy continues & now whenever it comes out , i take a le zyncet tablet & its gone. i want to know , what are the side effects of this medicine or what is the permanent cure to my allergy sickness.", "human": "hellothank you for contacting HCMallergic response subsides by itself with age in most of the cases. I would recommend you two things for chronic allergy: > take montelukast one daily for one month. research has shown that it decreases allergic response.> visit allergy Center in your area where an allergist will perform some tests to confirm type of allergy and then will prescribe immunotherapy.wishing you good health. thank you", "ai": " I'm an assistant and I cannot provide medical advice or a definitive answer to your question as I am not a doctor and I don't have access to your medical records. Allergies cannot be permanently cured in the sense that there is no known treatment that can completely eradicate the allergic response from your body. However, there are treatments that can help manage and reduce the symptoms of allergies.\n\nIt's important to note that Le zincet is a brand name for an antihistamine medication, and while it can help alleviate the symptoms of allergies, it doesn't cure the underlying condition. Antihistamines work by blocking the effects of histamine, which is a chemical that the immune system produces in response to an allergen.\n\nWhen it comes to side effects, all medications have the potential to cause side effects, and the severity and frequency of these side effects can vary from person to person. Some common side effects of antihistamines include drowsiness, dry mouth, and blurred vision. Less common, but more serious side effects, such as allergic reactions or difficulty urinating, can occur in rare cases.\n\nIf you have ongoing concerns about your allergy or the side effects of your medication, I encourage you to speak with your healthcare provider. They can provide you with the most accurate and up-to-date information based on your personal medical history and current condition.\n\nAllergy desensitization, also known as allergen immunotherapy, is a treatment that involves exposing the body to gradually increasing doses of an allergen over a period of time. This can help the immune system become less reactive to the allergen, reducing or even eliminating the symptoms of allergies. However, it's important to note that allergy desensitization is not a cure and requires a long-term commitment, as well as close monitoring by a healthcare provider.\n\nIn conclusion, while there is no definitive cure for allergies, there are treatments that can help manage and reduce their symptoms. It's important to work closely with your healthcare provider to determine the best treatment approach for you."}

While I can't definitively say what may be causing your leg and foot cramps, there are several potential explanations.\n\n1. Hormonal changes: The Mirena coil releases progestin, a hormone that can help regulate menstruation and prevent pregnancy. After removal, your hormone levels may fluctuate, leading to cramping or spasms in the legs and feet.\n2. Dehydration: Cramping can also be a symptom of dehydration, especially if you're not getting enough fluids due to vomiting or diarrhea, which are common side effects of Mirena coil removal.\n3. Mineral deficiencies: Cramping can also be caused by deficiencies in minerals like calcium, magnesium, and potassium. These minerals help regulate muscle function, and deficiencies can lead to cramping.\n4. Nerve damage: In rare cases, Mirena coil removal can cause nerve damage, which can lead to cramping and other uncomfortable symptoms.\n5. Other medical conditions: There are several other medical conditions that can cause leg and foot cramping, such as peripheral artery disease, diabetes, and restless leg syndrome. It's important to rule out these conditions as well.\n\nIt's important to speak with your healthcare provider about your symptoms, as they can help determine the underlying cause and provide appropriate treatment. If you're experiencing severe cramping, you may be able to find relief by taking a warm bath, massaging the affected area, or using a heating pad. Additionally, staying well-hydrated and ensuring you're getting adequate nutrients can help alleviate cramping caused by hormonal fluctuations or mineral deficiencies."}
{"question": "What is the dosage for prednisolone?my daughter having Wt. 19kg is getting urticaria-skin rash all over the body since 7 days, not responding to anithistaminics e.g. atarax 3.5ml BD and steroid deflazacort which has been given for 4 days. I have to start new oral steroid e.g. Prednisolone (omnacortil). How much dose  i have to give and for how many days?", "human": "HIWell come to HCMGiving steroid for urticarial rash is not advisable in this age group if antihistamine is not working well then this can be changed to other group antihistamine, in my opinion the condition can be treated with Tab Levocetrizine 2.5 mg tree times in day, hope this information helps.", "ai": " The dosage of prednisolone for a child weighing 19kg (approx. 42 pounds) can vary depending on the specific reason for taking the medication and the severity of the symptoms. Generally, the initial dose for treating an acute flare-up of urticaria (hives) in children is around 1-2mg/kg per day given in divided doses.\n\nSo, the initial dosage for your daughter would be around 19-38mg (42-83mg per day if you consider the two daily doses) of prednisolone. This is just an approximate dosage, and I strongly advise you to consult with a pediatrician or a healthcare professional to determine the exact dosage and duration of treatment based on your daughter's condition and individual response to the medication.\n\nRemember that prednisolone is a potent steroid and long-term use can have adverse side effects, so it is important to monitor your daughter's progress closely during treatment. Also, keep in mind that anithistamines and steroids like deflazacort may take some time to show improvement, so give the new medication a chance to work before considering an increase in dosage.\n\nRegards.\n\nDISCLAIMER: The information provided is intended for educational purposes only and should in no way be considered as medical advice.

Here are some possibilities:\n\n1. Liver disease: Your symptoms, including the elevated liver enzymes and weight loss, could be signs of liver disease. Hepatitis, cirrhosis, and other liver conditions can cause these symptoms along with a scaly rash (which could be a sign of pruritus or itching related to the liver disease). Your CEA level being elevated (12.69) is also concerning, as this is a tumor marker and could suggest the presence of a liver tumor (however, it's important to note that CEA levels can be elevated in other conditions as well). Your healthcare provider may recommend further testing to determine if liver disease is the cause of your symptoms.\n\n2. Autoimmune conditions: Your symptoms, including the scaly rash, swollen lymph nodes, and weight loss, could be signs of an autoimmune condition such as psoriasis, lupus, or rheumatoid arthritis. Autoimmune conditions can cause liver inflammation and damage, leading to elevated liver enzymes. You may need to undergo further testing to determine if an autoimmune condition is the underlying cause of your symptoms.\n\n3. Infectious causes: Your symptoms could be due to an infection, such as HIV or tuberculosis. These infections can cause liver damage and inflammation, leading to elevated liver enzymes. In addition, HIV can present with a scaly rash, night sweats, weight loss, and other symptoms. Your healthcare provider may recommend further testing to determine if an infectious cause is the underlying cause of your symptoms.\n\n4. Malignancy: Your symptoms, including the elevated liver enzymes, weight loss, and night sweats, could be signs of an underlying malignancy, such as liver cancer, lymphoma, or another type of cancer. Your healthcare provider may recommend further testing to rule out this possibility.\n\nIt's important to note that this is not an exhaustive list, and there may be other conditions that could be causing your symptoms. Your healthcare provider is the best person to help you determine the underlying cause of your symptoms and develop an appropriate treatment plan. I would encourage you to follow up with your healthcare provider for further evaluation and testing."}

Here are some possible explanations for each symptom:\n\n1. Severe leg pain when getting up in the morning: This could be due to peripheral artery disease, which is caused by narrowed arteries limiting blood flow to the legs. It can also be a sign of other conditions like arthritis, sciatica, or nerve damage.\n2. Night sweats: Night sweats can be a symptom of various conditions such as infections, cancer, menopause, or conditions that affect the immune system.\n3. Bloating: Bloating can be a sign of various digestive problems such as IBS, gastroparesis, or food intolerances. It can also be a symptom of more serious conditions like ovarian cancer or a hernia.\n4. Headaches: Headaches can have various causes, including stress, dehydration, nutrient deficiencies, migraines, or more serious conditions like brain tumors or aneurysms.\n5. Bleeding gums: Bleeding gums can be a sign of gum disease or other oral health issues. However, they can also be a symptom of other conditions like vitamin C deficiency, leukemia, or HIV.\n6. Bruise on the arm: A bruise appearing out of nowhere could be due to an injury that you're not aware of. However, it could also be a sign of certain health conditions, such as blood clotting disorders, liver disease, or skin disorders.\n7.

However, I can provide some general guidance based on the information you've given.\n\nYour father's history of prostate cancer and surgical removal of the testicles (orchiectomy) suggest that he may have had hormone-sensitive prostate cancer. Calutide-50 (leuprorelin acetate) is a type of hormonal therapy that is commonly used to treat hormone-sensitive prostate cancer. The fact that he has been taking it for 12 years suggests that it has been effective in controlling his cancer.\n\nHowever, prostate cancer can be a complex disease and can change over time. While your father's current treatment may be effective, it's important that he continues to be monitored by his healthcare team to ensure that the cancer has not progressed or developed resistance to the treatment.\n\nYour father should continue to see his healthcare provider regularly, ideally every 3-6 months, for regular check-ups that may include blood tests, PSA (prostate-specific antigen) tests, and imaging studies. During these appointments, his healthcare provider can assess his current treatment and determine if any adjustments are necessary based on his individual health status and the latest medical guidelines.\n\nIf your father experiences any new or worsening symptoms, such as difficulty urinating, increased frequency of urination, rectal bleeding, pain in the back, hips, or pelvis, or bone pain, he should contact his healthcare provider right away.\n\nWhile a urologist may have been involved in your father's initial diagnosis and treatment, an oncologist, specifically a medical oncologist, may be more focused on managing systemic treatments such as hormonal therapy. Depending on your father's individual health needs and the recommendations of his healthcare team, he may benefit from consulting with both a urologist and an oncologist. Ultimately, the decision to seek a consultation with a specialist should be made in consultation with your father's primary healthcare provider."}

You could try taking a course of proton pump inhibitors (to reduce the acidity ) like pantoprazole after consulting with your physician.If it doesn't get better, get a complete blood picture,and an abdominal ultrasound done, visit a gastroenterologist.", "ai": " Upper abdominal pain that worsens at night and is relieved by lying down could be caused by several conditions. Here are some possible causes and associated symptoms that may help identify the condition:\n\n1. Gastroesophageal Reflux Disease (GERD): GERD is a condition where stomach acid flows back into the esophagus, causing heartburn and abdominal pain. In some cases, the pain may be felt in the upper abdomen. The pain may be aggravated by lying down or bending over, and it may wake you up at night. Other symptoms of GERD include heartburn, regurgitation, and bloating.\n2. Peptic Ulcer Disease: Peptic ulcers are open sores that develop in the lining of the stomach or duodenum (the first part of the small intestine). The pain from a peptic ulcer is often described as a burning or gnawing sensation in the upper abdomen, which may worsen at night or when the stomach is empty. Other symptoms include nausea, loss of appetite, and vomiting.\n3. Gallbladder disease: Gallbladder disease, including gallstones and cholecystitis, can cause upper abdominal pain, especially after eating. The pain may be aggravated by lying down or taking deep breaths. Other symptoms of gallbladder disease include fever, chills, jaundice, and clay-colored stools.\n4. Irritable Bowel Syndrome (IBS): IBS is a functional gastrointestinal disorder characterized by abdominal pain, bloating, and changes in bowel movements. The pain may be aggravated by stress, certain foods, or physical activity and may occur mainly in the upper abdomen. Other symptoms of IBS include constipation or diarrhea, mucus in the stools, and passing gas.\n5. Pancreatitis: Pancreatitis is inflammation of the pancreas, which can cause upper abdominal pain, especially after eating. The pain may be severe and constant, and it may radiate to the back or chest. Other symptoms of pancreatitis include nausea, vomiting, fever, and abdominal swelling.\n6. Other causes: Upper abdominal pain at night could be caused by other conditions such as liver disease, viral infections, or inflammatory bowel disease. If the pain is severe, persistent, or accompanied by other symptoms, it is important to seek medical advice to rule out any serious conditions.\n\nIt is important to note that this list is not exhaustive, and only a healthcare professional can provide a definitive diagnosis. If you are experiencing persistent upper abdominal pain, please consult a healthcare provider for a proper evaluation."}

It is normal for the skin to look darker after taking this peel.It is unlike the other peels where you do not see any peeling of skin.Here you will gradually see the darker part of the skin come out in the next few days.You should take care to apply a good sunscreen and a moisturizer in the next few days very strictly for best results.In case there is irritation/redness increases/ scab formation occurs, you may consult your dermatologist for the needful.Hope this is helpful.Take care!", "ai": " I'm not a doctor, but I can try to provide you with some general information about cosmopeels and post-treatment care that might help alleviate your concerns. Cosmopeels are a type of medium-depth chemical peel that contains a higher concentration of acids compared to superficial peels. They are used to address various skin concerns, including pigmentation, fine lines, and uneven skin texture.\n\nAfter undergoing a cosmopeel treatment, it's normal to experience some redness, swelling, and discomfort. These symptoms are a result of the skin healing process. Additionally, the pigmented areas might appear more prominent during the healing phase due to the new skin regeneration process. This is not uncommon, and most people notice that the pigmentation fades or improves during the following weeks.\n\nHowever, it's essential to follow your healthcare professional's advice regarding post-treatment care to ensure optimal results and prevent any potential complications. Some general recommendations include:\n\n- Protecting your skin from sun exposure: Wear protective clothing, a wide-brimmed hat, and sunscreen (at least SPF 30) whenever going outside. The sun can aggravate the pigmentation and interfere with the healing process.\n- Avoiding harsh skincare products: Use gentle, fragrance-free, and non-abrasive skincare products during the healing period.\n- Providing adequate hydration: Keep your skin hydrated by applying a moisturizer regularly.\n- Minimizing heat exposure: Avoid direct contact with heat sources like sun lamps, hot tubs, and saunas.\n- Avoiding picking at or scratching the treated area.\n\nIf your symptoms persist or worsen, or if you have concerns about your skin color changing or scarring, you should consult your healthcare professional. They may be able to provide reassurance, recommend treatments, or adjust your post-treatment care plan to help alleviate your concerns."}
{"question": "What causes excessive breathing in the baby?Hello, I have a 4 1/2 month old baby who is breathing at 72 breaths per minute resting. She was 38weeks at delivery and, while small (2.75 kg) was pretty good for a twin. Her growth is fine and development normal. I am just concerned about breath rate as our 3 year old has bronchiolitis obliterans and is oxygen dependent. I think we did not diagnose her problems early enough. Any advice?", "human": "Hello, By what you say this seems to be a medical emergency to me. The baby's respiratory rate requires hospitalization and evaluation. It could be acute bronchiolitis, please take her to the nearest Emergency Room as soon as possible. Hope I have answered your query. Let me know if I can assist you further. Regards,Dr. Sumanth Amperayani, Pediatrician, Pulmonology", "ai": " Excessive breathing, also known as tachypnea, in a 4.5-month-old baby can be caused by various conditions. Some common causes include:\n\n1. Respiratory infections: These include bronchiolitis, pneumonia, or other respiratory infections that can irritate the airways and make breathing harder and faster. If your baby has a temperature, congestion, or other symptoms of an infection, it's worth speaking to your pediatrician.\n2. Prematurity: As your baby was born quite early, she may have some lingering respiratory issues. Premature infants often have underdeveloped lungs and may require additional oxygen or other breathing support.\n3. Anemia: A low red blood cell count can make it harder for your baby's body to deliver oxygen to its cells, which can lead to faster breathing. Keep an eye out for other signs of anemia, such as pallor, weakness, or a rapid heartbeat.\n4. Temperature: A baby who is too cold may breathe faster as their body tries to warm up. Make sure your baby's environment is kept warm enough, ideally between 68 and 72 degrees Fahrenheit (20 and 22 degrees Celsius).\n5. Anxiety or stress: Infants can become anxious or stressed, especially if they have a sibling with a chronic illness. This can lead to faster breathing, especially during sleep.\n\nIf your baby's tachypnea persists despite trying to address any obvious causes, such as keeping her warm and ensuring she's getting enough fluids, it's a good idea to touch base with your pediatrician. They may want to examine your baby to see if there's any underlying issue that needs to be addressed. Additionally, depending on your situation, they may suggest regular check-ups or monitoring to ensure your baby is growing and developing appropriately.\n\nIt's understandable that you're concerned given your family history, but try not to worry too much unless there are clear signs of a problem. Your pediatrician can help you monitor your baby's health and provide guidance as needed."}

No specific medication are required nor available for this.Get yourself examined by an ENT specialist to look for your vocal chords.Take care.", "ai": " It's important to note that the depth of a person's voice is influenced by various factors, including hormonal levels, muscle development, and genetics. In boys, the voice typically becomes deeper during puberty due to the production of testosterone and the corresponding development of the vocal cords. However, not all boys experience the same degree of voice change during this time, and some may have a voice that is perceived as more feminine than average.\n\nIf you are concerned about the perception that your voice is not deep enough, there are some possible causes to consider:\n\n1. Puberty: If you are a young boy, your voice may still be developing. It's not uncommon for boys to go through a period of having a more feminine-sounding voice during puberty before it becomes deeper. Give it some time.\n2. Neurological conditions: Certain neurological conditions, such as cerebellar ataxia or myasthenia gravis, can weaken the muscles controlling the vocal cords and result in a weak or breathy voice.\n3. Vocal cord damage: Strain or damage to the vocal cords, such as from frequent screaming or singing, can cause a change in vocal quality.\n4. Emotional state: People often speak differently depending on their emotional state. If you are feeling anxious or emotional, this may affect the way your voice sounds.\n\nThere is no medication that can specifically make your voice deeper. The best way to improve the depth and resonance of your voice is through regular vocal exercise and proper vocal technique, which can help strengthen and develop the muscles used for speaking and singing.\n\nIf you are concerned about the perception of your voice, you may want to consider working with a speech-language pathologist or a voice therapist to learn exercises and techniques that can help improve vocal quality and confidence. Additionally, consider practicing techniques for projecting your voice and speaking from your diaphragm to help make your voice sound fuller and more resonant."}

If your child has been stung by a bee or wasp and developed a fever and headache 24 hours after the sting, but there is no swelling at the sting site, it's important to monitor their symptoms closely.\n\nFirst, make sure your child stays hydrated by offering plenty of fluids. Both fever and dehydration can be dangerous in children, so it's essential to prevent dehydration.\n\nYou can give your child over-the-counter medications such as acetaminophen (Tylenol) or ibuprofen (Motrin) to help reduce the fever and alleviate any discomfort from the headache. However, it's essential to follow the recommended dosages on the package label carefully.\n\nAdditionally, you can give your child an antihistamine such as diphenhydramine (Benadryl) to help relieve any potential allergic reaction.

However, there should be no harm associated in giving septilin to a baby of this age.", "ai": " Septilin syrup is a herbal supplement commonly used in Ayurvedic medicine for boosting immunity and preventing repeated infections. The main ingredients of Septilin include Amalaki, Haritaki, Bhibitaki, and Jataphal, which have immunomodulatory and antioxidant properties.\n\nAlthough there are no specific safety concerns for giving Septilin syrup to a 5-month-old child, it's essential to consult with the child's healthcare provider before starting any new supplement. The doctor who has been treating your child is in the best position to assess the risks and benefits, taking into account their medical history, current diagnosis, and other medications they may be taking.\n\nIt's important to note that the use of any complementary or alternative medicine should not replace the recommended medical treatment prescribed by the physician.

However, please consult your healthcare provider for personalized medical advice.\n\nRegarding your question about Vagifem and DVT, it's important to note that there is no definitive evidence that estrogen therapy with Vagifem specifically increases the risk of DVT in the absence of other risk factors. However, there is a general increased risk of thrombotic events, including DVT, with hormone therapy, especially in the first year of use.\n\nAs for the duration of anticoagulation therapy after a DVT event, it typically depends on the individual's risk factors and the severity of the event. For most patients with a first-time, unprovoked DVT, anticoagulation therapy is recommended for at least 3 months to reduce the risk of recurrence. However, some patients may require longer-term therapy based on their risk factors.\n\nRegarding your symptoms of extreme tiredness in the afternoon and poor sleep quality, it's important to note that these can be common side effects of anticoagulation therapy, especially during the first few weeks of treatment. If these symptoms persist or become severe, it's important to discuss them with your healthcare provider, as they may be able to adjust your dosage or try a different medication. Additionally, these symptoms could be related to other underlying conditions, such as anemia or sleep apnea, so it's important to rule out other potential causes."}
{"question": "Q. My 4 month baby has not passed stools. Please help.Hi doctor,My baby is 4 months old and is vomiting in between while having breast milk.

It is common to have a decrease in stool frequency or constipation after switching from breast milk to formula feed. As long as your child is feeding well, passing gas from below, has no vomiting and has a soft belly, there is nothing to worry about. It is normal to pass stool once every 2-3 days. Also, you may noticea change in stool color (green) after switching to formula feed. In this scenario, you can try using a cotton Q-tip (cotton swab). Apply some lubrication on it and stimulate the rectal area to see if your child passes stool. If this does not help, then try seeing your local pediatrician who can help with rectal stimulation and passage of his stool.", "ai": " I'm an AI language model and not a doctor, but I can suggest some general tips that might help promote bowel movements in your baby. however, it's important that you consult with a healthcare professional, such as your baby's pediatrician, for personalized advice, especially given your baby's recent switch to formula feed and vomiting, which could be signs of an underlying issue. Here are some suggestions that might help with constipation:\n\n1. Ensure your baby is getting enough fluids: Formula-fed babies may require more water than breastfed babies, as formula is thicker and less water content. Speak with your pediatrician about the recommended amount of water for your baby's age and adjusting bottle feeds if necessary.\n\n2. Encourage physical activity: Gently massaging your baby's legs while they are in a prone position (tummy down) could stimulate their bowels. Place them on their belly for a few minutes during wakeful hours each day for tummy time, which will also help with their overall motor development.\n\n3. Adjust feeding frequency: It might be useful to spread your baby's feedings throughout the day instead of feeding them every few hours. This can help reduce the volume of food in their gut at one time and create a more consistent bowel motility.\n\n4. Warm water bath: Giving your baby a warm water bath might help to relax their abdomen and encourage bowel movements.\n\n5. Try gripe water: Some babies have uncomfortable gas that can contribute to constipation. Gripe water, a mixture of water, ginger, lemon juice, and sometimes other ingredients, is commonly used to help soothe infant tummies and can sometimes help with constipation as well. However, consult your pediatrician before giving gripe water to your baby.\n\nAs mentioned, it is essential to consult your baby's healthcare professional for personalized advice, as the root cause of their constipation might be something more serious, like undiagnosed lactose intolerance or other medical conditions. Stay calm, keep monitoring your baby's condition closely, and make an appointment with your pediatrician as soon as possible."}

Misdiagnosis or failure to detect a fetus at an early stage of pregnancy can be a source of anxiety, but it's essential not to jump to conclusions based on limited information. Here are a few points that might help clarify the situation:\n\n1. At 5-6 weeks, fetal development is still in its early stages. It can be challenging to identify a fetus during ultrasound scans at this gestational age, especially if the pregnancy is not progressing as expected. Fetal heartbeat is usually detectable around 6-8 weeks, but the presence of a heartbeat does not guarantee a healthy pregnancy.\n2. The presence of a gestational sac does not necessarily mean that the pregnancy is progressing as expected or that a fetus is present. It's a critical sign of pregnancy, but it's not a definitive indicator of a healthy fetus. Further testing, such as a follow-up ultrasound or blood tests, might be needed to assess the viability of the pregnancy.\n3. Even if the pregnancy is not progressing as expected, it might still be salvageable. Your healthcare provider might recommend a follow-up scan or other diagnostic tests to assess the situation further. They may also suggest interventions such as progesterone supplementation or bed rest to help support your pregnancy.\n\nIn the meantime, it's essential to keep an open communication line with your healthcare provider and seek answers to any questions or concerns that arise. Remember that the early stages of pregnancy can be unpredictable, and misdiagnoses or false positives do occur. Staying informed, maintaining a positive outlook, and seeking professional guidance can help alleviate anxiety and support a healthy pregnancy outcome."}

The constellation of symptoms you are experiencing – pain in the upper left chest, neck, and upper back, along with frequent sinus tachycardia and mild mitral valve prolapse (MVP) – could be related to a few different conditions. Here are some possibilities:\n\n1. Musculoskeletal pain: Your primary doctor suspects fibromyalgia, which is a condition characterized by widespread pain, tenderness, and fatigue. However, it's important to note that other conditions can also cause musculoskeletal pain in the chest, neck, and upper back. For example, you mentioned having IBS, which can be associated with muscle spasms in the chest and abdomen, leading to discomfort or even pain.\n\n2. Cardiac conditions: Although an echocardiogram showed only mild MVP, which is a common and usually harmless condition, it's still worth considering other cardiac causes for your symptoms, especially given the frequency of sinus tachycardia. Other conditions that could be considered include coronary artery disease, arrhythmias, or even costochondritis (inflammation of the cartilage connecting the ribs to the breastbone), which could cause chest pain.\n\n3. Nerve-related pain: Some nerve conditions, such as cervical radiculopathy (pinched nerves in the neck) or thoracic outlet syndrome (compression of the nerves and blood vessels between the collarbone and the first rib), can cause pain in the neck, upper back, and upper left chest.\n\nGiven the information provided, it's recommended that you continue working with your primary care doctor to explore additional diagnostic tests or consult with a specialist if needed, to help identify the cause of your symptoms.

Dizziness, blurred vision, and difficulty in balance can be associated with various conditions, some of which are benign and self-limiting, while others may require medical attention. Here are some possible causes:\n\n1. Vestibular disorders: The vestibular system is responsible for maintaining balance and coordination. Conditions such as Benign Paroxysmal Positional Vertigo (BPPV), Meniere's disease, and vestibular migraines can cause brief episodes of dizziness, vertigo, and imbalance.\n\n2. Migraines: Migraines can cause various symptoms, including dizziness, blurred vision, and difficulty in balance. These symptoms usually precede or accompany a headache.\n\n3. Transient ischemic attacks (mini-strokes): Brief episodes of dizziness, blurred vision, and imbalance along with other symptoms (such as sudden weakness, slurred speech, or numbness) may indicate a transient ischemic attack. This is a serious medical condition and warrant immediate medical attention.\n\n4. Low blood pressure: Dizziness, blurred vision, and difficulty in balance can result from a drop in blood pressure. This condition is often accompanied by lightheadedness or fainting.\n\n5. Medications: Certain medications can cause dizziness and difficulty in balance as a side effect.\n\n6. Environmental factors: Exposure to certain environments (e.g., moving vehicles, height, or enclosed spaces) can trigger dizziness, blurred vision, and difficulty in balance.\n\n7. Anxiety: Anxiety or panic attacks can cause symptoms of dizziness, blurred vision, and difficulty in balance, often accompanied by other symptoms such as rapid heartbeat, sweating, and shortness of breath.\n\nIt's important to consult a healthcare professional for a proper evaluation, as the underlying cause of your symptoms needs to be identified to ensure appropriate treatment."}

However, please keep in mind that this is not a definitive diagnosis and it's important for you to consult with a healthcare professional for an accurate assessment.\n\nGiven your description of chest and arm pain, your age, and your current medications and health conditions, there are several potential causes that might be worth discussing with your doctor:\n\n1. Gastroesophageal Reflux Disease (GERD): Although you're on omeprazole to treat possible ulcers, GERD may still be a contributing factor to your chest pain. In some cases, GERD can cause heartburn, chest pain, or discomfort in the arms.\n2. Angina: Your symptoms could indicate angina, which is chest pain or discomfort caused by reduced blood flow to the heart. This is usually associated with coronary artery disease. However, your age, symptoms, and blood pressure readings seem to suggest a lower risk of this condition.\n3. Anxiety or panic attacks: Considering your history of stress, mild depression, and the description of your pain moving around, it could be worth discussing the possibility of anxiety or panic attacks with your doctor. These conditions can cause symptoms similar to heart-related problems, such as chest pain and arm discomfort.\n4. Gallbladder issues: Since omeprazole is used to treat ulcers, your doctor may have missed prescribing you a medication for potential gallbladder issues. If there is a problem with your gallbladder, it could lead to chest or arm pain and a decrease in appetite.\n5. Other causes: Other conditions, like pleurisy, shingles, or pulmonary embolism, can cause chest and arm pain, although these conditions are less likely given your other symptoms and age.\n\nIt's important to discuss your concerns and symptoms with your healthcare provider to help identify the underlying cause and appropriate treatment options. If you're experiencing severe or unusual symptoms, it may be necessary for you to seek emergency medical care."}

Perforation of intrauterine device, particularly in the abdominal cavity can cause nausea, vomiting, abdominal distension, etc.. You are having these symptoms for about 2 months. Therefore it is likely that Mirena has perforated since that date.  Your doctor therefore has advised you Ultrasonography. It will locate the position of Mirena.

The ultrasound should help determine if the IUD is in the correct position or if there is any other issue that could be contributing to your symptoms.\n2. Follow-up with your healthcare provider: After you get the results of the ultrasound, make an appointment with your healthcare provider to discuss the findings and any treatment options. They may recommend removing the IUD if it is not in the correct position or if it is causing your symptoms.\n3. Other potential causes: In addition to the IUD, there could be other potential causes for your persistent nausea, such as gastrointestinal issues, food intolerances, or pregnancy despite a negative pregnancy test. Your healthcare provider may recommend further testing to rule out these causes.\n4. Self-care measures: In the meantime, you can try some self-care measures to help alleviate your nausea. This may include eating small, frequent meals, avoiding strong smells, and trying ginger or acupressure to help with nausea. Make sure you are staying hydrated by drinking plenty of fluids.\n5. Medications: If self-care measures are not effective, your healthcare provider may recommend medications to help alleviate your nausea.

Alopecia Areata is an autoimmune disease that causes hair loss in circular patches on the scalp, face, or other parts of the body.\n\nFirstly, it's essential to consult a healthcare professional, preferably a dermatologist, for an accurate diagnosis and personalized treatment plan. Here are some common treatments for Alopecia Areata:\n\n1. Corticosteroids - Topical, intralesional, or systemic corticosteroids are the most commonly used treatments for Alopecia Areata. They work by suppressing the immune system, reducing inflammation, and promoting hair regrowth. However, long-term use may have side effects.\n2. Immunomodulators - Immunomodulators like Minoxidil, Anthralin, and Diphenylcyclopentenone are used to treat Alopecia Areata. These drugs work by modifying the immune response, allowing the hair follicles to grow back.\n3. Injections - Injections of corticosteroids, Melatonin, or other medications directly into the affected areas may provide better results than topical applications.\n4. Light Therapy - Low-level laser or light emission therapy (LLLT) may help slow down hair loss and promote hair growth in some people with Alopecia Areata.\n5. Hair transplantation - Hair transplantation can be an option for those with extensive hair loss. However, it's important to note that this is a cosmetic procedure and won't address the underlying cause of the condition.\n\nSome alternative therapies, like acupuncture, herbal remedies, and nutritional supplements, may help improve hair growth, but their effectiveness is not proven, and they shouldn't be considered a replacement for conventional treatments.\n\nAs a Saudi Arabian national, you may consider consulting Indian dermatologists who are experts in treating Alopecia Areata, such as Dr. D. Venkataswamy of Chennai, Dr. Rajesh Upadhyay of New Delhi, or Dr. Debasish Basu of Kolkata. Keep in mind that you may need to consult with them over video consultations or plan a trip to India for an in-person consultation. While the cost of treatments may vary, many Indian hospitals and clinics offer affordable rates compared to other countries. It's recommended to research the doctor's qualifications, experience, and reviews before making an appointment."}

However, please keep in mind that I cannot diagnose or provide medical advice, and you should always consult a healthcare professional for accurate information.\n\nThe symptoms your husband is experiencing - sudden chills, fever, and vomiting, along with elevated liver enzymes - could be indicative of several conditions, including:\n\n1. Hepatitis: This condition can cause inflammation of the liver and result in symptoms such as fatigue, fever, loss of appetite, nausea, and jaundice. Hepatitis can be viral, such as Hepatitis A, B, or C, or non-viral, such as drug-induced or autoimmune.\n2. Cholecystitis: While the CAT scan and sonogram ruled out gallstones, it is still possible that your husband is experiencing acute cholecystitis, which is inflammation of the gallbladder. However, this condition typically causes constant, localized pain in the upper right abdomen, rather than the sudden chills, fever, and vomiting described.\n3. Common bile duct stone: A bile duct stone, also known as a gallstone in the common bile duct, can cause symptoms similar to those your husband is experiencing, including fever, chills, and jaundice. This condition can cause a blockage in the bile duct, leading to the buildup of bile in the liver and subsequent liver damage and elevated liver enzymes.\n4. Gastrointestinal infection: Infections, such as foodborne illness or bacterial infections, can cause symptoms including fever, chills, and vomiting, while also leading to elevated liver enzymes.\n5. Metabolic conditions: Certain metabolic conditions, such as cirrhosis or Gilbert's syndrome, can cause elevated liver enzymes, but may not present with the other symptoms your husband is experiencing.\n\nYour husband's gastroenterologist should be able to provide a proper diagnosis and treatment plan based on further tests and information. In the meantime, encourage your husband to rest, stay hydrated, and eat light meals as tolerated."}

{"question": "Is \"follicle size of 18mm with endometrial thickness of 5.7mm\" a side effect of 'fertyl'?Hi i am 30 years old. This cycle i took fertyl 50mg starting 3 day for 5 days. Follicle monitoring done on 11 january shows follicle of size 18mm but endometrial thickness is just 5.7mm. Is this the side effect of fertyl. Will progynova 2mg help solve the problem. Last menstruation period date was 3 january.", "human": "Hallow, Fertyl is clomiphene citrate. It is basically used for egg release (ovulation) where natural ovulation is a problem. It is in particular useful in Polycystic Ovarian Syndrome where the follicles are maturing to varied extent and still the ovulation failure is noted. Clomiphene citrate is also having antioestrogenic effect. So it may hamper  growth of endometrium. Hence, in women where Endometrial growth is low, gonadotropin hormones may be preferred for induction of ovulation. Endometrial thickness between 9 mm to 13 mm has proved to be most conducive for implantation of fertilized ovum or blastocyst. Ovulation occurring when endometrium is just 5.7 mm is likely to end in 'no pregnancy'.So long as the follicular size is concerned, it has been reported for many decades that the ova discharged from the follicles of size between 18 mm to 21 mm are the healthiest one and give maximum fertilization rate and continuation of pregnancy success rate. Progynova is a synthetic hormone replacement for oestrogen. It is used to build up the lining of the uterus in preparation for embryo transfer during a thaw cycle for women who do not ovulate regularly. Hence in your case, it might prove to be effective in building up the endometrium. However, you should not wait for the ovulation beyond the follicular size more than 21 mm. If it takes longer for the endometrium to grow, you may waste this cycle and start Progynova earlier in next cycle and have ovulation at proper follicular size. I hope this information is useful to you for further decisions. Dr. Nishikant Shrotri", "ai": " I am an artificial intelligence and do not have the ability to examine you or your medical records directly. However, I can provide some general information based on the information you have provided.\n\nFollicle size and endometrial thickness are important indicators of fertility and are monitored during infertility treatments, including those using medications like clomiphene citrate (Brand name: Fertyl). A large follicle indicates the maturation of an ovulatory follicle, while a thin endometrial lining may indicate poor implantation potential.\n\nThe relationship between clomiphene use and endometrial thickness can be complex. Some studies suggest that clomiphene may cause a thin endometrial lining initially, but this may improve as the cycle progresses. Thus, a thin endometrial thickness on ultrasound scan does not necessarily mean that clomiphene use is the cause. Other factors, such as natural variability in endometrial thickness, age, weight, and underlying medical conditions, can also contribute to a thin endometrial lining.\n\nIf the fertility specialist recommends the use of progesterone to thicken the endometrial lining before transferring an embryo, this is a common practice in infertility treatments. Progesterone may be prescribed as Progynova, which is a micronized progesterone tablet that can be taken orally. However, it is essential to consult with your healthcare provider to discuss the specifics of your case and the recommended course of treatment. They will be able to consider all the available information, including your medical history, age, and test results, to determine the best approach for you."}

This can be due to several reasons, such as the healing process, scar tissue formation, or the regeneration of the damaged tissue.\n\nThe unevenness of your lips could also be due to the healing process. It is important to keep in mind that each person heals differently, and it may take some time for your lip to regain its normal appearance.\n\nYou can help ease the swelling by applying a cold compress on your lip for 15-20 minutes at a time, several times a day. Over-the-counter pain relievers, such as acetaminophen, can also help manage any discomfort.\n\nIf the swelling, knot, or unevenness persists for more than a week or two, or if it is causing significant pain or interfering with your daily activities, it would be a good idea to consult with your healthcare provider or a plastic surgeon for further evaluation. They may be able to recommend additional treatments or interventions to help improve your lip's appearance.\n\nIn the meantime, try to avoid activities that could further irritate or damage your lip, such as drinking hot beverages, eating hard or crunchy foods, or using harsh toothpastes or lip products. Keeping your lips hydrated with a lip balm can also help promote faster healing and reduce the appearance of scars."}

Overuse: Repeatedly putting stress on your knees during sprinting or any other high-impact exercise can lead to inflammation, pain, and even injury.\n2. Poor form: Performing exercises with incorrect form can put undue stress on your knees, leading to pain.\n3. Muscle imbalance: Imbalances in the muscles surrounding the knee can lead to instability and pain.\n4.

They can assess your situation and provide guidance based on your specific condition.\n\nSome possible solutions to help alleviate your knee pain include:\n\n1. Modifying your workout: Consider reducing the intensity or frequency of your sprinting workouts. You may also want to try low-impact alternatives, such as cycling or swimming.\n2. Improving your form: Working with a trainer or physical therapist can help you improve your form during your workouts to reduce stress on your knees.\n3. Rest and recovery: Taking time to rest and recover between workouts can help your knees heal and reduce pain.\n4.

If you attempt pregnancy now, most likely you will require insulin right from the beginning as pregnancy itself causes a diabetes like state which becomes more manifested in people who are already diabetic. Also you may need higher doses than in previous pregnancy. If the sugars are well controlled throughout the pregnancy then there should not be any issues for you as well as the baby. Everything depends upon the sugar levels. If they are controlled there are no risks. A proper diabetic diet and regular exercise will help keep the sugars down. Nothing extra needs to be done apart from this. So best of luck. Take care.Hope this satisfies your query. Thanks for using HCM.     Feel free to ask any more questions that you may have. Dr Madhuri BagdeConsultant Obstetrician and Gynecologist", "ai": " If you have a history of gestational diabetes (diabetes that develops during pregnancy) and you are now planning another pregnancy at the age of 34, it is important to consult with your healthcare provider to discuss any potential risks and necessary precautions. Here are some general suggestions:\n\n1. Careful planning and preparation: Start by making an appointment with your healthcare provider to discuss your pregnancy plans and to go over your medical history, including your previous pregnancy and delivery. Your provider may recommend certain tests or screenings to assess your risk for complications during this pregnancy.\n2. Maintain good blood sugar control: Properly managing your blood sugar levels is crucial for both your health and the health of your developing fetus. Work with your healthcare provider to develop a diet plan and, if needed, an exercise regimen to help you maintain healthy blood sugar levels.\n3.

Follow your healthcare provider's recommended schedule for prenatal visits.\n4. Medication management: Depending on your specific circumstances, your healthcare provider may recommend medications or insulin therapy to help you manage your blood sugar levels during pregnancy. Discuss the potential risks and benefits of any medications with your healthcare provider before making a decision.\n5. Stay hydrated: Drink plenty of water and other fluids throughout the day to help prevent dehydration, which can impact your blood sugar levels and overall health. Aim for at least eight cups (64 ounces or 1.9 liters) of water per day, but consult with your healthcare provider for specific recommendations based on your individual needs.\n6. Get enough rest: Adequate rest is important for maintaining good health during pregnancy. Pay attention to your body's signals and make sure you're getting enough sleep each night.\n7. Manage stress: High stress levels can impact your blood sugar levels and overall health. Practice relaxation techniques, such as deep breathing, meditation, or gentle yoga, to help manage stress and promote better health during your pregnancy.\n8.

The sore spot could be caused by a variety of conditions, including oral infections, trauma, or even a benign growth. However, given your friend's concern about cancer, it's important to take any potential signs seriously.\n\nCircumvallate papillae are bumps or small projections found on the surface of the tongue. They play an important role in taste perception. However, they can also be associated with certain conditions such as geographic tongue, a condition characterized by irregular loss of the papillae, or traumatic injury.\n\nThe redness and soreness your friend is experiencing could be related to an infection, trauma, or a more serious condition like cancer. It's important for your friend to follow through with the recommended biopsy to get a definitive diagnosis. While the procedure may be unpleasant, it's vital for identifying any potential health issues and ensuring proper treatment. The possibility of cancer cannot be ruled out without proper testing.

He is still working but has been feeling more tired than usual", "human": "The blood pressure you have mentioned is on the lower side and it explains the tiredness he is feeling.  Maybe lisinopril at 20 mg is more powerful for him and the erratic consumption od medication may add to the fluctuations in blood pressure is far worse than not taking any medication.  I would suggest you take take 10 mg lisinopril every day at a foxed time , if th3 blood pressure is still more than 140 / 90 than only increase the dosage . Regards Dr Priyank Mody", "ai": " High blood pressure (BP) itself does not directly cause fatigue. However, several factors related to high BP and its treatment can contribute to feelings of fatigue.\n\n1. Medications: Lisinopril is a common medication used to treat hypertension. One of its side effects is dizziness or lightheadedness, which can make a person feel tired or weak. In some cases, it can also cause flu-like symptoms such as muscle weakness, which can contribute to feelings of fatigue. If your husband is experiencing these side effects, it would be a good idea to talk to his healthcare provider about potentially adjusting his dosage or trying a different medication.\n\n2. Sleep disturbances: High BP can cause sleep disturbances, such as difficulty falling or staying asleep. This can lead to fatigue and daytime sleepiness. It's important for your husband to follow a consistent sleep schedule and avoid caffeine and alcohol close to bedtime.\n\n3. Anemia: High BP can sometimes be associated with anemia, a condition in which the body does not produce enough red blood cells to carry oxygen to the body's tissues. Anemia can cause fatigue, weakness, and shortness of breath. If your husband's healthcare provider suspects anemia, they may order blood tests to check his blood count.\n\n4. Other conditions: High BP can be a sign of underlying medical conditions, such as diabetes or kidney disease. These conditions can cause fatigue on their own, and it's important for your husband to follow up with his healthcare provider for a thorough evaluation to rule out any other potential causes.\n\n5. Lack of physical activity: Inactivity can contribute to fatigue and can also be a risk factor for high BP. Encouraging your husband to engage in regular physical activity, such as walking, can help improve his energy levels and overall health.\n\nIf your husband continues to feel more tired than usual, it's important for him to discuss his symptoms with his healthcare provider. They may be able to identify any underlying causes and recommend appropriate treatments."}

It's crucial to remember that this information is not a substitute for professional medical advice.\n\nRegarding your concern about your penis size, it's important to know that the size of a penis when it is not erect varies significantly among men. Penis size during an erection can be influenced by several factors, including blood flow, overall health, and mental and emotional factors. Since you've mentioned that you've been masturbating frequently for several years and have recently stopped, it's possible that your body may need some time to adjust.\n\nHowever, if you're experiencing a persistent lack of erectile function or size, it may be a good idea to consult a healthcare professional.

This is a type of eczema that affects the skin around the mouth and chin. It can present with small, red, bumpy rashes, which may look like pimples or acne. Additionally, symptoms such as a stuffy nose, headache, and feeling unwell are not uncommon with perioral dermatitis.\n\nPerioral dermatitis can be caused by various factors, including topical irritants (such as certain skincare products or toothpaste), oral medications (like tetracyclines, which were taken by your other daughter), or even saliva. It's important to note that perioral dermatitis is not contagious.\n\nThe first step in treating perioral dermatitis is to identify and avoid any potential triggers. This may involve changing skincare products, using a gentle toothpaste, or stopping any oral medications that may be contributing to the condition. Your daughter's healthcare provider may also recommend using a mild, over-the-counter topical cream or ointment to help soothe the affected skin.\n\nIf the condition does not improve with over-the-counter treatments, or if it becomes severely inflamed or infected, a prescription medication may be necessary. In some cases, antibiotics or corticosteroids may be used to help clear up the rash.\n\nIt's important to encourage your daughter to practice good skincare hygiene, including gently cleansing the affected area with a fragrance-free cleanser and patting it dry with a clean towel. She should also avoid picking or scratching at the bumps, as this can lead to infection and prolong the healing process.\n\nIf you're concerned about your daughter's symptoms, I would recommend making an appointment with her healthcare provider for a proper diagnosis and treatment consultation."}

What can I do now?", "human": "Hi, Metronidazole and alcohol interaction causes disulfiram-like reaction. This leads to nausea, vomiting, tachycardia (increased heartbeat), shortness of breath, etc. If you had consumed red wine 5 hours before the drug intake, then it is all right. There is nothing much to fear. You may have nausea and vomiting, but that would be minimal and temporary. 5 hours is ample time for the wine to be metabolized in the body.

Red wine contains ethanol, which is a type of alcohol. When Metronidazole is taken with alcohol, a disulfiram-like reaction can occur. This reaction can cause symptoms such as flushing, nausea, vomiting, headache, and rapid or irregular heartbeat.\n\nIf you have already taken Metronidazole and consumed red wine within a few hours of each other, there is not much you can do to undo the reaction. The best course of action is to avoid consuming alcohol while taking Metronidazole and for several hours after finishing the medication.\n\nIf you experience any symptoms of the disulfiram-like reaction, such as flushing, nausea, vomiting, or rapid heartbeat, you should contact your healthcare provider right away. They may recommend treatments to help alleviate the symptoms and ensure your safety.\n\nTo prevent this reaction in the future, be sure to follow your healthcare provider's instructions carefully and avoid consuming alcohol while taking Metronidazole.

{"question": "My teeth has turned yellow color, shall I need to undergo scaling ?My teeth has turned yellow color. I went to a dental doctor. the doctor suggested that these stains will not go by simple brushing. I need to undergo scling. He has given appointment for scaling.", "human": "Hi Raksha, Scaling is a procedure for cleaning teeth which is followed by polishing to remove stains and any other deposits accumulated in time. Scaling as i am sure as your dentist would have mentioned needs to be done every 6 months. The external stains may go with scaling and polishing but this does not result in whitening.Whitening of teeth is an entirely different procedure in which teeth lighten by 3-4 shades from the normal colour or sometimes even more. this procedure is commonly referred to as bleaching. There are 2 types of whitening procedure. one is done in clinic called inoffice procedure and the other is done by the patient in the house called home whitening. If you desire whitening, please consult your dentist for the same.Regards", "ai": " Scaling is a dental procedure that involves removing plaque and tartar buildup from your teeth, particularly below the gum line and in hard-to-reach areas. While scaling can help improve the appearance of your teeth by removing surface stains, it is not specifically a treatment for yellow teeth caused by intrinsic stains, which originated from within the tooth.\n\nYellowing teeth can be caused by a variety of factors, including genetics, age, lifestyle factors like smoking and consumption of foods and drinks high in stain-causing agents, and certain medications. For intrinsic stains, treatments such as teeth whitening or veneers may be more effective.\n\nIt's important to follow your dentist's recommendation and keep in mind that scaling is mainly to maintain oral health and prevent gum diseases, rather than as a primary solution for yellow teeth. If you have concerns about yellowing or stained teeth, it's best to consult your dental professional for a proper diagnosis and treatment plan."}

Ihope my answer will be helpful to you.", "ai": " I am an AI language model and not a doctor, but I can try to help you understand some general information about back pain and how you might be able to assess your symptoms.\n\nBack pain can be caused by a variety of conditions, including muscle or ligament strain, herniated discs, spinal stenosis, osteoporosis, or even kidney problems. The sudden onset of lower left back pain during tennis could be due to a muscle strain or a herniated disc. It's also possible that your pain could be related to your kidneys, but this is less likely based on the information you've provided.\n\nSymptoms of a kidney problem can include back pain, flank pain, fever, chills, and urinary symptoms like blood in the urine or frequent urination. If you have any of these symptoms, or if your pain is severe, persistent, or accompanied by other worrying symptoms like difficulty walking or breathing, you should see a doctor as soon as possible.\n\nTo help assess your pain, you can try to identify any specific characteristics, such as the location, radiation, and aggravating or relieving factors. For instance, if the pain is only on the left side and worsens when you cough, sneeze, or bear down, it could be more likely to be related to your kidneys. However, it's important to keep in mind that these are just general guidelines, and only a healthcare professional can accurately diagnose the cause of your symptoms.\n\nIf you're unsure about the severity of your back pain or if it might be related to a kidney issue, it's always a good idea to speak with your healthcare provider. They can evaluate your symptoms and perform any necessary tests to help determine the underlying cause and develop an appropriate treatment plan.\n\nIn the meantime, you can try some self-care measures to help relieve your pain, such as applying heat or ice, practicing gentle stretching or relaxation techniques, and avoiding activities that make the pain worse. Making sure you're getting enough rest, staying hydrated, and maintaining good posture can also help support your back and reduce the risk of further aggravating the injury."}

My  esr  increased from  35 t0 55 even when i had taken 250 mg proximexa  as advised by my doctor since he suspected infection. why did my esr increase after 3 days of antibiotics?", "human": "ESR is a nonspecific test indicating the presence of an inflammatory condition. This could be due to an infection or to many other causes. The inflammatory process and the change in ESR could be due to the infection and would occur regardless of antibiotic treatment- it is part of the body's response to the infection. If the infection clears up with treatment, the inflammatory process will start to clear up, but signs of it such as the ESR may take some time to return to normal. The ESR is not useful for following the course of an infection. Again, it may also be due to an entirely different condition from the infection, such as arthritis, lupus, response to injuries, etc etc. Hope this helps.", "ai": " ESR (Erythrocyte Sedimentation Rate) is a laboratory test that measures the rate at which red blood cells settle in an hour in a tube of blood. It is often used as an inflammatory marker, as an increase in ESR can indicate the presence of inflammation in the body.\n\nThe reason why your ESR increased after starting antibiotics for a suspected infection can have several explanations. Here are a few possibilities:\n\n1. The infection is more severe than initially thought: If the infection is more severe than initially suspected, the body's inflammatory response may be more pronounced, leading to a higher ESR reading.\n2. Other causes of inflammation: Antibiotics can have side effects, and some of them can cause inflammation. For example, antibiotics that kill normal bacteria in the gut can disrupt the gut microbiome and lead to inflammation, which can increase ESR levels.\n3. Delayed response: ESR is not an instant test, and it can take some time for the red blood cells to settle and for the result to be read. It's possible that your ESR was already elevated before the test was done, and it took a few days for the antibiotics to start reducing the inflammation, which is why the ESR level appeared higher after three days of treatment.\n4. Error in laboratory testing: It's also possible that there was an error in the laboratory testing, which led to an incorrectly high ESR result. It's important to discuss the test result with your healthcare provider to rule out any potential errors and to get a clear understanding of what the result means in the context of your overall health.\n\nIf you have concerns about your ESR result or about your condition in general, it's important to talk to your healthcare provider. They can help you interpret the test result, discuss any potential concerns, and adjust your treatment plan if necessary."}

A more specialized evaluation: If your symptoms persist despite multiple tests and therapies, it might be worthwhile to consider seeing a gastroenterologist or another specialist for a more in-depth evaluation. They may have additional tests or treatments that could help identify the cause of your pain.\n2. Diet modifications: Sometimes, food sensitivities or intolerances can cause stomach pain. It might be helpful to keep a food diary to see if there are any patterns between what you eat and when you experience pain. You could also try an elimination diet, where you remove certain foods from your diet for a period of time and gradually reintroduce them to see if they cause a reaction.\n3. Stress management: Stomach pain can be caused or worsened by stress and anxiety. Consider trying relaxation techniques, such as deep breathing, meditation, or progressive muscle relaxation, to help manage stress and improve your overall well-being.\n4. Alternative therapies: Some people find that alternative therapies, such as acupuncture or massage, can help relieve stomach pain. You might consider discussing these options with your healthcare provider or a practitioner trained in these therapies.\n5. Support groups: Living with chronic pain can be challenging and isolating.

It is for about 5-6 months that i feel pain in my left testicle as well as a sharp pain in my left Buttocks. I have done an Ultra Sound with no sign of testicular cancer. But the pain seems never to subside. Just wondering if there might be any Disk or Prostate problem involved. Thanks", "human": "Hi, It can be due to renal calculi, take anti-inflammatory drugs and take ultrasound pelvis to conform any stones in kidney.Hope I have answered your query. Let me know if I can assist you further. Regards,Dr. S. R. Raveendran, Sexologist", "ai": " Based on the information provided, it's important to note that I'm an AI language model and not a doctor. I can't diagnose or prescribe treatments, but I can suggest some potential causes and next steps based on common medical knowledge.\n\nThe pain you're experiencing in the testicle and left buttocks could be due to various conditions. The ultrasound results rule out testicular cancer, but other conditions might be responsible for the pain. Some possibilities include:\n\n1. Ingrown hair or hernia: An ingrown hair in the groin area or a hernia could irritate the nerve responsible for testicular pain.\n2. Musculoskeletal issues: You may have a muscle strain, a ruptured disc, or another spinal condition that causes referred pain to the testicle. This is less likely than other causes but still worth considering.\n3. Prostatitis: Prostatitis is inflammation of the prostate or the tissues surrounding the prostate. It can cause pain in the testicles, along with various other symptoms.\n4. Renal and ureteral colic: A kidney stone can refer pain to the testicle, resulting in a sharp pain.\n5. Nerve damage: It's possible the pain could be caused by damage to the genitofemoral nerve (the nerve supplying sensation to the testicle). This condition can be caused by trauma or surgeries, such as inguinal hernia repair surgery.\n\nConsidering the information you've provided, it seems likely that your symptoms might be caused by prostatitis, given the absence of testicular cancer and the persistent pain. However, only a healthcare professional can make a definitive diagnosis.\n\nIn pursuit of a diagnosis and potential treatment, you should consider visiting a urologist or your primary care provider. They may perform further tests to rule out any underlying conditions, such as blood tests or imaging studies. Additionally, there are various treatments for prostatitis, ranging from antibiotics for bacterial infections, pain relievers for inflammation, and physical therapy—speak to your healthcare provider for a personalized treatment plan."}

Your doctor has prescribed you Cycstone tablets from Himalaya, which is an herbal medication that contains extracts of Phyllanthus niruri and Punarnava roots. This medication is known to help in the dissolution of small kidney stones.\n\nHowever, if the stone size is 5.9mm, the medication might take longer to dissolve, and the treatment course might need to be extended or supplemented with other treatment options.\n\nAlways follow your doctor's advice and medication schedule closely. In addition to taking medication, increasing water intake is essential to help flush out the stone and reduce the concentration of stone-forming substances in the urine.\n\nSome other medications that your doctor may prescribe include:\n\n1. Allopurinol or Febuxostat: These medications are used when stones form due to high uric acid levels.\n2. Thiazide diuretics: These medications help increase urine output, which helps flush out the stone.\n3. Alpha blockers: If the stone is causing pain, your doctor may prescribe an alpha blocker to help relax the muscles around the ureter and alleviate the pain.\n4. NSAIDs or colchicine: These medications can help manage pain caused by kidney stones.\n\nAlways consult with your doctor about medication side effects, contraindications, and interactions before starting a new medication.

I can understand your concern. You have pancytopenia. There are many causes of pancytopenia.  Megaloblastic anemia,  Hypoplastic or aplastic marrow, certain viral infection, bone marrow fbrosis etc are the causes of pancytopenia.  You should go for bone marrow examination once to find the cause of pancytopenia. Then you should take treatment according to cause. Consult your doctor and take treatment accordingly. Hope I have answered your question, if you have doubt then I will be happy to answer. Thanks for using health care magic. Wish you a very good health. Don't forget to click thank you.", "ai": " I'm an artificial intelligence and don't have the ability to diagnose or prescribe medical treatments. I can provide you with information about the medications you mentioned and their potential uses in the context of pancytopenia.\n\nPancytopenia is a condition characterized by a decrease in all three types of blood cells: red blood cells (RBCs or anemia), white blood cells (WBCs or neutropenia), and platelets (thrombocytopenia). The exact cause of your pancytopenia needs to be determined by your doctor.\n\nLeucovorin, also known as folinic acid, is a B vitamin that is often used in combination with methotrexate, a chemotherapeutic drug, to reduce its side effects. Methotrexate can inhibit the production of new red and white blood cells in the bone marrow. Leucovorin helps to bypass this inhibition and allows the production of new cells. It is also used to treat certain types of anemia, such as megaloblastic anemia caused by folate deficiency.\n\nLivogen is a brand name for a combination of folic acid and cyanocobalamin, both are forms of vitamin B12. Folic acid and vitamin B12 are important nutrients for the production of new cells, particularly red blood cells. Deficiencies of these vitamins can lead to anemia, among other health issues.\n\nThis treatment, Leucovorin, Livogen, and Vitcofol, is aimed to support the bone marrow function and enhance the production of new blood cells. It's essential to take these medications as prescribed by your doctor, and to keep all follow-up appointments, as well as to report any side effects you may experience.\n\nIf your Hb (hemoglobin) level is 6.9 g/dL and your WBC (white blood cell) count is 2800/mm³, your anemia is considered moderate to severe. Your RBC count, 1.81 x 106/mm³, indicates microcytic anemia, which could be due to a variety of causes, such as thalassemia, lead poisoning, or sideroblastic anemia. Your doctor should perform additional tests to determine the underlying cause of your pancytopenia, which will help guide your treatment.\n\nYou might want to discuss your concerns and questions with your doctor to get a clearer understanding of your diagnosis, treatment, and what to expect during your recovery."}

Avoid hot and spicy food. Don't worry, you will be alright. Please hit thanks.", "ai": " It is important to note that I am an AI language model and not a doctor. I cannot provide definitive medical advice. However, I can help you understand the general safety information regarding taking lithium and Celexa together.\n\nBoth lithium and Celexa (citalopram) are prescription medications used to treat different mental health conditions. Lithium is often used to treat bipolar disorder, while Celexa is an antidepressant used to treat depression.\n\nAccording to the FDA and various studies, there is generally no contraindication to taking these medications together. However, there are some potential interactions that need to be monitored carefully.\n\nOne potential interaction is an increased risk of side effects related to the cardiovascular system, such as heart palpitations, heartburn, and other gastrointestinal symptoms. These side effects can occur with either medication alone or in combination.\n\nAdditionally, lithium and Celexa may both increase the risk of serotonin syndrome, a potentially life-threatening condition, if taken in excessive doses or in combination with other serotonin-enhancing medications. Symptoms of serotonin syndrome include agitation, confusion, hallucinations, rapid heart rate, muscle rigidity, and loss of muscle coordination.\n\nGiven your symptoms and concerns, I would recommend speaking with your healthcare provider about your experience and any potential interactions between your medications. It is important to provide accurate and detailed information about any symptoms you are experiencing, as well as any other medications, supplements, or substances you are taking. Your healthcare provider may be able to adjust your dosages or recommend alternative treatments, if necessary.\n\nIn the meantime, I would encourage you to continue taking your medications as prescribed, and to contact your healthcare provider if your symptoms worsen or become more frequent or severe. It's also important to remember that all medications come with risks and benefits, and that effective treatment of mental health conditions often requires a multidisciplinary approach that includes medication, therapy, and lifestyle changes.\n\nI hope this information is helpful.

The best thing you can do is when you wake up in the morning, before getting out of bed and taking a step, give yourself a little foot rub.There are many things you can try to help your foot get better:Give your feet a rest. Cut back on activities that make your feet hurt. Try not to walk or run on hard surfaces.Use shoes with good arch support and a cushioned sole.Do toe stretches, calf stretches and towel stretches several times a day, especially when you first get up in the morning.I do hope that you have found something helpful and I will be glad to answer any further query.Take care", "ai": " The symptoms you described, such as sharp pain on the arch of your foot with muscle spasms, constant cramping, and the inability to move your foot, could be indicative of several conditions, including:\n\n1. Plantar Fasciitis: This is a common condition characterized by inflammation and irritation of the plantar fascia, a thick band of tissue that runs along the bottom of your foot and connects your heel bone to your toes. This condition can cause severe pain, especially with the first steps in the morning or after long periods of rest.\n\n2. Tarsal Tunnel Syndrome: This condition occurs when the posterior tibial nerve, which supplies sensation to the bottom of your foot and allows muscles in your foot to move, becomes compressed. Symptoms may include pain, tingling, numbness, and muscle weakness in the foot and ankle. A severe, sudden onset of pain could be a sign of nerve compression.\n\n3.

The pain can feel like a grinding or throbbing sensation, and it may be worsened by pressure or movement.\n\n4. Ruptured Plantar Fascia: If the pain is severe, you may have suffered a rupture or tear in the plantar fascia. This condition can cause a sharp, stabbing pain in the arch, and it might feel like you've been hit by a heavy object.\n\n5. Other causes: There are other potential causes, such as a stress fracture, tendonitis, or an infection, that could also be responsible for your symptoms.\n\nIf you have any concerns or if your symptoms do not improve within a few days, you should consult with a healthcare professional for an accurate diagnosis and to develop a treatment plan. In the meantime, you can try the following self-care measures:\n\n1. Rest your foot: Avoid putting weight on the affected foot and give it time to heal.\n2. Ice: Apply ice to the affected area for 15-20 minutes several times a day to reduce inflammation and pain.\n3. Stretch: Gently stretch your foot and ankle, focusing on the calf muscles and the arch.\n4. Over-the-counter pain medication: Take over-the-counter pain relievers, such as ibuprofen or naproxen, as directed to help manage your pain.\n5. Supportive footwear: Wear comfortable, supportive shoes that do not put excessive pressure on the arch of your foot.\n6. Avoid activities that aggravate the pain: Avoid activities that make the pain worse, such as running, jumping, or prolonged standing.\n\nI cannot provide a definitive diagnosis without further examination, and it's important to consult a healthcare professional for accurate information."}

However, I can help you understand the general approach to treating a hematoma during pregnancy.\n\nA hematoma is a collection of blood outside of the blood vessels, and a 29x5x6 mm hematoma is considered to be larger than average. While it depends on its location and other factors, larger hematomas may require more intensive treatment to prevent complications, such as increasing pressure on the fetus or potential for infection.\n\nBoth Feragyn 2000 (human menopausal gonadotropins or hMG) and Sustana (human chorionic gonadotropin or hCG) are hormonal medications that can be used in pregnancy to promote ovulation or support fetal development. However, the reason for the different treatments prescribed by the doctors is likely related to the hematoma itself.\n\nFertgyn 2000 is typically used for ovulation induction in infertile women, while Sustana is often recommended during pregnancy to prevent the shrinking of the corpus luteum and maintain progesterone levels. In the context of a hematoma, the doctors may be using Sustana to help prevent further bleeding or promote clot stabilization. It is essential to clarify these points with your healthcare provider, as each person's situation may differ.\n\nBefore making any decisions or starting new treatments, it is essential to discuss any concerns and questions with your doctor, as they are the best resource to guide you through your pregnancy and ensure the safety of both you and your developing baby."}

However, it's essential to weigh the risks and benefits of leaving the polyps versus undergoing a cholecystectomy (gallbladder removal).\n\nThe decision to perform a cholecystectomy in individuals with small gallbladder polyps is primarily based on the presence of symptoms related to the gallbladder or gallstones and the risk of gallbladder cancer. While the risk of gallbladder cancer is low with small polyps, it is still higher than the general population. For instance, the estimated risk is around 0.1% for polyps between 3-10 mm in size.\n\nDuring pregnancy, the risk of developing gallbladder problems, including gallstones and gallbladder cancer, increases due to hormonal changes and the increased workload on the liver and gallbladder. Yet, there is no clear consensus on whether small gallbladder polyps necessitate removal during pregnancy.\n\nIf you are asymptomatic and have no other significant health problems, some experts suggest monitoring these polyps with regular ultrasound scans instead of undergoing the surgical procedure during pregnancy. However, it's essential to discuss this decision with your healthcare provider, as they can provide you with the most accurate advice based on your personal medical history and circumstances.\n\nUltimately, the choice is yours, and you should take into consideration the potential risks and benefits of both options.

They may perform blood tests to check your red blood cell count, hemoglobin levels, and iron levels to help diagnose anemia or rule out other potential causes.\n\nTo manage anemia, your doctor may recommend dietary changes to include more iron-rich foods, such as red meat, poultry, fish, beans, and dark, leafy green vegetables. They may also suggest taking iron supplements or prescription medication as needed. In severe cases, a blood transfusion may be necessary.\n\nAs mentioned earlier, it's essential to speak with your healthcare provider for a proper diagnosis and to rule out other conditions that may cause similar symptoms. If you are experiencing any of the symptoms you have described, do not delay in seeking medical attention."}

Hope I have answered your query.Let me know if I can assist you further. Regards,Dr. Parth Goswami,General & Family Physician", "ai": " I'm an AI language model and not a doctor, but I can help you understand some possible causes of an elevated bilirubin level based on the information you've provided. However, it's important that you consult your healthcare provider for an accurate diagnosis and advice tailored to your specific situation.\n\nBilirubin is a yellow pigment produced when your liver breaks down old red blood cells. The elevation of bilirubin could be due to several reasons. Here are some possibilities, considering your mentioned health conditions:\n\n1. Fatty liver: Fatty liver disease can cause an increase in bilirubin levels. When the liver is damaged due to fat accumulation, it may not function properly in processing and excreting bilirubin.\n\n2. Increased breakdown of red blood cells: Regular physical activity, especially intense exercise, can put additional stress on the body and may lead to the breakdown of more red blood cells than usual, which in turn can cause an increase in bilirubin levels.\n\n3. Diabetes: Despite your borderline blood sugar, it's worth noting that diabetes can contribute to an elevated bilirubin level. Diabetes can cause damage to the liver, leading to impaired bilirubin metabolism.\n\n4. Other liver diseases: Since your LFTs (liver function tests) were slightly elevated, there could be other liver-related issues causing bilirubin elevation. However, it's essential to remember that one elevated result doesn't necessarily indicate a chronic liver disease, but your healthcare provider will monitor this.\n\n5. Cholesterol medication (Statins): Statins, medications used to lower cholesterol, can cause an increase in bilirubin levels in some cases. However, this is usually considered a mild and reversible side effect and not typically a cause for concern.\n\n6. Other factors: There can be several other causes of an elevated bilirubin level, such as infections, tumors, or genetic conditions. However, these possibilities appear less likely given the information you've provided.\n\nSince your healthcare provider is planning to recheck your bilirubin level in two weeks, it's essential to remain calm and trust in their expertise. By following their advice and keeping them informed of any changes in your health or symptoms, they will help you navigate through any concerns that arise."}
{"question": "Q. Kindly suggest the glasses that can be used while working on laptop.Hello doctor,I am 27 years old, male, pursuing PG. This is the dissertation writing time for me. For that, I have to rely on a laptop most of the time. It makes my eyes uncomfortable (red and dry). So, would be glad to have suggestions. Any glasses that I could use while working on a laptop?", "human": "Hi. People who spend much time in front of digital screens like a laptop, mobiles, etc., are at higher risk of developing dry eyes also called computer eye syndrome. Usually, we blink 8 to 12 times per minute but while using digital devices blink rate is decreased 2 to 3 times per minute. That is why tear film is disturbed and eyes get dry. So keep using Refresh Tears and try to modify the habits like blinking every 10 to 15 seconds during laptop use and try to avoid any humid environment. I hope these simple things will help you a lot.", "ai": " I'm not a doctor, but I can suggest that you consider using computer glasses or blue light blocking glasses while working on your laptop to help reduce eye strain and discomfort. These glasses are specifically designed to filter out the high-energy visible light emitted by digital devices, which can contribute to eye fatigue and discomfort. Some popular brands include Gunnar, Blue Light Blocking Glasses, and Warby Parker's Prescription Computer Glasses. However, it's always a good idea to consult with an optometrist or ophthalmologist to determine the best solution for your specific needs. Additionally, practicing the 20-20-20 rule, which involves taking a 20-second break every 20 minutes to look at something 20 feet away, can help reduce eye strain as well."}

Here are some possibilities:\n\n1. Trigeminal neuralgia: Also known as tic douloureux, this condition is characterized by sudden, severe electrocution-like pain in the mouth or face. It's often described as a sharp, jabbing, or shooting pain and can be triggered by touch, chewing, or speaking.\n2. Atypical facial pain: This condition is characterized by persistent, aching facial pain that doesn't follow a nerve distribution pattern. The pain is often described as burning, throbbing, or dull and can be on one or both sides of the face.\n3. Temporomandibular joint (TMJ) disorder: This condition affects the joint that connects the jawbone to the skull and can cause pain, clicking, or popping sounds in the jaw. The pain can spread to other areas in the face, including the mouth.\n4. Glossitis or stomatitis: These conditions are inflammation of the tongue or mucous membranes in the mouth, respectively.

Nothing about my health is out of the ordinary (besides the lump) so I have no idea what it is.", "human": "Hello and Welcome to ‘Ask A Doctor’ service. I have reviewed your query and here is my advice. In most cases cause is benign and should not worry you. If this I soft and not painful then this in most cases indicates swollen lymph node, lipoma or atheroma. And if this is hard and immobile swelling behind the ear would be a bony swelling, most commonly known as osteoma. These swellings are generally asymptomatic and requires no treatment. However if it increases in size or you develop pain then I would like you to meet a ENT doctor for further evaluation and treatment. The other swelling in the neck is likely to be a lymph node and since it has not increased in size for past few years then you have nothing to worry. No treatment is required.

However, this list is not exhaustive, and it's important to note that only a healthcare professional can give you an accurate diagnosis.\n\n1. Swollen lymph nodes: Lymph nodes behind the ear can swell in response to infection or inflammation. This can cause a hard, tender, and painful lump.\n2. Ear infection: An infection in the middle ear or mastoid bone can sometimes result in a lump behind the ear. Symptoms may also include earache, fever, and difficulty hearing.\n3. Abscess: A collection of pus, usually caused by a bacterial infection, can form an abscess behind the ear. This can result in a painful, hot, and tender lump.\n4. Cancer: While less common, a lump behind the ear could be a sign of a cancerous growth, such as squamous cell carcinoma or a benign tumor. This is less likely if you are otherwise healthy, but it is still a concern.\n\nGiven the brief description you've provided, it's hard to pinpoint the exact cause. However, if you're experiencing increasing pain, tenderness, or if you notice other worrying symptoms like fever, loss of hearing, or difficulty swallowing, it would be best to consult a healthcare professional as soon as possible. In the meantime, applying a warm compress to the area can help reduce discomfort and increase blood flow to the affected area, making it easier for your body to fight any potential infection. However, if the pain worsens or there's no improvement after a few days, it's essential to seek medical attention."}

Consult your doctor and take treatment accordingly. Hope I have answered your question, if you have doubt then I will be happy to answer. Thanks for using health care magic. Wish you a very good health.", "ai": " I'm not a doctor, but I can try to provide you some information that might help. The lump you're experiencing could be caused by several conditions, some of which are more common than others, given your recent shoulder surgery. Here are a few possibilities:\n\n1. Hematoma: A hematoma is a collection of blood outside of a vessel. It can occur following surgery, especially after a procedure that involves trauma to the tissue, such as knee or shoulder surgery. The pressure you felt before going to bed could be due to the hematoma enlarging. However, hematomas usually appear in the surgical area, so it's uncommon for one to form in the area between your vagina and the crease of your leg.\n\n2. Lymphedema: Lymphedema is the swelling of body tissue due to the accumulation of lymph fluid. It can occur as a side effect of surgery, radiation therapy, or other treatments for cancer. This condition typically affects the arms or legs but can occasionally present in other areas.\n\n3. Hernia: Although the lump's location makes this possibility less likely, it's still worth mentioning. A hernia is the bulge or protrusion of an organ or fatty tissue through the wall of the muscle or connective tissue that holds it in place. This condition is typically accompanied by a dull ache or heaviness, but it's essential to rule it out.\n\n4. Infection: An infection could also be a cause for concern. Infections can occur following surgery, and if the infection is located near the surgical site, it could potentially spread to other areas.\n\nIt is crucial to consult with your healthcare provider to determine the cause of the lump. They may suggest imaging tests like an ultrasound or an MRI, as well as a physical examination, to help diagnose the issue. Remember not to rely on online information alone and seek professional advice to ensure an accurate diagnosis and the best treatment options. In the meantime, try to keep the area clean and avoid putting excessive pressure on it."}

Hormonal therapy: Your healthcare provider might suggest hormonal therapy to help control your bleeding. Progesterone is a commonly used hormone for this purpose, as it decreases blood flow in the uterus.\n2. Iron supplements: If you have experienced significant blood loss during and after childbirth, you may benefit from iron supplements to help prevent or treat anemia.\n3. Antifibrinolytics: Antifibrinolytic medications, like epsilon-aminocaproic acid or aminocaproic acid, help to stop bleeding by preventing the breakdown of blood clots. These medications can be used in addition to or instead of tranexamic acid. However, they do carry some risks, such as increased risk of blood clots, and should be used under the close supervision of a healthcare provider.\n4. Surgery: In rare cases where other methods have not been effective, a surgical procedure may be necessary to stop the bleeding. This could involve a dilation and curettage (D&C) or a hysterectomy.\n5. Emotional support: Postpartum hemorrhage can be emotionally taxing, so it's essential to take care of your emotional health. Consider joining support groups for women who have experienced similar conditions, or speaking with a counselor or therapist.\n\nIt's important to discuss these treatment options with your healthcare provider to determine the best course of action for your individual situation. If you continue to feel concerned about your postpartum bleeding, consider requesting a referral to a gynecologist or a specialist in women's health."}
{"question": "Is IRBBB dangerous?my 11 yr old son was told he has IRBBB. Naturally as parents we are so stressed. He is VERY athletic and loves sports. Sometimes gets a little short of breath with endurance sports like Basketball.. we have a dr's appt next week. Hopefully will get news... but how serious is IRBBB?", "human": "Thanks for your question on Health Care Magic. I can understand your concern. IRBBB is Incomplete Right Bundle Branch Block. First of all, you need to understand basis of bundle branch to understand IRBBB. There are two bundle branches in heart which transmit the impulse from atria to ventricle. Right and left. Any block in this transmission, can cause problem in transmission of impulse from atria to ventricle and hence ventricle will not function properly. In pediatric patient, most common cause for this is developmental defect. So in your son's case, his right bundle branch is blocked incompletely. So right ventricle is not functioning well. Right ventricle is connected to lungs, so he feels shortness of breath on exertion. Honestly speaking, this is serious health issue and this can worsen with the age. So consult cardiologist as soon as possible for this  IRBBB. Hope I have solved your query. I will be happy to help you further. Wishing good health to your son. Thanks.", "ai": " I'm an AI language model and cannot provide medical advice, but I can try to help answer your question about IRBBB based on available information. IRBBB, or Iron Responsive Element Binding Protein B, is a gene that provides instructions for making a protein involved in the body's response to iron levels. Mutations in this gene can lead to various health conditions, the most common being Thoracic Aortic Aneurysm and Thoracic Aortic Dissection (TAAD), which affect the aorta, the large blood vessel that carries blood from the heart to the rest of the body.\n\nIt is important to note that not all people with IRBBB mutations will develop these conditions. The risk and severity can vary greatly among individuals. Generally, the risk is higher with specific types of mutations and in those with a family history of TAAD.\n\nAs for athletic activities and shortness of breath, IRBBB mutations, in most cases, are not directly linked to these symptoms. Shortness of breath can have numerous causes, including asthma, exercise induced bronchoconstriction, or other cardiovascular conditions. An athlete's activity level and physical fitness can help protect against the development or progression of possible cardiovascular issues.\n\nYour son's doctor will be able to provide more accurate information about his specific situation based on testing results and family history. It is common for such appointments to bring a range of emotions, but it's essential to remember that knowledge is power, and understanding the condition can lead to better management and effective strategies for prevention, if needed. In the meantime, you can focus on maintaining positive thoughts and ensuring your son continues enjoying his athletic activities while under the guidance of medical professionals."}

Some individuals report feeling calmer and less anxious within a few days of starting supplementation, while others may not experience any improvement until they have taken it for several weeks.\n\nIt is essential to keep in mind that each individual's response to GABA supplementation may differ, and it may not be effective for everyone. If you experience anxiety or nervousness disorders, it is recommended to consult with a healthcare professional before considering GABA supplements. They can provide you with accurate and personalized information based on your specific circumstances and overall health.\n\nAdditionally, GABA supplements should not be considered a primary treatment for anxiety disorders or other mental health conditions. They are a supplement, not a cure, and should be used in conjunction with therapy and other proven treatments as recommended by your healthcare provider."}

However, I can suggest some general tips that might help you manage your symptoms:\n\n1. Identify and avoid triggers: Try to identify any potential triggers for your dermatitis, such as certain foods, cosmetics, or environmental factors. Once identified, avoid contact with those triggers as much as possible.\n\n2. Moisturize regularly: Use a fragrance-free, hypoallergenic moisturizer to keep your skin hydrated and soothe some of the itching and irritation. Apply it after washing your face or whenever your skin feels dry.\n\n3. Adjust your skincare routine: Minimize the use of harsh cleansers, toners, and other skincare products that may aggravate your dermatitis. You might need to switch to gentle, fragrance-free products that won't irritate your skin.\n\n4. Cool compresses: Use cool compresses or wet cloths to relieve itching and inflammation. You can apply these compresses a few times a day as needed.\n\n5. Avoid scratching: Scratching can worsen the itching and potentially lead to infection. Instead, try to resist the urge to scratch and use gentle techniques like applying a cool compress or moisturizing your skin to alleviate itching.\n\n6. Monitor your symptoms: Keep track of your symptoms and report any changes to your dermatologist. They may need to adjust your treatment plan if your symptoms worsen or improve.\n\n7. Alternative treatment options: If you find that the current treatment prescribed by your dermatologist is not working well for you, you can discuss alternative treatment options with your healthcare provider. These may include other topical medications, oral medications, or light therapy.\n\nIt's important to remember that every person's skin is unique, and what works for one person may not work for another. If you're unsure about any of these steps or if you experience any concerning symptoms, it's always best to consult with your healthcare provider or dermatologist."}

However, Metformin can cause gastrointestinal side effects such as nausea, vomiting, and stomach pain.\n\nLow blood sugar (hypoglycemia) can cause symptoms such as dizziness, sweating, weakness, and diarrhea. The diarrhea you experienced could have been caused by the hypoglycemia, or it could have been an unrelated issue.\n\nYour other medications, Levothyroxine for hypothyroidism and Kariva for birth control, do not typically cause diarrhea as a side effect. It is worth discussing this issue with your healthcare provider, as they can evaluate your symptoms and determine the cause. They may want to check your stool for any signs of infection or inflammation, or they may want to adjust your medications.\n\nIn the future, make sure to always test your blood sugar level before driving or operating machinery, especially after skipping meals or increasing your physical activity. It is also important to monitor your blood sugar levels closely and adjust your medications as needed to avoid both hypoglycemia and hyperglycemia."}

It's important to note that I cannot diagnose or recommend specific treatments based on your description alone. The symptoms you've mentioned, such as a popping sound, sharp pain, and a visible bruise, could potentially be signs of a calf strain or a deeper injury, like a tear.\n\nIt's a good sign that your symptoms have improved after six days, but if you're still experiencing pain when walking, it would be wise to consult a healthcare professional. They can perform a thorough examination and suggest appropriate treatments.\n\nIn the meantime, you can continue with the R.I.C.E. (Rest, Ice, Compression, Elevation) protocol to help manage your symptoms and promote healing. Avoid putting weight on the affected leg as much as possible, and consider using crutches or a cane for support when necessary. Pain medications, such as over-the-counter anti-inflammatory drugs or prescription painkillers, may be recommended by your doctor to help manage your pain.

Both prednisolone and Microgynon 30 have potential interactions that could affect their effectiveness when taken together.\n\nPrednisolone is a steroid medication commonly used to reduce inflammation. Asthma exacerbations can cause inflammation that may require steroid therapy. In theory, prednisolone should not directly interfere with the effectiveness of Microgynon 30, as they primarily target different issues (inflammation and contraception, respectively).\n\nHowever, it's essential to inform your GP or other healthcare provider about all the medications you're taking, including any prescription and over-the-counter drugs, as well as any herbal remedies, vitamins, or supplements. They can then assess whether any potential interactions may affect the safety or efficacy of your medications.\n\nYou might consider reaching out to your GP to discuss your current medications and get clarification on the potential interaction between prednisolone and Microgynon 30. If needed, they may suggest alternative contraceptive options or adjust the dosages of the medications to minimize any potential risks or side effects.\n\nRemember, it's crucial to maintain clear communication with your healthcare team regarding all your medications to ensure the best possible health outcomes."}

I encourage you to discuss these suggestions with your healthcare provider, as they can assess your situation and provide personalized recommendations:\n\n1. Rheumatoid Arthritis (RA): Be sure to discuss the effectiveness of your current RA treatment plan with your healthcare provider. Depending on your symptoms and response to current treatment, they might consider adjusting your medication dosage or prescription. Physical therapy and lifestyle modifications, such as regular exercise, healthy eating, and stress reduction techniques, may also be beneficial for managing RA symptoms.\n\n2. Headache: Over-the-counter pain relievers like acetaminophen or non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) could help manage headaches. Keep in mind that NSAIDs can potentially worsen stomach ulcers or increase the risk of gastrointestinal bleeding. Consider discussing other options with your doctor if you suffer from frequent headaches.\n\n3. Jaw pain: RA can cause temporomandibular joint (TMJ) inflammation and jaw pain. Applying heat or cold compression to the affected area can help relieve discomfort. Also, practicing jaw relaxation exercises, such as resting your jaw in a comfortable position and gently massaging your jaw muscles, can help.\n\n4. Low BP and high pulse: Although not listed as a symptom of RA, low blood pressure (hypotension) and high pulse (tachycardia) can be potential side effects of certain medications, such as RA drugs or some blood pressure medications. Be sure to discuss these symptoms with your healthcare provider, as they might need to adjust your treatment plan.\n\n5. Tinnitus: Ringing in the ears, or tinnitus, could be a side effect of certain medications, such as aspirin or certain RA drugs. Avoid taking over-the-counter pain medications without consulting your doctor, as they might increase your risk of tinnitus. Other possible causes of tinnitus include stress, earwax, or other underlying medical conditions. You may want to consider trying relaxation techniques, wearing earplugs, or using a sound generator to help mask the ringing noise.\n\nRemember, it's essential to discuss any symptoms or concerns with your healthcare provider, as they can give you the most accurate information specific to your circumstances."}

So the next step is to look for certain liver damage and most common casue is fatty liver disease. It should be confirmed by ultrasound. Other causes are viral hepatitis,s irrhosis, medications, alcohol intake or autoimmune diseases. To verify exact cause, US, bilirubin levels and tumor markers should be additionaly done Then appropriate treatment can be started.I hope I have answered you query. If you have any further questions you can contact us in every time.Kindly regards. Wish you a good health.", "ai": " I cannot definitively diagnose a liver disease based on your brother's elevated SGPT (Synthetase, Alpha-1) and SGOT (Synthetase, Alkaline) levels without further investigation. However, I can suggest some steps for you:\n\n1. Specialist Doctor: It would be best to consult a hepatologist (a doctor specializing in liver diseases) or a gastroenterologist (a doctor specializing in the digestive system) since your brother's liver enzymes are significantly elevated. To find one in Pune or Ahmednagar, you can contact the local medical association or ask your brother's current doctors for a referral.\n2. Possible Disease: Elevated SGPT and SGOT levels can be indicative of several different liver diseases, including viral hepatitis, alcoholic liver disease, drugs or toxins, or other less common causes. Given your brother's recent diagnosis and treatment for dengue, it's important to consider the possibility of post-viral or drug-induced liver injury, but other causes should also be considered.\n3. Precautions: Your brother should avoid alcohol consumption and maintain a healthy diet rich in fruits, vegetables, and lean proteins. He should also try to drink plenty of fluids, avoid fatty and fried foods, and not take any over-the-counter medications without consulting his doctor first. It may also be beneficial to avoid foods with high levels of saturated fats and cholesterol.\n4. Medicines: Treatment for liver diseases will depend on the underlying cause. In your brother's case, if it is a post-viral condition, supportive care and rest may be sufficient. If it is a drug-induced liver injury, discontinuing the offending medication and avoiding other potential liver toxins may be needed. In cases where the liver function does not improve or becomes worse, further interventions such as steroids, intravenous fluids, or specialized medical treatments may be necessary. Consulting a hepatologist will help establish the most effective treatment plan."}
{"question": "Is there any safe methods to remove amalgam without side effects ?Hi i believe i have mercury poisoning from my amalgam fillings, i am currently waiting for my blood tests to come in, my question is  if i get  the teeth removed with the amalgam will there be any mercury released in my system from that or  is that a safe method to remove the amalgam without the side effects. i removed 3 amalgams fairly safely with a dentist but i still had terrible side effects.", "human": "thanks for your query, i have gone through your question..the side effects could be because of the amalgam restorations but you can get it removed and restore it with composites..no need to remove the teeth...there are no side effects by removing the amalgam... i hope my answer will help you..take care..", "ai": " I am an artificial intelligence and do not have the ability to diagnostic health conditions or provide medical advice. However, I can share some information about the process of removing amalgam fillings and the potential concerns you have raised.\n\nAmalgam is a metal alloy used for dental fillings that contains mercury. When amalgam fillings are removed, some mercury can be released. The extent of the mercury release depends on various factors, including the size and location of the filling, the technique used during removal, and the individual's overall health.\n\nThe American Dental Association (ADA) states that amalgam is safe for adults and children over the age of 6. The ADA also states that the process of removing amalgam fillings does not pose a significant risk to health, provided that standard safety measures are followed, such as using a high-volume evacuator to remove amalgam debris, using a protective barrier to prevent contact with the skin, and ensuring good ventilation in the treatment room.\n\nHowever, some individuals may experience symptoms they attribute to mercury exposure during or after the removal of amalgam fillings. These symptoms can include dental pain, headaches, fatigue, muscle weakness, cognitive impairment, and others. The scientific evidence regarding a causal relationship between mercury exposure from dental fillings and these symptoms is controversial and not conclusive.\n\nIf you have had terrible side effects after having three amalgam fillings removed, it may be worth considering other potential causes. For example, you may have an underlying health condition or be sensitive to other substances used during the dental procedure. Moreover, the side effects you experienced could be unrelated to the removal of the fillings.\n\nIn any case, it is important to discuss your concerns with your healthcare provider or dentist. They can help you evaluate your symptoms, interpret the results of your blood tests, and suggest appropriate treatments or referrals if needed. If you decide to have additional amalgam fillings removed, be sure to find a qualified dentist who follows standard safety measures during the procedure."}

However, I can share some general information about sickle beta thalassemia and the potential risks associated with repeated sickle crises.\n\nSickle beta thalassemia is a type of inherited blood disorder characterized by the production of abnormal hemoglobin. This condition can lead to the formation of sickle-shaped red blood cells, which can get stuck in small blood vessels, causing blockages and leading to sickle crises. Repeated sickle crises can potentially result in various complications, including:\n\n1. Organ damage: Repeated sickle crises can lead to damage to organs such as the kidneys, lungs, brain, and eyes.\n2. Infections: People with sickle cell disease are more prone to infections due to the damage to their immune systems, and each sickle crisis can weaken the body and make it easier for infections to take hold.\n3. Bone damage: Repeated sickle crises can lead to bone damage and pain.\n4. Anemia:Sickle crises can cause anemia, which can make it difficult for the body to deliver oxygen to all of its tissues.\n\nWith regard to your question about danger and hospitalization, it is always a good idea to consult with your healthcare provider for personalized medical advice. They will be able to evaluate your overall health condition and determine if hospitalization is necessary based on the severity of your symptoms and the frequency of your sickle crises.\n\nIn the meantime, there are some things you can do to help manage your sickle cell disease and reduce the risk of complications, including:\n\n1. Stay hydrated: Dehydration can worsen sickle crises, so be sure to drink plenty of fluids.\n2. Avoid triggers: There are certain triggers, such as stress, cold temperature, and dehydration, that can worsen sickle crises. Try to avoid these triggers as much as possible.\n3. Get vaccinated: People with sickle cell disease are more susceptible to infections, so getting vaccinated is important to help protect against common infections like the flu and pneumococcal disease.\n4. Maintain a healthy lifestyle: Eating a healthy diet and getting regular exercise can help improve overall health and reduce the frequency and severity of sickle crises.\n5. Follow your healthcare provider's recommendations: Be sure to follow your healthcare provider's recommendations for managing your sickle cell disease, which may include medications, blood transfusions, and other treatments.\n\nIf you have any concerns about your health or the severity of your sickle crises, do not hesitate to contact your healthcare provider for advice and guidance. They can help you manage your condition and minimize the risks associated with repeated sickle crises."}

Mangat.", "ai": " I am unable to provide definitive answers to medical questions, as I am an artificial intelligence and do not have the ability to diagnose or prescribe medication. However, I can provide you with some general information that might be helpful.\n\nProchlorperazine is an antiemetic medication used to treat nausea and vomiting. It belongs to a class of drugs called phenothiazines. Rejection medicines, also known as immunosuppressants, are used to prevent the body from rejecting a transplanted organ. These medications work by suppressing the immune system.\n\nIt is essential to inform your treating physicians, including your oncologist and transplant team, about all medications you are taking to avoid potential drug interactions or complications. They are in the best position to evaluate your individual situation and determine whether taking prochlorperazine is safe while on immunosuppressants.\n\nImmunosuppressants can increase the risk of side effects from antiemetic medications like prochlorperazine, such as drowsiness, dizziness, or restlessness. Additionally, phenothiazine drugs can potentially alter the levels of immunosuppressant drugs in your body. Therefore, it is crucial to communicate openly about your medication use to prevent potential adverse reactions or complications.\n\nPlease discuss your concern with your healthcare provider to clarify your specific situation and establish an appropriate course of action. They may recommend alternative antiemetics or adjust your current medications based on your medical history and current treatment plan."}
{"question": "Would paracetamol overdose cause labyrinthitis?Hi just over a weak ago i took 24 500mg tablets of paracetamol at once, I did not experience any vomitting or side effects at the time. 5 days ago i started feeling very dizzy and unsteady and the doctor told me I had labyrinthitis, could this be anything to do with the paracetamol overdose?", "human": "Hi,Overdose of Parecetamol is unlikely to be the cause for labyrinthitis. The most common toxic effects due to paracetamol overdose is nausea, vomiting, right upper abdominal pain, liver dysfunction, fatigue, fever and jaundice. Labyrnthitis (inner ear disorder) could be due to certain infections caused by viruses or bacteria.Hope I have answered your query. Let me know if I can assist you further. Regards,Dr. Mohammed Taher Ali, General & Family Physician", "ai": " It is highly unlikely that a paracetamol overdose directly causes labyrinthitis. Paracetamol overdose can lead to liver damage, which in severe cases can cause encephalopathy (brain dysfunction), but there is no established link between paracetamol and labyrinthitis. Labyrinthitis is typically caused by viral infections, bacterial infections, or inner ear disorders, and the symptoms include vertigo, dizziness, tinnitus, and hearing loss.\n\nIt's important to remember that taking a large dose of paracetamol may mask the symptoms of an overdose, as it can relieve fever and pain that may indicate liver damage. If you're unsure about any medication you've taken, it's always a good idea to consult a healthcare professional for advice."}

I was just wondering what it might be.", "human": "Hi, It can be ankle sprain most probably developed due to trivial trauma or slipping.

Hope I have answered your query. Let me know if I can assist you further. Regards,Dr. Shinas Hussain,General & Family Physician", "ai": " I'm not a doctor, but I can try to help you with some possible causes and suggested treatments for your pain and burning sensation in the ankle. However, please keep in mind that this information should not be used as a substitute for professional medical advice.\n\nSome common causes of ankle pain and swelling include:\n\n1. Ankle sprain: This is a common injury, especially for people who are active. An ankle sprain occurs when the ligaments that support the ankle are stretched or torn. This can cause pain, swelling, and difficulty walking.\n2. Arthritis: Arthritis can affect the ankle joint and cause pain, swelling, and stiffness.\n3. Tendonitis: Inflammation of the tendons in the ankle can cause pain and swelling.\n4. Gout: This is a type of arthritis that causes sudden attacks of pain, swelling, redness, and warmth in the joints, often in the big toe or ankle.\n5. Nerve damage: Nerve damage in the ankle can cause burning or tingling sensations.\n\nHere are some possible treatments that may help alleviate the pain and swelling:\n\n1. Rest, ice, compression, and elevation (RICE): These are the basic principles for treating an ankle injury. Rest the ankle by avoiding activities that cause pain. Ice the ankle for 15-20 minutes at a time, several times a day, to reduce swelling. Compress the ankle with an elastic bandage or brace, and keep the ankle elevated above heart level to reduce swelling and aid in healing.\n2. Pain relievers: Over-the-counter pain relievers, such as acetaminophen or nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) like ibuprofen or naproxen, can help reduce pain and inflammation. However, be sure to follow the instructions on the label and speak to your doctor before taking these medications, especially if you have any underlying health conditions or are taking other medications.\n3. Physical therapy: A physical therapist can help you develop a plan to strengthen the muscles around your ankle and improve flexibility and range of motion.\n4. Braces or orthotics: A brace or orthotic device can provide support and prevent further injury to the ankle.\n5. Surgery: In some cases, surgery may be necessary to repair damage to the ligaments, tendons, or cartilage in the ankle.\n\nIt's important to see a doctor if your ankle pain persists despite home treatment, or if you experience any signs of infection such as redness, warmth, or pus in the affected area. They can help diagnose the underlying cause of the pain and recommend appropriate treatment."}

Dr wants me to have pt for neck, but my neck hurts just turning it.", "human": "Hello and Welcome to ‘Ask A Doctor’ service.I have reviewed your query and here is my advice.Several features of pain can be helpful in clarifying what is going on and the next steps for diagnosis and treatment.Type of pain: Burning mostly means a nerve is having problems. This can be either a sick nerve or a nerve that has had an injury. Electrical, shooting would be others implying nerve source for pain.Location of pain: There is a lot to this. First, if something goes in the pathway of a nerve, then that is the nerve involved. Nerves are long and the pain is in a belt-like long pathway. Smaller areas are smaller nerves. This also tends to say what might be going on. Obviously if there was an injury to the area and then there was pain outward from it \"hit a nerve\" would be a possibility. Sick nerves are multiple areas and tend to be the TIPS of the nerve not the whole nerve.What hurts: Moving a particular way that triggers the pain tells what is hurting. Specifically it can distinguish outward structures like skin, muscles, tendons, joints from deep structures like organs and nerves.There is the pain. There is the context of it. If it is getting less that is perceived as good regardless of the pain. If the patient is making a lot of pain, then after the patient, the pain is less.Pain exists, at multiple levels of abstraction. There is how it is held. Producing the pain by oneself (patient) changes this and generally helps. Having a control of the pain helps.Hope I have answered your query.

The double crash injury to the brachial plexus and the herniations at C3 and C7 may be contributing to your symptoms.\n\nHere are some treatment options that may be helpful for managing your neck pain and improving function:\n\n1. Physical therapy: Your doctor suggested physical therapy for your neck. This can help improve your neck's mobility, reduce pain, and prevent further injury. Make sure to follow the specific exercises and instructions given by your physical therapist.\n2. Pain management: Pain medication, such as nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) or opioids, may be prescribed to help manage your pain. Acupuncture, massage, or heat therapy may also provide temporary relief.\n3. Bracing or cervical collar: A cervical collar or brace may be recommended to provide additional support and stabilization to your neck, especially during activities that aggravate your pain.\n4. Occupational therapy: Given your hand weakness and potential for double crush injury, occupational therapy may be necessary to help improve function and prevent further damage. This may include ergonomic modifications, strength training exercises, and education on proper positioning and body mechanics.\n5. Surgery: If nonsurgical treatments are not effective, your doctor may consider surgical intervention to address the herniations at C3 and C7, as well as any other potential contributing factors, such as scar tissue or bony overgrowth from the previous spinal fusion surgeries.\n\nIt is important to follow your doctor's recommendations and attend all necessary appointments, such as your upcoming EMG, to help determine the best course of treatment for your condition.

{"question": "Q. My wrist is swollen and getting worse. Is it broken?Hello doctor,My wrist has been hurting a lot for the past week, despite me never sustaining an injury. I went to A and E where one doctor said it was broken but when I went to fracture clinic the next day other doctor said it was fine and sent me home. It is only getting worse and even more swollen. Do you think it is broken?", "human": "Hello. You have mentioned pain around your wrist region for a week without any history of injury to the affected area. Anyways the pictures which you have sent me to show that there is a bit of swelling around the wrist region, but x-rays are required, and clinical images alone are not sufficient. The only thing which I was going across is that you have sustained three or four fractures in the past six years which if there is no significant history of trauma in previous episodes, needs further evaluation, but if there was a history of significant injury then its fine. As for the present condition, I would like to state that in patients with healthy bone metabolism and no underlying pathology, there should not be any fracture without a history of any significant trauma at your age. So, I would advise you for, 1. Crepe bandage for compression, if you can use a wrist brace for two to three weeks, it is even better. 2. Gentle anti-inflammatory medication like Ibuprofen, Paracetamol, etc., can be used for pain relief on SOS basis. 3. Ice packs should be used three to four times in a day, 10 to 15 minutes every time to keep swelling and pain to bare minimum. We can again review after seven days on how are you feeling, but in the event swelling or pain increases, it is advisable to meet up with an orthopedic surgeon and get your x-rays and other investigations done.

It's critical to follow up with your healthcare provider, providing them with any new developments, and seeking their professional advice to determine the cause of your symptoms.

It does not seem to go away no matter what I do. It hurts to move or do anything. Could I be in labor? And do I need to go to the hospital?", "human": "Hello. The sudden onset back pain in a full term pregnant patient is likely to be due to lightening when the baby's head goes down in pelvis and the sacrum and coccyx bone extend to accommodate the presenting part. If there is no abdominal tightness and contractions which are of increasing intensity and lasting for more than 15 to 20 seconds each, then unlikely that you are in labor. But it is always recommended to go to the hospital and get yourself evaluated by the obstetrician.", "ai": " I'm an AI language model and not a doctor, but I can try to help answer your question based on the information you have provided. Back pain is a common symptom during late pregnancy due to the weight of the baby putting pressure on the lower back and pelvis. It's not necessarily a sign of labor, but it can be a prelude to labor for some women. However, severe or persistent back pain, especially if it's accompanied by other symptoms such as regular contractions, vaginal discharge with a smell or tinge, or a feeling of pressure in the pelvic area, could be a sign of labor. If you have any concerns or are experiencing severe pain, it's always a good idea to contact your healthcare provider for advice. They can evaluate your symptoms and determine if you need to come into the hospital for further assessment.

My doctor said there is no dependence between LH and FSH.But i heard LH should be less than FSH. Please help", "human": "Hi there,Welcome to HCM,Do not worry.Usually the FSH values are almost twice that of LH, if not so then we suspect the women to have a condition called PCOS and do additional hormonal tests and pelvic ultrasound.But in your case what really matters is if you have any other health concerns or not.You should be getting regular period, if your period are not regular then it is more likely that you have PCOS, also having PCOS will make childbearing more difficult. But with just one FSH, LH value you need not worry.Moreover all factors of infertility need to be evaluated after 1 year of trying, but since you have started the evaluation in 7 months you need to do all the tests including your pelvic ultrasound, blood tests including thyroid and prolactin levels. Your partner semen analysis is also essential. Only after complete analysis can a cause for infertility if at all any can be ascertained.Take Folic acid 5 mg while you are trying to conceive.Hope this helps.Regards.", "ai": " The hormone levels you have mentioned, LH (luteinizing hormone) of 5.80 mIu/ml and FSH (follicle-stimulating hormone) of 5.20 mIu/ml, fall within the normal range for premenopausal women. The normal ranges for LH and FSH can vary slightly depending on the laboratory and the time of the menstrual cycle.\n\nThe normal reference range for LH is typically between 3.5 and 12.5 mIu/ml, and for FSH, it's between 2.5 and 12.5 mIu/ml. Your LH and FSH levels fall right within these ranges.\n\nIt is true that normally, the LH level should be lower than FSH, especially in the follicular phase of the menstrual cycle when you are expecting to ovulate. However, it is not uncommon for these levels to be quite similar in some women, including those trying to conceive. Your doctor is correct that there is not necessarily a dependence between LH and FSH levels.\n\nIf you have been trying to get pregnant for 7 months without success and your periods are regular, it may be worth considering other factors that may be impacting your fertility, such as ovulation disorders or structural issues with the fallopian tubes or uterus. Your doctor may recommend further testing or interventions, such as ovulation induction or intrauterine insemination (IUI).

The liver is responsible for producing enzymes like alanine aminotransferase (ALT) and aspartate aminotransferase (AST), which are markers used to assess liver health.\n\nChronic alcohol consumption and HCV co-infection can lead to a buildup of these enzymes in the blood. Therefore, stopping alcohol consumption is the most effective way to help reduce enzyme levels in your body. This will allow the liver to focus on healing itself, rather than metabolizing alcohol.\n\nHowever, it is essential to note that enzyme levels can take some time to return to normal after stopping alcohol consumption and beginning HCV treatment. Your doctor may recommend a liver function test to monitor the progress of your liver health as you make lifestyle changes and begin treatment.\n\nHCV treatment involves antiviral medications that can eradicate the virus from your liver, leading to reduced liver inflammation and decreased enzyme levels. Your doctor may also recommend other strategies, such as a healthy diet, regular exercise, and weight loss, to support your liver health.\n\nIt's important to remember that while stopping alcohol consumption and beginning HCV treatment are the best steps you can take to improve your liver health, they may not result in an immediate reduction in enzyme levels.

It seems to be getting worse? Should I be concerned? It s also now sore above my knee where it didn t hurt before and there s no bruise up there", "human": "HiThanks for posting your query on HCM.I appreciate your concern for the bruises.Apparently it could be due to diabetes itself.Healing of the wounds in patients with diabetes mellitus will be slow and delayed some times it may not heal due to uncontrolled blood sugar.It may also be due to infection of the soft tissues.You are therefore advised to check your fasting blood glucose, dressing of the wound and use of appropriate antibiotic after visiting your doctor.Hope this answers your query.Regards.", "ai": " I'm not a doctor, but I can try to help you understand the potential reasons behind your bruise getting bigger and redder over the past month, especially if you have type 1 diabetes. However, it's crucial to consult your healthcare professional for an accurate diagnosis and advice.\n\nDiabetes, including type 1, can affect the healing process and blood flow in various ways. In this context, the following factors might contribute to the worsening condition of your bruise:\n\n1. Neuropathy: Diabetes may cause nerve damage, leading to reduced sensation in certain areas, including your legs. This reduced sensation can make it hard for you to notice injuries or feel pain, which, in turn, can lead to delayed healing or worsening of existing injuries. The soreness above your knee with no visible bruise could be a sign of nerve damage.\n\n2. Poor circulation: Diabetes can affect the blood flow in your limbs, causing poor circulation, which may slow down the healing process and make bruises last longer or worsen.\n\n3. Abnormal clotting: Diabetes can affect how blood clots, which can result in bruises that take longer to heal. In some cases, the clotting process may not work correctly, leading to larger bruises or the formation of blood blisters.\n\n4. Hyperglycemia: High blood sugar levels can weaken your immune system, making it more difficult for your body to fight infections and heal injuries effectively. Keeping your blood sugar levels under control is essential for overall health and wound healing.\n\nYour concerns are valid, and it's important to have your bruise checked by your healthcare professional to determine if there is an underlying issue that requires additional treatment or evaluation. If you're experiencing increased soreness, decreased sensation, or other symptoms, be sure to discuss these with your doctor as well. In the meantime, keep an eye on your blood sugar levels and continue following your diabetes management plan as prescribed by your healthcare team."}

{"question": "Suggest treatment for epistaxis in a childDear doctor, my daughter is 7 yrs old and she started to have epistaxsis from the age of 3. she gets around 3-5 episode / year.Mostly after a cold attack and found in left nostrils only.Few drops and stops shortly.Till what age she may get this attack ? I am a nurse.will it stop ?", "human": "Hi... it will definitely stop.I do not think you need to worry about this if there is no family history or personal history of bleeding disorder.Best regards - Dr Sumanth Amperayani", "ai": " Epistaxis, or nosebleeds, are relatively common in children, especially those with a history of frequent colds or allergies. In your daughter's case, it is essential to address her episodes of nosebleeds to prevent complications and provide her with some relief. here are some suggestions for managing her epistaxis:\n\n1. Hydration: Ensure your daughter stays well-hydrated by drinking plenty of fluids. Dehydration can make nosebleeds worse.\n2. Nasal saline spray: Using a nasal saline spray daily can help keep the nostrils moist, reducing the chance of nosebleeds.\n3. Avoiding trauma to the nose: Teach your daughter to avoid hitting or rubbing her nose hard, as this can lead to nosebleeds. Additionally, make sure she uses a soft-tipped cotton swab when cleaning her nostrils.\n4. Warm compress: Apply a warm compress to the affected nostril for 5-10 minutes to help slow the bleeding. Make sure the compress is not too hot.\n5. Vitamin K-rich foods: Incorporate vitamin K-rich foods, such as green leafy vegetables, egg yolks, and fruits like kiwi and mango, into her diet. Vitamin K helps blood clot effectively, which can potentially reduce nosebleed episodes.\n6. Hydrogel nostril inserts: Consider using hydrogel nostril inserts, available over-the-counter, to help seal off the nostrils and stop the bleeding.\n7. Medications: For persistent or severe nosebleeds, your daughter's pediatrician may prescribe a topical medication like a nasal cream or spray containing vasoconstrictors or antifibrinolytic agents.\n8. Consult an ENT specialist: If her nosebleeds do not improve with the above measures or become more frequent, severe, or last longer than usual, consider consulting an Ear, Nose, and Throat (ENT) specialist. They may perform further evaluation to rule out any underlying medical conditions.\n\nIt is difficult to predict how long your daughter will continue experiencing nosebleeds. In some cases, children may grow out of them as they age, while others may continue experiencing them throughout their lives. Nevertheless, by implementing the suggested measures, you can help minimize their frequency and severity."}
{"question": "TB meningitis, taking medicines post surgery, recent scan features suggestive of gliosis. What could this be?hello sir... i am a tb menigitis patient... i had surgery on last year and i am using akt4, oflox,claribid(clarithromycin500mg),benadon40mg from last 1year. recently i had and ct scan of brain. the report says status post carnitomy in left fronto temporo pariental region. I11 defined csf density in left temporal region-suggestive of gliosis .can i know whats this...is it curing..", "human": "Hi ,It seems that you had tuberculous meningitis with tubercular abcess in left temporal region ,for which Left fronto temporal craniotony with evacuation of abcess might be done. So once operation is done part of brain tissue would be removed.Like any wound in body which when heals will left with scar ,it is the same thing in brain which is called as gliosis. Gliosis is a process of scarring in the central nervous system. It results from the proliferation of astrocytes in an injured or diseased part of the brain, causing the formation of a fibrous glial scar. Although they are a necessary element to injury recovery, both the accumulation of glial cells and subsequent scarring are important markers of neurological damage.Scar cannot be removed ,it produce headache and seizure", "ai": " I'd be happy to help explain the terms in your CT scan report to the best of my ability! It appears that you had a carcinoma (a type of cancer) removed from the left front temporal-parietal region of your brain during surgery. The term \"status post carcinomy\" in the report means that the imaging is being done after this surgery.\n\nThe finding of \"I11 defined CSF density in the left temporal region-suggestive of gliosis\" may be a bit more complex. Gliosis is a condition where there is an abnormal excess of glial cells in the brain. Glial cells support and protect nervous tissue, but too many glial cells can form scar tissue and impair brain function. It's important to note that gliosis can be a normal response to injury or inflammation, such as what you experienced with your TB meningitis, or it can be a sign of a more concerning condition, such as a glioma (a type of brain tumor). Your healthcare provider is likely monitoring this finding closely and may have more information based on your individual symptoms and further evaluation.\n\nRegarding your treatment, it's important to continue following your healthcare provider's recommendations for your TB meningitis medication regimen. The development of gliosis may not be directly related to your current treatment, but it's understandable that you may have concerns. You should discuss any questions or concerns with your healthcare provider, who can provide you with the most accurate and up-to-date information for your specific situation."}
{"question": "How to get rid of penis pimples ?I have pimples(though I am not sure those are pimples) in my penis.I am virgin.Those are around there for last 7-8 yrs, now I am 26.Though those are not creating any problem but still I am worried about those.Please give me some suggestion.", "human": "They may be Fordyce's spots:http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fordyce_spotsor pearly penile papules:http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hirsuties_papillaris_genitalisBoth are harmless.", "ai": " I cannot definitively diagnose your condition based on the information provided, as penile lesions can have various causes ranging from benign to more serious. However, I can offer some suggestions based on common causes of penile pimples, also known as papules or pustules, which are not related to sexual activity.\n\n1. Hidradenitis Suppurativa (HS): HS is a chronic inflammatory skin condition that causes painful and persistent pimple-like bumps, usually in areas with heavy sweating, such as the armpits or groin. While it's more common in the genital area of women, men can also be affected. The lesions can vary in size, and they can develop into pus-filled abscesses. HS has been linked to a bacterial infection, genetics, and obesity. Mild cases can be managed with good hygiene and antibiotics, but severe cases may require surgical intervention.\n\n2. Folliculitis: Folliculitis is a condition in which the hair follicles become infected, leading to redness, pus-filled bumps, and discomfort. This condition can be caused by various factors, including bacterial infections, shaving, or wearing tight clothing. Preventing folliculitis involves practicing good hygiene, avoiding close contact with others during outbreaks, and using proper shaving techniques. Topical and oral antibiotics may be prescribed to treat the infection.\n\n3. Skin infections: Sexually transmitted infections (STIs), such as herpes or syphilis, can also present as penile pimples or papules. However, as you mentioned that you're a virgin, it's unlikely that this is the cause in your case. Other skin infections, such as scabies, can also cause pimple-like bumps. These conditions are usually diagnosed with a physical examination and laboratory tests. Treatment depends on the underlying cause.\n\n4. Seborrheic dermatitis: Seborrheic dermatitis is a chronic inflammatory skin condition that affects areas with high oil production, such as the scalp, face, and chest. It can also affect the penis, causing redness, greasy patches, and pimple-like bumps. This condition is not contagious, and it's thought to be caused by an overgrowth of a type of yeast called Malassezia. Treatment involves using antifungal shampoos and topical antidandruff products, as well as practicing good hygiene.\n\n5. Squamous cell carcinoma: Although it's rare, penile squamous cell carcinoma can present as painless pimples or papules. This condition is one of the most common types of penile cancer. If you notice any changes in the size, color, or texture of the bumps, or if they're accompanied by other symptoms, such as pain, itching, or bleeding, you should see a healthcare provider for an evaluation.\n\nTo help manage penile pimples or papules, consider the following steps:\n\n- Practice good hygiene: Wash the area daily with soap and warm water and pat it dry. Do not scrub the area or use harsh soaps, as this can irritate the skin.\n- Dry the area thoroughly after showering or bathing.\n- Avoid wearing tight clothing and underwear made of synthetic materials, which can trap moisture and create a breeding ground for bacteria and fungi.\n- Avoid picking at or squeezing the bumps, as this can lead to infection and scarring.\n- If you suspect that the pimples are caused by folliculitis or bacterial infection, apply a warm compress to the area to help reduce inflammation and improve drainage. Follow this with an over-the-counter antibiotic cream.\n\nIf self-care measures don't improve the condition or if the bumps are large, painful, or don't go away after a few weeks, you should see a healthcare provider for further evaluation and treatment. They can help identify the underlying cause and provide appropriate treatment options, such as prescription medications, surgical procedures, or lifestyle modifications."}
{"question": "Could the pain in stomach due to swallowed fish bone?I have been having stomach problems and so far I have taken an ultra sound, ct scan and a hydroscan  all thinking this could be a gallbladder issue, but so far its not...could the problem have been the swallowing of a fish bone 4 days before the symptoms began? and would all these tests have found the bone by now, since I am just remembering about it now.", "human": "Hi,Welcome to HealthcareMagic.I have read your query and understand your concern.Yes the pain could be due to the fish bone, if it has struck in the abdomen, or have caused an injury during the passage, as by now it should have got digested by the stomach enzymes.Fish bone will not be seen in these test, it will need an endoscopy.I would suggest that you  take a ppi tablet like pantaprazole or omeprazole for 2-3 days, if the pain improves you need to continue it for a week or so till the injury heals. If it dosen't then go for an endoscopy.Regards,Dr. Ashish Verma", "ai": " Yes, swallowing a fish bone can cause stomach pain. It is a common occurrence and usually the bone passes through the digestive system without causing any major issues. However, in some cases, the bone may get lodged in the esophagus, throat, or stomach, leading to discomfort, pain, or even infection.\n\nSwallowing a fish bone typically does not show up on imaging tests such as an ultrasound, CT scan, or hydroscan, which are primarily used to diagnose conditions like gallstones, inflammation, or blockages in the digestive system. These tests are not specifically designed to detect small foreign objects like fish bones.\n\nIf you are experiencing persistent stomach pain and recalled swallowing a fish bone a few days prior, it might be a good idea to consult with your healthcare provider or a gastroenterologist for further evaluation. They may perform an X-ray or a barium swallow study to assess the presence of the bone in your digestive system. In most cases, the bone will pass through on its own without any intervention, but if it causes significant pain or discomfort, your doctor may recommend surgical removal.\n\nIt's important to remember that promptly reporting such incidents to your healthcare provider may prevent unnecessary tests or procedures, as well as help diagnose and treat conditions more effectively."}

Thank you", "human": "Hello and Welcome to ‘Ask A Doctor’ service. I have reviewed your query and here is my advice. There are 2 possibilities to be considered. One is a possible attack of migraine. Second is a possible TIA. The second one is more worrisome and needs scanning of the brain and the blood vessels supplying blood to the brain. I would therefore suggest meeting a neurologist for the same. Alternatively you can visit the ER. As for now, you can try painkillers for migraine. I hope that helps. Let us know the reports and we may be able to help you further. Hope I have answered your query. Let me know if I can assist you further.", "ai": " I'm an AI language model and cannot physically examine you or diagnose conditions. The sensation of a \"frozen\" feeling on one side of the brain is not a commonly recognized medical condition with a specific cause. However, I can suggest a few possible explanations based on the information you've provided:\n\n1. Transient Ischemic Attack (TIA or \"mini-stroke\"): Although your description does not seem to match the classic symptoms of a TIA (sudden onset, short duration with complete resolution, and a specific pattern of symptoms), it's worth considering as a possibility. However, the absence of other symptoms like numbness, weakness, or difficulty speaking makes this less likely.\n\n2. Migraine or migraine variant: Although you mentioned that you no longer get migraines, this sensation could be a variant or a component of a migraine event. There are various migraine subtypes that may present with different symptoms, including the \"hemiplegic migraine\" which can involve unilateral weakness or sensory disturbances.\n\n3. Vascular insufficiency: As aging can lead to decreased blood flow to certain brain areas, this could be a possible explanation for the sensation of a \"frozen\" feeling. However, this is usually a chronic condition, taking more than a few minutes to develop, and you would likely notice other symptoms (such as dizziness, lightheadedness, or cognitive decline) in addition to the sensory disturbance.\n\n4. Other neurological conditions: There are various neurological conditions that can cause sensory disturbances. Multiple sclerosis, Parkinson's disease, and other conditions could potentially cause this sensation. However, they usually present with other symptoms and a more chronic course, rather than a transient episode.\n\n5. Other possible causes: There are many other possible causes, such as stress, anxiety, or sleep deprivation, that could contribute to the sensation of a \"frozen\" feeling on one side of the brain.\n\nIt's important to keep in mind that this advice is based on the information you've provided, and that further evaluation by a healthcare professional is required for an accurate diagnosis and appropriate treatment. If the sensation recurs or persists, or if you have any concerns, be sure to consult with your doctor. Please do not delay in seeking medical advice if your symptoms worsen or if you experience any new or unusual symptoms."}

A neck bone fracture, specifically in the context of cervical vertebrae, can often be managed with a combination of non-surgical and surgical interventions depending on the severity of the injury and other factors.\n\nFrom the information given, it appears that the patient's injuries include fractures in the neck region. However, more information is needed to determine the specific location and extent of the fractures. Additionally, the patient's symptoms, such as pain and irritation from the neck collar, could indicate the need for further evaluation and potential surgical intervention.\n\nIt's important to note that not all neck bone fractures require surgery. Non-surgical treatments, such as immobilization using a brace or collar, can be effective for some patients with stable fractures. However, unstable fractures or those with signs of neurological compromise may require surgical intervention to ensure proper alignment, stabilization, and prevent further damage.\n\nA thorough evaluation by a medical professional, including imaging studies and a physical examination, would be necessary to determine the best treatment approach for this patient. Additionally, regular follow-up care and monitoring would be crucial to ensure optimal healing and recovery.\n\nThis information is intended for educational purposes only and should not be considered medical advice.

Is this some concern?", "human": "Hi,From history it seems that there might be having ingrowm hair follicle  infection at both the sites giving this problem.Clean the part and apply antibiotic cream.If require give him one course of antibiotic medicine like Amoxicilin for 3-5 days.Ok and take care.", "ai": " Bump formation in the skin, such as what your son is experiencing, is typically caused by a few different factors. The most common cause of pimples, including the ones on your son's arm, is a buildup of sebum (oil produced by the sebaceous glands) and dead skin cells in the pores. Bacteria can also be present, leading to inflammation and the formation of a pus-filled head.\n\nThe reason why your son's bumps have not moved or healed after being popped is that squeezing or picking at pimples can cause damage to the skin, leading to scarring and an increased risk of infection. It's important to avoid this behavior as much as possible, as it can make the condition worse.\n\nThe presence of multiple pimples in different areas of the body, such as under the arm and below the nipple, could indicate hormonal changes or increased oil production, which are common during puberty. It's not uncommon for adolescents to experience acne in these areas, and it can be a cause of concern if the bumps become large, painful, or if they do not respond to over-the-counter treatments.\n\nIf your son's acne is severe or causing him distress, it's a good idea to consult a healthcare professional or a dermatologist for advice on treatment options. In the meantime, encourage your son to practice good skin hygiene, such as washing his skin gently with a mild cleanser twice a day and avoiding tight-fitting clothing that may trap sweat and oil next to the skin. Additionally, avoiding touching or picking at the bumps will help prevent the spread of bacteria and potential scarring."}
{"question": "What does the brain MRI report indicate?What does the following MRI of the brain report mean? There is a small chronic lacunar infarct versus a dilated perivascular space in the posterior left centrum semiolale. A small chronic lacunar infarct in the left thalamus is observed. There is no evidence of restricted diffusion to suggest acute infarction in the brain parenchyma.

I don't understand well the sentence before the last, but i suppose it's a brain atrophy caused by an old subdural hemorrhage. You should see a neurologist to value the risk factors for cerebral vascular disease and to treat the patient properly.", "ai": " The MRI report indicates that there are two findings in the brain:\n\n1. A small chronic lacunar infarct in the left centrum semiovale and left thalamus: This means that there are small areas of brain tissue death (infarcts) in the left side of the brain in the centrum semiovale (a region deep in the white matter) and in the left thalamus (a region deep in the brain involved in sensory processing). The term \"chronic\" suggests that these infarcts have been present for some time.\n2. There is no evidence of acute infarction: This means that the MRI does not show any signs of recent stroke or brain tissue damage. The term \"restricted diffusion\" is used to describe the lack of water movement in the brain tissue, which can indicate acute infarction. The fact that this was not observed suggests that the infarcts were not recent.\n3. Mildly prominent CSF overlying the cerebral hemispheres: This finding indicates that there is a moderate amount of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) in the spaces around the brain (the subarachnoid space) overlying the cerebral hemispheres. This is likely secondary to cerebral and cerebellar volume loss.\n4. Normal ventricles and basilar cisterns: The size of the ventricles and basilar cisterns (fluid-filled spaces in the brain) is within normal limits.\n\nOverall, the report suggests the presence of chronic small lacunar infarcts in the left side of the brain, along with moderate cerebral and cerebellar volume loss. This may be indicative of small vessel disease or other conditions that affect the blood supply to the brain. The absence of acute infarcts suggests that these conditions have been present for some time."}

Lifestyle modifications: Encourage your wife to maintain a healthy diet, stay hydrated, and get enough rest. Smoking cessation and avoiding heavy lifting can also help reduce the risk of further back damage.\n\nRemember, this advice is for general information only and shouldn't replace a consultation with a healthcare professional.

{"question": "Does mobile phone usage increase BP?I have been using a smartphone for over two months. IN the past I used a simple flip phone. I am 65 year old woman in fair/good health except for Hashimotos sarcoidosis, mild hypertension, sarcoidosis of lymph glands in remission for 7 years. Since using the phone, I have noticed my blood pressure rising at night. I notice at times the phone is hot to my ear. Can this radiation generated heat cause a rise in blood pressure?", "human": "Hi. Mobile phone use is not known to cause a increase in bp. Plz visit your physician and explain this to him for adequate drug titration. Hope it helps. Take care.", "ai": " There is currently no definitive scientific evidence that proves mobile phone usage directly causes an increase in blood pressure (BP) for everyone. However, some studies suggest that using a mobile phone, especially for long durations, can lead to an increase in systolic blood pressure (the top number) by a few points. This effect is often temporary and may be due to factors such as mental stress, muscle tension, or the person leaning forward in a concentrated manner while using the phone.\n\nRegarding the heat issue, mobile phones do emit some heat, especially during prolonged use or when the signal is weak, which could contribute to a sensation of warmth. This heat is typically not cause for concern, as it is within the safe range set by regulatory agencies. However, if you find the heat uncomfortable, you may want to consider using a hands-free kit, earbuds, or a cooling phone case to reduce the amount of time your ear is directly in contact with the device.\n\nIt's essential to address any potential causes of your elevated nighttime blood pressure, especially if you have hypertension. Here are some steps you can take:\n\n1. Maintain a regular sleep schedule, going to bed and waking up at the same time each day.\n2. Limit your caffeine and alcohol intake, as both can affect blood pressure.\n3. Manage stress through activities like meditation, deep breathing, or gentle exercise.\n4. Monitor your BP consistently by using a home blood pressure monitor.\n5. Keep a record of your BP readings, noting any trends or potential triggers.\n6. Communicate any concerns to your healthcare professional, who can evaluate other possible causes and adjust your treatment plan if necessary.\n\nIt is also essential to keep in mind that technology and electronics advance constantly. If you are worried about the potential health effects of mobile phone usage, consider using a wired landline or a cordless phone with a base station instead. Remember, more research is needed to fully understand the potential connections between mobile phone usage and BP, and always consult with your healthcare professional for personalized advice."}

Still you can go for usg pelvis to confirm/exclude pregnancy.(even 5 week pregnancy isseen in usg scan)       Usg would also help in finding cause of delayed period like pcod or ovarian cyst.       Thanks", "ai": " I cannot definitively determine if your symptoms are related to pregnancy or your medication use based on the information provided. Dizziness and weakness are common side effects of Sustana (sustained-release hydrochlorothiazide), a diuretic used to treat high blood pressure and edema (swelling). These symptoms may not be related to pregnancy.\n\nAdditionally, missing a period and receiving a negative pregnancy test do not necessarily rule out pregnancy, as it is possible for implantation bleeding or a very early pregnancy to cause a false negative result. If you have concerns about your pregnancy status, I would recommend contacting your healthcare provider for further evaluation and guidance. It is important to note that taking Sustana without a prescription or as prescribed by your doctor can pose potential risks to your health, especially during pregnancy. Always consult with a healthcare professional before starting or continuing any medication."}

It's important to note that my suggestions should not be taken as medical advice and you should consult your doctor for an accurate diagnosis and treatment.\n\nThe symptoms you're experiencing, including itching, red patches, cracks, and pain below the knee, could be related to various conditions, such as:\n\n1. Dermatitis: This is a general term for inflammation of the skin. Dermatitis can have many causes, including allergic reactions, irritants, or infections.

It's important to note that I cannot definitively diagnose you or rule out any conditions.\n\nYour symptoms of headache, neck pain, lower back pain, and thigh pain, following gum recession surgery, could be related to several possibilities:\n\n1. Post-operative pain: It's common to experience some degree of pain, including headaches and discomfort in the neck, back, and thighs after dental procedures like gum recession surgery. Pain medications, rest, and ice packs may help alleviate the symptoms.\n2.

Augmentin, in particular, can cause gastrointestinal issues like diarrhea, as well as headaches and dizziness. These symptoms usually subside once the body adjusts to the medication.\n3. Sinusitis: Even if the antibiotics don't provide significant relief, sinusitis could still be the cause of your symptoms. Sinus infections can cause pressure and pain in the head, face, neck, and back. If your symptoms do not improve with the antibiotics, consult your doctor about alternative treatments.\n4. Other underlying conditions: Several conditions, such as cervicogenic headaches or herniated discs, can cause neck, back, and head pain.

It differs from other autism spectrum disorders by its relative preservation of linguistic and cognitive development. For proper diagnosis, you can consult a psychiatrist. Thanks", "ai": " Based on the symptoms you have described, it is unlikely that your son has Asperger's Syndrome. Asperger's is a type of Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) that is characterized by social and communication difficulties, but it does not typically involve the repetitive behaviors or obsession with making things perfect that you mentioned.\n\nMood swings and getting angry easily are common behaviors in children and can be caused by a variety of factors, including stress, fatigue, or developmental milestones. If you are concerned about your son's behavior, it would be best to speak with his pediatrician or a mental health professional for a thorough evaluation. They can help determine if there are any underlying causes for his behavior and provide appropriate interventions if needed.\n\nIf you do suspect that your son might have Asperger's Syndrome or any other developmental disorder, it's important to remember that accurate information and professional advice are crucial for making informed decisions about your child's care.

The swelling is a result of the trauma to the tissues in your mouth, as well as the inflammation that can occur during the procedure. The swelling usually subsides within a few days to a week.\n\nRegarding the bumps on the inside of your lips, it's difficult to diagnosis over the internet, but they could be a result of the swelling, or they could be trauma or blisters from the dental instruments used during the surgery. They may also be related to your cold sore, as cold sores can cause inflammation and pain in the surrounding tissues.\n\nIf the bumps are causing significant pain, or if you have other symptoms such as increased redness, warmth, or drainage, it would be a good idea to contact your dentist or dental surgeon to have them checked out. An infection can cause similar symptoms, but there are other possible causes, such as an allergic reaction or inflammation.\n\nIt's also important to note that a fever after dental surgery is not necessarily a sign of an infection. Fever can be a normal reaction to the stress and trauma of the surgery. However, if you have a fever for more than a few days, or if you have other symptoms such as increased redness, drainage, or pain, it's important to contact your healthcare provider to rule out an infection or other underlying condition."}

High levels of CPK in the blood can indicate muscle damage. A CPK level of 1150 is significantly higher than the normal range, but it doesn't directly indicate what caused the muscle damage. The most common reasons for elevated CPK are:\n\n1. Muscle injury or trauma (for example, from a fall or strenuous activity)\n2. Muscle diseases, such as muscular dystrophies, metabolic myopathies or inflammatory myopathies\n3. Nervous system conditions, such as Guillain-Barré syndrome or motor neuron diseases\n\nIf your cousin's muscle damage was due to injury or trauma, he should be fine given sufficient time for recovery. However, if it was caused by an underlying muscle condition, he may be at risk for future episodes or complications. His doctors will be able to provide a more accurate diagnosis and prognosis based on the results of further tests and evaluations. Remember to follow their recommendations and advice carefully.\n\nFor more information, you can consult trustworthy sources like the National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke (NINDS) and the Muscular Dystrophy Association (MDA).

It's generally not recommended for use in infants under 6 months of age due to potential risks related to their immature respiratory system and the possibility of adverse effects, such as increasing heart rate and tremors.\n\nMoreover, a cough and cold in a 2.5-month-old baby are usually not indicative of a serious respiratory condition. The symptoms could be attributed to various factors, such as teething, a viral infection, pollution, or allergens.

Is it life threatening?", "human": "Interstitial lung disease caused by a connective tissue disease can be treated by suppressing your immune system. This is often done first by corticosteroid medications like prednisone. If this is unsuccessful, stronger immunosuppressants can be used.", "ai": " I'm an AI language model and not a doctor, but I can provide you with some general information about interstitial lung disease (ILD) and its treatment based on available research. It's important to consult with your healthcare provider for accurate information based on your specific situation.\n\nInterstitial lung disease refers to a group of conditions that damage the lungs' interstitium, which is the supporting tissue between the air sacs (alveoli). ILD can cause scarring, thickening, and tightening of the lung tissue, leading to decreased lung function.\n\nThere's no one-size-fits-all treatment for ILD as its causes and progression can vary greatly depending on the specific type and underlying condition. Some common treatments include:\n\n1. Medications: Corticosteroids, anti-fibrotic drugs, and other medications can help manage symptoms and slow the progression of lung damage.\n2. Oxygen therapy: Supplemental oxygen can help improve breathlessness and support proper lung function.\n3. Pulmonary rehabilitation: A program of breathing exercises, education, and counseling can help improve physical and emotional functioning for people with ILD.\n4. Lung transplant: In severe cases, a lung transplant may be considered as a last resort.\n\nYour chest pain and joint ache could be related to your rheumatological condition, hormonal cycle, or a separate issue. It's important to discuss these symptoms with your healthcare provider as they could potentially be linked to your ILD or another condition.\n\nConnective tissue diseases, such as lupus or scleroderma, can increase the risk of developing ILD, but not everyone with these conditions will develop lung problems. The life prognosis and treatment options depend on the specific type and severity of the ILD. Make sure to have open and honest discussions with your healthcare provider about your concerns regarding your diagnosis, symptoms, and potential treatments."}

The treatment approach would depend on the depth of the wounds. Very deep scars would need a procedure like dermabrasion. For superficial scars, you can try Tretin 0.025 (Tretionin) cream daily night. Apply it in small amounts and very lightly over the scars, daily night for two months. It will not lead to a 100 % reduction in the scars, but it would gradually make the scars less visible by tightening the skin. If you are not satisfied with the results after two months, consult a local dermatologist for dermabrasion.", "ai": " I'm an AI language model and not a doctor, but I can suggest some general treatments that might help reduce the appearance of chickenpox scars. However, it's always best to consult a dermatologist or healthcare professional for personalized recommendations:\n\n1. Topical creams: Some over-the-counter scar treatments contain ingredients like retinoids, vitamin C, or hydroquinone. These ingredients can help improve the texture and appearance of scars.\n2. Collagen therapy: Collagen is a protein that plays a crucial role in skin elasticity and regeneration. Some people opt for collagen therapy, which involves applying topical collagen or using collagen injections, to help improve the appearance of scars.\n3. Microdermabrasion: This is a non-invasive exfoliating treatment that helps to remove dead skin cells and reveal smoother, more even-toned skin. It may help reduce the appearance of scars.\n4. Chemical peels: A chemical peel involves applying a chemical solution to the skin to remove the outer layers and reveal new, smoother skin. This treatment can be effective in reducing the appearance of scars, but it may cause some downtime.\n5. Laser therapy: Laser treatments can be effective in reducing the appearance of scars. They work by stimulating collagen production and improving skin texture. However, this treatment can be costly and may require multiple sessions.\n6. Microneedling: This treatment involves using fine needles to create micro-injuries in the skin. This stimulates collagen production and can help to improve the appearance of scars.\n7. Makeup: Covering scars with makeup can help improve their appearance and boost self-confidence. Look for a good quality, long-lasting concealer that matches your skin tone.\n\nRemember, everyone's skin is different, and what works for one person may not work for another. Consulting a healthcare professional or dermatologist is always recommended to discuss the best treatment options for your specific situation. Additionally, ensure that any treatments you use are safe and suitable for your skin type."}

A renal liver cyst occurs when a cyst forms in the liver, near the renal surface. Renal liver cysts are usually benign and do not cause any symptoms. However, large cysts or those that cause symptoms require medical management.\n\nThe growth of renal liver cysts is usually slow, and they do not turn into cancer. However, they may cause complications like infection, rupture, or obstruction of the bile ducts. The symptoms of a renal liver cyst may include:\n\n- Abdominal pain or discomfort\n- Swelling in the abdomen\n- Nausea and vomiting\n- Fever and chills if infected\n\nIf you have been diagnosed with a renal liver cyst, your healthcare provider will likely recommend regular monitoring through ultrasounds or CT scans. This is to ensure that the cyst is not growing or causing complications. If symptoms do develop, your healthcare provider may recommend the following treatments:\n\n1. Draining the cyst: If the cyst is large enough, it may be drained using a minor surgical procedure called a cyst fenestration.\n\n2. Medications: Pain relievers and antibiotics may be prescribed if there is infection in the cyst.\n\n3. Surgical removal: In some cases, the cyst may need to be surgically removed. This may be recommended if the cyst is causing significant symptoms, if it is causing complications, or if it is malignant.\n\nIt is important to keep in mind that most renal liver cysts are benign and do not pose a significant risk to your health. Regular monitoring by your healthcare provider is the best approach for managing this condition.\n\nHere are some lifestyle changes that can help improve your overall health and reduce the risk of complications:\n\n- Eat a healthy diet: A healthy diet rich in fruits, vegetables, lean proteins, and whole grains can help improve your overall health.\n- Stay hydrated: Drink plenty of water to help maintain normal kidney function.\n- Avoid alcohol: Alcohol can damage the liver and kidneys, so it's important to avoid excessive alcohol consumption.\n- Exercise regularly: Regular physical activity can help improve digestion, reduce stress, and improve overall health.\n\nSources:\n\n1.

Asthma exacerbation: Although she is taking her normal treatments, a sudden worsening of asthma symptoms could lead to pallor due to decreased oxygenation of the blood or increased work of breathing. You should consider checking her peak flow readings or using a pulse oximeter to assess her oxygen saturation levels.\n\n2. Side effects of medications: Some medications can cause paleness as a side effect. Clonazepam, Risperidone, Topiramate, or Geritol could potentially lead to paleness. Inquire about this with her pediatrician or neurologist.\n\n3. Gastrointestinal (GI) problems: Asthmatic patients and individuals on certain medications like Risperidone may experience GI disturbances. Pallor could potentially be a result of internal bleeding due to ulcers or other gastrointestinal issues. Keep an eye on any other symptoms, such as abdominal pain, vomiting, or diarrhea.\n\n4. Dehydration: Dehydration can lead to pallor in children. If she is having difficulty dressing herself and seems to be making an effort, it might suggest that she's unwell and not drinking enough fluid. Increase her access to water, juice, or electrolyte-rich drinks if needed.\n\n5. Anemia: Anemia is a condition in which there is a lack of adequate healthy red blood cells or hemoglobin in your daughter's blood. This condition could be caused by various reasons, such as vitamin deficiencies, gastrointestinal blood loss, or other underlying conditions. You may want to discuss this possibility with your doctor, as they can screen for anemia and investigate the potential causes.\n\n6. Autonomic dysfunction: Autonomic dysfunction refers to the loss of normal control of the body's automatic functions, including blood pressure and heart rate. Individuals with autism, particularly those with a co-occurring medical condition, may experience paleness due to autonomic dysfunction. This condition can be evaluated by a pediatrician and may require further specialized care.\n\n7. Septicemia or infection: Although less common, a sudden onset of pallor can be caused by a serious bacterial infection. Keep an eye on her temperature and other symptoms such as irritability, difficulty breathing, increased heart rate, or changes in behavior.\n\nIt's essential to consult her healthcare provider for an accurate diagnosis and appropriate treatment."}

Make sure you are drinking an adequate amount of water daily.\n5. Consider natural supplements: Instead of taking a potentially risky supplement like OxyELITE Pro, look into natural alternatives for weight loss or energy enhancement. Many herbs, vitamins, and minerals have been shown to support overall health and help achieve weight loss or energy goals.\n\nIt's important to remember that every person's body reacts differently to supplements and medications, and it's crucial to consider the potential risks before resuming use."}

However, it's important that you consult with your healthcare provider before making any decisions about trying to conceive while being treated for Cystitis and PCOS.\n\nRegarding your current situation, here are some things you might want to consider:\n\n1. Cystitis: This is a urinary tract infection that can be treated with antibiotics. The infection itself should not prevent you from trying to conceive, but the use of certain antibiotics, such as nitrofurantoin and trimethoprim, can affect sperm motility. If possible, you may want to discuss alternative antibiotics with your doctor.\n2. PCOS: PCOS is a condition that affects the hormonal balance in women, leading to ovulation issues and other symptoms such as weight gain and acne. YAZ (ethinyl estradiol and drospirenone) is a combination hormonal contraceptive that is often prescribed to women with PCOS to help regulate menstrual cycles and improve symptoms. However, it also acts as a birth control pill. If you are planning to try to conceive soon, it's important to discuss other options with your healthcare provider. They may recommend other medications, insulin sensitizers, or lifestyle modifications to help manage your PCOS and improve your chances of conceiving.\n\nWith that being said, here are some general tips that may help increase your chances of conceiving while being treated for PCOS and Cystitis:\n\n1. Make sure you are doing everything you can to optimize your health in general. This includes eating a healthy, balanced diet, getting regular exercise, and managing stress.\n2. Try to maintain a healthy weight. Being underweight or overweight can impact your fertility.\n3. Work with your healthcare provider to optimize your medication regimen. It may be necessary to adjust your medications or switch to different ones to improve your chances of conceiving.\n4. Consider trying fertility treatments, such as clomiphene citrate or metformin, which have been shown to improve ovulation and pregnancy rates in women with PCOS.\n5. Regular monitoring of your menstrual cycle can help identify the best time to try to conceive. Consider using an ovulation predictor kit to help pinpoint ovulation.\n6. Avoid alcohol, tobacco, and drugs, which can negatively impact fertility.\n7. Consider seeking the help of a fertility specialist if you are having difficulty conceiving despite making these lifestyle changes. They may be able to provide additional treatments or support.\n\nRemember, it's always best to consult with your healthcare provider regarding any specific concerns or questions you may have about trying to conceive while being treated for Cystitis and PCOS. They can provide you with the most accurate and personalized advice based on your individual circumstances."}

You can control the attack of asthma by Inhaler like Asthalin or any inhalers containing corticosteroids.", "ai": " I'm an AI language model and cannot provide medical advice, but I can suggest some common treatments and management strategies for asthma and chest pain that you may want to discuss with your healthcare provider. Keep in mind that every person is unique, so what works best for you may differ.\n\n1. Asthma: Asthma is a chronic respiratory condition causing inflammation and narrowing of the airways. Since you have been experiencing symptoms for five years and have a history of working in an old building with potential mold exposure, it is essential to seek professional advice, especially from an allergist or pulmonologist, to create an effective asthma management plan. Some common treatments include:\n\n- Inhaled corticosteroids: These medications help reduce inflammation in the airways to prevent asthma symptoms.\n- Long-acting beta-agonists (LABAs): These medications work by relaxing the muscles around the airways to make it easier to breathe, especially during physical activity or at night.\n- Combination inhalers: These are often prescribed if your asthma is not well controlled with inhaled corticosteroids and LABAs alone.\n- Allergy medications: If your asthma is allergy-induced, allergy medications such as antihistamines, leukotriene modifiers, or monoclonal antibody therapy may be recommended.\n- Peak flow meter: This device provides information on how well you're breathing, helping you monitor your symptoms and adjust your treatment plan accordingly.\n- Triggers identification and avoidance: Identifying your asthma triggers (e.g., cleaners, air sprays, mold, smoke, cold air, or exercise) and avoiding them whenever possible can help alleviate your symptoms.\n\n2. Chest pain: Chest pain can have various causes, and it's important to rule out other possible explanations, such as heart disease or gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD), before considering it as related to your asthma. You should consult your doctor for a proper diagnosis and treatment. Some common treatments for chest pain associated with asthma include:\n\n- Albuterol: This quick-acting bronchodilator may help alleviate chest tightness and wheezing. It is typically administered through an inhaler and can provide relief within minutes of use.\n- NSAIDs: Pain relief medications like ibuprofen or naproxen may help address chest pain due to their anti-inflammatory properties. However, they can also be risky for people with asthma, so always consult a healthcare professional before taking them.\n- Deep breathing exercises: These exercises can help loosen mucus in the airways, making it easier to breathe and reducing chest pain.\n- Breathing warm, moist air: Humidifiers, steam inhalers, or taking long, hot showers can help loosen mucus in the airways, reducing the need to cough and potentially alleviating chest pain.\n\nRemember that it is crucial to consult with a healthcare professional to diagnose and manage both your asthma and chest pain. Your doctor may recommend further testing and/or additional therapies tailored to your specific situation, and they can evaluate any potential interactions between your asthma medications and other treatments for chest pain."}

Good evening. I am Dr Shareef answering your query.As per the history of trauma, it could be a hematoma (collection of blood) in the axilla at the site of trauma.

If it does not, or if it increases, I would get you assessed by a general surgeon, who might go for a mammgraphy of bilateral breasts followed by a FNAC (fine needle aspiraton cytology) and possibly a biopsy of the lesion. Further management would depend on the clinical examination and investigation reports.I hope this information would help you in discussing with your family physician/treating doctor in further management of your problem. Please do not hesitate to ask in case of any further doubts.Thanks for choosing health care magic to clear doubts on your health problems. Wishing you an early recovery. Dr Shareef.", "ai": " The lump you're experiencing below your right armpit, which appeared after your grandson kicked you, is likely to be a result of the bruise that formed from the injury. Bruises can take several days to develop fully, and it's not uncommon for them to persist as a palpable lump in the tissue for an extended period. However, it's essential to note that if the lump continues to grow, becomes painful, or you experience other symptoms such as fever, swelling, or difficulty breathing, you should consult your healthcare provider to rule out any underlying conditions, such as an infection or tumor. Generally, if the lump is stationary, not painful, and has been present since the injury, it's likely just a residual bruise."}

I have gone through your query and understand the concerns. I have reviewed the report (attachment removed to protect patient identity). Hope you found the answer helpful. Regards. For more informaton consult a fetal medicine specialist online --> https://icliniq.com./ask-a-doctor-online/fetal-medicine-specialist", "ai": " Hello! I'd be happy to help you understand the implications of the ultrasound findings you've shared with me.  however, I am an AI language model and not a doctor. I can provide you with general information about these findings, but it is important that you discuss the results with your healthcare provider to get the most accurate information for your specific situation.\n\nThe first finding, the presence of bilateral 5mm choroid plexus cysts, is a common finding in ultrasound examinations during pregnancy. Choroid plexus cysts are fluid-filled structures that develop from the choroid plexus, which produces cerebrospinal fluid. Approximately 1-3% of all fetuses have these cysts. The size and number of the cysts do not usually indicate any problems, but larger cysts or multiple cysts may be associated with an increased risk of certain neurological conditions such as neural tube defects or Down syndrome. However, most cases of choroid plexus cysts are not indicative of any health problems for the baby.\n\nThe second finding, the echogenic focus in the left ventricle, is a bit more concerning. An echogenic focus is a bright spot that can appear on the ultrasound image and can represent a variety of things, including normal anatomy or pathology. In the context of a pregnancy, an echogenic focus in the heart can be due to various causes, including normal anatomy, such as a small muscular branch or a physiological variant, or it could be indicative of a structural cardiac abnormality.\n\nYour healthcare provider will likely recommendations for further evaluation, which may include additional ultrasound examinations, fetal echocardiography, or other diagnostic tests to better assess the nature and significance of the echogenic focus. It is important to remember that the presence of an echogenic focus does not automatically mean that there is a cardiac abnormality. The vast majority of cases turn out to be benign, but it is important to thoroughly evaluate the issue to ensure the health and well-being of both the mother and the baby.\n\nIn summary, while the finding of choroid plexus cysts is generally not considered a cause for concern, the detection of an echogenic focus in the heart requires further evaluation. I strongly recommend that you discuss these findings with your healthcare provider to get accurate information and recommendations specific to your situation. They will be able to provide more detailed information and guidance based on the results of any additional diagnostic tests and your personal medical history."}

However, it's important to consult with your healthcare provider for an accurate diagnosis and treatment.\n\n1. Muscle strain or spasms: Bronchitis can lead to persistent coughing, which may cause muscle strain or spasms in your back, particularly in the lower lung area.\n2. Pleurisy: Though rare, bronchitis can sometimes cause pleurisy - inflammation of the lining surrounding the lungs, which can result in sharp pain when breathing or coughing.\n3.

{"question": "Q. I have small cysts in my ovaries. Is this a serious problem?Hello doctor,I am a 19 year old female. I have small cysts in my ovaries. Is this a serious problem? Can you tell me in detail about it? I have attached my sonography report for your consideration.", "human": "Hello. I read your query and went through your reports (attachment removed to protect patient identity). I hope this helps you. For more information consult a general practitioner online --> https://www.icliniq.com/ask-a-doctor-online/general-practitioner", "ai": " I'm not a doctor, but I can provide you with some general information about ovarian cysts based on available resources. I would strongly advise consulting with a healthcare professional for an accurate diagnosis and treatment plan based on your specific situation.\n\nOvarian cysts are sacs filled with fluid that form on the surface or inside of an ovary. They are quite common, especially among women of reproductive age. Most ovarian cysts are functional cysts, which form during the menstrual cycle due to hormonal activity. They usually resolve on their own without causing any symptoms or complications.\n\nYour sonography report can help identify the type of cyst you have. Here are some common types:\n\n1. Functional cysts: Follicular cysts and luteal cysts are two types of functional cysts. Follicular cysts form when a follicle doesn't release an egg during ovulation. Luteal cysts form when the follicle fails to dissolve after ovulation, and instead transforms into a corpus luteum. These cysts are generally benign and usually disappear without any treatment.\n\n2. Hemorrhagic cysts: These cysts form when the wall of the cyst ruptures, causing bleeding into the cavity. If the cyst is large or repeatedly ruptures, it may cause abdominal pain, bloating, and other symptoms. Hemorrhagic cysts usually resolve on their own, but in some cases, they may require drainage or surgery.\n\n3. Dermoid cysts: Dermoid cysts, also known as teratomas, are non-functional cysts that contain various types of tissue, such as hair, teeth, and bones. These cysts form due to abnormal cell development. While benign in most cases, they can grow quite large and cause symptoms if they press on nearby organs.\n\n4. Endometrioma: Endometriosis is a chronic condition where the endometrial tissue (the tissue that lines the inside of the uterus) grows outside of the uterus, including on the ovaries. This can lead to the formation of large, fluid-filled cysts called endometriomas. Endometriosis and its cysts can cause pain, irregular menstruation, and infertility.\n\nBased on the information provided, it's difficult to assess the severity of your situation just based on the presence of small cysts. However, it's important to remember that most ovarian cysts are harmless and often disappear on their own without any intervention. If your doctor or sonographer suggests further testing or treatment, it's crucial to follow their recommendations to ensure optimal health.\n\nOnce again, make sure to consult with a healthcare professional for an accurate evaluation and any necessary follow-up care."}

For more information consult an HIV AIDS specialist online --> https://www.icliniq.com/ask-a-doctor-online/HIV-AIDS-specialist", "ai": " The risk of HIV transmission during anal sex depends on several factors, including the HIV status and viral load of the person with HIV, the duration of exposure, and the use of preventative measures such as condoms or pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP).\n\nAccording to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), the risk of HIV transmission during receptive anal sex with an HIV-positive partner without using antiretroviral therapy (ART) or PrEP is estimated to be around 1 in 750 acts for individuals who are HIV negative and do not have genital ulcers or other HIV susceptibility factors. However, this risk increases if the HIV-positive partner has a high viral load, which can mean high amounts of virus in their semen or blood.\n\nIt's important to note that transmission risk can vary from person to person, and these estimates are based on average risks. Your individual risk will depend on the specific circumstances of your exposure.\n\nTo reduce the risk of HIV and other STDs in the future, it's recommended that you get tested for HIV and other STDs as soon as possible. You can also consider starting PrEP if you're at ongoing risk for HIV infection.\n\nYou should also consider getting vaccinated against Hepatitis A and B, as well as Gardasil (HPV vaccine) if you haven't already, as these vaccines can protect you against other sexually transmitted infections.\n\nIt generally takes 3 to 6 weeks for an HIV antibody test to be accurate, so you should wait until at least that long before getting tested. In the meantime, you can talk to your healthcare provider about other forms of testing or prevention strategies, such as nucleic acid test (NAT) or biochemical test for earlier HIV detection. You can also contact your local health department for resources and guidance.\n\nLastly, if you need emotional support or counseling related to this experience, consider speaking with a counselor or a trusted person in your life. It's normal to feel worried and anxious after a potential exposure to HIV, but seeking out information, resources, and support can help you manage your concerns and take care of your overall well-being."}

{"question": "Suggest treatment for lump behind left earMy daughter is 4 years old and I noticed a lump behind her left ear. I also noticed small lumps in various spots on her scalp. I took her to the doctor yesterday and the doctor precribed an antibotic. Her doctor didn t really act like it was anything serious...Should I be concerned?", "human": "Hi, this could be pyoderma or lymphadenitis due to infection. In both conditions, antibiotics for 5 to 6 days is given. Its nothing serious. Take care.", "ai": " While I'm an AI language model and not able to physically examine your daughter or provide medical advice, I can suggest some steps you can take to address your concerns.\n\nFirst and foremost, if your doctor has prescribed an antibiotic, it's important to make sure your daughter takes the full course as directed. This is usually the first line of treatment for soft tissue infections, which can cause lumps.\n\nHowever, if you're still worried or if the lumps don't improve or get larger after a few days of antibiotic treatment, I would recommend:\n\n1. Following up with your daughter's doctor: Share your concerns with the doctor and ask for more information. They may refer you to a specialist such as an ear, nose, and throat (ENT) doctor or a dermatologist for further evaluation.\n2. Keeping an eye on the lumps: Observe the size, shape, color, and any other characteristics of the lumps. If they're painful, reddened, or warm, or if your daughter complains of other symptoms like fever, swelling, or difficulty swallowing, contact your doctor right away.\n3. Avoiding panic: Try to stay calm and reassure your daughter. Most lumps in childhood are benign and not necessarily a cause for concern. However, it's important to have any recurring or persistent symptoms checked out.\n\nRemember, it's always a good idea to trust your instincts as a parent. If you're concerned, ask for more information or seek a second opinion from another medical professional."}

Two is abnormal - share a picture for confirmation. Doing a urine complete can help diagnose the presence of sperm in urine. Also, check for blood sugar and urine culture. Hope I have answered your query. Let me know if I can assist you further. Regards,Dr. S. R. Raveendran, Sexologist", "ai": " I cannot definitively diagnose or treat your condition based on the information provided, as it may be a complex medical issue. However, I can suggest some possible causes and potential treatments for the symptoms you described.\n\nFirst, let me clarify that having multiple urinary openings, or meatuses, in the penis is not unusual. Normally, there is one meatus, but some men may have two or more due to varying degrees of congenital or acquired conditions. This condition is called ectopic urethra or double urethra.\n\nHowever, the simultaneous occurrence of sperm discharge during urination and during times of sexual excitement suggests the possibility of a condition called retrograde ejaculation. Retrograde ejaculation occurs when the semen is released into the bladder instead of out of the body during ejaculation. This can be caused by various factors, such as neurological conditions, surgery, or medications. In some cases, retrograde ejaculation may be a harmless condition, but in others, it may indicate underlying health issues, such as prostate problems or diabetes.\n\nTo determine the cause of your symptoms, it is essential to consult a healthcare professional for a thorough evaluation. Your doctor may perform a physical examination, including a digital rectal exam to assess your prostate, urinalysis, and other diagnostic tests as needed. Depending on the underlying cause, treatment options may include medication, surgery, or lifestyle modifications.\n\nSome possible treatments for retrograde ejaculation include:\n\n1. Alpha-blockers: These medications can help relax the bladder neck, allowing semen to flow out of the body during ejaculation.\n2. Surgical procedures: In some cases, surgery may be necessary to repair damaged or incorrectly positioned muscles or structures that prevent semen from being expelled from the body during ejaculation.\n3. Pelvic floor exercises: Strengthening the pelvic floor muscles through exercises, such as Kegels, may help improve the ability to control semen flow during ejaculation.\n4. Lifestyle modifications: Maintaining good hydration, avoiding or limiting alcohol consumption, and eliminating caffeine from your diet may help reduce the risk of experiencing retrograde ejaculation.\n5. Medications: Certain medications, such as phosphodiesterase inhibitors (PDIs), can help improve the quality and volume of semen and increase the likelihood of ejaculating forward during sexual activity.\n\nIt is crucial to remember that treatment for retrograde ejaculation and any associated underlying conditions will depend on the specific causes and individual circumstances. Consulting a healthcare professional is the best way to determine the appropriate course of action."}

Thanks.", "ai": " I'm an AI language model and not a doctor, but I'd be happy to provide some general tips for having a healthy pregnancy based on information that is widely available. Please consult with your healthcare provider for personalized advice.\n\n1. Regular Pre-natal Care: Regular check-ups are essential to monitor the health of both the mother and the developing fetus. Early prenatal care can help detect and address potential health issues before they become serious.\n\n2. Maintain a Balanced Diet: Eating a balanced diet, rich in essential nutrients like folic acid, iron, calcium, and vitamin D, is crucial for a healthy pregnancy. It's also a good idea to avoid foods that may increase the risk of foodborne illnesses.\n\n3.

Manage Chronic Conditions: If you have any chronic medical conditions, such as diabetes or thyroid disease, working closely with your healthcare provider to ensure they are well-controlled can help reduce potential risks for both you and the baby.\n\n5. Avoid Harmful Substances: Avoid smoking, alcohol, and recreational drugs as they can negatively impact fetal development. It's also important to limit caffeine intake, ideally to under 200mg per day.\n\n6. Regular Exercise: Regular, low-impact exercise, such as walking or swimming, can help improve overall health and fitness and may be beneficial for pregnancy. Always consult with your healthcare provider before starting a new exercise routine.\n\n7. Manage Stress: High stress levels during pregnancy can negatively impact both mother and baby. Practice stress management techniques, like meditation, deep breathing, or yoga, to help stay calm and reduce stress.\n\n8. Avoid Medications Unnecessarily: Some medications can pose risks during pregnancy, so it's always best to consult with your healthcare provider before taking any new medicines. If you're trying to conceive and have been prescribed a medication, discuss alternatives with your healthcare provider.\n\nAs for your concern about not getting pregnant, having a past abortion or high TSH levels shouldn't typically prevent you from getting pregnant. However, it's always a good idea to discuss your concerns with your healthcare provider. They may be able to offer recommendations for lifestyle changes, diagnostic tests, or treatments that could help improve your fertility."}

Minoxidil works by increasing blood flow to the scalp and promoting hair growth.\n\nHowever, like all medications, minoxidil can have side effects. The most common side effects of minoxidil for hair loss are:\n\n* Irritation of the scalp and skin (such as redness, itching, or burning)\n* Dizziness, lightheadedness, or headache\n* Rapid heartbeat or chest pain\n* Increased hair growth on other parts of the body\n\nIt's important to note that not everyone who uses minoxidil will experience side effects, and they may vary in severity.

Here are a few possible causes:\n\n1. New Environment: Daycare can be a new and unfamiliar environment for your child, which may make them feel uncomfortable or unsure about trying new foods. It might take some time for them to get used to the new routine and surroundings.\n2. Distractions: There could be many distractions at daycare that are preventing your child from focusing on eating. They may be more interested in playing with toys or interacting with their peers.\n3. Social Pressure: Children often feed off the eating habits of those around them. If other children in the daycare are not eating well or are picky eaters, your child may be influenced by this and not feel inclined to eat.\n4. Routine: The mealtimes or snack times at daycare may not align with your child's usual eating schedule, which could disrupt their mealtime routine and make it harder for them to eat.\n5.

Stress or Anxiety: Children can experience stress or anxiety in new environments, which can affect their appetite. If your child is feeling overwhelmed or anxious at daycare, they may not feel like eating.\n\nTo address this issue, you could try the following:\n\n1. Gradually introduce new foods andtextures at daycare to help your child become more familiar with them.\n2. Encourage your child to try small bites of new foods and offer positive reinforcement for trying new things.\n3. Make mealtimes at daycare more engaging and fun, such as making mealtime into a playful activity or involving your child in the meal preparation.\n4. Speak with your child's caregiver about your concerns and ask if they have any suggestions for encouraging your child to eat more.\n5. Offer healthy snacks between meals to help keep your child's energy levels up and prevent them from becoming too hungry at mealtime.\n6. Consider talking to your child's pediatrician about any underlying medical or developmental issues that could be contributing to their reluctance to eat at daycare."}

As asthma is allergy problem so i would also suggest you to rule out the cause of allergy (e.g dust, pollen, some food like egg, clothes, etc) and then prevent it. in this way the frequency of attack will decrease. hope i have cleared your query. if you need to ask anything else then you are most welcome. else you can close the thread and rate it.may you get well soon. thank you", "ai": " There is currently no definitive evidence to suggest that the consumption of whey protein or other bodybuilding supplements causes adverse effects specific to asthma. However, some studies have shown that protein supplements, particularly when consumed in large quantities, can increase the metabolic rate, which may lead to an increase in mucus production in the lungs. This could potentially worsen symptoms in individuals with asthma.\n\nAdditionally, some bodybuilding supplements may contain ingredients like creatine, beta-alanine, or caffeine, which may have potential side effects, such as increased heart rate, blood pressure, or respiratory symptoms. It is important to note that individual responses to these supplements may vary.\n\nIf you are considering taking a whey protein supplement to support your weight gain, it would be best to consult with a healthcare professional, such as your asthma specialist or a registered dietitian, to discuss the potential risks and benefits. They can help you determine if a protein supplement is right for you based on your medical history, current medications, and overall health goals.\n\nIn general, it's a good idea to focus on achieving a healthy and balanced diet that includes adequate protein intake through whole foods like lean meats, nuts, beans, and dairy products. For more information, you can also consider speaking with a registered dietitian to help you create a personalized nutrition plan that supports your asthma management and weight gain goals."}
{"question": "I have walking problem, how can I rectify this ?When I am walking I have confident less walk, i am fearing, this problem with me for the past 6 months. I am having stage fear . how can i rectify this. How i face the problem boldly.", "human": "Get your gait analysis done by an orthopedician, and if anything is wrong, you can take gait training to resolve it.", "ai": " I'm sorry to hear that you've been experiencing fear and lack of confidence during your walks for the past six months. Here are some suggestions that may help you regain your confidence and improve your walking experience:\n\n1. Identify the cause: Try to figure out what is causing your fear. Is it a physical issue that is making you feel unsteady, or is it a mental issue like anxiety or self-doubt? Once you've identified the cause, you can focus your efforts on addressing it.\n2. Practice mindfulness: Mindfulness meditation can help you stay focused on the present moment and reduce anxiety. Try practicing mindfulness meditation before you go for a walk, or during your walk if you feel anxious. You can use an app or a guided meditation to help you get started.\n3. Build confidence gradually: Rather than trying to go for long walks all at once, start with shorter walks and gradually build up your stamina and confidence. Consider walking in a safe and familiar environment, such as your neighborhood or a local park.\n4. Seek support: Consider seeking the support of a healthcare professional, such as a doctor or a physical therapist, if your walking problem is causing significant distress or impeding your ability to carry out daily activities. They can help you identify any underlying physical or mental health issues, and provide you with appropriate treatment and support.\n5. Use positive affirmations: Use positive affirmations to help boost your confidence and reinforce positive thoughts. For example, you might repeat affirmations like \"I am capable and strong,\" \"I am confident and in control,\" or \"I am making progress every day.\"\n6. Break it down: If you're feeling overwhelmed by the thought of going for a walk, try breaking it down into smaller, manageable steps. For example, you might start by walking to the end of your driveway and back, then gradually increasing the distance as you feel more confident.\n7. Focus on your breath: Deep, rhythmic breathing can help calm your mind and reduce feelings of anxiety. Try focusing on your breath as you walk, taking slow, deep breaths in through your nose and out through your mouth.\n8. Set realistic goals: Set realistic goals for yourself, such as walking a certain distance or improving your speed, and celebrate your progress along the way. This can help you feel motivated and encourage you to keep going even when the going gets tough."}
{"question": "Why do I feel tender and bruised in stomach with intense discomfort?Hi there. I m trying to conceive and for the last few days, my stomach has felt tender and bruised. I ve also felt slightly nauseous at times I ve passed ovulation and an due on my cycle on the 20th of this month. Its the bruising feeling on my stomach that is uncomfortable...any ideas what this can be down to and how I can ease it? Many thanks", "human": "Hello madam , 20 weeks pregnacy there are high chances of this type of symptoms due to abdominal distension and also regurgitation due to GE junction disturbances. As such no need to worry , avoid spicy foods , tea/coffee and have frequent samll meals and dont avoid meals. Take tab - Pantoprazole 40 mg once daily before food . It will subside", "ai": " I'm not a doctor, but I can try to provide some possible explanations for the tenderness, bruising, and discomfort you're experiencing in your stomach. These symptoms could be related to the following conditions:\n\n1. Ovarian cysts: Ovarian cysts are fluid-filled sacs that develop in or on the ovaries. They can cause pain or tenderness in the lower abdomen or the area around the navel. During ovulation, a cyst may form and rupture, leading to a sharp pain or cramp, followed by bruising.\n2. Implantation bleeding: If you are pregnant and undergoing implantation bleeding, it may cause discomfort, cramping, or tender breasts similar to premenstrual symptoms. Although implantation bleeding itself doesn't cause bruising, the repeated contact between your stomach and abdominal wall while moving around may lead to bruising in some cases.\n3. Constipation: If you are constipated, the hard stool may press against your stomach, causing discomfort, bloating, and tenderness. In such cases, consuming more fiber-rich foods, staying hydrated, and engaging in regular physical activity can help alleviate these symptoms.\n4. Irritable Bowel Syndrome (IBS): IBS is a chronic gastrointestinal disorder that may cause abdominal pain, bloating, discomfort, and tenderness. Certain foods, stress, or hormonal changes can trigger the symptoms of IBS.\n5. Endometriosis: Endometriosis is a condition where the tissue lining the inner wall of the uterus grows outside the uterus, leading to painful periods, heavy bleeding, and pelvic pain. Although it is more common in women during their reproductive years, it is possible for this condition to present with symptoms during pregnancy or while trying to conceive.\n\nTo alleviate the symptoms, you can try the following techniques:\n\n1. Use a heating pad: Applying a heating pad to your abdomen can help alleviate pain and cramping.\n2. Take over-the-counter pain relievers: If approved by your healthcare provider, you can take pain relievers like acetaminophen or ibuprofen to help manage your discomfort.\n3. Rest and relax: Try to get some rest and engage in calming activities like reading, listening to music, or taking a warm bath to help alleviate stress.\n4. Stay hydrated: Ensure that you're drinking plenty of fluids to help manage constipation and prevent dehydration.\n5. Apply gentle pressure: Placing a soft, warm compress on your abdomen can help alleviate tenderness and ease cramps.\n6. Contact your healthcare provider: If your symptoms persist or worsen, it's essential to consult your healthcare provider or a gynecologist for a proper diagnosis and treatment options."}

The mediastinum is divided into compartments, and a cyst in this area can form in any of these compartments. The cause of mediastinum cysts is not always known, and they can be congenital (present at birth) or develop later in life.\n\nMediastinum cysts are usually asymptomatic, meaning they don't cause any symptoms. However, some can become large enough to press on neighboring structures and cause symptoms such as chest pain, coughing, shortness of breath, or difficulty swallowing.\n\nThe size of the cyst and the fact that it hasn't grown in three months are good signs. Most mediastinum cysts are benign and do not require surgical intervention unless they cause symptoms or are suspected to be malignant. Your doctor may want to perform additional tests or observations to rule out other potential causes of your symptomatology if you are experiencing any symptoms despite the stable size of the cyst.\n\nIt is important to follow up with your doctor regularly and discuss any concerns or symptoms you may have. If you have any questions or if there are any updates to your condition, please let me know and I will try to provide you with accurate and up-to-date information."}
{"question": "What could cause skipping of heartbeat?hi just before i fall asleep or trying to falling asleep i feel like my heart is going to stop beating and i cant breath properly! Sometimes i actually fall asleep but wake up terrified cause i think my heart has stopped beating! Can this be anything serious??? Thank you in advance", "human": "I read your question carefully and I understand your concern.Judging from that description I would say that a heart issue is very unlikely. One doesn't actually understand if heart has stopped beating, if it did there would be lack of blood flow to the brain which would cause lead to dizziness or fainting. I guess if one wanted to explore the issue to the end an EKG and perhaps a 24 hour Holter EKG (where you carry a device monitoring heart rhythm for 24 hours) may be done.However I believe the symptoms are most likely due to anxiety, which can often manifest this way, so nothing serious.I hope to have been of help.", "ai": " It is important to note that I am an AI language model and not a doctor. I cannot diagnose medical conditions. However, I can provide some information that might help explain what you are experiencing.\n\nThe phenomenon you described, where you feel like your heart is skipping beats or stopping completely, and experience difficulty breathing, is often referred to as heart palpitations. Heart palpitations can have various causes, some benign and some more serious.\n\nCommon causes of heart palpitations include stress, anxiety, physical exertion, hormonal fluctuations, and dehydration. These conditions are usually not cause for concern and go away on their own.\n\nHowever, in some cases, heart palpitations can be a sign of a more serious medical condition, such as an irregular heartbeat (arrhythmia), heart disease, or thyroid problems. If your heart palpitations are frequent, intense, or associated with chest pain, dizziness, or shortness of breath, it is important to consult a healthcare professional to rule out any underlying conditions.\n\nIt is also important to note that heart palpitations can be more pronounced during sleep due to changes in body position or relaxation of the muscles in the chest, making it easier to feel the beating of the heart.\n\nIf you are experiencing persistent heart palpitations, you might want to keep a record of when they occur, their intensity, and any accompanying symptoms to share with your healthcare provider. This information can help them evaluate the cause and appropriate treatment options.\n\nAs always, if you feel like you're having a medical emergency, call emergency services immediately. If you're worried about your symptoms but they don't require immediate attention, consider making an appointment with your primary care physician or a cardiologist for a consultation."}

Dr Shareef.", "ai": " Abdominal pain and bleeding after heavy drinking could be caused by several conditions, some of which are:\n\n1. Alcoholic gastritis: This is inflammation of the stomach lining caused by chronic alcohol consumption. It can lead to abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting, and bloody stools or vomit.\n2. Esophagitis: Alcohol can irritate the esophagus, leading to inflammation and bleeding, which can cause chest pain and bloody vomit.\n3. Peptic ulcers: Heavy drinking can increase the production of stomach acid, which can irritate and erode the lining of the stomach or the first part of the small intestine (duodenum), leading to ulcers. Ulcers can cause abdominal pain and bleeding.\n4. Liver disease: Alcohol can damage the liver, leading to inflammation and bleeding in the gastrointestinal tract. This is more common in people who drink heavily for a long time.\n\nIt's important to note that these conditions require medical attention. If you're experiencing persistent abdominal pain and bleeding after drinking, you should see a doctor as soon as possible. In the meantime, avoid drinking alcohol and try to eat small, bland meals to help your stomach. Stay hydrated by drinking plenty of water or clear fluids."}

Regards,Dr. Shinas Hussain,General & Family Physician", "ai": " I'm not a doctor, but I can try to provide you with some possible causes of pain, numbness, and weakness in the legs based on the information you've provided.\n\n1. Radiculopathy: This condition occurs when a nerve root in the spine is compressed or irritated, leading to pain, numbness, and weakness in the areas of the body served by that nerve. The symptoms you described, such as leg pain, numbness, and difficulty walking, could be signs of radiculopathy, which is a common complication of herniated discs or degenerative disc disease.\n2. Peripheral neuropathy: This condition occurs when the nerves outside of the brain and spinal cord (peripheral nerves) are damaged. Symptoms of peripheral neuropathy can include pain, numbness, tingling, and weakness in the legs. Several conditions can cause peripheral neuropathy, including diabetes, vitamin deficiencies, infections, and certain medications.\n3. Spinal stenosis: This condition occurs when there is a narrowing of the spinal canal, putting pressure on the spinal cord and nerves. Symptoms can include pain, numbness, and weakness in the legs, and difficulty walking.\n4. Arthritis: Arthritis can affect the joints in the legs, causing pain and inflammation. Osteoarthritis, the most common type, occurs when the cartilage in the joints wears down, allowing the bones to rub against each other. Rheumatoid arthritis, an autoimmune disorder, can cause inflammation in the joints and surrounding tissues.\n5. Poor circulation: If the blood flow to your legs is reduced, you may experience pain, numbness, and weakness. Conditions such as peripheral artery disease or blood clots in the legs can cause poor circulation.\n6. Nerve tumors: tumors in or near the nerves can compress or damage them, leading to pain, numbness, and weakness in the legs.\n\nIt is important to see a doctor for a proper diagnosis and treatment plan. The causes and treatments for these conditions can vary, so it is essential to get an accurate diagnosis to receive effective treatment. In the meantime, you may find some relief by avoiding prolonged periods of sitting or standing, practicing good posture, stretching regularly, and using a cane or other assistive device to help you move around."}

While I can't prescribe specific treatments, I can suggest some natural and proven remedies that may help improve the appearance of your under-eye area.\n\n1. Cold Compress: Apply a cold compress or chilled cucumber slices to the affected area for about 15 minutes each day. The cold temperature helps to shrink the blood vessels, reducing the bluish tint of dark circles.\n\n2. Proper Sleep and Relaxation: Ensure you are getting enough sleep, as fatigue and stress can worsen the appearance of dark circles. Aim for 7-8 hours of sleep per night and practice relaxation techniques, such as meditation or deep breathing exercises, to help reduce stress.\n\n3. Hydration: Drink plenty of water and other hydrating beverages, such as herbal tea or fresh fruit juices.

Look for products containing ingredients like vitamin C, retinol, caffeine, or niacinamide, which help brighten and improve the appearance of the skin.\n\n7. Sun Protection: Protect your under-eye area from the sun's harmful rays by wearing sunscreen with at least SPF 30 every day, even when indoors.\n\n8. Proper Makeup Application: Avoid heavy, cakey concealers and opt for a lightweight, brightening formula that does not settle into fine lines. Gently pat it onto the affected area, allowing it to blend seamlessly with your skin tone for a flawless finish.\n\n9. Herbal Remedies: Consider trying natural remedies such as potato slices, rose water, or green tea bags, which have anti-inflammatory and antioxidant properties that can help reduce dark circles.\n\n10.

Consult with a healthcare professional: It's essential to speak with a healthcare provider about your symptoms, especially if you've been experiencing them for over two years. They can perform a thorough evaluation and determine if there's an underlying medical condition causing your erection problems, watery semen, and reduced semen volume.\n\n2. Lifestyle modifications: This may include quitting smoking, limiting alcohol intake, managing stress through relaxation techniques, and staying physically active. Regular exercise has been shown to improve overall health, boost mood, and help maintain optimal reproductive health.\n\n3. Medications: Depending on the diagnosis from your healthcare provider, they might recommend medication to help improve your symptoms. For example, oral medications like sildenafil (Viagra), vardenafil (Levitra), or tadalafil (Cialis) can help improve erectile function. Medications for conditions like low testosterone or hypogonadism may also be prescribed.\n\n4. Surgery: For conditions like undescended testes, surgical intervention might be necessary. This could potentially help address your erection and semen issues.\n\n5. Counseling or therapy: Emotional and psychological factors can also contribute to erectile dysfunction and low semen volume. Talking to a mental health professional or relationship counselor might be helpful in addressing any underlying emotional challenges or relationship issues.\n\n6. Nutritional supplements: Certain supplements, like L-arginine, zinc, folic acid, and ginseng, have been suggested as potential treatments for erectile dysfunction. However, it's crucial to talk to your healthcare provider before trying any new supplements.\n\n7. Lifestyle habits: Evaluating your masturbation habits and sexual activities is also essential. Frequent masturbation or using pornography extensively can lead to erectile dysfunction and decreased semen volume. Limiting these activities or exploring other ways to be sexually active with your partner can help improve your overall sexual health."}

Opioids, such as morphine and oxycodone, are effective for managing severe pain. Non-opioid medications, such as acetaminophen (paracetamol) and nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), can help augment the pain-relieving effects of opioids and provide additional benefits, such as reducing inflammation.\n\nGiven that your sister is undergoing a lung biopsy and awaiting results, it is important that she receives adequate pain management. However, taking a large number of medications for pain could increase the risk of side effects, such as constipation, drowsiness, confusion, and respiratory depression.\n\nThere are several strategies that could be considered to improve pain management and reduce the number of medications your sister is taking:\n\n1. Optimizing opioid dosing: Ensure that your sister's opioid dose is appropriate for her pain level and that she is taking the medication as prescribed.\n2. Consider adjusting the dosing schedule: Changing the dosing frequency of the opioids and other medications could help improve pain control and reduce side effects.\n3. Explore alternative pain management modalities: There are several non-pharmacologic approaches to pain management, such as heat or cold therapy, massage, acupuncture, and relaxation techniques, that could be helpful for managing pain.\n4. Implementing a patient-controlled analgesia (PCA) pump: A PCA pump allows your sister to self-administer controlled doses of pain medication as needed, which could help improve pain control and reduce the need for frequent oral dosing.\n5. Discussing adjuvant therapies: There are several adjuvant therapies, such as gabapentinoids and cannabinoids, that could be added to your sister's pain regimen to help improve pain control and reduce opioid requirements.\n\nIt is important to note that any changes to your sister's pain management regimen should be made in consultation with her healthcare provider.

Meningitis in children offers due to infection most probably viral or bacterial. It is not related to drugs used by any close relative or friend. Take care.", "ai": " Meningitis is an inflammation of the protective membranes covering the brain and spinal cord. Both viral and bacterial infections can cause meningitis in babies, and while methamphetamine use has been linked to an increased risk of bacterial meningitis, it does not directly cause the infection. The bacterium most commonly associated with meningitis in babies is Neisseria meningitidis, and it can be spread from person to person through saliva or respiratory droplets, usually during close contact. Other bacterial causes of meningitis include Streptococcus pneumoniae, Listeria monocytogenes, and Escherichia coli.\n\nIt is essential to understand that the primary source of the infection in this situation is unclear. Meningitis in a baby can also be caused by other factors, such as asymptomatic carriers, poor hygiene, or other environmental sources. Therefore, it's crucial to consider all possibilities when investigating the cause of the infant's illness. That being said, if the mother or her associates have used unclean needles or other practices that increase the risk of bacterial meningitis, they could potentially transmit the infection to the baby. Additionally, methamphetamine use can weaken the baby's immune system, making them more susceptible to infections.\n\nIt would be best to consult with a healthcare professional or a pediatrician for more precise information about the specific case. They will have access to the most up-to-date medical information and can provide guidance tailored to the situation. In the meantime, it is crucial to ensure that everyone in the household, including the baby, receives prompt medical attention and practices good personal hygiene to minimize the risk of infection transmission."}

I'm not a doctor, but I can try to provide you with some information that might help ease your concerns.\n\nDuring wisdom tooth removal, your dental healthcare provider may use local anesthesia to numb the area around the tooth, making the procedure more comfortable for you. If you're feeling particularly anxious, you can try the following options to help reduce your anxiety:\n\n1. Communicate with your dentist or oral surgeon: Let them know you're feeling anxious and discuss your concerns with them. They may be able to offer you additional options, such as nitrous oxide (laughing gas) or sedation techniques to help you relax.\n2. Bring a support person with you: Having someone you trust present during the procedure can be helpful in reducing anxiety.\n3. Practice relaxation techniques: Deep breathing exercises, progressive muscle relaxation, or visualization can help you relax before and during the procedure.\n4. Use distraction techniques: Listen to music, watch a movie, or focus on something other than the procedure to help distract your mind.\n5. Consider sedation dentistry: If your anxiety is significant, your dental healthcare provider may recommend sedation dentistry to help you relax during the procedure. This can be in the form of oral sedatives, nitrous oxide, or IV sedation.\n\nIt's important to note that every dental healthcare provider may have slightly different approaches to making their patients comfortable, so it's always a good idea to discuss your options with them.

I have an unfinished root canal for about eight months, temporary filling has also fallen out. Now I am with severe pain. Unable to drink, eat, etc. What should I do to relieve the pain? OTC is not working.", "human": "Hi. I have read through your complaint and the relevant details. You said it is an eight months old treated tooth and also with incomplete root canal treatment. With this, I suspect that the tooth is severely infected and you might need to take a course of antibiotics along with pain killers as an emergency till you seek a dentist as soon as possible. Also do not worry that the temporary filling has fallen out. That is okay because if it was there, you would have got a swelling due to the severe infection pressurized within the boundaries of the tooth. Re-root canal treatment is highly questionable at this stage.  Meanwhile, take the tablets as per the prescription. Capsule Amoxycillin 500 mg orally eight hourly for five days, tablet Metronidazole 400 mg orally 12 hourly for five days, tablet Ibuprofena and Paracetomol (200 mg and 500 mg) combination drug to be taken orally eight hourly for 2 to 3 days. Note: Please do not repeat the course unless prescribed again. All medicines are to be taken after food only. If you get any skin rashes or allergies immediately stop taking the medicine. If you having any gastric irritation during the course of the medicines, please take tablet Omeprazole 10 mg 12 hourly 30 minutes before food along with the other prescribed medicines. However, I advice you to visit a dentist as soon as possible to get it virtually treated because antibiotics are mere ad-ons to the actual treatment.", "ai": " I'm an AI language model and not a doctor, but I can suggest some general steps you can take to manage your toothache until you can see a dentist:\n\n1. Over-the-counter (OTC) pain relievers: You can take OTC painkillers such as acetaminophen or ibuprofen to help alleviate the pain. Make sure to follow the instructions on the label for dosages.\n2. Clove oil: Clove oil is a natural analgesic and anti-inflammatory agent. You can apply a small amount (1-2 drops) of clove oil to a cotton ball and place it on the affected tooth for quick pain relief.\n3. Saltwater rinse: Rinsing your mouth with warm saltwater can help reduce inflammation and decrease pain. Mix 1/2 teaspoon of salt in a glass of warm water and swish it around your mouth for 30 seconds before spitting it out.\n4. Cold compress: Applying a cold compress to the affected area can help reduce inflammation and numb the tooth, providing temporary pain relief.\n5. Temporary filling: If possible, try to place a temporary filling yourself using dental cement, sugarless gum, or toothpaste, before seeing a dentist. Make sure to sterilize the materials first to prevent infection.\n6. Avoid hot or cold foods: Try to avoid hot or cold foods as they may exacerbate the toothache.\n7. Contact your dentist: Schedule an appointment with your dentist as soon as possible to address the dislodged filling and the root canal treatment.\n\nPlease remember that I'm an AI model and not a medical professional. If you experience persistent pain, or if any procedures such as home remedies or temporary fillings seem challenging or intimidating, I strongly recommend consulting your dentist immediately."}
{"question": "Taking clomid and duphaston. Fever cold and cough. Will these affect my chances of conception?From the 2nd of my period i took Clomid 50 mg for 5 days as prescribed by doctor. Ovulation occurred on day 13th. Doctor has then asked me to take Duphaston 10 mg for 10 days. I am taking the medicine but I am having fever as well as cough and cold. Will this cause problem in getting pregnant. What are the chances of me getting pregnant in this cycle.", "human": "Hello,Thanks for the query, Cough and cold may be due to decreased immunity. Boost your immune system by eating a healthy diet, including plenty of fresh fruits and vegetables.Too much stress is known to weaken the immune system. So avoid stress,Avoid taking cough syrup for relief as it contains caffeine. alcohol. High fever is known to cause miscarriage. Get treated for fever with antipyretics, Hope this helps,regards,Dr NILOFER", "ai": " I am an AI language model and not a doctor, but I can try to provide you some general information on this topic based on available data. While I cannot diagnose your current health condition or predict your chances of getting pregnant with absolute certainty, I can give you some basic information that might help you better understand the situation.\n\nClomid (clomiphene citrate) is a medication commonly used to stimulate ovulation. It works by blocking the action of estrogen on the pituitary gland, leading to the release of more follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) and luteinizing hormone (LH), which can help promote ovulation.\n\nDuphaston (bromocriptine) is another medication sometimes used in conjunction with clomid. Its primary function is not to stimulate ovulation but instead to prevent or reduce the production of prolactin, a hormone that can interfere with ovulation if its levels are too high. Prolactin inhibits the release of LH and FSH, making it more challenging to stimulate ovulation.\n\nNow, regarding your current state of health and its impact on your chances of getting pregnant, it is essential to keep in mind that a fever, cold, and cough are common ailments. While they might not directly affect the chances of ovulating or getting pregnant, they can cause some complications. For instance, a high fever can potentially damage or delay ovulation. As for the cold and cough, they might lead to dehydration or disrupt your normal sleep patterns, which could indirectly impact your fertility.\n\nHowever, based on available scientific data, there's no definitive evidence suggesting that having a fever, cold, or cough while taking clomid or duphaston significantly lowers your chances of getting pregnant in any given cycle. Nevertheless, it is still crucial to consult your doctor if you have concerns about your current health and its potential implications on your fertility treatment. They may be able to provide you with more insights based on your specific medical history and recommendations. Adhering to your doctor's plan and seeking their guidance throughout the process is essential in maximizing your chances of success."}

What tests might you suggest and what might be causing this?", "human": "Hello, Foot drops are generally caused by injury to nerves supplying lower leg. It is quite common after traumas and neuropathic causes like peripheral neuropathy can also lead to foot drop. Consult a neurologist and get evaluated. A detailed evaluation is required including a nerve conduction study is needed. Hope I have answered your query. Let me know if I can assist you further. Take care Regards,Dr Shinas Hussain, General & Family Physician", "ai": " Drop foot, also known as foot drop, is a condition where an individual has difficulty lifting the front part of their foot. This can result in a dragging or scraping of the foot on the ground when walking. Several conditions can cause drop foot, and given your relative's age, the following are potential causes that may be considered:\n\n1. Peroneal Nerve Palsy: The peroneal nerve is responsible for innervating the muscles that lift the front part of the foot. Damage to this nerve can result in drop foot. Causes of peroneal nerve palsy include compression, diabetes, or other neurological conditions. A nerve conduction study (NCS) and electromyography (EMG) can help diagnose this condition.\n\n2. Disorders of the Spinal Cord or Brain: Conditions such as Multiple Sclerosis, Parkinson's disease, or a benign tumor, among others, can cause drop foot. A neurological evaluation, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), or computed tomography (CT) scan may be required to rule out these conditions.\n\n3. Calf Muscle Problems: Calf muscle problems, including injuries and muscular dystrophies, may cause drop foot. Physical therapy, followed by an assessment of muscle strength and muscle function, can help determine if a muscle issue is the cause.\n\n4. Arthritis: Osteoarthritis and rheumatoid arthritis can cause drop foot by affecting the ankle or foot joints. An evaluation by an orthopedic specialist and X-rays may be necessary to diagnose arthritis.\n\n5. Motor Neuron Diseases: Conditions like Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease, Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis (ALS), and other motor neuron diseases can cause drop foot. A neurological evaluation, NCS, and EMG can help diagnose these conditions if they are suspected.\n\n6. Other possible causes: Other causes of drop foot include stroke, tumors, and certain medications like corticosteroids or neuroleptics. Your relative should undergo a thorough medical evaluation, including a comprehensive history and physical examination, to rule out these causes. Depending on the findings, additional tests may be necessary.\n\nRegardless of the underlying cause, it is essential to consult with a healthcare professional for an accurate diagnosis and appropriate treatment. In the meantime, it could be helpful for your relative to consider using an ankle-foot orthosis (AFO) or a foot drop brace to assist with walking. Your relative should consult their doctor or a physical therapist for the best fitting and usage instructions of an AFO if recommended."}

Hydrocortisone, a type of steroid medication, is known to cause fluid retention and increase the risk of low blood pressure (hypotension) when taken in higher doses or for an extended period. Sinemet, used to treat Parkinson's disease, can also cause orthostatic hypotension (a drop in blood pressure upon standing) due to its ability to reduce peripheral vascular resistance.\n\nThyroxine (T4), a thyroid hormone replacement medication, is unlikely to contribute to such a significant drop in blood pressure.\n\nIf you are experiencing consistent and significant drops in blood pressure shortly after taking hydrocortisone and Sinemet, it is recommended that you discuss this issue with your healthcare provider. They may be able to adjust your dosages or prescribe additional medications, such as a medication to treat orthostatic hypotension, to help mitigate this side effect. Regular monitoring of your blood pressure at home, especially shortly after taking these medications, would be prudent for your safety and to better inform your healthcare team."}

However, please consult your healthcare professional for medical advice tailored to your specific condition.\n\n1. Asthma: For asthma attacks, follow the steps of your Asthma Action Plan. This consists of using your short-acting bronchodilator inhaler (such as albuterol) when symptoms start. If the symptoms do not improve, call your doctor or go to the emergency room. Using your inhaler frequently for asthma attacks may not be the cause of the chlorine taste. However, if you are concerned, discuss this with your doctor.\n\n2. Chest infection: For a chest infection, it's essential to keep up with your regular asthma treatments and therapies while taking antibiotics prescribed by your doctor to fight the chest infection. Drink plenty of fluids to help keep yourself hydrated. Cough up the mucus as much as you can to help clear your lungs and improve breathing.\n\n3.

{"question": "What causes swelling and bumps under armpit?Hello my son is ten soon to be 11 in sept.... He has bumps under his underarms one of them is red and slightly swollen.... They are popable and look like little pimples w/o any white inside them....what coul this be? Does this occur before armpit hair begins to grow?", "human": "Hi,It sees that there might be having enlarged axillary lymphnodes producing bumps in that area.This can be due to having some recurrent minor injuries on hand, fingers.Nothing to worry if there is no pain or size increases.Ok and take care.", "ai": " It is normal for children to develop small, benign bumps or swellings under their armpits from time to time. These bumps, which may be clear or have a slight color, are often caused by a condition called apocrine gland cysts or milia. Apocrine glands are located in the armpit and other areas of the body with sweat glands, and they produce a thicker, milky type of sweat. occasionally, these glands can become clogged or infected, leading to the formation of cysts or bumps.\n\nMilia are small white or yellowish bumps that are caused by a buildup of keratin, a protein found in skin cells, under the surface of the skin. Milia are common in infants and young children, and they often appear on the face, particularly around the eyes and nose, as well as under the arms. Milia are not caused by sweat, hair growth, or infection.\n\nThe fact that your son's bump is red and swollen suggests that it may be infected, which could be due to scratching or irritation. In this case, it would be best to have your son seen by a healthcare professional, who can examine the bump and recommend appropriate treatment, which may include antibiotics to clear up any infection.\n\nIf the bump is not infected, and it is not causing pain or discomfort, it is generally not necessary to seek medical treatment, as the bumps will usually go away on their own within a few days to a few weeks. In the meantime, you can help relieve any discomfort or irritation by keeping the area clean and dry and applying a warm compress to the area several times a day.\n\nIf your son is concerned about the appearance of the bumps, you can help him understand that they are common and not harmful, and that they will go away on their own as he grows older. It is also a good idea to remind him not to pick or scratch at the bumps, as this can lead to infection or scarring.\n\nIt is important to note that the onset of apocrine gland cysts or milia does not necessarily coincide with the start of armpit hair growth, as these conditions can occur at any age, even in infants who do not yet have any noticeable underarm hair. However, if your son is concerned about hair growth or body changes, you can take this opportunity to have an open and supportive conversation with him about the normal physical changes that occur during puberty and the steps he can take to stay clean and healthy."}

Wish your kid good health.Dr. Sumanth MBBS., DCH., DNB (Paed).,", "ai": " I'm glad you're seeking advice for your son's perioral dermatitis. The first step would be to discontinue the use of topical steroids, including Elide, as they can worsen the condition over prolonged use. Instead, consider the following treatment options:\n\n1. Topical Calcineurin Inhibitors: These include over-the-counter creams and prescription-strength options like Mometasone Furoate (Elocon). They are effective for treating perioral dermatitis, and they are safer for long-term use than steroids.\n2. Antibacterial Cleansers: A gentle antibacterial cleanser can help manage the inflammation and prevent infection. Look for options containing ingredients like ceramide and glycerin to hydrate the skin.\n3. Moisturizer: Apply a fragrance-free moisturizer after cleansing to soothe the skin and create a barrier against irritants.\n4. Dietary Modifications: Although perioral dermatitis is not typically caused by diet, some children may find relief by avoiding spicy, hot, or greasy foods.\n5. Topical Antibiotics: In some cases, your doctor may prescribe a topical antibiotic, such as clindamycin or erythromycin, to help reduce inflammation and eradicate any potential bacterial infections.\n6. Antifungal therapy: Since mipirocin is an antibiotic and topical steroids can increase the risk of fungal infections, it's essential to rule out fungal involvement before pursuing antifungal therapy. However, if your son's condition fails to improve with the above treatments and suspects fungal involvement, discuss antifungal options with your doctor.\n\nIt's crucial to remember that treatment may take weeks or even months to produce noticeable improvements, so patience and consistency are essential. If your son's condition worsens or fails to improve with these treatments, consult with a pediatric dermatologist for further evaluation and personalized treatment options."}

Regards,Dr. Shinas Hussain, General & Family Physician", "ai": " Sofradex (Betamethasone dipropionate and neomycine sulfate and paraffin) is an topical corticosteroid medication often used to reduce inflammation and itching associated with various skin conditions such as eczema, contact dermatitis, and psoriasis. Based on the information provided, itching on the thighs described as \"khujlii\" could potentially be related to any number of skin conditions.\n\nWhile I cannot definitively say whether Sofradex is effective for your father's specific condition without a proper diagnosis by a healthcare professional, many people have reported finding relief from itching and inflammation with its use. However, it is important to note that prolonged use of topical corticosteroids may lead to side effects such as thinning of the skin, stretch marks, and increased susceptibility to infections.\n\nAdditionally, itching can be caused by various factors, including allergic reactions, infections, and underlying medical conditions. In order to determine whether the itching is caused by an allergy and whether it is contagious, a healthcare professional would need to conduct an assessment, including taking a detailed medical history, performing a physical examination, and possibly ordering tests.\n\nRegarding other creams, over-the-counter anti-itch creams containing ingredients such as hydrocortisone, calamine lotion, diphenhydramine, or antihistamines may be helpful in providing temporary relief from itching. However, it is important to consult with a healthcare professional before trying any new treatments, especially if you have an underlying medical condition or are taking other medications, as some ingredients may interact with one another.\n\nAllergy can indeed be contagious, but the specific type of allergy you are referring to is unclear from the information provided. Allergies can be transmitted through contact with an allergen (such as through touch, inhalation, or ingestion) or through the transfer of allergenic cells from one person to another (such as through cuts or wounds). However, it is important to note that most allergies are not contagious in the sense that they do not spread from person to person simply by being in close proximity to someone who has the allergy.\n\nTherefore, it is important to determine the underlying cause of the itching and consult with a healthcare professional if you have concerns. They can help determine the cause and recommend appropriate treatments. If the itching is indeed due to an allergy, taking steps to avoid the allergen(s) can help prevent future outbreaks."}

Other treatment options are oral fluconazole, itraconazole and terbinafine  given only after consulting a dermatologist.Thanks.Dr.Harshit Bhachech.MBBS, DDVL.", "ai": " I'm an AI language model and not a doctor, but I can try to help you understand some common symptoms associated with Candida overgrowth based on the information you've provided. However, it is essential to consult with a healthcare professional for an accurate diagnosis.\n\nCandida is a type of yeast that naturally exists in the body, but it can become overgrown when the balance of bacteria in the body is disrupted. This condition, known as Candida overgrowth or candidiasis, can cause various symptoms in different areas of the body. Here are some symptoms that might be related to Candida based on yourdescription:\n\n1. Skin and mucous membranes: Rashes, itching, and blisters, particularly in the areas you mentioned, such as under the breasts and around the rectum, can be signs of Candida. These symptoms could also be related to other conditions, such as dermatitis or herpes, so it's crucial to determine the cause with a healthcare professional.\n\n2. Oral symptoms: Blisters in the mouth or the development of sores, particularly when you're stressed, can sometimes be indicators of Candida overgrowth. Again, other conditions, such as canker sores or stress-induced ulcers, can cause similar symptoms, so a proper diagnosis is essential.\n\n3. Digestive symptoms: While you didn't mention any digestive symptoms in your description, some individuals with Candida overgrowth experience bloating, gas, diarrhea, constipation, or other gastrointestinal issues.\n\nAs for the use of probiotics to treat Candida, research suggests that probiotics may support the growth of beneficial bacteria in the gut, which could help restore the balance disrupted by an overgrowth of Candida. However, there isn't conclusive evidence that probiotics alone can effectively eliminate Candida in the gut. Treatment may involve a combination of factors, such as an antifungal prescription, dietary modifications, stress reduction techniques, and probiotic supplementation.\n\nThe concern about herpes and probiotics is important. Herpes simplex virus (HSV) infections can weaken the intestinal barrier, making it easier for harmful bacteria, like Candida, to overgrow. In turn, Candida overgrowth can lead to a worsening of herpes symptoms. It's essential to discuss your personal situation with your healthcare professional before starting any probiotic therapy, especially if you have a history of herpes.

I've had extra heartbeats for over 20 years; however, I have noticed that they are growing in frequency since the start of my pregnancy. I hate them. They always scare me. I've had tests done years ago. Should I be concerned now more than before?", "human": "Hi,I would advise you to have a holter monitoring done, it is a test when you are given a small device for a day and your 24 hour ECG is registered. If the arrhythmias are not much during a day, there is nothing to be worried even if you feel them.Take careCome back if you have any further questions", "ai": " I'm not a doctor, but I can share some information about Mitral Valve Prolapse (MVP) and increased heartbeats during pregnancy that may help you. I recommend consulting your healthcare provider for accurate information based on your specific situation.\n\nMVP is a common heart condition characterized by the bulging of the mitral valve into the left atrium, creating a potentially incomplete closure, which can cause heart murmurs and extra heartbeats. It's usually asymptomatic, but some people, like you, may feel palpitations or notice heartbeats that seem unusual.\n\nDuring pregnancy, various physiological changes can occur in the heart, making it work harder to supply blood to both the mother and the developing fetus. This increased workload could potentially exacerbate symptoms of MVP, such as increasing the frequency of heartbeats. However, there's no evidence to suggest that MVP poses a significant risk to the mother or the baby.\n\nBased on your personal history and the current situation, you might want to consider the following:\n\n- Communicate with your healthcare provider about your concerns and symptoms. They may recommend additional tests to ensure the health of both you and your baby.\n- Practice relaxation techniques, such as deep breathing or meditation, to help manage anxiety and stress around the increased heartbeats.\n- Eat a healthy and balanced diet, staying hydrated, and getting regular exercise to support your overall health during pregnancy.\n- Discuss any medications you're taking or considering with your healthcare provider. Certain medications may not be suitable during pregnancy, so it's essential to consult your doctor for guidance.\n\nKeep in mind that each pregnancy and individual's experience is unique. Regular communication with your healthcare provider, staying informed, and practicing self-care can help alleviate concerns and ensure the best possible outcome for both you and the baby."}
{"question": "What causes bruise in my neck and chest?Thanks! Hi, I am just wondering about something. I took a shower tonight and was washing my neck and chest and noticed I felt a bruise, but there is nothing there. I felt this about a month ago and I don't really want to worry, but I don't want to ignore something that has been around for a month. Any ideas?", "human": "Hi, dearI have gone through your question. I can understand your concern. You may have purpura or petechhia.  You should go for complete coagulation profile. Then you should take treatment accordingly. Hope I have answered your question, if you have doubt then I will be happy to answer. Thanks for using health care magic. Wish you a very good health.", "ai": " There are several possible causes for a bruise that appears without an obvious injury. Here are a few possibilities:\n\n1. Internal bruising: Bruises can occur internally, meaning they're not visible on the surface of the skin but can still cause discoloration or tenderness when pressed. This can happen due to various conditions, such as chronic disease, medication side effects, or certain health conditions. In your case, it's less likely to be internal bruising as it's been only a month, but it's worth considering.\n2. Blood vessel disorders: Some disorders that affect the blood vessels, such as vasculitis or hemorrhage, can cause unexplained bruises. These conditions cause blood to leak into the tissues and form bruises.\n3. Trauma or pressure: Trauma or pressure on the skin, even if not visible, can cause a bruise. This could have happened when you were washing your neck and chest in the shower or from any other activity throughout the day.\n4. Aging: As we age, our skin becomes thinner and more fragile, making it easier to bruise.\n5. Certain medical conditions: Conditions such as liver disease, leukemia, and platelet disorders can cause easy bruising.\n\nIt's important to note that most of the time, a bruise without an obvious cause is nothing to worry about. However, if you have other symptoms or are concerned, it is always a good idea to consult a healthcare professional for peace of mind.\n\nIf the bruise persists or grows larger, or if you notice any other unusual symptoms, such as swelling, pain, or difficulty breathing, seek medical attention right away.\n\nIn the meantime, you could try wearing loose clothing, avoiding strenuous activities, and applying ice or a warm compress to the affected area as needed to help reduce discomfort."}

Propygenta is an antifungal medication used to treat fungal infections, while Micogel is a topical corticosteroid used to reduce inflammation and swelling.\n\nUsing Propygenta and Micogel together for a fungal infection and allergic swelling could potentially provide additional benefits. The antifungal properties of Propygenta can help eliminate the fungal infection, while the anti-inflammatory effects of Micogel can help reduce swelling and discomfort.\n\nHowever, it's always important to consult with your healthcare provider or pharmacist before using any medication combination, as they can provide personalized advice based on your specific medical condition and any potential drug interactions or side effects. They can also provide instructions on the proper dosage and application of both medications to ensure optimal effectiveness and safety."}

It is important that you continue to follow the advice of his healthcare professionals, as they have examined him and have a complete picture of his medical history and current condition.\n\nIt seems that your son had a boil or abscess under his scrotum, and he was admitted to the hospital for treatment with antibiotics and possibly anti-fungal medication. Once the boil started draining, he returned to the hospital due to dehydration. The dehydration could have been caused by his body losing fluids as the boil drained. Dehydration is a serious condition that can lead to more complications if not treated promptly, so your son's doctors may have wanted to monitor him closely to prevent any further issues.\n\nThe fact that your son was given antibiotics and possibly anti-fungal medication suggests that there may have been both bacterial and fungal infections present. This is not uncommon in people with prolonged episodes of skin infections, such as a boil.\n\nIt is important that your son continues to take any prescribed medications as directed by his healthcare professionals. He should also drink plenty of fluids to help prevent dehydration and maintain good hydration. If he experiences any worsening of symptoms, fever, or increasing pain, he should contact his doctor for further evaluation.\n\nIn the future, your son should practice good hygiene to prevent similar infections from occurring. This includes maintaining cleanliness in the groin area and avoiding tight-fitting clothes that may irritate the skin. If he develops any new lumps or swelling in the area, he should seek medical attention promptly."}
{"question": "What causes swelling in gums after tooth extraction?i had a molar pulled out last thursday and since then ive notice that my back molar has my gums all swollen around it.. it dont really hurt its more like its uncomfortable.. why is this happening?? I go on thursday this week to get my stiches removed.", "human": "HiIt could be due to traumatic extraction or there might be some remaining root.If it doesn't resolve with in 5 days after taking medicines then go x-ray to rule out if there is some remaining root stump.Continue with your medicines for 5 days.Also do warm saline rinses 3-4 times a day.Visit your dentist for further consent.RegardsDr. Neha Sumra", "ai": " Swelling after tooth extraction is a common occurrence and is usually a part of the healing process. There are several reasons why your gums may be swollen after having a molar extracted:\n\n1. Inflammation: The tooth extraction procedure involves the use of forceps or other surgical instruments to remove the tooth, which can cause trauma to the surrounding tissues. This can lead to inflammation, which may result in swelling.\n2. Bleeding: During the tooth extraction process, there may be some bleeding of the gums and other tissues. This blood can accumulate and form a small clot, which can lead to swelling.\n3. Bruising: Just like bruises that form on the skin after an injury, bruises can also form inside the mouth, causing the gums to appear swollen. This is often due to trauma to the blood vessels during the tooth extraction procedure.\n4. edema: Edema, or the accumulation of fluid in the tissue, can also contribute to swelling after tooth extraction. This can be due to the body's natural response to the trauma of the tooth extraction or due to the use of certain medications, such as steroids or nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs).\n\nIt's normal to experience some degree of swelling after a tooth extraction, and in most cases, it goes away on its own over time. However, if the swelling is severe or accompanied by other symptoms, such as fever or increasing pain, you should contact your dentist or oral surgeon for further evaluation. In the meantime, you can use a cool compress on the outside of the mouth to help reduce swelling and discomfort."}
{"question": "Does eczema cause greenish stool in kids?Hello,I have a seven week old baby, for the last couple of days she has been having yellowish/greenish stool with white little stringy things in her stool. I am not quite sure if this is normal. She has gotten eczema recently, so I'm not sure if that has something to do with it.", "human": "Eczema does not cause greenish stools in kids and I do not find any association. Greenish stools occur due to rapid transit of faecal matter through the large intestine and is normal in babies of such an age. Probably you are giving formula feeds, at least partly, and since they are hard to digest, often white portions are present in the stool. It is normal too. No need to worry.", "ai": " Yellowish or greenish stool in a baby, along with white stringy substances, can be caused by a few different things, and eczema is not one of them. These symptoms are more commonly associated with issues related to digestion and absorption in the gut, such as breast milk digestion, food intolerances, or bile duct issues. If you're concerned about your baby's stool, it's best to consult a healthcare professional to rule out any underlying medical conditions. The eczema itself is an unrelated skin condition."}

{"question": "Could scoliosis with a growth spurt cause a chest lump?My 9 year old son woke up 2 days ago with a painful lump on his chest. I took him to our family doctor and she took xrays and the xrays showed a curve in his spine. She is sending us to a specialist because she thinks he might have Scoliosis. Could a growth spurt and having Scoliosis caused this lump?", "human": "Hello, There is no association between a growth spurt & scoliosis and the painful chest lump that your son has. Could the lump have been the result of an injury? Hope I have answered your query. Let me know if I can assist you further. Take care Regards,Dr Arnold Zedd, Pediatrician", "ai": " It's important to note that I'm an AI language model and not a medical doctor, but I can try to provide you with some general information on this topic.\n\nScoliosis is a condition characterized by an abnormal sideways curve of the spine. The curve can lead to various symptoms, such as uneven shoulders, uneven waistline, and uneven rib cage. In some cases, people with scoliosis may experience back pain or discomfort, but a noticeable lump on the chest is not a typical symptom.\n\nGrowth spurts, on the other hand, are periods of rapid growth that occur in children and adolescents. During these spurts, the bones in the body may grow faster than the muscles and soft tissues, leading to feelings of discomfort or even pain in some areas of the body.\n\nIt's possible that the lump your son is experiencing could be related to his growth spurt, rather than his scoliosis. As his bones grow faster than his muscles, he may develop muscle imbalances and tightness that could cause a noticeable lump or bulge in certain areas of the body.\n\nHowever, it's also important to remember that only a healthcare professional can make a definitive diagnosis. I would recommend following up with the specialist your doctor has referred you to, as they will be able to provide more detailed information and guidance based on a thorough examination and diagnosis."}
{"question": "What causes fluctuations in the BP level in a lung and liver cancer patient?Someone I know has been on this for awhile and has been getting great results I have noticed her belly is getting big and her blood pressure is going up and down. She has been diagnosed with stag 4 cancer liver lung pelvis cancer do you know if this mean it is getting close to dieing I am close to the family I just want to be prepared for them or is it hard to say thanks", "human": "if patient's tummy is getting distended that signifies that she might be developing ascites (accumulation of fluid in the tummy )or disease is spreading.so it's a poor prognosis and survival is maximum upto 6 months in these cases", "ai": " I'm an AI language model and not a doctor, but I can try to help answer your question based on the information available to me. Fluctuations in blood pressure can be caused by a variety of factors, including those related to cancer and its treatment. In the case of a patient with stage 4 liver-lung-pelvis cancer, there are several potential causes of blood pressure fluctuations:\n\n1. Fluid buildup (edema): Cancer can interfere with the normal functioning of the lymphatic system, causing fluid to accumulate in the body. This can lead to swelling, particularly in the abdomen, and can contribute to fluctuations in blood pressure.\n2. Liver dysfunction: The liver plays a crucial role in regulating blood pressure by removing toxins and producing necessary proteins. When the liver is not functioning properly due to cancer, it can impact blood pressure regulation.\n3. Medications: Certain medications used to treat cancer and its symptoms can cause blood pressure fluctuations as a side effect. Chemotherapy drugs, for example, can cause dehydration, which can lead to an increase in blood pressure, while other drugs used to manage symptoms such as pain or nausea can cause a drop in blood pressure.\n4. Infections: Infections, particularly those that affect the lungs or other major organs, can lead to fluctuations in blood pressure as the body responds to the infection.\n5. Nutritional deficiencies: Malnutrition, which can be a common problem for cancer patients, can contribute to fluctuations in blood pressure.\n\nIt is important to note that having a large belly and blood pressure fluctuations does not necessarily mean that the patient is close to dying. However, it is a concern that warrants further investigation by their healthcare team. Regular monitoring of their symptoms, blood pressure, and other vital signs is necessary to ensure that any potential complications are detected and addressed promptly. If you have concerns, I would encourage you to speak with their healthcare provider for more information. I understand that this is a difficult time, but being informed and prepared will likely be beneficial to you and the family."}

Please keep in mind that this information is not a substitute for professional medical advice.\n\nHepatomegaly is the enlargement of the liver, while splenomegaly refers to an enlarged spleen. Diffuse parenchymal liver disease is a catchall term for various conditions that cause inflammation and damage to the liver's parenchyma, i.e., the functional tissue part of the liver. This term includes conditions such as alcoholic liver disease, viral hepatitis, and nonalcoholic fatty liver disease.\n\nTreatment: However, given your diagnosis, I recommend seeking advice from a liver specialist or your healthcare team to better understand the underlying cause of your condition and the most appropriate treatment plan for you. The treatment options may include:\n\n1. Addressing the underlying cause, such as eliminating alcohol consumption, managing viral hepatitis with antiviral medications, and implementing lifestyle modifications for nonalcoholic fatty liver disease.\n2. Symptomatic relief, such as managing symptoms with medications to help with nausea, abdominal pain, and bloating.\n3. Supplementation of nutrients if you are experiencing malnutrition.\n4. Monitoring liver function regularly through blood tests.\n5. In severe cases, transjhepatic cholangiogram (TjCG) or liver biopsy may be necessary to evaluate the extent of the damage and potential for liver transplantation.\n\nProhibited foods: dietary restrictions for liver diseases depend on the underlying condition and individual symptoms. Here are some general guidelines:\n\n1. Avoid alcohol: Alcohol can worsen liver damage and contribute to the enlargement of the liver and spleen. While recovering from liver disease, it is recommended to avoid alcohol altogether.\n2. Avoid foods high in saturated and trans fats: Focus on a balanced diet that includes plenty of fruits, vegetables, whole grains, lean proteins, and healthy fats.\n3. Limit your intake of processed foods and added sugars: These foods can worsen inflammation and contribute to nonalcoholic fatty liver disease.\n4. Talk to your healthcare team about any other dietary restrictions or recommendations based on your specific condition.\n\nIt is essential to keep in touch with your healthcare team and advocate for yourself in the hospital setting to ensure that you receive the appropriate diagnostic tests, treatment, and medications to manage your condition effectively. You can also explore resources like patient advocacy organizations and insurance providers to help with accessing care and affordability."}

Wish him a good health & a speedy recovery.Let me know if I need to clarify further.Thanks & take care.", "ai": " I'm an AI language model and not a doctor, but I can try to help you understand some possible reasons why your son experienced another allergic reaction despite taking medication. Keep in mind that this is not medical advice and you should consult a healthcare professional for specific recommendations.\n\nAllergic reactions to foods, like capsicum and paneer, can be complex and unpredictable. The first reaction may trigger an immune response that can produce symptoms such as pain in the throat, difficulty swallowing, and continuous coughing. These symptoms are a result of an allergic inflammatory response. When you give your son medication, like Wysolone, Histac, and Effcoulin, it helps to reduce the symptoms by counteracting the allergic response.\n\nHowever, the medication may not completely eliminate the allergens from his system, especially if they were consumed in larger quantities or if they were eaten close together in time. In your son's case, it seems like a significant amount of capsicum and paneer was consumed in the first instance, leading to a strong allergic reaction. The second reaction might be due to the residual allergens still present in his system after the initial dose of medication.\n\nAlternatively, it's also possible for some individuals to have multiple foods that trigger allergic reactions. They might experience a reaction when consuming one food, and then another reaction when they're exposed to a different allergen shortly after. This can make it difficult to determine the exact cause of an allergic reaction.\n\nGiven this information, I would recommend the following steps:\n\n1. Consult with your doctor to discuss the previous allergic reaction and the recurring symptoms. They can provide you with professional medical advice based on your son's medical history.\n2. Consider keeping a food diary to better understand which specific foods trigger allergic reactions for your son. This can help identify patterns and potentially determine which foods should be avoided.\n3. Work with a healthcare professional or a registered dietitian to create a diet plan that minimizes the risk of allergic reactions while ensuring your son gets proper nutrients.\n4. Monitor your son's reaction to different foods and medications closely to identify any trends or changes. This can help you take appropriate action as soon as possible to manage any allergic symptoms.\n5. Always carry an emergency epinephrine auto-injector, as prescribed by your doctor, to help manage severe allergic reactions.\n\nRemember, these are general suggestions and might not apply to your specific case. Always consult with a healthcare professional for personalized medical advice."}

Certain foods, medications, infections, and other factors can cause hemolysis (red blood cell destruction) in people with G6PD deficiency.\n\nHere are some supplements and dietary recommendations:\n\n1. Folic acid: Folic acid helps support the production of new red blood cells in the body. Talk to your doctor about the appropriate dose for your child.\n\n2. Vitamin E: Vitamin E acts as an antioxidant and may help prevent hemolysis. Consult your doctor for the recommended dose.\n\n3. Vitamin C: Vitamin C has antioxidant properties and may help protect the red blood cells. However, excessive intake can cause oxidative stress, so it's essential to consult with a healthcare professional for the safe and appropriate dose.\n\n4.

Certain vegetables (such as spinach, parsley, and watercress) and fruits (such as mango, plums, and citrus fruits) that contain high amounts of nitrates\n5. Certain medications (such as antibiotics like sulfonamides and antimalarial drugs)\n\nIt's important to avoid these foods and medications, particularly while you are breastfeeding your son to prevent any adverse effects. Cooking these foods may reduce their potential risk, but it's best to consult your doctor for specific recommendations based on your son's case.\n\nLastly, there is no clear evidence that exposure to sunlight every morning directly benefits individuals with G6PD deficiency. While maintaining adequate vitamin D levels is essential, direct sunlight exposure does not have a proven effect on this condition beyond its role in vitamin D production.\n\nAs always, it's crucial to consult with your child's healthcare professional for personalized advice regarding dietary considerations, supplement recommendations, and other aspects related to managing G6PD deficiency."}

The body raises its temperature in an attempt to fight the infection. Loose motions, or diarrhea, can also be a symptom of various infections, including gastrointestinal infections.\n\nThe elevated white blood cell count in your nephew's blood tests is a sign of an active infection, as white blood cells help fight infections. However, it's important to note that other conditions can also cause an elevated white blood cell count.\n\nSepticemia can be a life-threatening condition, especially in young children and older adults, so it's essential that your nephew receives appropriate medical care. The doctor's diagnosis of septicemia based on his symptoms and lab results is a reasonable one, and the blood tests you mentioned support this diagnosis. I would strongly advise that you continue following the doctor's treatment plan and seek further consultation if necessary.\n\nThe specific cause of your nephew's septicemia may be determined through further tests, such as blood culture or bone marrow aspiration. The doctor may also consider testing for specific types of bacterial infections if there are suspected sources, such as urinary tract or respiratory infections.\n\nIn the meantime, it may be helpful to ensure that your nephew is getting plenty of fluids to prevent dehydration due to fever and diarrhea. If your nephew is unable to tolerate oral fluids, your doctor may recommend intravenous fluids. The doctor may also prescribe antibiotics to help treat the infection. It's essential to follow the doctor's instructions carefully and report any concerns promptly.\n\nAgain, I am not a doctor, and this information is intended to provide you with a general understanding of the symptoms and possible causes. If you have any specific concerns or questions, you should consult your healthcare professional for advice tailored to your nephew's particular situation."}
{"question": "What is the cause for child like behavior by a adult? Could it be motor neuron disease?Hi my sister is not well ,she is very confused and gone back to being like a child.she is getting lots of tests and they thought it was a brain tumour but rulled it out ,now they say she has very little sugar in her system and ar testing her for motor nuron desease", "human": "Hi,Any brain pathology involving the frontal lobes of the brain can lead to regressive behavior in which an adult may behave like a child. That is why, her doctors are doing so many tests to find the cause for the pathology. Such behavior is not very common in motor neuron disease, which is typically characterized by muscle weakness, spasms, pain and difficulty in making movements. Regressed behavior can also be due to some psychiatric disorders, though I am sure her doctor must have already assessed her for the same and ruled them out.Best wishes.", "ai": " While it's not uncommon for adults to display childlike behavior under certain circumstances, such as stress, anxiety, or dementia, it's important to note that I'm an AI language model and not a doctor, so I can't diagnose medical conditions. However, I can share some information about the conditions you mentioned.\n\nChildlike behavior in an adult can be caused by various conditions, including developmental disorders, neurological diseases, mental health issues, and substance abuse. Motor neuron diseases (MND), also known as motor neuron disorders, are a group of progressive neurological disorders that affect the motor neurons in the brain and spinal cord. These neurons are responsible for controlling voluntary muscle movements, so when they break down, muscles begin to weaken, waste away, or become paralyzed.\n\nSigns and symptoms of MND include muscle weakness, atrophy, and wasting, especially in the arms and legs. Speech, swallowing, and breathing difficulties may also develop over time. However, childlike behavior is not a symptom typically associated with MND. If your sister is experiencing confusion and regression to childlike behavior, it might be worth discussing this with her healthcare team to rule out other potential causes, such as brain injury, infection, dementia, or other neurological conditions. They may consider further testing, such as cognitive assessments, brain imaging, or blood tests, to help determine the cause."}

It's essential to consult with your healthcare provider for personalized advice.\n\n1. Dermatomyositis: People with dermatomyositis or other weakened immune systems should not come in close contact with children for 4 weeks after their OPV dose due to the possibility of shedding the live polio virus in their stool. So, during this period, try to maintain a safe distance from your granddaughter after her vaccination.\n\n2. Breastfeeding: If you are breastfeeding your granddaughter, it is generally considered safe to continue doing so after she receives the OPV. The amount of the virus that is passed through breast milk is extremely low and should not pose a risk to a healthy adult.\n\n3. Close contact: People at higher risk of exposure to the OPV virus, such as babies, pregnant women, or those with weakened immune systems, should avoid close contact with anyone for four weeks after they have received the vaccine. It's a good idea to inform your family members, friends, and caregivers about this precaution so they can plan accordingly.\n\n4. Hygiene: Maintain good hygiene practices, such as washing your hands regularly with soap and water, especially after using the bathroom or changing diapers, to reduce the risk of spreading the virus.\n\n5. Inform others: Let your family members, friends, and healthcare professionals know about your condition and the importance of avoiding contact with your granddaughter for four weeks after her vaccination.\n\nRemember, these suggestions are not comprehensive medical advice, and you should always consult with a healthcare professional for personalized guidance related to your specific situation."}

However, loose stools, irritation, cold and cough are not typically associated with teething. Teething usually causes symptoms such as drooling, biting or chewing toys, gum swelling, and mild irritability. If your baby has a persistent green stool along with loose stools, irritation, cold and cough, it would be best to consult with your pediatrician to rule out any potential infections or other underlying medical conditions. Your doctor may recommend a physical examination, blood tests, or stool tests to determine the cause of your baby's symptoms.

If edema present diuretic given TIPSS and Liver transplantation are some modality Regular exercise done So don't be panic,  avoid stress and consult gastroenterologist for examination Take care", "ai": " I cannot definitively answer your question without consulting medical records or speaking directly with your healthcare provider. However, I can share some information that might help.\n\nAlcoholic cirrhosis is a condition in which the liver becomes damaged and scarred due to excessive alcohol consumption. Marijuana and smoking, specifically tobacco, can negatively impact liver health in various ways.\n\nMarijuana contains several compounds, including THC (tetrahydrocannabinol) and CBD (cannabidiol), which can affect the liver. Chronic use of marijuana might lead to an increase in liver enzymes, indicating liver damage. However, the evidence regarding the long-term impact of marijuana on the liver in individuals with pre-existing liver conditions like alcoholic cirrhosis is limited and inconsistent. Some studies suggest that marijuana use might even have potential therapeutic properties in liver disease, such as reducing inflammation and promoting regeneration.\n\nTobacco smoking is a known risk factor for liver disease, especially in combination with heavy alcohol consumption. Smoking can cause oxidative stress, inflammation, and damage to the liver. Moreover, smokers have a higher risk of developing alcoholic cirrhosis and alcoholic hepatitis.\n\nGiven your diagnosis of alcoholic cirrhosis and pre-existing health concerns, it's essential to be cautious about introducing new substances into your body. While marijuana might help with your sleeping, eating, and anxiety issues, the potential risks and long-term effects on your liver are unclear.\n\nI strongly recommend consulting your healthcare provider before using marijuana or continuing to smoke. They can provide you with accurate information based on your medical history and current condition. They may also recommend alternative treatments for your symptoms, such as medication or behavioral therapy.\n\nIf you're struggling with alcohol, it may be helpful to talk to your healthcare provider or seek support groups such as Alcoholics Anonymous. These resources can help you manage your alcohol consumption and provide the necessary tools to live a healthier lifestyle.\n\nIn summary, there is limited evidence regarding the effects of marijuana on liver health in individuals with alcoholic cirrhosis. Smoking tobacco, on the other hand, is a well-established risk factor for liver damage and should be avoided. Consult your healthcare provider for personalized recommendations and alternatives to help manage your symptoms."}

Let me know if I can assist you further. Regards,Dr. R.G. Joshi, Dermatologist", "ai": "Based on the description provided, it's difficult to definitively diagnose the condition without seeing the child in person. However, I can suggest some possible causes for the itchy rash on the knees, elbows, hands, feet, and face. These may include:\n\n1. Allergic reactions: Hives (urticaria) can present with itchy red rashes that come and go in different places. Although they typically do not leave a ring-like appearance, the rapid itching and appearance of new rashes in different areas can make it seem like multiple episodes of ringworm. The rashes on the face may be more suggestive of allergic contact dermatitis or other facial eczemas. If the rashes persist or worsen, or if the child has a known allergy, consider seeking medical advice.\n\n2. Atopic dermatitis (eczema): This chronic inflammatory condition can present with itchy red rashes in the flexural areas, including behind the knees, elbows, and hands, and on the face. The rashes may be scaly, weepy, or crusty and can have red, purple, or brownish discoloration. Atopic dermatitis often runs in families and can be associated with asthma, hay fever, or food allergies.\n\n3. Viral infections: The child could have a viral infection such as fifth disease, which presents with a red slapped-cheek rash and a rash with a lace-like or lacelike appearance on the body, arms, and legs. The rash typically goes away on its own after a few days. The itchiness and presence of rashes on various body parts may be due to this infection.\n\n4. Dermatitis herpetiformis (Duhring's disease): This is a chronic, itchy rash that usually occurs on the elbows, knees, and buttocks in people with celiac disease. The rash consists of raised, blister-like bumps or papules, which may burst and crust over. It does not usually affect the face or hands.\n\n5. Infestations: In cases where hives or other rashes are not definitively diagnosed, it's important to consider the possibility of infestations, such as scabies or pinworms. Although these conditions do not cause hives, they can cause itchiness and rashes on various body parts, including the knees, elbows, hands, feet, and face.\n\nTo determine the exact cause, consider keeping a detailed diary of the rash's appearance, duration, and any triggers (e.g., foods, environmental factors, or contact with potential allergens). If concerned, consult a healthcare professional for an accurate diagnosis and appropriate treatment options."}

However, other conditions, such as a herniated disc or spinal stenosis, could also cause similar symptoms.\n\nRenal colic is a severe pain that occurs when a kidney stone moves in the urinary tract. The pain is often described as crampy, sharp, or waves of intense pain, and it can radiate to the lower abdomen, groin, or even the testicle in males. The frequent urination experienced in this case is likely due to the pressure of the stone on the ureter, causing discomfort and the urge to urinate.\n\nThe sudden onset of back pain with twisting motions of the waist could also indicate a herniated disc in the spine.Disc herniation can cause back pain, sciatica, and other symptoms depending on the location and the extent of the herniation.\n\nBoth kidney stones and herniated discs require medical evaluation, particularly given the age and health status of the patient. Diagnostic tests such as a CT scan, ultrasound, or MRI may be needed to determine the underlying cause of the symptoms. Treatment options may include pain relief medications, hydration, and in some cases, surgical intervention.\n\nIt is essential for an individual experiencing these symptoms to seek medical attention promptly, as delaying treatment could lead to complications or worsening of the condition.\n\nOther factors that may need to be considered during the evaluation include any history of urinary tract infections, previous kidney stones, any medical conditions such as diabetes or high blood pressure, or a history of heavy lifting or repetitive motion that could contribute to a herniated disc."}

Regards,Dr. Matt Wachsman, Addiction Medicine Specialist", "ai": " Based on the information provided, it is difficult to determine a definitive cause for your symptoms of soreness, tiredness, and pain all over the body. Here are some possible explanations that may contribute to your symptoms:\n\n1. Chronic Fatigue Syndrome (CFS): This condition is characterized by persistent fatigue that does not improve with rest. Other symptoms may include muscles and joint pain, memory and concentration problems, and unrefreshing sleep. While there is no known cause for CFS, some researchers believe it may be related to viral infections, immune system dysfunction, or hormonal imbalances.\n2. Fibromyalgia: This condition is characterized by widespread pain and tenderness in the muscles and ligaments, often accompanied by fatigue, sleep disturbances, and other symptoms. The cause of fibromyalgia is unknown, but it may involve abnormalities in the way the body processes pain.\n3. Hypothyroidism: Thyroid hormones play a crucial role in regulating metabolism, energy production, and muscle function. Low levels of thyroid hormones can lead to fatigue, muscle weakness, and joint pain. Your doctor can check thyroid function by testing your thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH) and thyroid hormone levels.\n4. Anemia: This condition occurs when your body does not have enough red blood cells to carry oxygen to your tissues. Symptoms of anemia can include fatigue, weakness, and muscle aches. Your doctor can check for anemia by testing your blood for hemoglobin and hematocrit levels.\n5. Depression: Depression can cause feelings of tiredness, lack of energy, and muscle aches. If you are experiencing other symptoms of depression, such as sadness, hopelessness, or loss of interest in activities, it is important to talk to your doctor.\n6. Poor Sleep: Lack of adequate sleep can lead to fatigue, muscle aches, and joint pain. Ensure that you are getting enough sleep each night, and try to establish good sleep hygiene habits, such as avoiding electronics before bed and maintaining a consistent sleep schedule.\n7. Dehydration: Even if you are drinking lots of water, you may still be dehydrated, particularly if you are sweating a lot or urinating frequently. Make sure that you are consuming enough fluids to maintain proper hydration levels.\n8. Inactivity: Lack of physical activity can weakened muscles and joints, leading to soreness and fatigue. Aim for at least 150 minutes of moderate-intensity or 75 minutes of vigorous-intensity aerobic activity each week, and incorporate strength training exercises at least two days per week.\n\nIt is important to speak with your doctor if your symptoms persist despite making lifestyle changes. They may recommend further testing or refer you to a specialist for additional evaluation."}

This could be an injury to the ankle or foot, such as a sprain, strain, or contusion, which has led to swelling, redness, and warmth at the site of impact.\n\nHere are some suggestions that may help alleviate your discomfort and speed up the healing process:\n\n1. Rest and Ice: The first step in dealing with any injury is to rest the affected area and apply ice to reduce swelling and inflammation. Use an ice pack wrapped in a towel and apply it to the affected area for 15-20 minutes at a time, several times a day. Do not apply ice directly to the skin.\n2. Compression: Wrap the affected ankle and foot with a compression bandage to help reduce swelling and provide support. Be sure not to wrap it too tightly, as this can restrict blood flow.\n3. Elevation: attempt to keep the affected foot elevated above heart level as much as possible, especially when sitting or lying down. This can help reduce swelling and promote healing.\n4. Pain Relief: Over-the-counter pain relievers such as acetaminophen or ibuprofen can help manage pain and reduce inflammation. Be sure to follow the recommended dosage on the packaging.\n5. Gentle Exercise: Once the swelling has subsided and the pain has lessened, perform gentle exercises to regain movement and strength in the ankle and foot. These could include ankle flexion and extension, toe curls, and toe walks.\n6. Proper Footwear: Wear comfortable and supportive footwear to help the injured area heal properly. Avoid wearing shoes that put additional pressure on the affected area, such as high heels or stiff-soled shoes.\n\nIt's essential that you see a healthcare professional if your symptoms do not improve after a few days or if they worsen. This could be a sign of a more serious injury that may require further treatment."}

Why would a patient with esophageal cancer have a feeding tube inserted surgically into the duodenum and not into the stomach?", "human": "Hi,thanks for query.Depending upon the extent of spread of cancer the things are decided.If the growth of cancer is extending beyond stomach this must have planned.The idea of inserting tube is to make sure that the patient gets proper nutrition and his general condition remains good to support the treatment.wishing you good health.", "ai": " A feeding tube inserted into the duodenum (a procedure known as a duodeno-gastrostomy or jejunostomy with a long tube passing through the pylorus into the duodenum) may be considered in patients with esophageal cancer who are unable to swallow safely or tolerate enteral nutrition through the mouth due to obstructive symptoms or other complications. This approach can provide adequate nutritional support by bypassing the obstructed segment of the esophagus and stomach and delivering nutrients directly into the small intestine.\n\nEsophageal cancer can extend into the upper part of the stomach (known as the cardia), which may prevent the placement of a gastric feeding tube. In addition, since the stomach empties more slowly than the small intestine, using a gastric tube can increase the risk of aspiration and prolong the time needed for the stomach to empty, which can lead to discomfort and potentially worsen the symptomatology in patients with obstructive esophageal cancer. Inserting a feeding tube into the duodenum can reduce the risk of malpositioning or accidental dislodgement compared to a gastric tube. However, due to individual variability, it ultimately depends on the anatomical location and extent of the cancer and the specific needs and conditions of the patient. Consulting with a healthcare professional experienced in managing esophageal cancer and its complications can provide more personalized information."}

It is common to experience spotting or light bleeding after taking emergency contraception pills like Plan B, especially if they were taken close to the time of ovulation. The spotting can be due to the hormonal effect of the pills on the uterine lining.\n\nHowever, only a healthcare professional can definitively determine whether or not you are pregnant based on your symptoms and a medical examination. If you are concerned about your symptoms or have any uncertainty about your pregnancy status, I would recommend contacting your healthcare provider for advice. They can evaluate your symptoms and perform any necessary medical tests to determine the cause. Additionally, you can also take a home pregnancy test if you prefer, but keep in mind that the results may not be 100% accurate.\n\nIn any case, it is important to remember that experiencing spotting or light bleeding after taking Plan B does not mean that you are necessarily pregnant. However, only a healthcare provider can provide a definitive answer."}
{"question": "Applying vaseline for reddishness around penis for years. Should I be worried?I have been having reddishness around my penis for the past 2-3 years. My urologist has suggested applying   Vaseline around it. I see the reddishness sometimes less but it has not gone completely. No other symptoms, no pain. Is this something I need not worry about.", "human": "HIThank for asking to HCMI really appreciate your concern the redness that you are seeing might not be due to any disease or skin lesion but this could be a natural appearance, that does not need any treatment in my opinion the Vaseline, should be stop this is not the medicine, just leave it like that only, when it is not associated with any other symptoms then why to tampered it, stop worrying about this, hope this information helps you take care and have nice day.", "ai": " I am not a doctor, but I can provide you with some general information that may help you understand the situation better. It is important to note that I cannot diagnose or recommend a course of action based on the information you have provided.\n\nRedness around the penis, also known as balanitis or penile inflammation, can have various causes, including yeast infections, sexually transmitted infections (STIs), allergies, or iriritation from using certain products, such as Vaseline.\n\nThe use of Vaseline to alleviate the redness is a common recommendation for mild cases of balanitis, and it may help reduce irritation and keep the area moisturized. However, if the redness persists or worsens despite using Vaseline, it is important to follow up with your urologist or consult a dermatologist for further evaluation. The underlying cause of the redness needs to be identified and treated appropriately.\n\nThere are several potential risks associated with using Vaseline, including increased risk of urinary tract infections and problems with the foreskin, particularly in uncircumcised men. In some cases, prolonged use of Vaseline may lead to a condition called balanitis xerotica obliterans, characterized by an inflamed, thickened, and painful penis. However, it is important to note that this condition is relatively rare, and it is uncertain whether the use of Vaseline is a direct cause.\n\nIf you are concerned about the redness and the use of Vaseline, I would suggest discussing these concerns with your urologist or a dermatologist. They can provide you with more accurate information based on your individual case.\n\nIn summary, while applying Vaseline for the redness around your penis may bring some relief, it is important to investigate the underlying cause of the condition and consider other treatment options if the redness persists despite using Vaseline. Regular follow-up with your healthcare provider is also recommended to ensure adequate monitoring and prompt treatment if necessary."}

{"question": "What are the chances of pregnancy in HBV negative wife & HBV positive husband?I have been TTC from past 1.5 years. The blood test resulted all normal for me and for my husband, it is Hepatitis - B positive. Will this is the cause for not getting conceived (Wife being HBV - negative and Husband being HBV - positive) ? What is the solution if we want to conceive?", "human": "Hi, Hepatitis B positivity doesn't have any effect on conceiving. What you can do is to go for a IUI with washed sperms because chances of transmission of hepatitis B is high by normal intercourse. Also get yourself evaluated at intervals for hepatitis B. You can try ovulation induction in which you will receive medicines for growth of your eggs and when egg matures, injection will be given for rupture and IUI will be done that means after processing semen of your husband it will be directly put into your uterus.Hope I have answered your query. Let me know if I can assist you further. Regards,Dr. Khushboo Priya", "ai": " The presence of Hepatitis B virus (HBV) in the blood of one partner does not necessarily increase the risk of pregnancy complications or infertility for an HBV-negative partner. Hepatitis B is a viral infection that primarily affects the liver, and there is no evidence to suggest that it directly interferes with the reproductive system or fertility.\n\nHowever, there are certain scenarios where additional precautions may be considered to ensure the safety and health of the HBV-negative partner and the future baby:\n\n1. Prevention of transmission: Although the risk of transmission from an HBV-positive husband to an HBV-negative wife during sexual intercourse is low (estimated at about 0.1%-2% per act), it's still essential to practice additional precautions. Using barrier methods such as condoms can help reduce the risk further.\n\n2. Antiviral therapy: The husband can consider antiviral therapy to reduce the viral load in his blood, which may decrease the risk of transmission.\n\n3. Vaccination: If the wife has not already been vaccinated against HBV, she should consider getting vaccinated to build immunity and protect herself from potential exposure during pregnancy or delivery.\n\nRegarding your current struggles with conception, there could be various reasons. It's essential to consider other factors, such as age (both yours and your husband's), lifestyle choices (such as smoking or alcohol consumption), underlying medical conditions, and potential fertility issues. You may wish to discuss these possibilities with your healthcare provider or a fertility specialist, who can help you determine if further testing or treatments (such as intrauterine insemination or in vitro fertilization) may be necessary. However, based on the information provided, HBV status should not be the primary concern."}

Ejection fraction (EF) is a measurement of the percentage of blood that is pumped out of the left ventricle of the heart with each heartbeat. A normal ejection fraction range is generally considered to be between 50% and 70%. An EF of 40% is considered to be below the normal range and may increase the risk of heart problems.\n\nHowever, the decision to avoid amusement park rides should be based on your overall cardiac health and your healthcare provider's recommendations. If you have any symptoms of cardiac distress or have been advised by your healthcare provider to avoid physical exertion, it would be safest to avoid amusement park rides. If you are unsure, you should speak with your healthcare provider to discuss your specific situation and any concerns you may have.

{"question": "What is osteophytic lipping?Hello Dr. What is Osteophetic Lipping? I have been diagnosed to have osteophyetic lipping, and have been suggested to have surgery on my feet. Is it worth having this surgery? My work involves standing over 9hrs a day on my feet and I used to walk a lot, but always in flat sensible shoes. I have a lot of pain in my feet, and cannot do much walking, but job involves standing a lot. Would you kindly advise me on this. Regards Rochan", "human": "Hi dear this just means that your joint pain cause is arthritis, this lipping is nothing but eburnations of bone around joint , formed due to degenerating cartilage, if your symptoms are worrying you please go for surgery as advised by your doctor.", "ai": " Osteophytes, also known as bone spurs, are bony growths that can form along the edges of bones in response to degenerative changes or inflammation in the joints. Osteophytic lipping specifically refers to the formation of these bony protrusions along the edges of the bones in the feet, particularly along the edges of the phalanges (the bones of the toes) or metatarsals (the long bones of the feet).\n\nThe growth of osteophytes can result from various conditions, including osteoarthritis, rheumatoid arthritis, psoriatic arthritis, and other joint diseases. These conditions can cause pain, swelling, and stiffness in the feet, making it difficult to stand for long periods or walk comfortably.\n\nAs for whether surgery is worth considering for osteophyetic lipping, it ultimately depends on the severity of your symptoms and how they are impacting your ability to function in your daily life. Surgery for osteophytes in the feet is typically considered when conservative treatments such as pain medication, physical therapy, or shoe modifications have not provided adequate relief.\n\nThe specific type of surgery recommended for osteophyetic lipping would depend on the location and extent of the bone growth. Common surgical procedures for this condition include cheilectomy, which involves removing the bone spur and adjacent tissue, and arthrodesis, which involves fusing the affected joint.\n\nIt's important to note that surgery comes with risks and potential complications, including infection, scarring, and the possibility of worsening symptoms or developing new complications. Additionally, recovery time can be significant, and it may be several weeks before you can return to work or resume your normal activities.\n\nGiven your work requirements and your history of walking, I would recommend discussing the potential risks and benefits of surgery with your healthcare provider. They can help you weigh the benefits of relief from pain and improved mobility against the risks and potential complications, and help you explore other treatment options that may be suitable for your needs.\n\nIn the meantime, some simple modifications to your work environment and clothing may help alleviate some of the pain and discomfort you are experiencing. For example, you might consider wearing cushioned shoes with good arch support, using footrests or anti-fatigue mats to reduce the amount of standing you need to do, and taking frequent breaks to rest and stretch your feet.\n\nI hope this information is helpful. Let me know if you have any further questions."}

I have heard of some women taking soy isoflavones vitamins with metformin and it helping them get pregnant. Is this true and is it safe for me to try this? I have been trying to concieve for 5 years now.", "human": "Hallow Dear, In Polycystic Ovarian syndrome, the main disorders are infertility due to failure to release eggs (ovulation) as a result of dysfunction in reproductory hormones, raised insulin levels and raised androgens. Metformin helps bring down the levels of Insulin. It acts as a good adjuvant to the medicines used for induction of ovulation. The success of only Metformin for the treatment of anovulatory infertility is questionable. According to some scientists, Myo inositol brings down the levels of Insulin as well as androgens and hence is more effective in the treatment of infertility due to PCOS. For induction of ovulation, Clomiphene citrate may be tried for 6 cycles (along with Metformin or Myo inositol). If it fails, HMG/hCG combination may be tried. PCOS is characterised by obesity. Please calculate your BMI. You should maintain your BMI between 18 and 23.9 by reducing weight by apt diet and exercises. Soy isoflavones are supposed to improve general health as well as the quality of the eggs, increasing the possibility of successful pregnancy. They are quite safe in your treatment. I hope this will help you to seek for a comprehensive management of PCOS. Please report to your Infertility consultant. Dr. Nishikant Shrotri", "ai": " I cannot definitively answer whether taking soy isoflavones vitamins along with metformin is safe for you while trying to get pregnant, as I am an AI language model and not a medical doctor. I can, however, share some information that may help you make an informed decision.\n\nSoy isoflavones are a type of phytoestrogen, which is a plant compound that can act like the hormone estrogen in the body. Metformin is a medication used to treat insulin resistance and type 2 diabetes, including polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS).\n\nThere are some preclinical and limited human studies suggesting that soy isoflavones may improve ovulation and fertility in women with PCOS. However, these studies are not definitive, and more research is needed to confirm these findings.\n\nRegarding safety, there are mixed opinions about combining soy isoflavones and metformin. Some studies suggest that soy isoflavones may increase the absorption or effectiveness of metformin, while others suggest that they may interfere with it.\n\nIt's essential to discuss your specific situation with your healthcare provider before starting any new supplements or making changes to your medication regimen. They can provide you with personalized advice based on your medical history and current medications. It's particularly important to consult with your provider if you have PCOS and are trying to conceive, as this condition can increase the risk of certain complications during pregnancy.\n\nIf your provider gives you the green light to try soy isoflavones alongside metformin, make sure to choose a reputable brand and take the recommended dose. It's also essential to consult the product label for any potential drug interactions, as some soy isoflavone supplements may contain other herbs or ingredients that could impact your fertility treatments or medications.\n\nIt's essential to remember that each body responds differently to medications and supplements, and what works for some may not work for others. It's crucial to stay patient and stay in close communication with your healthcare provider throughout your fertility journey."}

So my humble request to please consider for local oncologist visit.", "ai": " I'm an AI language model and not a doctor, but I can try to provide you with some general information about glioblastoma and its treatment. I'm deeply sorry to hear about your loved one's diagnosis and current situation.\n\nGlioblastoma is an aggressive type of brain cancer with a high rate of recurrence, even after initial treatment. According to the American Cancer Society, the five-year relative survival rate for people diagnosed with glioblastoma between 2010-2016 was only about 5%. This means that only 5% of people were alive six years after their diagnosis.\n\nTreatment for glioblastoma typically includes surgery, followed by radiation therapy and chemotherapy. However, as you mentioned, the patient's tumor has stopped responding to chemotherapy. This is not an uncommon occurrence in glioblastoma, as the tumors can develop resistance to treatments over time. In such cases, healthcare providers may explore other therapies, such as clinical trials or supportive care.\n\nThe decision to continue or discontinue treatment depends on the circumstances of each patient, including their overall health, response to previous treatments, and personal preferences. If you have further questions or concerns, it is essential to consult the patient's healthcare team for accurate and reliable information.

Cereal, including rice and baby cereals like Cerealac, is an important part of a balanced diet for a toddler. However, it should not be the sole source of nutrition. A 2-year-old requires a variety of nutrients from different food groups to support their growth and development. Fruits, vegetables, proteins, and healthy fats are essential for a toddler's health.\n\nIf your child is refusing other foods, you may try offering them in different ways, such as mixing fruits and vegetables with Cerealac or serving them as finger foods. You could also introduce new textures and flavors gradually and consistently to help expand their palate. If you are concerned about your child's nutritional intake or growth, I would recommend consulting a pediatrician or a registered dietitian for personalized advice related to your child's specific needs.

Make sure that you include every minute details possible. Hope this answers your query. Available for further clarifications.Good luck.", "ai": " It is normal for penises to grow throughout adolescence and into young adulthood. The size of your penis when erect at 15 years old is within the normal range for your age. Losing body fat may make the penis appear longer when flaccid by reducing the amount of overhanging skin and fat pad. However, it is important to note that the size of your penis when erect is largely determined by genetics and cannot be significantly altered through weight loss or other means.\n\nAs for your question about the most likely final size of your penis, it is difficult to make an accurate prediction. Every individual develops differently, and some people may continue to experience growth into their late teens or even early twenties. On average, men tend to reach their maximum penis size by the age of 18 or 19. However, it is important to remember that there is a normal range of penis size, and what matters most is not the size itself, but how it affects your self-confidence and your relationships. Ultimately, focus on maintaining a healthy lifestyle, including a balanced diet and regular exercise, to promote overall health and wellbeing."}

However, I strongly recommend consulting your pediatrician before trying any home remedies, especially for acne and hair growth concerns, as they can assess your baby's condition and provide appropriate recommendations based on their expertise.\n\nNewborn Acne:\n1. Warm compress: Apply a warm compress to the affected area for a few minutes to help open the pores and release any impurities. Be careful not to make the water too hot, as it can burn your baby's delicate skin.\n2. Mild cleansing: Gently clean your baby's face with a warm, wet washcloth and a gentle fragrance-free baby cleanser. Avoid soap or harsh cleansers as they can dry out the skin and make acne worse. Pat the area dry with a soft towel.\n3. Avoid rubbing: Avoid rubbing or scrubbing the affected area, as this can irritate the skin and make the acne worse.\n\nHome Remedy for Excessive Hair Growth:\n1. Tweezing: Carefully pluck the hairs one at a time using a clean pair of tweezers or a sterilized toothpick. Make sure your hands are clean and wash the area before and after tweezing to prevent any infection.\n2. Shaving: You can also use a clean, new razor and shaving cream to gently shave the area. However, it's best to consult your pediatrician first, as some doctors may not recommend shaving for newborns due to the risk of injury.\n3. Use a hair remover: You can also consider using a hair removal cream specifically designed for infants. Follow the instructions carefully and perform a patch test to ensure there is no adverse reaction before applying it to a larger area.\n4.

Below are some potential causes, but it's essential to remember that only a thorough medical evaluation by a healthcare professional can provide an accurate diagnosis:\n\n1. Post-procedural complications: Although your cardiologist may have thought the pain was unrelated to the ASD closure, it's worth considering the possibility that the procedure caused some damage to the surrounding tissue or organs, such as the diaphragm, ribs, or nerves. This could lead to chronic pain.\n2. Diaphragmatic irritation: The diaphragm, a large muscle used for breathing, is situated right below the ribs. During the ASD closure procedure, the catheter or wires used to seal the ASD might have touched the diaphragm, causing irritation or injury. This can result in chronic pain and discomfort.\n3. Pericarditis: Pericarditis is an inflammation of the sac surrounding the heart. It can cause chest pain, particularly when taking deep breaths or coughing, and may also be felt near the last rib. This condition can be a complication of cardiac procedures or can develop as a result of various other factors; however, it's a less common cause of chronic pain after ASD closure.\n4. Other underlying conditions: It's essential to consider other potential causes of chronic pain near the last rib, such as gastrointestinal issues, muscle strains, or rib injuries. These conditions are unrelated to the ASD closure procedure and should be evaluated separately.\n\nIf you are experiencing chronic pain following your ASD closure procedure, it's essential to discuss this with your healthcare provider.

However, it's important that you consult a healthcare professional for an accurate diagnosis.\n\nThe lumps on your son's head that itch and don't have any accompanying bite marks or scabs could be caused by several conditions. Here are a few possibilities:\n\n1. Allergic Reactions: Allergic reactions to food, insect bites, or environmental factors such as pollen can cause itchy lumps or hives on the head.\n2. Infections: Bacterial or fungal infections, such as cellulitis or ringworm, can cause lumps on the head that do not have any visible bite marks or scabs.\n3. Vascular Anomalies: Lumps or growths on the head can be caused by vascular anomalies, such as hemangiomas or blood vessel malformations.\n4. Hidradenitis Suppurativa: This is a chronic inflammatory disease that can cause painful lumps and bumps under the arms or in other areas where there are many sweat glands.\n5. Infestations: Parasitic infestations, such as scabies or lice, can cause itchy bumps on the head.\n\nIt's important to note that your son's recent history of having had hand, foot, and mouth disease (hfam) does not appear to be directly related to the lumps on his head, as hfam is a viral infection that generally causes symptoms such as fever, sore throat, and painful blisters on the hands and feet. However, if there is a possibility that your son may have been re-exposed to an allergen or infection that he encountered during that time, it could be worth considering.\n\nGiven the concerning size and number of the lumps, as well as their location and the itching, it's important that you have your son evaluated by a healthcare professional as soon as possible to rule out any serious underlying conditions. Your doctor may perform a physical examination, ask about your son's medical history, and order any necessary tests to help determine the cause of the lumps. In the meantime, you can try to keep your son's head clean and free of irritants, and apply a cool compress to help relieve any itching or discomfort."}

If the above situation happens at three or four places on his body simultaneously by an HIV-infected mosquito, what is the possibility of HIV transmission by this method?", "human": "Hi. It is good that you have an interest in HIV transmission. Hope your query is answered, but if you have any other question, please do not hesitate to ask or call anytime. For more information consult an HIV AIDS specialist online --> https://icliniq.com./ask-a-doctor-online/HIV-AIDS-specialist", "ai": " I understand your concern, but I must clarify that I'm an AI language model and not a doctor. However, I can share some information on this topic based on scientific consensus.\n\nHIV (Human Immunodeficiency Virus) is a retrovirus that primarily spreads through direct contact with infected body fluids, such as blood, semen, vaginal fluids, and breast milk. Mosquitoes do not transmit HIV.\n\nThe misconception arises from the fact that some people believe that HIV can survive in insects or be transmitted through mosquito bites, similar to other diseases like malaria and Zika. However, scientific research has repeatedly shown that HIV cannot replicate in insects, including mosquitoes.\n\nConsequently, the scenario you describe, where a mosquito bites an HIV-infected person with a high viral load and then bites an uninfected person at multiple sites, is highly unlikely to result in HIV transmission. The virus would not survive in the mosquito, and even if some HIV particles were present in the mosquito's saliva, the risk of transmission through a mosquito bite is negligible.\n\nIn summary, mosquitoes do not transmit HIV, and the virus is not known to survive in insects. Therefore, there is no risk of HIV transmission via mosquitoes, regardless of the circumstances you've described."}

The painful lump on the bottom of your tongue that you can feel from the top, which is also associated with a sore throat, could be a number of things. Here are some of the most common possibilities:\n\n1. Oral Thrush: Oral thrush is a fungal infection that can cause white or yellowish patches in the mouth and throat. It can also lead to painful red lumps or sore spots, particularly on the tongue and inner cheeks. The infection can make swallowing difficult, which may cause a sore throat.\n2. Trauma or injury: You may have accidentally bitten or burnt the bottom of your tongue, leading to a painful lump and sore throat. This can be caused by eating hard or sharp foods, using dental appliances, or even by biting your tongue while speaking or chewing.\n3. Tonsillitis: Inflammation of the tonsils, which are located at the back of the throat, can cause pain and swelling in the affected area. This can make swallowing difficult and lead to a sore throat, as well as making it uncomfortable to move the tongue around in the mouth.\n4. Cancer: While it's less likely, a persistent painful lump on the tongue with a sore throat could signify a more serious condition such as tongue cancer. However, this is a rare cause and it's more likely that the symptoms you're experiencing are due to one of the more common conditions mentioned above.\n\nIf you're concerned about your symptoms, I would recommend consulting a healthcare professional for a proper diagnosis and treatment recommendations. In the meantime, try drinking plenty of fluids to help soothe your sore throat and avoid irritating foods that may aggravate the painful lump on your tongue."}

{"question": "What causes penis pain during intercourse?I am 50 years old and in reasonable health. I have recently started having pain associated with erection. The pain is located toward the base of the penis. It almost feels like it would if I were pressing down on an erect penis. I ve been looking around to see if this is normal for my age, but don t find anything mentioning pain associated with erectile dysfunction. Any ideas what this is all about?", "human": "Hi, Pain in the erected penis may be due to Peyronie's disease. It is characterized by development of scar tissue with in the penis. Other possible causes are like sickle cell anemia, balanitis or herpes zoster infection, etc. Lack of lubrication during intercourse also may be one of the reason. Use lubricants while intercourse. Use vitamin a capsules as early as possible. If symptoms not improved please consult your doctor he will examine and treat you accordingly. Hope I have answered your query. Let me know if I can assist you further.Regards,Dr. Penchila Prasad Kandikattu", "ai": " Penis pain during intercourse, especially when it's associated with erections and located at the base, can have various causes. While it's natural to wonder if this is a normal part of aging, it's essential to be aware that several conditions can cause such symptoms. Here are some possible causes:\n\n1. Erectile Dysfunction (ED) Medications: If you're taking ED medications, especially those in the PDE5 inhibitor class (e.g., sildenafil, tadalafil, vardenafil), you might experience pain, especially if you have an infection or injury in the genital area. This side effect is relatively uncommon but can occur.\n\n2. Peyronie's Disease: This condition causes scar tissue to develop in the penis, leading to penis curvature and pain during erection. It's more common in older adults.\n\n3. Priapism: Prolonged erections, which can be painful and even lead to penile damage, can occur due to various medical conditions, such as sickle cell disease, leukemia, and certain medications.\n\n4. Penile Fracture: Also known as a \" popped vein\" or \"torn penis,\" a penile fracture refers to the rupture of the penis's chambers. While this is a rare injury, it can cause significant pain, swelling, and bruising during and after intercourse.\n\n5. Venous Leaks: This condition, also called \"ischemic erectile dysfunction,\" is characterized by insufficient blood flow to the penis during erection. It can cause pain and discomfort during intercourse, especially toward the base of the penis.\n\n6. Infections: Several infections, such as urethritis, epididymitis, or prostatitis, can cause penis pain. These conditions are often accompanied by other symptoms, such as discharge, fever, or urinary symptoms.\n\n7. Nerve Damage: Conditions that damage the nerves supplying the penis, such as diabetes, multiple sclerosis, or spinal injuries, can lead to pain during intercourse.\n\n8. Trauma or Injury: Direct trauma, such as rough intercourse or forceful insertion, can cause pain, bruising, or swelling in the penis.\n\nIt's essential to consult a healthcare professional if you experience persistent or severe penis pain during intercourse. They can help diagnose the underlying cause and provide appropriate treatments to alleviate your symptoms."}

I read carefully your query and I understand your concerns.The trasmission pathways of HBV are via infected blood (e.g transfusion) or blood contamined equipments(unsterile needles e.g having a tattoo, piercing, or having dental procedures etc.) and infected body fluids (unprotected sex).Regarding the possible treatment of your child, I would strongly recommend to you to have prenatal care because in utero infection is uncommon, representing no more than 5 percent of perinatal HBV infections. With such a presentation on my clinic I would recommend Hepatitis B Vaccine - first dose of the vaccine series and Hepatitis B immunoglobulin (HBIG) - 1 or 2 dose to be given immediately in the delivery room (or within the first 12 hours of life), then there is more than a 95% chance that a newborn will avoid a chronic HBV infection.Hope I helped with my answer. Feel free to ask again if you have further concerns, I would be happy to answer you.Wishing you health,Dr. Ina", "ai": " Hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) is a protein produced in the body in response to a hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection. Here are some possible reasons why you may have been infected with HBV despite being vaccinated in childhood:\n\n1. Inadequate or incomplete vaccination series: The vaccination series for hepatitis B typically requires three doses for adequate protection. If you did not receive all three doses, or if the doses were not administered at the recommended intervals, you may not have developed a strong enough immune response to protect against the virus.\n2. Occurrence of the infection before vaccination: You may have been infected with HBV before you received the vaccination series. If this is the case, the infection may have occurred too early for the vaccines to provide protection.\n3. Breakdown of immunity: Immunity to HBV can wane over time, especially in individuals with weaker immune systems. This could be a factor if you have a condition that weakens your immune system, such as HIV or undergoing chemotherapy.\n4. Sexual transmission: HBV can be transmitted sexually, and even if you and your husband are monogamous, there is a possibility that you were infected through another partner before your current relationship.\n5. Needle sticks or other exposure: HBV can be transmitted through contact with infected blood or other bodily fluids, such as during medical procedures or through sharing needles.\n\nRegarding the potential impact on your child, if you are infectious at the time of delivery, there is a risk of transmitting the virus to your baby during birth. This can be mitigated by receiving antiviral treatment during pregnancy and giving your baby the first dose of the hepatitis B vaccine and hepatitis B immune globulin (HBIG) within 12 hours of birth. Your healthcare provider can provide more information on this.\n\nIt's important to discuss these concerns with your healthcare provider and ask for further guidance based on your specific situation. They can provide you with more accurate and personalized information."}

You should  go for follicular studies usg from 10 th day of cycle to rule out ovulation problem .If follicular studies reports are normal go for Hysterosalpingography  to check tubal patency .", "ai": " I'm an AI language model and cannot perform medical diagnoses, but I can provide some general information on this topic based on available research and common practices.\n\nOvulation predictor kits (OPKs) detect the presence of luteinizing hormone (LH) in your urine, which typically surges 24-36 hours before ovulation. If you've been using OPKs consistently and haven't detected any LH surge within the 12-19 day window, there are a few possibilities, including:\n\n1. Ovulation may occur outside of your testing window. The traditional 12-19 day window for testing is based on the average human menstrual cycle length of 28 days. However, not all women have a regular 28-day cycle, and ovulation can occur earlier or later than expected. You may want to consider tracking your basal body temperature (BBT) to identify the day of ovulation. BBT is an accurate method of detecting ovulation because of the temperature spike that occurs around ovulation.\n2. Luteal phase deficiency (LPD). This is a condition where the luteal phase (the second half of the menstrual cycle, from ovulation to the next menstruation) is too short to sustain a pregnancy. This can make it difficult to detect an LH surge because ovulation may occur before the testing window. In this case, you might want to consult with a fertility specialist, who can help determine if LPD is the cause and suggest treatments, such as hormonal therapies.\n3. Inaccurate OPKs may result in false negative results. High levels of estrogen in your urine can interfere with the accuracy of the test. A false negative can also occur if you haven't waited long enough after waking up, or you have used the test incorrectly.\n4. Factors such as stress and diet can also affect your menstrual cycle. In some cases, these factors can influence ovulation timing, leading to difficulties in detecting it through OPKs.\n5. Other medical conditions or fertility issues might be at play. A consultation with a fertility specialist can help identify if there are underlying causes preventing conception.\n\nYou mentioned that you have consulted with many doctors and all reports are fine. However, it may be worth consulting a fertility specialist if you have been trying for a year without success, particularly if you are experiencing difficulties detecting ovulation. They can help you understand your specific situation and explore potential causes and treatments. Keep in mind that fertility treatments, if needed, can require a considerable investment of time, resources, and emotional energy, so it is important to discuss any concerns you have with your healthcare provider thoroughly."}

The deep purple line you see in the control window is expected to appear if the test is functioning properly. However, the interpretation of a faint line in the test window is not definitive and can depend on the sensitivity of the particular brand of test used. Ideally, you should wait a few days and take another test to confirm the result. If your period is significantly late and you continue to experience symptoms such as breast tenderness, nausea, or fatigue, it is advisable to speak with your healthcare provider for further guidance. Keep in mind that experiencing irregular periods or missing a period does not always mean you are pregnant, and there could be other explanations for your symptoms, such as hormonal fluctuations or stress."}

Based on the information you have provided, it appears that your sister has been diagnosed with tuberculosis (TB) and has been undergoing treatment for over a year. She has been taking various anti-TB medications, including Akurense-4 and Akurense-5, and is currently taking Cinex and Combutol 1000.\n\nRegarding your question about the safety of taking Cinex and Combutol 1000 together for TB, both of these medications are commonly used in the treatment of tuberculosis. Cinex (inosine pranobex) is used to boost the immune system and improve the effectiveness of other TB medications. Combutol 1000 (ethambutol) is an anti-TB medication that is used to treat drug-susceptible TB. When used in combination with other anti-TB drugs, both of these medications are generally considered safe.\n\nHowever, it is important to note that your sister's recent Montoux test result being positive again suggests that her TB may not be responding to current treatment. This is a concerning development, and it may be necessary for her to undergo further testing to determine if she has developed drug-resistant TB. If this is the case, her treatment regimen may need to be changed to one that includes different medications.\n\nTherefore, I would strongly recommend that your sister consult with her healthcare provider as soon as possible to discuss the results of her Montoux test and to determine if any changes need to be made to her current treatment plan. It is important that she continues to take her medications as prescribed to reduce the risk of complications and to help ensure the best possible outcome."}

However, I can try to help you understand some possible causes based on the information you've provided.\n\nGiven that there's pain, difficulty moving the arm, and twitching, it could be signs of nerve damage or a contusion (bruise) involving the nerves. Nerves can be damaged during falls, even if there's no visible bruising or a broken bone. Commonly, this can be a radial nerve injury which controls the muscles in the thumb side of your forearm and wrist. These injuries, known as \"stinger\" or \"burner\" injuries, often occur when the shoulder is forced into an abnormal position or when direct pressure is applied to the nerve.\n\nHowever, it's essential to seek medical advice to get an accurate diagnosis and appropriate treatment. In the meantime, you can try to reduce the discomfort by immobilizing your arm with a sling or a splint. Avoid putting much strain on the affected arm by limiting heavy lifting, carrying heavy objects, and pushing or pulling with the injured side.\n\nPlease keep in mind that while this list provides potential explanations based on your symptoms, only a medical professional can provide an accurate diagnosis. If you are experiencing persistent pain, numbness, or weakness, it's crucial to consult your healthcare provider to ensure proper care and treatment.\n\nLastly, don't be too hard on yourself, and remember that accidents happen. Good luck with your recovery process."}

However, I can list some potential causes, both related and unrelated to the procedure, to help you understand the possibilities.\n\n1. Post-procedural discomfort/healing: Angioplasty can sometimes cause temporary discomfort or pressure in the head due to the catheterization procedure itself or due to the body's natural healing process. Swelling or inflammation in the head or neck area could be another contributing factor. This should subside over time as your father-in-law recovers.\n\n2. Migraine or headache: Angioplasty can trigger migraines or severe headaches in some people, although this is not common. The pressure and tension he's experiencing could be a sign of a migraine or a tension-type headache.\n\n3. Anxiety or stress: Emotional stress or anxiety can sometimes manifest as headache or tension, especially if your father-in-law is worried about his health or the recovery process.\n\n4. Transient ischemic attack (TIA) or stroke: Although very unlikely, given the timing and his overall condition, it is essential to rule out a TIA or stroke, which could cause sudden onset of head heaviness.\n\n5. Neurological issues: Although rare, angioplasty can very rarely cause neurological issues or nerve damage, which could result in head discomfort or tension.\n\n6. Medications: Some medications used before, during, or after the procedure, such as beta-blockers or painkillers, can cause headaches.\n\nIt is essential to consult with your father-in-law's healthcare professional to help determine the cause and discuss any concerns.

Ipratropium bromide works by drying up mucus in the airways, while albuterol is a bronchodilator that helps to relax and open up the airways.\n\nWhile Duavent is primarily used for the treatment of asthma and COPD, it may also be used on an as-needed basis for the relief of acute cough and bronchospasms in patients without these conditions. However, before considering nebulization with Duavent for your daughter's severe cough, it's important to consult with her healthcare provider. They can evaluate her symptoms, perform any necessary diagnoses, and determine if Duavent is an appropriate treatment option.\n\nNebulization may be more effective than taking Duavent via inhaler for delivering the medication deep into the lungs, especially for patients who have difficulty using inhalers properly. However, nebulization may also require specialized equipment and expertise, and there may be potential risks associated with the use of a nebulizer. Therefore, it's important to follow the instructions of your healthcare provider carefully if you're considering nebulization at home.\n\nAs for her body temperature of 37.3°C (99.1°F), it is considered normal and within the normal range.

Medical conditions: Certain medical issues, such as anemia, arrhythmias, thyroid disorders, and cardiovascular diseases, can lead to persistent heart palpitations.\n\nUsing a Holter monitor is an excellent step to help determine the underlying cause of your palpitations by monitoring your heart rhythm over an extended period. Share the results with your doctor, who can then discuss potential diagnoses and treatment options based on your specific situation.\n\nIn the meantime, try to identify any factors that may trigger your palpitations, such as specific foods, emotions, or physical activities. Make note of these triggers to discuss with your doctor. Additionally, ensure you're getting enough rest and practicing stress-reducing techniques, such as deep breathing exercises and progressive muscle relaxation.\n\nRemember, this advice does not replace medical guidance. It's essential to follow up with a healthcare professional for accurate information regarding your heart palpitations."}
{"question": "How to cure infertility?hi, I am 33 years old, had laproscopy done in october2009 (left tube tortuous) My husband's semen's count and motility(active 10% sluggisg 55%) is pretty low.now doctor told left tube blocked.normally egg formation in leftt overy normal.3month before tb pcr detected positive in mensual sample.after that i m on AKT3 .one time conceive normally & one time with iui (both lasts only for 45 days) please sugest the treatment and doctor in gurgaon delhi", "human": "Hi, I have gone through your question.Since your one fallopian tube is blocked and your husband's semen parameters are deranged, conceiving naturally is difficult.In your case, you should undergo at least 3 cycles of IUI followed by in vitro fertilization or ICSI (intracytoplasmic sperm injection ), if IUI fails.I would suggest you to consult an infertility specialist and take any further infertility treatment after completing the course of antitubercular treatment.Hope you found the answer helpful.Wishing you good health.Regards,Dr Deepti Verma", "ai": " I'm an AI language model and not a doctor, but I can help you understand some potential treatments for infertility related to your situation. However, I strongly recommend consulting a fertility specialist for personalized medical advice.\n\nBased on the information you've provided, it appears you have tubal infertility on your side (left tube), possibly due to a blockage. Your husband's low semen count and motility suggest he may also have issues contributing to your infertility. Here are some possible treatments:\n\n1. Surgery: Tubal ligation reversal or microsurgical tubal cannulation can be considered for you to restore the patency of the blocked tube. However, this procedure depends on the extent and location of the blockage.\n\nAs for your husband, a varicocele repair (VARCO) may be an option, which can improve semen quality and motility by repairing the dilated veins in the scrotum that put pressure on the testicles and interfere with sperm production.\n\n2. Medical treatments: If surgery is not an option or is unsuccessful, other medical treatments such as In Vitro Fertilization (IVF) and Intracytoplasmic Sperm Injection (ICSI) could be considered. These treatments involve directly fertilizing the egg with the sperm in a laboratory.\n\n3. Medications: For your husband, medications like clomiphene citrate (Clomid) or letrozole (Femara) to stimulate sperm production, and medications to treat underlying conditions like hypothyroidism or diabetes could be recommended by a fertility specialist.\n\n4. IUI with donor sperms: Another option could be to undergo IUI using donor sperm due to your husband's low semen count and motility.\n\nSome fertility specialists in Gurgaon and Delhi that you may consider are:\n\n1. Medica Super Specialty Hospital - Dr. Ritu Bhawani, Dr. Sushmita Srivastava\n2. Indira IVF – Dr. Anuradha Kapoor, Dr. Nita Shah\n3. Artemis Health Institute – Dr. Ranjit Lal, Dr. Anubha Gupta\n4. Fortis La Femme – Dr. Nidhi Manglik, Dr. Anjali Sharma\n\nPlease note that these specialists may have various expertise, and it's essential to discuss your case in detail with each of them to find the best treatment option based on your unique situation. Good luck!"}

I also have some twitching or spasms going on down there too. I have had 3 c-sections and after the last one I had an abcess removed. Do you know what this could be?", "human": "Hello!Thank you for the query.Your symptoms are quite characteristic for a hernia in the mentioned area. It can be an umbilical hernia or if it is close to the C-section scar, the scar can be the source of it.Hernia should be more visible when standing and coughing and can disappear when lying down.Hernia usually contains fatty tissue from abdominal cavity however sometimes intestines can also be under the skin.I suggest you to consult a surgeon with this issue. In case of doubts, ultrasound should be done.Hope this will help.Regards.", "ai": " I'm an AI language model and not a doctor, so I cannot diagnose conditions based on symptoms. However, I can help you understand some possible causes for the large twitching lump and spasms you're experiencing in your stomach area.\n\nGiven your medical history, there are a few possibilities:\n\n1. Scar tissue: You've had three C-sections, which can result in significant scarring in the abdominal area. Scar tissue can sometimes form lumps or masses that may feel distinct and can twist or move, which could explain the twitching sensation.\n2. Hernia: With multiple surgeries in your abdominal area, you might have developed a hernia. Hernias can cause a noticeable lump or bulge, and you might also feel twisting or spasms in the affected area.\n3. Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS): This common condition can cause abdominal cramps, bloating, and twitching, especially in the lower abdomen. IBS can sometimes result in lumps or bulges that are not actually there but might feel distinctive when pressed.\n4. Muscle spasms or cramps: Sometimes, the muscles in the stomach area can contract involuntarily, leading to spasms or twitching. This could be due to various reasons, including dehydration, muscle strains, or nerve irritation.\n5. Abscess or infection: Based on your medical history, it's possible that the remaining infection from your last surgery could still be present, causing swelling and twitching. This would warrant a follow-up with your healthcare provider, as you should have your incision checked for any signs of infection.\n6. Other conditions: There are numerous other medical conditions that could cause a lump or twitching in the stomach area, such as lipomas (benign fatty tumors), gastrointestinal disorders, or neurological conditions – but without a thorough examination by a medical professional, it's not possible to rule out these possibilities.\n\nYou should consult with your healthcare provider for a proper evaluation and diagnosis. In the meantime, try to stay relaxed and avoid any abdominal straining, such as heavy lifting or strenuous exercises, until you receive further instructions."}
{"question": "Suggest medication for autismMy son is 4 years old, 50 pounds and was diagnosed with Autism in January 2001. We have taken him off of dairy over the last week and swithced him to rice milk. Around this same time we noticed pink circles around both of his eyes. The only known food allergies he has are to some tree nuts (all except for almonds and Brazil nuts).

But a child requires interventional program in fact American Academy of Pediatrics recommends at least 25 hours of therapy per week with parental training.Hope I have answered your query. Let me know if I can assist you further.Regards,Dr. Shivtej N", "ai": " I'm an artificial intelligence and cannot diagnose or prescribe medication. I can, however, provide you with some information about medications commonly used to help manage symptoms associated with Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD). These medications are not a cure for ASD, but rather are intended to help with specific symptoms.\n\n1. Stimulant medications: These medications are commonly used to address attention deficits and hyperactivity in individuals with ASD. Methylphenidate (Ritalin, Concerta) and amphetamines (Adderall, Dexedrine) are the most commonly prescribed stimulant medications for ASD. However, since your son has already shown some weight gain and is diagnosed at a relatively young age, it may be worth considering non-stimulant options first.\n\n2. Non-stimulant medications: Strattera (atomoxetine) is an non-stimulant medication that has been found to be effective in improving attention and hyperactivity in some children with ASD. These medications might be a good option for your son since he is overweight and you are looking to avoid stimulants.\n\n3. Anti-anxiety medications: Your son's eye circles could potentially be due to an anxiety condition. In such cases, medications like selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) (e.g., fluoxetine, sertraline) or benzodiazepines (e.g., clonazepam) might be used to help manage anxiety symptoms.\n\n4. Antipsychotic medications: Antipsychotic medications (like risperidone or aripiprazole) are sometimes used to help manage irritability, aggression, and self-harming behaviors in individuals with ASD. These medications can also help with sleep problems, although there is a risk of side effects, particularly weight gain and metabolic issues.\n\n5. Anti-inflammatory medications: While there is no definitive evidence that shows anti-inflammatory medications are effective for ASD symptoms, some parents report improvement when using medications such as ibuprofen or montelukast (Singulair) for symptoms like gastrointestinal issues or skin problems – including pink eye circles.\n\n6. Dietary interventions: Eliminating dairy might help reduce eye inflammation if your son has an underlying food allergy or intolerance. You can consider trying elimination diets or consulting a dietitian who specializes in ASD for more personalized guidance.\n\nYou should consult your healthcare provider or a child psychiatrist for a proper evaluation and to discuss the most appropriate options for your son. Remember that medications should be seen as one part of a comprehensive treatment plan, which includes therapies like Applied Behavior Analysis, Speech Therapy, and Occupational Therapy."}

Warning signs would be persistent vomiting, excessive sleeping, crying excessively, unable to feed, bleeding from any site (nose, ears, etc.), and seizures. If one of the signs is present, better get your baby checked by your doctor.sincerely,Mark Rosario MDpediatrics", "ai": " While it's reassuring that the baby seems to have no visible injuries, it's important to note that internal injuries are not always immediately apparent. Falling from a height, even if it's just a chair, can potentially cause head or spine injuries, which may not be visible right away. Additionally, the baby's sedated behavior and seeming discomfort could be a sign of an injury or trauma.\n\nIf the baby has fallen from a chair and shows any signs of discomfort or unusual behavior (such as lethargy, irritability, or changes in eating or sleeping patterns), it's always a good idea to consult with a healthcare professional. They can evaluate the baby and perform any necessary tests to rule out any potential injuries, and provide you with guidance and peace of mind.\n\nIt's also important to be aware that infants at this age are becoming more mobile and exploring their environment, which increases their risk for falls. Taking steps to babyproof your home and minimize potential hazards can help prevent future falls."}

However, I can suggest some potential causes for slow blood flow to the heart and thinning of the heart walls, which is also known as cardiomyopathy. This condition can have various causes, some of which are:\n\n1. Coronary artery disease: Even though your angiogram showed perfect arteries, you might have microvascular disease, which affects the tiny blood vessels in your heart. This can impair blood flow to the heart.\n2. Heart valve issues: Dysfunctional heart valves can affect blood flow to the heart.\n3. High blood pressure: Chronic high blood pressure can lead to cardiomyopathy as the heart continues to work harder to pump blood against the increased pressure.\n4. Diabetes: Diabetes can damage the blood vessels, affecting the heart's blood supply.\n5. Alcohol abuse: Chronic alcohol consumption can damage the heart muscle and impair its ability to pump blood efficiently.\n6.

What is the alternate solution to give birth to a child?", "human": "you should go for a testicular biopsy.. maybe the biopsy will reveal sperms in the testicular tissue that could be used for an IVF cycle.. IVF might be the only possible way for you to have children..goodluck", "ai": " I'm an artificial intelligence language model and not a doctor, but I can suggest some potential treatment options for azoospermia based on available information. This condition, characterized by the absence of sperm in semen, can have various causes, and treatment options depend on the underlying cause. Since you have undergone a varicocele surgery without improvement, I assume your case might be related to obstructive azoospermia. Here are some possible alternatives:\n\n1. Sperm Retrieval Techniques: With obstructive azoospermia, sperm might be present in the testes but unable to reach the semen due to an obstruction. In such cases, sperm can be retrieved directly from the testes for assisted reproduction. The most common techniques are testicular spermiogram (TESA), micro-TESE, or sperm aspiration (MESA).\n\n2. In vitro fertilization (IVF) or intracytoplasmic sperm injection (ICSI): With sperm retrieved through the techniques mentioned above, IVF or ICSI can be performed to achieve successful fertilization. The embryo(s) will then be transferred to your wife's uterus for possible implantation.\n\n3. Donor sperm: If sperm cannot be retrieved from you, donor sperm can be used for fertility treatments. This may involve insemination, IUI, or IVF with donor sperm.\n\n4. Surrogacy: In cases where a woman is unable to carry a child herself due to medical conditions or other reasons, gestational surrogacy might be an option. Using the sperm retrieval technique and IVF, an embryo will be created from your partner's eggs and your retrieved sperm. The resulting embryo will then be transferred to a surrogate mother.\n\n5. Adoption: If all the above options are not feasible, adoption can be considered as an alternative way to build a family.\n\nAs you consider these options, it's highly recommended that you consult with a fertility specialist who can assess the underlying cause of azoospermia and recommend the most suitable treatment for your specific situation."}
{"question": "Can intake of yasmin cause side effects like thrush/yeast infection?hello ever since I started taking yasmin the contraceptive pill (3months) ive had thrush/yeast infection. Ive never suffered with it before. I have also given it to my boyfriend and his penis is red and sore. im using canestan cream however there doesnt seem to be progress could this be because im taking yasmin?", "human": "Hi, Yes, the birth control pill 'yasmin' can cause thrush/yeast infection. Yasmin is a combined oral contraceptive pill that contains two different hormones viz. estrogen and progesterone. Taking these pills can cause hormonal balance which helps the yeast to grow. It is believed that the estrogen in birth control pills can cause the vagina to produce more sugars. These sugars feed the yeast already living in the vagina causing overgrowth and thus infection (vaginal thrush or candidiasis). It is a similar effect to that seen in pregnancy when estrogen levels rise naturally. If the infection bothers you too much you could be switched to a different kind of contraceptive pill with a stronger progesterone component and a weaker estrogen component or consider going on the mini-pill which only contains progesterone. Hope I have answered your query. Let me know if I can assist you further. Take care Regards,Dr. Mohammed Taher Ali, General & Family Physician", "ai": " Yes, hormonal contraceptives like Yasmin can increase the risk of developing yeast infections. The hormones in the pill can disrupt the balance of bacteria in the genital tract, making it more susceptible to yeast infections.\n\nIf you have been experiencing recurrent yeast infections since starting Yasmin, it is worth discussing this with your healthcare provider. They may suggest trying a different type of contraceptive pill or exploring other options for birth control that may not increase your risk of yeast infections.\n\nIt is also important to note that your boyfriend's symptoms of redness and soreness may not be directly related to Yasmin. However, if he has been having sex with you while you have been experiencing recurrent yeast infections, it is possible that he could have developed an infection as well.

Calorie dense food should be incorporated in your diet like dried fruits, potato, sweets, nuts, jam, jelly, banana or mango shake, porridge, badam kheer, etc. 2. Leafy vegetables should be restricted in your diet as they reduce appetite. 3. You should take three major meals a day and snacks in between. Also, butter and margarine should be considered. 4. An adequate amount of egg, meat, fish, milk should be taken as it helps you for tissue building in your body. 5. Try to eat one boiled egg every morning. 6. You should eat more food at each meal. 7. Before taking a meal, you can walk for some time as it help to you feel hunger. 8. You should take more water.", "ai": " I'm an AI language model and not a doctor, but I can suggest some tips that might help you gain weight in a healthy way. However, before starting any weight gain regimen, I recommend consulting with a healthcare professional or a registered dietitian to ensure that any suggested methods are suitable for your specific situation:\n\n1. Eat more calories than you burn: To gain weight, you need to consume more calories than your body burns. Focus on nutrient-dense foods that provide a lot of calories per serving. Try increasing your caloric intake by 500 calories per day, and make sure to keep it consistent over time.\n\n2. Eat frequent, balanced meals: Instead of consuming three large meals, try eating 5-6 smaller meals throughout the day. Include a variety of nutrient-dense foods in each meal, such as lean protein, healthy fats, whole grains, fruits, and vegetables.\n\n3. Choose nutrient-dense foods: Focus on foods that are calorie-dense but not empty calories. These include foods like whole grains, nuts, seeds, avocados, legumes, and lean proteins. Avoid sugary and processed foods, as they can provide a lot of calories but few essential nutrients.\n\n4. Healthy fats: Incorporate healthy sources of fat into your diet, such as olive oil, nuts, seeds, avocado, and fish. These healthy fats can help increase your overall caloric intake and improve the absorption and utilization of certain nutrients.\n\n5. Limit processed foods and sugars: Avoid foods that are high in added sugars, refined grains, and processed ingredients. These foods can contribute to weight gain in the form of body fat, but they lack essential nutrients and can negatively impact your overall health.\n\n6. Exercise: Avoid extreme weight loss workouts and focus on low-impact exercises, such as walking, swimming, or cycling. These activities can help you build muscle and increase your overall caloric expenditure without leading to unwanted weight loss or loss of appetite.\n\n7. Eat before and after workouts: Make sure to feed your body properly before and after your workouts. Eating a meal rich in complex carbohydrates and protein before a workout can give you the energy you need to perform at your best, while a protein-rich meal after your workout can help repair and build muscle.\n\n8. Eat enough calories at night: Eating a balanced meal that provides enough calories before bedtime can help ensure that you are getting enough energy to grow and develop. Avoid snacking on empty calories, such as sweets or sugary drinks, before bed.\n\n9. Consider nutritional supplements: In some cases, your healthcare professional or registered dietitian may recommend using nutritional supplements, such as protein powders or weight gain shakes, to help increase your caloric intake and support healthy growth.\n\n10. Stay hydrated: Make sure to drink enough water throughout the day, but avoid consuming large amounts of water before meals as it can dilute the digestive juices in your stomach and make it more difficult to digest and absorb nutrients.\n\nRemember, gaining weight in a healthy and sustainable way is important. Be sure to consult with a healthcare professional or a registered dietitian to create a personalized plan that is right for you."}

Here are some possibilities, based on the information you've given:\n\n1. Infections: Your wife's symptoms could be due to an infection. However, the normal results from her MP (Microbiological culture and sensitivity) and Widal tests make bacterial infections like typhoid and paratyphoid less likely. Viral infections, such as flu, COVID-19, or a urinary tract infection, could be possible.\n2. Medications: Certain medications or reactions to medications can cause fever, shivering, and body pain. Check if she is currently taking any medication and discuss it with her doctor.\n3. Autoimmune diseases: Some autoimmune diseases like Rheumatoid Arthritis, Lupus, or connective tissue diseases can present with these symptoms. The absence of a definitive diagnosis from her recent ultrasound report does not completely rule out this possibility.\n4. Cancer: In rare cases, unexplained fever, shivering, and body pain could be due to a malignancy. The absence of abnormal findings on her ultrasound report does not completely rule out this possibility.\n\nYou should monitor her symptoms closely, including her temperature's progression, the intensity of body aches, and any new symptoms. If her symptoms worsen or she experiences difficulty breathing, severe abdominal pain, or unexplained weight loss, you should consider seeking emergency medical care.\n\nIt is essential to consult a healthcare professional for a proper diagnosis. They may recommend additional tests, such as a complete blood count (CBC), erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR), C-reactive protein (CRP), or a chest X-ray, depending on their clinical judgment."}

The pain may be worsened by activities that increase abdominal pressure, such as coughing, laughing, or sneezing.\n2.

However, there are certain potential risks and considerations you should be aware of:\n\n1. Smoking can irritate your respiratory system, making it more difficult to improve from your chest infection and cold, especially when using Ventolin for symptomatic relief.\n\n2. Marijuana can interact with some medications by increasing the concentration of certain active ingredients in the bloodstream (primarily through the cytochrome P450 system). However, there is no clear evidence that marijuana interacts specifically with Zithromax or albuterol.\n\n3. Cigarettes can negatively impact your recovery by:\n   a. Interfering with your body's ability to absorb oxygen efficiently, which can worsen your symptoms and make it harder to breathe.\n   b. Increasing the production of mucus in your respiratory system, which can make it more difficult to clear out the infection.\n   c. Compromising your immune system, allowing the infection to further progress or prevent proper healing.\n\nInstead of smoking, consider other ways to manage your symptoms, such as:\n\n1. Staying hydrated by drinking plenty of fluids, including water, juice, and herbal tea.\n2. Using saline nasal sprays or drops to help clear nasal congestion.\n3. Engaging in light activity, taking rests when needed.\n4. Taking over-the-counter medications, such as acetaminophen or decongestants, as recommended by your healthcare provider.\n5.

It is important that you do not delay seeking medical attention. You should call 911 or go to the emergency room immediately to have your blood pressure checked by medical professionals. A sudden increase in blood pressure can lead to complications such as stroke, heart attack, or organ damage.

Repeatedly high readings at home are still reason for concern and warrant a prompt evaluation by a healthcare professional. In the meantime, try to remain calm, sit in a comfortable position, avoid caffeine and nicotine, and avoid any strenuous activity until your blood pressure has been evaluated. Stay hydrated and try to relax as much as possible."}

Complex renal cysts often have an increased risk of malignancy, though not all of them are cancerous.\n\nHowever, it is important to note that not all cysts with focal wall calcification are malignant. Other causes of focal wall calcification include chronic inflammation, infection, or traumatic injury. Therefore, further evaluation with imaging modalities such as CT or MRI is often recommended to better characterize the lesion and assess the risk of malignancy. Your healthcare provider will be able to discuss these findings with you in more detail and the appropriate follow-up steps."}

So consult your doctor,  go for some blood and urine test,  sometime it is seen in anemia also", "ai": " I'm not a doctor, but I can suggest some common causes of puffy eyes in children and potential treatments. However, it's essential to consult with a healthcare professional for an accurate diagnosis and treatment plan. For your son's condition, here are some possibilities that have been suggested:\n\n1. Allergies: Food allergies, animal dander, or environmental allergens could be causing his puffy eyes. Treatment may include avoiding the allergen, antihistamines, or nasal decongestants.\n2. Sinusitis: A sinus infection could cause puffiness around the eyes. Treatment typically includes antibiotics and decongestants.\n3. Dehydration: Lack of sufficient fluid intake can cause the skin around the eyes to become puffy. Ensure your child stays hydrated by drinking plenty of fluids.\n4. Fatigue: If your child is not getting enough sleep, excessive tiredness can lead to puffy eyes due to fluid retention. Encourage regular naps and a consistent bedtime routine.\n5. Viral infection: A viral infection, such as the common cold or flu, can cause puffy eyes due to inflammation. Let the doctor know about any other symptoms your son may be experiencing.\n6. Vasodilator medications: Some medications, such as certain types of antihypertensive drugs, can cause the blood vessels in the eyes to dilate, leading to puffiness. Consult your doctor about alternative treatments if this is the case.\n\nIt is important to note that if your child's puffy eyelids do not improve despite appropriate treatment, or if there are other concerning symptoms, you should discuss your concerns with their healthcare provider. Additionally, continue to follow up with their doctor as they determine the underlying cause and the most effective treatment approach."}
{"question": "Can leg and neck pain be the symptoms of a gas problem?my boyfriend has chronic heartburn and continuous gas. His gas is most times very foul he complains of tingling in his leg and has neck pain he uses prilosex but dose not follow a regimen", "human": "test test 12", "ai": " While leg and neck pain are not typical symptoms of gas or heartburn alone, they can be related to these conditions in certain situations. Chronic heartburn can lead to gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD), a condition where stomach acid flows back into the esophagus, causing irritation and inflammation. This can, in turn, lead to symptoms such as:\n\n1. Heartburn: a burning sensation in the chest, usually occurring after meals.\n2. Regurgitation: a feeling of acid backing up into the throat.\n3. Belching and bloating: increased gas in the stomach and intestines.\n4. Abdominal pain and discomfort: cramps or pain in the abdomen.\n5. Leg pain: in some cases, GERD and related conditions can cause pain, tingling, or cramping in the legs, which is called referred pain. This occurs when the nerves in the esophagus and intestines are irritated, sending signals to other parts of the body.\n6. Neck pain: although less common, neck pain can also be a symptom of GERD or related conditions. It may be due to the muscle tension or referred pain from the irritated nerves in the esophagus and upper intestines.\n\nIt is essential to note that these symptoms can have various causes, and heartburn, gas, and referred pain are just a few possibilities. Other conditions, like nerve damage or muscle problems, can cause similar symptoms. If your boyfriend is experiencing these symptoms frequently and consistently, it would be best to consult his healthcare provider. They can evaluate his symptoms and determine whether heartburn or another condition is causing his leg, neck, and gas problems.\n\nAdditionally, not following a regimen for using medication like Prilosec (omeprazole) regularly can make his symptoms worse. Proton pump inhibitors like Prilosec should be taken consistently to effectively manage heartburn and GERD. Inconsistent use can limit the medication's ability to reduce stomach acid production, which may exacerbate the symptoms. If your boyfriend needs help adhering to a medication schedule, he can consider setting reminders, obtaining a pill organizer, or speaking with his healthcare provider for additional support."}

Available for further clarifications.Good luck.", "ai": " I'm sorry to hear that you're going through a difficult time, Yvonne. Losing a loved one after a long marriage can be a profoundly challenging experience, and it's not uncommon for people to develop symptoms of anxiety, depression, and sleeplessness as a result.\n\nThe cause of these symptoms can be complex and multifaceted. Grief can activate the body's stress response system, leading to physical symptoms like insomnia, racing heart, and anxious feelings. Depression can also contribute to sleeplessness, as well as a lack of energy and interest in activities. Anxiety can manifest as racing thoughts, panic attacks, and difficulty focusing.\n\nYour experience with Elavil is not uncommon, as antidepressants like amitriptyline (the active ingredient in Elavil) can have side effects that include insomnia, anxiety, and agitation in some people. These side effects can sometimes be more pronounced in the first few months of taking the medication, and they may eventually subside as your body adjusts to the drug.\n\nHowever, it's important to note that everyone's experience with antidepressants is unique, and there can be significant variation in how people respond to different medications. If you're feeling awful and experiencing new or worsening symptoms, it's important to speak with your healthcare provider. They may be able to adjust your dosage, try a different medication, or recommend additional resources such as therapy or support groups.\n\nIn the meantime, here are some things that might help you manage your symptoms in the short term:\n\n1. Establish a regular sleep routine: Try to go to bed and wake up at the same time every day, even on weekends. Avoid caffeine, alcohol, and heavy meals close to bedtime. Consider creating a relaxing bedtime routine, such as taking a warm bath, reading a book, or listening to calming music.\n2. Practice relaxation techniques: Deep breathing exercises, meditation, and progressive muscle relaxation can help reduce anxiety and promote relaxation. Consider incorporating these practices into your daily routine, or seek out guided practices online or through a smartphone app.\n3. Stay connected: Reach out to friends, family members, or support groups for emotional support. Talking about your feelings and connecting with others who have gone through similar experiences can be helpful in managing grief and stress.\n4. Get moving: Regular physical activity can help improve mood and reduce stress. Aim for at least 30 minutes of moderate-intensity exercise most days of the week. Walking, swimming, and yoga are all good options for beginners.\n5. Practice good self-care: Take care of yourself by eating well, getting enough rest, and engaging in activities that bring you joy. Avoid things that can make your symptoms worse, such as smoking, alcohol, and illicit drugs.\n\nI hope this information is helpful, Yvonne. Please don't hesitate to reach out if you have any further questions or concerns."}

These enzymes are released into the bloodstream when there is liver damage or injury. Normal levels suggest that your liver function is likely within normal limits. However, it's important to keep in mind that a single reading may not be definitive, and your doctor may consider your medical history, symptoms, and other test results when making a diagnosis.\n\nIf you're experiencing frequent giddiness (dizziness or lightheadedness), you should discuss this symptom with your doctor.

Hope I have answered your query. Let me know if I can assist you further.", "ai": " I'm an artificial intelligence and not a doctor, but I can try to help you understand the information you've been given. It's important to note that I can't provide medical advice or recommendations. The antibiotic Moxifloxacin (Mox 500) is commonly used to treat various bacterial infections, including respiratory tract infections like bronchitis and pneumonia. However, the fact that you've been diagnosed with a lung infection based on an X-ray does not necessarily mean that it's a bacterial infection. In many cases, lung infections are viral in origin, and antibiotics are not effective in treating them.\n\nThe length of treatment (5 days) and the dosage (3 times a day) prescribed by your doctor is fairly standard for Moxifloxacin, but whether that's enough for your specific case depends on various factors, such as the severity and type of infection, your overall health, and how you respond to the medication. If you're unsure about the length of your treatment or have any concerns, it would be best to contact your doctor for clarification.\n\nIn light of your recent cold, it is also possible that your lung infection is viral in origin or that your cold may have led to a secondary bacterial infection. If that's the case, Moxifloxacin might not be the most appropriate medication for you. It's important to follow your doctor's advice and take the full course of treatment as prescribed. If your symptoms do not improve or worsen during the course of your treatment, you should contact your doctor."}
{"question": "i have a mouth sores with blood clotsi have a mouth sore with blood clots. can i be told whata these are and advis me what to do.", "human": "Usually mouth sores are due to Vit B and C deficiency. It is advisable to load yourself with Vit B complex supplements and Vit C. Application of local ointments like Mucopain would lead to pain relief and healing would be possible with ointments like Hexigel. Try applying these before and after meals", "ai": " I'm not a doctor, but I can try to provide you with some general information about mouth sores with blood clots. If you have a mouth sore with blood clots, it could be one of several conditions, such as a traumatic ulcer, aperulentulosis, or a blood blister.\n\nA traumatic ulcer is a sore that develops after injury to the mouth, such as biting the inside of your cheek or tongue. The blood clots are usually a sign of healing. To help the ulcer heal, you can rinse your mouth with warm salt water several times a day, avoid spicy or acidic foods, and use a soft-bristled toothbrush.\n\nAperulentulosis is a type of ulcer that is caused by the bacterium Actinomyces israellii. It can appear as a red, painful sore with a yellow or gray center and a white or yellow film. The blood clots may be a sign of infection. If you suspect you have aperulentulosis, you should see a doctor for a proper diagnosis and treatment.\n\nA blood blister is a fluid-filled sac that forms under the mucous membrane of the mouth. It is caused by an injury that disrupts the blood vessels beneath the surface of the mouth. The blood clots are a sign of healing. To help the blood blister heal, you can rinse your mouth with warm water several times a day, avoid irritating the area, and apply a cool compress to the affected area.\n\nIn any case, if your mouth sore persists for more than a week, is very painful, or is accompanied by other symptoms, such as fever or difficulty swallowing, you should see a doctor for a proper diagnosis and treatment. Ignoring a mouth sore could lead to more serious complications, such as infection or delayed healing."}
{"question": "What could cause pain behind the knees?My 18 year old grandson, a junior college basketball player, is experiencing sharp pain starts behind his knees on both legs. His legs tingle like they are asleep. Has been going on all day, but getting worse. They lifted weights the past couple of days.... chest and back. Should he go to an ER?", "human": "Hi, Pain in both legs with numbness indicates disc pathology with nerve compression and it may have happened due to weight lifting. tell him to stop weight lifting. Take rest on hard bed. Tablet Pregalin x75 mg one at bedtime helps in relieving pain and numbness. Visit to orthopedic surgeon for detailed clinical examination is recommended. MRI of the lumbo sacral spine needs to bed done. Hope I have answered your query. Let me know if I can assist you further.Regards,Dr. Jayesh Vaza", "ai": " The sharp pain behind the knees that your grandson is experiencing, along with the tingling sensation, could be a sign of several possible conditions. However, it is important to note that I am an AI language model and cannot diagnose conditions based on symptoms alone. I strongly recommend that your grandson consults a healthcare professional, such as his team doctor or a sports medicine specialist, for an evaluation. Some possible causes of the pain behind the knees are:\n\n1. Patellar Tendinitis: Inflammation of the patellar tendon, which connects the kneecap to the shinbone. This injury is common in athletes, particularly those who participate in activities involving jumping and sudden stopping.\n2. Hamstring Strain: Injury to the muscles at the back of the thigh. This can cause pain, swelling, and a tingling sensation.\n3. Popliteal Artery Entrapment: Compression of the popliteal artery, which can cause pain, numbness, and a tingling sensation in the leg. While rare, this condition is a serious medical emergency that requires prompt medical attention.\n4. Baker's Cyst: A fluid-filled cyst that forms behind the knee. This condition is often related to other knee problems, such as arthritis or cartilage damage.\n5. Deep Vein Thrombosis (DVT): A blood clot in the deep veins of the leg. This condition can cause pain, swelling, and a tingling sensation in the leg. It is a serious medical condition that requires immediate medical attention.\n\nYour grandson's age and basketball participation raises the possibility of sports-related injuries, but it is still important to rule out more serious conditions such as DVT. I cannot say for certain if he should go to the ER, but if the pain persists, worsens, or is accompanied by swelling, discoloration, or shortness of breath, he should seek emergency care immediately. Otherwise, he should call his team doctor or make an appointment with a sports medicine specialist to evaluate the cause of the pain and develop an appropriate treatment plan."}

Regarding your first question, it's common for patients to experience weakness or other symptoms in the legs after a thoracic spine fusion due to the surgery and the healing process. Rehabilitation exercises, such as physical therapy and home exercises, can help improve muscle strength and function. Your healthcare provider or a physical therapist can provide you with a customized exercise program. In general, regular exercise, even if it's just walking, can help promote healing and improve overall health.\n\nRegarding your second question, a thoracotomy (a surgical incision in the chest) can sometimes cause organs, such as the liver, to shift position due to the surgery. This is known as iatrogenic liver injury. In some cases, the liver function may return to normal on its own over time. Your healthcare provider may recommend monitoring your liver function through blood tests to check for any signs of liver damage or dysfunction. If liver damage is detected, treatments such as medication or dietary changes may be recommended. However, without more information it's difficult for me to provide a definitive answer. It's important to follow up with your healthcare provider to discuss any concerns you may have about your health or your recovery from surgery."}

Further clarifications and consultations on Health care magic are welcome. If you do not have any clarifications, you can close the discussion and rate the answer. Wish your kid good health.Dr. Sumanth MBBS., DCH., DNB (Paed).,", "ai": " Dark circles under the eyes in young children are typically not a cause for concern and are usually due to various harmless factors. These can include:\n\n1. Fatigue: Even though your child is getting enough sleep, the quality of sleep and her individual sleep patterns might not be sufficiently restorative. Irregular sleep schedules, frequent night wakings, and long naps can contribute to dark circles.\n\n2. Diet: Dehydration or a lack of essential nutrients in a child's diet can lead to dark circles.\n\n3. Genetics: Some children inherit dark circles as a familial trait.\n\n4. Dry eyes or eye rubbing: Dry eyes or frequent eye rubbing can cause dark circles due to the pooling of blood in the area around the eyes.\n\nDark circles are usually not a sign of any underlying serious medical condition. However, if you are concerned, you can discuss this with your child's pediatrician during your next appointment. They might be able to offer reassurance or suggest ways to improve your child's sleep habits, hydration, or diet.\n\nRed pimples or spots that are appearing and disappearing on your child's face, around the mouth and cheeks, sound like milia. Milia are small, raised, white or yellowish bumps, and they occur when dead skin cells become trapped beneath the skin's surface. Milia can appear anywhere on the body but are most commonly found on the face and around the eyes. They're not contagious and usually don't itch or hurt, but they can be annoying for kids and adults alike.\n\nRed bumps on the face may also be caused by other factors:\n\n1. Allergic reactions: Your child may be allergic to certain foods, cosmetics, or environmental factors, leading to skin irritation and rashes.\n\n2. Eczema: Atopic dermatitis, or eczema, is a common chronic skin condition that causes red, itchy patches and spots on the face and other areas of the body.\n\n3. Rosacea: A red rash on the face can also indicate rosacea, which is an inflammatory skin condition that typically affects adults, causing redness, swelling, and small pimples.\n\nIf your child's red spots or pimples persist despite home care and you are unsure of the underlying cause, it's a good idea to consult with your pediatrician. They may be able to determine the cause of the bumps and recommend appropriate treatments or interventions.\n\nRegular hand washing, avoiding harsh cleansers, and keeping your child's skin moisturized can help keep irritations at bay. If you suspect an allergy, avoiding potential allergens might be helpful. Your pediatrician can guide you on the best course of action for your child's specific situation."}

I can suggest some possible treatments based on common practices and medical literature, but you should consult with a healthcare professional for an accurate diagnosis and personalized treatment plan.\n\nRegarding the shortness of breath, if the result of a Treadmill Stress Test (TMT) is positive, this could indicate an underlying cardiac issue. Treatment may include medication such as nitrates to improve blood flow to the heart, beta-blockers to regulate heart rate and reduce chest pain, and ACE inhibitors or ARBs to improve heart function. Lifestyle modifications, such as exercise, a heart-healthy diet, quitting smoking, and managing stress, may also be recommended. In some cases, further testing such as an echocardiogram or cardiac catheterization may be necessary to determine the exact cause.\n\nThe anxiety and headache may be related to the shortness of breath or may be independent symptoms.

Regards,Dr. Loveleen Sharma, General & Family Physician", "ai": " Yes, both Hepatitis A and Typhoid vaccinations are available in oral form. However, it is important to note that the oral Typhoid vaccine (Vivotif) is a live attenuated vaccine, which means it contains a weakened form of the live bacteria. This vaccine is typically given as a series of capsules to be taken at home, usually with water, several days apart. The exact number of capsules depends on the recommended dose schedule, which is usually 4 capsules spaced apart over a period of several days.\n\nAs for Hepatitis A, there is an oral vaccine (ImmuneGlobe) available as well, which is also a live attenuated vaccine. It is given as a single dose or in a series of two doses, depending on the specific vaccine brand and the age of the person receiving the vaccine.\n\nBefore making a decision about taking the vaccines orally while in India, it is recommended that you consult with your healthcare provider or travel medicine clinic. They can provide you with the most up-to-date information on vaccine recommendations for your travel itinerary and help you determine the best way to obtain the needed vaccinations, including any restrictions or precautions related to the oral vaccines.\n\nIt is important to note that neither Hepatitis A nor Typhoid vaccines provide immediate protection. The vaccines take several days to weeks to become effective. Therefore, it is best to get the vaccines well in advance of your travel plans to ensure adequate protection during your trip.\n\nRegarding the availability of Immunoglobulins in India, it is sometimes used for post-exposure prophylaxis (PEP) for Hepatitis A when someone has had a known exposure to the virus and needs immediate protection. However, it is administered by injection, not as an oral medication.\n\nIn summary, both Hepatitis A and Typhoid oral vaccines are available, but getting the vaccines well in advance of your travel plans is essential, as they take time to become effective. Consulting with a healthcare provider or travel medicine clinic before your trip is highly recommended."}

These conditions can worsen kidney function and lead to complications if left untreated.\n\nThe fact that your mother has undergone dialysis once suggests that her kidney function has deteriorated significantly, and her healthcare team likely believes that she needs regular dialysis to maintain her health. However, there are some potential interventions that may help delay or reduce the need for dialysis:\n\n1. Managing underlying conditions: Your mother's thyroid and high blood pressure conditions need to be well-controlled. Regular follow-up appointments, medications, and lifestyle modifications, such as a healthy diet and exercise, can help slow the progression of kidney damage.\n\n2. Dietary modifications: A kidney-friendly diet can help reduce the workload on the kidneys and delay the need for dialysis. Your mother may need to avoid foods high in protein, phosphorus, and sodium and focus on consuming fruits, vegetables, and whole grains.\n\n3. Diuretics: Your mother's high blood pressure might be managed with diuretics, which can help her body eliminate excess fluid and reduce the strain on her kidneys. However, diuretics can cause dehydration if not used appropriately, so it's essential to monitor fluid intake and output.\n\n4. Renal rehabilitation: A multidisciplinary renal rehabilitation program can help individuals with chronic kidney disease maintain their kidney function longer and improve their quality of life. Such a program may include education and counseling on diet, medications, lifestyle modifications, and managing complications.\n\nIf your mother's healthcare team has recommended dialysis, it's likely that they believe it's the best option to maintain her health and prevent complications. However, it's essential to have an open and honest conversation with her healthcare team about your concerns and explore all available treatment options, including those mentioned above, to delay or potentially avoid dialysis. Ultimately, the decision should be based on your mother's overall health, lifestyle, and personal preferences."}
{"question": "Suggest treatment for swelling in the entire scrotal sacI had hydrocele surgery 10 days ago. Now I have severe swelling in the entire scrotal sac which is the size of a softball. The urologist prescribed ibuprofen and cephalexin last friday, but the swelling remains the same. Note:I have had severe lymphedema in my right leg for several years . the urologist who did the operation is aware of this condition.", "human": "Hi,A hydrocele is an accumulation of peritoneal fluid in the scrotum and surgical drainage of the fluid is done to treat the condition. If the hydrocele is uncomplicated, the doctor makes an incision directly into the scrotum. After the canal between the abdominal cavity and the scrotum is repaired, the hydrocele sac is removed, fluid is removed from the scrotum, and the incision is closed with sutures.10 days is a very short time for the surgical wound to heal completely. The hydrocele sac has been removed surgically and now the fluid is accumulating in the scrotum. This will be present for some time until it gets absorbed in to the body. There can be some swelling for the first 2 - 3 weeks after surgery and few people also experience bruising of scrotal skin. Please wear loose clothes and have a scrotal support as suggested by your surgeon.", "ai": " I'm an artificial intelligence and cannot physically examine you, but I can suggest some potential options based on the information provided. These suggestions are not intended as medical advice, and you should consult your healthcare provider for personalized recommendations.\n\nGiven your history of lymphedema and the persistent scrotal swelling after hydrocele surgery, the following possibilities may be considered:\n\n1. Lymphedema: Your scrotal swelling might be related to your pre-existing lymphedema. It is important to follow your lymphedema management plan, including compression therapy, elevation, and skin care. Ensure you are wearing the prescribed compression garment, and consider working with a certified lymphedema therapist if you're not currently doing so.\n\n2. Hydrocele recurrence: It is possible for hydroceles to recur after surgery. Consult your urologist to discuss the possibility of a hydrocele recurrence, and consider undergoing an ultrasound or another imaging test to examine the scrotal area.\n\n3. Infection: Although it's uncommon to develop an infection after hydrocele surgery, given the current use of anti-biotics, it's important to rule out an infected wound or hematoma. Ask your urologist about having the wound evaluated for signs of infection, such as increasing pain, redness, or pus. If an infection is diagnosed, you may need additional antibiotics or surgical intervention.\n\n4. Other causes: Various conditions, like a testicular tumor, inguinal hernia, or even deep vein thrombosis, could potentially cause scrotal swelling. Discuss these possibilities with your healthcare provider and consider other diagnostic tests, such as a CT scan or ultrasound, if necessary.\n\nIt is essential to work closely with your healthcare provider to determine the root cause of your scrotal swelling and develop an appropriate treatment plan."}

It seems to get better over night, and then by the time I pick him up from school it looks worse. Wondering what it could be? No fever. Eating well.", "human": "HelloPimples on face in a child may be due to pyoderma,seborrhic dermatitis with secondary infection. In both the cases patient may not have fever.Atopic dermatitis itself may cause red bumps/rashes on the face.In case of pyoderma or secondary infection treatment with antibiotic is needed. In atopic dermatitis treatment of seborrhea along with application of emollient/mild steroid is required.I would advise you to consult a pediatrician for clinical examination and management accordingly.Regards", "ai": " Pimples and bumps on a child's face at the age of 5 are not typically a sign of a serious health condition. Most likely, they are caused by a condition called juvenile acne. Acne is triggered by several factors, including genetics, hormonal changes, and bacteria. During childhood, hormonal changes can occur due to growth spurts, which can lead to the production of sebum (an oily substance) and the clogging of pores, leading to pimples.\n\nIt's important to maintain good hygiene practices to help minimize acne. Here are some things you can do to help manage your child's acne:\n\n1. Encourage regular face washing: Help your child wash their face gently with a mild soap and warm water twice a day, especially before bedtime. Make sure they avoid harsh scrubs or abrasive cleansers that can irritate the skin.\n2. Keep hands away from the face: Remind your child not to touch their face frequently, as this can spread bacteria and make acne worse.\n3. Avoid tight clothing: Encourage your child to wear loose-fitting clothing to avoid irritating the skin and contributing to acne.\n4. Watch for triggers: Pay attention to any potential triggers that may be making your child's acne worse, such as certain foods or stress.\n5. Consider over-the-counter treatments: If your child's acne is mild, you may consider using over-the-counter treatments containing salicylic acid or benzoyl peroxide. These can help reduce oil production and kill bacteria that cause acne.\n\nIf your child's acne is severe or not responding to over-the-counter treatments, it's important to consult a healthcare professional or a dermatologist for further evaluation and treatment options. In the meantime, reassure your child that acne is common and normal, and that many people outgrow it as they get older."}

Does not smoke or drink. Ex Athlete/swimmer.", "human": "Dear- thanks for using our service , I understand your concern and will try to help you with my advise. She is having orthostatic hypotension, with a baseline of low blood pressure. She should not worry about this blood pressure during the night but will need to be careful when stands up and moves her head to avoid a drop in the blood pressure with dizziness and risk of fall. She needs to have an evaluation to find out the reason of her low blood pressure. Athletes can have low blood pressure and low heart rate due to the exercise and physical fit. I hope this advise will be helpfulDr.Sara", "ai": " Low blood pressure, also known as hypotension, is defined as a systolic pressure (the top number) below 110 mmHg or a diastolic pressure (the bottom number) below 60 mmHg. In your daughter's case, her blood pressure readings of 80/40 to 100/60 when lying down are on the low side, but not dangerously so for a young and otherwise healthy adult. However, recurrent fainting or symptoms of dizziness or lightheadedness with low blood pressure readings can be concerning. Here are some potential causes of low blood pressure in young adults, although many cases are idiopathic (have no clear cause):\n\n1. Dehydration: This is a common cause of low blood pressure, especially if your daughter has been vigorously exercising or sweating a lot. Dehydration occurs when your body loses more fluid than it takes in, reducing blood volume and lowering blood pressure. She should make sure she drinks plenty of fluids to prevent dehydration.\n2. Volume depletion: In addition to dehydration, other conditions that cause volume loss, such as diarrhea, vomiting, or blood loss, can also cause low blood pressure. A low-sodium diet or certain medications (e.g., diuretics) can also contribute to volume depletion.\n3. Postural hypotension: This type of low blood pressure occurs when standing up or rising quickly from a seated position. It can be due to various conditions, such as dehydration, prescription medications, or certain neurologic conditions.\n4. Neurological conditions: Certain neurological conditions, such as Parkinson's disease, multiple sclerosis, or autonomic neuropathy, can cause low blood pressure due to dysfunction in the regulation of blood pressure.\n5. Endocrine disorders: Certain endocrine disorders, such as diabetes, Addison's disease, or thyroid disorders, can cause low blood pressure due to hormonal imbalances.\n6. Medications: Certain medications, such as beta-blockers, calcium channel blockers, diuretics, and some antidepressants, can lower blood pressure as a side effect.\n7. Hormonal changes: Hormonal changes, such as those that occur during pregnancy, can cause low blood pressure due to increased blood volume or other physiological changes.\n\nIt is important to note that many people with low blood pressure have no symptoms and do not require treatment. However, if your daughter experiences recurrent fainting, dizziness, or other symptoms, she should be evaluated by a healthcare professional to determine the cause and appropriate treatment. In the meantime, she can try the following measures to help prevent low blood pressure:\n\n* Drink plenty of fluids, especially before and after exercise, to avoid dehydration.\n* Eat saltier foods or add salt to her meals to help maintain blood volume.\n* Avoid standing up quickly from a seated position, especially after being inactive for a long time.\n* Wear compressive stockings or elevate her legs when sitting or lying down to improve circulation and help prevent pooling of blood in the legs.\n* If she is taking any medications, ask her healthcare professional if they could be contributing to her low blood pressure and if there are any alternatives that might be better."}

My name is Dr. Aida and  I am glad to attend you!Your granny symptoms could be related to an inner ear disorder, as she can not attend a phone call. For this reason, I recommend consulting with an ENT specialist for a physical exam and some labyrinthine tests to exclude an inner ear disorder. Hope you will find this answer helpful!Kind regards, Dr. Aida", "ai": " I'm not a doctor, but I can try to help you identify some possible causes of your grandmother's symptoms based on the information provided. These symptoms could indicate Benign Paroxysmal Positional Vertigo (BPPV), Migraines, or Tension Headaches.\n\n1. Benign Paroxysmal Positional Vertigo (BPPV): This condition is caused by a problem with the inner ear, leading to dizziness and a feeling of the environment spinning around. Nausea, vomiting, and decreased ability to maintain balance can also be associated with BPPV. In some cases, pressure in the head may also be reported. While there is no clear cause of BPPV, it is more common in older adults and can be triggered by specific head movements. If your grandmother's symptoms are accompanied by falling or a fear of falling, it's essential to consult a healthcare professional for a proper evaluation and treatment, as BPPV can be managed with specific maneuvers and exercises.\n\n2. Migraines: Migraines are a type of headache characterized by recurring attacks of moderate to severe pain, often on one side of the head. They can be accompanied by other symptoms such as sensitivity to light and sound, nausea, and vomiting. Some people with migraines may also experience vertigo, which can cause a feeling of the world spinning or the head spinning around. If your grandmother's symptoms include severe or throbbing head pain, along with sensitivity to light and sound, she should consult a doctor for a thorough evaluation, as migraines may require specific treatments.\n\n3. Tension Headaches: Tension headaches are the most common type of headache, and they can cause a feeling of pressure or tightness in the head. Although tension headaches do not typically cause dizziness or a spinning sensation, it's worth mentioning that they can occasionally be accompanied by mild vertigo. Tension headaches can be caused by various factors such as stress, poor posture, and muscle strain. Simple lifestyle changes like getting enough sleep, maintaining good posture, and practicing relaxation techniques may help alleviate tension headaches. But if your grandmother's symptoms persist or worsen, it's important to consult a healthcare professional.\n\nIn any case, it's always a good idea to consult a healthcare professional for a proper diagnosis and treatment recommendations, especially for older adults experiencing new or worsening symptoms. I hope this information helps you understand the potential causes of your grandmother's symptoms, but please remember that I'm an AI and not a doctor."}

{"question": "Q. How to get rid of melasma?Hi doctor,I am a 28 year old male. I am having melasma over the last eight years. I am using Lookbrite cream at night and Melalite and Dermadew lotion in the morning with Suncros sunscreen SPF 26. But when I stop using it, the melasma increases. It becomes more darken on cheeks and nose. Please suggest any medicine to get rid of these ugly spots.", "human": "Hi. I have read your question and understood your concern. Melasma can relapse. Therefore, you must continue with a maintenance regime once your melasma clears. I suggest you to use a higher SPF sunscreen like Sebamed sunscreen SPF 50+. In addition I would suggest you to use Aziderm 20% gel (Azelaic acid) twice daily for dark spots. In morning use Aziderm after washing face and after 30 minutes, apply sunscreen over it. At night apply Aziderm and leave it overnight. Aziderm is slower acting, but it is safe. It can also be used for maintenance therapy. Melalite (Hydroquinone) and Lookbrite (combination of Hydroquinone, Tretinoin and Mometasone furoate) are steroid based creams and cannot be used for more than a month as they can have side effects. For further information consult a dermatologist online --> https://www.icliniq.com/ask-a-doctor-online/dermatologist", "ai": " I cannot prescribe medication over the internet, but I can suggest some common treatments for melasma that you may want to discuss with your doctor.\n\n1. Hydroquinone: It's a topical cream that reduces the production of melanin, the pigment responsible for dark spots. Hydroquinone may be prescribed in different strengths, and it might take several months to see improvement.\n\n2. Retinoids: Topical retinoids like tretinoin and adapalene can help reduce the appearance of melasma by increasing cell turnover and decreasing pigmentation. Combination therapies with hydroquinone and retinoids are often effective.\n\n3. Corticosteroids: In some cases, topical or injectable corticosteroids may be used to help diminish inflammation and the darkening of the melasma. However, they can cause side effects, so they’re not first-line treatments.\n\n4. Azelaic acid: A topical medication that can be used in combination with hydroquinone or alone. It hinders the formation of pigment and may help lighten dark spots.\n\n5. Chemical peels and microdermabrasion: These are skin treatments that help slough off the outer layers of the skin. They can be useful in reducing the appearance of melasma, but they may also cause irritation and redness.\n\nSince melasma can be stubborn and often requires a combination of treatments, it's crucial to consult a dermatologist or healthcare professional for a customized treatment plan. Remember, I strongly advise against discontinuing any prescribed treatments without consulting your doctor first, as stopping the use of your current medications can lead to worsening of your melasma."}

{"question": "Q. Kindly have a look on the report regarding glomus jugulare and advise.Hello doctor,Kindly have a look on my mother's report regarding glomus jugulare and advise.", "human": "Hello. This is a slow-growing benign noncancerous tumor of the base of the skull extending to the neck with a close relationship to the important vein, artery, and nerves of the brain. The scan reports indicate that this is a fairly large tumor and this will require a team of neurosurgeon and head-neck surgeon (ENT surgeon) for the surgery. She needs to be evaluated for control of BP and diabetes before surgery can be planned. Wishing her a speedy recovery.", "ai": " I'm an AI language model and not a doctor, but I can try to help you understand some of the information in the report about your mother's diagnosis of Glomus Jugulare. Glomus Jugulare is a type of tumor that arises from the glomus body, which is a part of the parasympathetic nervous system located in the temporal bone of the skull near the jugular foramen.\n\nThe report mentions several findings that indicate Glomus Jugulare:\n\n1. \"Bony erosion of temporal bone and jugular foramen\": This refers to the tumor breaking down or eroding the bone of the temporal bone and the jugular foramen.\n\n2. \"Jugular vein thrombosis\": Thrombosis means the formation of a blood clot. In this case, the jugular vein, which is near the tumor, has a blood clot. This can lead to headaches and other symptoms.\n\n3. \"Gadolinium enhancement\": Gadolinium is a contrast agent that is used in magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans to enhance the visibility of certain structures in the body. In this case, the MRI shows enhancement in the region of the tumor, indicating that it is likely to be a vascular tumor like Glomus Jugulare.\n\n4. \"Mass effect on the brainstem\": This means that the tumor is pushing on the brainstem, which can cause various symptoms such as hearing loss, balance problems, and facial paralysis.\n\nYour mother's treatment options for Glomus Jugulare may include surgery to remove the tumor, radiation therapy, or a combination of both. The specific treatment plan will depend on the size and location of the tumor, as well as your mother's overall health and other factors. She may also need ongoing monitoring and follow-up care to manage any complications or recurrences.\n\nI would recommend that you have your mother consult with a neurosurgeon or an otolaryngologist (ear, nose, and throat specialist) who specializes in treating skull base tumors for further evaluation and treatment recommendations. They will be able to provide the most accurate and up-to-date information based on your mother's individual circumstances."}

It's important to note that I cannot provide a definitive diagnosis based on your description alone, and you should consult a healthcare professional for an accurate assessment. However, I can suggest some possible explanations for your symptoms:\n\n1. Anxiety or stress: Shivering and chest pain can be physical manifestations of anxiety or stress. The solar plexus area is where the body's \"fight or flight\" response is located, so feelings of fear or apprehension can cause involuntary shivering and discomfort in this area.\n2. Gallbladder problems: The solar plexus area is also near the gallbladder, and issues with this organ can cause symptoms such as shivering, chest pain, and back pain. Gallstones or gallbladder inflammation can cause these symptoms, and you should consult a healthcare professional if you suspect this may be the case.\n3. Muscle strain or spasms: The pressure or pain you describe when material rubs against your skin could be due to muscle strain or spasms in the affected areas. This can be caused by repetitive motions or heavy lifting.\n4. Costochondritis: Costochondritis is inflammation of the cartilage that connects the ribs to the breastbone. This condition can cause chest pain and tenderness, especially when pressure is applied to the area or when taking deep breaths.\n5. Pulmonary conditions: Chest pain and discomfort can also be symptoms of various pulmonary conditions, such as pneumonia or pleurisy. If you have other symptoms such as fever, coughing, or difficulty breathing, seek medical attention right away.\n\nAgain, this is not an exhaustive list, and there may be other causes of your symptoms. It's important to consult a healthcare professional for a proper diagnosis and treatment plan. In the meantime, you can try some self-care measures such as practicing relaxation techniques, avoiding caffeine and alcohol, and taking warm baths or showers to ease muscle tension."}

{"question": "What does elevated ESR and CRP indicate?My daughter has had a low grade fever for approximately two weeks.  She had a similar fever one month ago.  Her Ped ran some blood levels, and told me her ESR and CRP were elevated.  Her other symptoms include a mild cough, and nasal congestion, but she also suffers from seasonal allergies. What could this indicate?", "human": "Hi,Thanks for asking.Based on your clinical history and query, my opinion is as follows:1. Presence of elevated ESR and CRP indicates inflammation.2. Cause appears to be allergic leading to nasal congestion.3. High elevated levels above more than 100 is serious.Hope it helps.Any further queries, happy to help again.", "ai": " Elevated erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) and C-reactive protein (CRP) levels in your daughter's blood work can be indicators of inflammation in the body. These markers are often used to assess the presence and degree of inflammation, particularly when an infection is suspected.\n\nGiven her symptoms of a low-grade fever, nasal congestion, and mild cough, it's possible that she has an infection, such as a bacterial or viral one. However, it's important to note that seasonal allergies can also cause symptoms like nasal congestion and a persistent cough, which might contribute to elevated ESR and CRP levels.\n\nIf your daughter's symptoms are consistent with seasonal allergies, her pediatrician may consider other factors, such as the timing and duration of the symptoms, physical examination findings, and other lab results, before coming to a definitive conclusion regarding an infection.\n\nAdditionally, other conditions, such as autoimmune disorders, malignancies, and various other inflammatory processes, can result in elevated ESR and CRP levels. Your daughter's pediatrician will likely consider additional diagnostic tests if they suspect an underlying condition other than an infection or allergies.\n\nIt's essential to follow up with her doctor for proper evaluation and advice regarding her symptoms and laboratory results. They can help determine the most appropriate course of action based on the available information."}

Wishing your child good health.", "ai": " I cannot definitively say whether Alerid will help treat your daughter's dry cough without consulting a healthcare professional. While Alerid contains ingredients, such as honey, which may soothe a cough, it's important to consider the cause and severity of the cough before administering any medication. If your daughter's cough persists or worsens, I would recommend contacting your daughter's pediatrician for advice, as they have a better understanding of her overall health and medical history. In the meantime, you can try providing her with plenty of fluids, keeping her environment humidified, and ensuring she gets adequate rest to help alleviate her symptoms."}
{"question": "Can Folinext D and Matilda Forte be taken together?Dear Dr., I recently suffered a miscarriage. I am now given folinext D and Matilda forte. I am thelessamia minor and have low level of B12. Can folinext D and matilda forte be taken together. I have this doubt as the formula has many things in common so will it cause some problem?", "human": "Hi, Based on the findings of low vitamin B-12 your doctor has advised you take multivitamin supplement maltida forte which contains substantial amount of vitamin B-12 and folic acid. Folinext-D is an omega-3 fatty acid is also found to be useful for patients suffering from thalassemia. Continue taking them as prescribed. Hope I have answered your query. Let me know if I can assist you further. Take care Regards,Dr. Mohammed Taher Ali", "ai": " I am an artificial intelligence and cannot provide medical advice. However, I can try to help answer your question based on available information.\n\nFolinic acid (found in Folinext D) and methylcobaltermin (found in Matilda Forte) are both forms of folate, a B-vitamin that plays an essential role in various bodily functions, including cell growth and development. Both folinic acid and methylcobaltermin help to prevent or treat folate deficiency, which is common among pregnant women and individuals with certain medical conditions.\n\nThere is no known interaction between folinic acid and methylcobaltermin that would make it dangerous or problematic to take them together. In fact, taking folic acid and methylfolate (like that found in Matilda Forte) together can actually be beneficial for individuals with certain genetic variations that affect their ability to convert folic acid to its active form in the body.\n\nThat being said, it is always best to consult your healthcare provider or pharmacist for personalized medical advice. They can evaluate your medical history, current medications, and nutritional needs to recommend the most appropriate supplementation plan for you. In general, taking these supplements as prescribed by your healthcare provider is the safest way to ensure optimal health."}

Good day", "ai": " I'm an AI language model and not a doctor, but I can try to provide you some general suggestions based on your description. If you're experiencing a recurrence of Vertigo symptoms after a year, it would be a good idea to follow up with your healthcare provider for an evaluation. Here are some potential steps you could discuss with your doctor:\n\n1. Review your current medication: Although Meclizine helped you manage the symptoms last year, it might be necessary to explore other options if the Vertigo is persisting. Your doctor may consider adjusting the dosage, prescribing a different medication or a combination of medications.\n\n2. Re-evaluate the cause of Vertigo: Vertigo is caused by a problem with the inner ear or the vestibular system. A recurrence could be due to an underlying condition that wasn't properly treated, or new trigger factors. Your doctor may request further tests like MRI, ENG, or Vestibular function tests, to rule out any possible causes.\n\n3. Lifestyle modifications: Simple lifestyle modifications can sometimes help manage the symptoms of Vertigo. Some possible recommendations include:\n   a. Avoiding positions that worsen the symptoms.\n   b. Practicing good posture.\n   c. Maintaining a healthy and balanced diet.\n   d. Getting regular exercise, especially low impact activities like walking or swimming.\n   e. Limiting caffeine and alcohol intake.\n   f. Getting enough sleep and minimizing stress.\n\n4. Alternative therapies: Therapies like acupuncture, Chiropractic care or Massage can also be beneficial for some people with Vertigo. However, always consult with your doctor before trying any alternative treatments.\n\n5. Support groups: Consider joining a support group for people with Vertigo. Connecting with others who are going through similar experiences can provide emotional support and practical tips for managing the condition.\n\nKeep in mind that everyone's experience with Vertigo is unique, and what works best for one person may not work for another. Working closely with your healthcare provider and following their guidance is crucial for effectively managing your Vertigo symptoms."}

TIA, or transient ischemic attack, is often referred to as a \"mini-stroke,\" and it is caused by a temporary disruption of blood flow to a part of the brain. Seizure-like symptoms can occur as a result of a TIA or as a separate condition.\n\nThe medications prescribed to your father are typically used to manage the symptoms and risks associated with his condition. Levetiracetam (Levipil) is an anticonvulsant medication used to control seizures. Diazepam (Lobazam) is a benzodiazepine sedative-hypnotic medication used to treat seizures, muscle spasms, and anxiety. Simvastatin and Atorvastatin (Statorasp) are statins used to lower cholesterol levels and reduce the risk of heart attacks and strokes.\n\nRegarding the long-term side effects, the following are some common side effects of the medications your father is taking:\n\n- Levetiracetam: side effects may include dizziness, drowsiness, weakness, confusion, memory problems, or agitation. Rarely, it can cause serious side effects such as allergic reactions or liver damage.\n- Diazepam: side effects may include drowsiness, dizziness, weakness, and unsteadiness. Long-term use can lead to dependence and withdrawal symptoms.\n- Simvastatin and Atorvastatin: side effects may include muscle pain, weakness, or tenderness, liver damage, and memory or cognitive problems.\n\nAs for the prognosis and the duration of the treatment, the outcome of TIA with seizure-like symptoms depends on the underlying cause. In some cases, the condition may resolve on its own with appropriate treatment. However, in others, it may require long-term management with medications and lifestyle modifications to prevent future attacks. Your father's doctor is the best person to provide an accurate prognosis and determine the duration of the treatment based on the individual circumstances.\n\nYour father should follow up with his doctor regularly to monitor his condition and adjust the treatment plan as necessary. Additionally, he should maintain a healthy lifestyle, which includes a healthy diet, regular exercise, avoiding smoking and alcohol, and managing stress. This can help reduce the risk of future attacks and improve overall health and well-being."}
{"question": "Suggest remedy for seizures due to stressMy daughter is 27 years old and has had 10 seizures since March 2014. Testing has been done, no physical reason for the seizures.

There is some evidence to suggest that Theanine may be beneficial in reducing stress and anxiety, but more research is needed to confirm these findings.\n\nRegarding the interaction between Theanine and Keppra, there is currently no evidence to suggest that they will interact negatively with each other. However, it is always important to speak with your daughter's healthcare provider before adding any new supplements to her regimen.\n\nTheanine is generally considered safe and well-tolerated, but it can cause some side effects, such as drowsiness, headache, and gastrointestinal symptoms, in some people. It is important to note that theanine supplements are not regulated by the FDA, so it is essential to purchase them from a reputable source.\n\nOne possible way to help manage stress and anxiety, in addition to Theanine and medication, is to encourage your daughter to practice stress-reducing techniques, such as deep breathing exercises, meditation, or yoga. These practices can help her relax and may help reduce the number of seizures she experiences. It might also be helpful for her to explore other lifestyle modifications, such as getting enough sleep, eating a healthy diet, and engaging in regular physical activity. Additionally, she may benefit from working with a mental health professional, such as a psychologist or therapist, who can help her develop coping strategies for managing stress and anxiety."}

A lump under the armpit that is painful, produces pulse, and smells could be a sign of an infected lymph node or a bacterial abscess, which is more serious than a simple boil. A boil usually forms as a result of a bacterial infection in a hair follicle, but an infected lymph node can be caused by various underlying conditions, including bacterial or viral infections, or cancer.\n\nThe fact that you had a similar experience before with a lump under your right armpit and it turned out to be a boil doesn't necessarily mean that the current lump is the same thing, as different parts of the body can have distinct health issues. It's important to receive an accurate diagnosis so that proper treatment can be administered.\n\nIn the meantime, you can take some general precautions to help alleviate any discomfort, as well as potential signs of infection:\n\n1. Keep the area clean: Gently clean the area around the lump with warm water and mild soap to help prevent the spread of infection.\n2. Avoid scratching or squeezing the lump: This can worsen the infection and potentially spread bacteria to other areas.\n3. Use a warm compress: Applying a warm compress to the area for 10-15 minutes at a time, several times a day, can help reduce any pain and swelling. Be sure to use a clean cloth between your skin and the heat source.\n4. Stay hydrated: Drink plenty of water and other fluids, as dehydration can weaken your immune system and make it harder for your body to fight infection.\n5. Get plenty of rest: Your body needs energy to fight an infection, so getting enough rest and avoiding strenuous activities can help you recover more quickly.\n\nRemember, this advice is not a substitute for professional medical care, and it's essential that you have the lump evaluated by a healthcare professional as soon as possible. In the meantime, you might find it helpful to make an appointment with your doctor or an urgent care clinic, depending on the severity of your symptoms."}

I am wondering if switching his medication will help This began after his exposure to antipsychotics. He first began taking risperdal consta in Jan. 2016 and developed this tic in October 2016. In December 2016 we switched to invega sustenna and I think it made it worse.", "human": "hi and thanks for question.many a times antipsychotic drugs such kind of tics in pt when pt took it for long time. I will suggest that either decrease the dose of drug or start benzhexol or tic stop drug for some times and meanwhile consult psychiatrist near by u. thanks", "ai": " Vocal tics are known side effects of some antipsychotic medications, including first-generation drugs like Haloperidol and Risperidone (the active ingredient in Risperdal), and to a lesser extent, second-generation antipsychotics like Paliperidone (the active ingredient in Invega Sustenna).\n\nHowever, the exact relationship between antipsychotics and vocal tics is not well understood, and not all individuals who take these medications will develop this side effect. Some researchers believe that the tics may be related to the medication's blocking effect on dopamine receptors in the brain, while others think they might be an idiosyncratic reaction to the drug.\n\nIf your brother's vocal tic began or worsened after starting Invega Sustenna, it's worth discussing this with his healthcare provider. They may consider trying a different medication or adjusting the dosage to see if that helps. However, it's also important to consider other possible causes of the tic, such as stress, anxiety, or an underlying medical condition. Your brother's healthcare provider can help determine whether the tic is related to the medication or something else.\n\nIt's also worth noting that switching medications can sometimes come with initial adjustment periods, and side effects can sometimes worsen before they improve. However, if the tic is severe or causing significant distress or impairment, it may be worth considering other treatment options. Your brother's healthcare provider can help evaluate the risks and benefits of different treatments and help develop a plan to manage the vocal tic and his underlying mental health condition."}
{"question": "Suggest remedy for pain in knuckleshello, i got hit in the hand by a baseball today while i was batting. my knuckles use to look identical but now two of them look indented/smashed down, there s slight pain and i can still move my fingers and open my hand but will my knuckles go back to normal? how long is the normal healing time", "human": "Hi there.You could have got your fingers dislocated at the knuckles.

In most cases, the knuckles will return to their normal shape as the swelling subsides. This can take anywhere from a few days to a few weeks.\n\nTo help alleviate the pain and encourage healing, you can try the following remedies:\n\n1. Rest: Avoid using the hand as much as possible. Minimizing the activity will help the injury heal faster.\n2. Ice: Apply an ice pack to the affected area for 15-20 minutes at a time, 2-3 times a day. This can help reduce swelling and alleviate pain.\n3. Compression: Wrap the hand with an elastic bandage or using a protective splint to help reduce swelling and hold the hand in a position of comfortable rest.\n4. Elevation: Keep the hand elevated when possible to help reduce swelling and minimize pain.\n5.

The nail looks like it is normal. What should we do?", "human": "Hello. Your mother seems to have paronychia. Paronychia is the infection of the finger or toenail along the edge. It might be a bacterial or fungal infection. Accordingly, she will require a topical antibiotic or antifungal application. If the infection is severe, she might have to take oral medications. Please get a complete blood count done and also check her diabetes status and revert with reports.", "ai": " I'm not a doctor, but I can suggest some steps you can take to help address your mother's issue with a foul odor coming from under her toenail. However, it's important to consult with her healthcare provider or a podiatrist to get an accurate diagnosis and treatment plan. Here are some general steps that may be helpful:\n\n1. Wash her foot regularly: Make sure her foot is clean to help reduce odor. Use warm water and mild soap, and dry thoroughly, especially between the toes where bacteria can thrive.\n\n2. Keep her feet dry: Moisture can encourage bacteria growth, which can contribute to foot odor. Make sure her feet are completely dry after bathing or showering, and use powders or antiperspirants to help keep her feet dry.\n\n3. Trim her toenails: Make sure her toenails are trimmed regularly to prevent them from pressing into the skin and creating an environment that can lead to infection and odor.\n\n4. Check for infection: If the odor persists, there may be an infection under the nail. Look for signs of redness, swelling, or pus. If you suspect an infection, help your mother see a healthcare provider or podiatrist as soon as possible.\n\n5. Diabetic foot care: If your mother is diabetic, it's important to pay extra attention to foot care to prevent complications. Make sure she's wearing appropriate shoes and socks, and check for any signs of cuts, sores, or infection.\n\n6. Fungal infection: A foul smell from a toenail could also be a sign of a fungal infection. Your mother's healthcare provider or podiatrist can prescribe antifungal medication if necessary.\n\n7. Proper footwear: Make sure your mother is wearing shoes that fit properly and allow her feet to breathe. Shoes that are too tight, too loose, or made of synthetic materials can contribute to foot odor and other foot problems.\n\n8. Diet: Certain foods can contribute to foot odor. Encourage your mother to eat a healthy diet and avoid foods that cause bad breath, as these same foods can also contribute to foot odor.\n\nRemember to consult with your mother's healthcare provider or a podiatrist for advice specific to her situation."}

I can understand your concern. Terminal stage cancer pain is one of the most cumbersome pain. Routine painkiller drugs will not help much. Patient needs centrally acting painkiller drugs. Transdermal patch of fentanyl (centrally acting painkiller) is available on prescription. It gives 48-72 hours pain relief. It will slowly release the drug and very effective in pain relief due to cancer. Since it is prescribed drug, you need doctor 's prescription for this. Hope I have solved your query. Wishing good health to your father. Thanks.", "ai": " I'm an AI language model and not a doctor, but I can provide you with some general information about using patches for pain relief in advanced cancer stages. I strongly recommend consulting a healthcare professional, preferably your father's oncologist or palliative care specialist, for the most accurate and personalized advice.\n\nOne common type of patch used for pain relief in cancer patients is a Transdermal Fentanyl Patch. Fentanyl is a strong opioid medication that can help alleviate cancer-related pain when applied through a patch directly to the skin. These patches are usually prescribed for patients with chronic pain that isn't well-managed with oral pain medications.\n\nFentanyl patches are available by prescription and will be dispensed through a pharmacy. In order to use the patch, follow these steps:\n\n1. Apply the patch to a clean, dry, hairless area on the body, typically the upper body or arms. Avoid applying the patch to irritated, sunburned, or scarred skin.\n2. Press the patch firmly onto the skin for about 30 seconds, ensuring good contact for maximal absorption.\n3. Once applied, leave the patch in place for a continuous period, as directed by your healthcare professional. The duration can vary depending on your father's pain level and tolerance, as well as the specific dosing instructions provided with the patch.\n4. Follow the specific instructions for the disposal of used patches to prevent accidental exposure to children and pets.\n\nIt's essential to monitor your father's pain level and Side effects while using the patch, and communicate this information with his healthcare team. Doing so will help them adjust the dosing and frequency as needed to ensure the best possible pain relief while minimizing any potential side effects.\n\nAs with any medication or treatment, it's crucial to discuss the risks, benefits, and potential side effects with his healthcare professional to make an informed decision."}

As per available data, patients get wheelchair bound in about 20-30 years after first symptom. patients also have few associated features other than nervous system. Friedreich ataxia itself not lead to death of patient, instead involvement of other organs of body can increase morbidity and mortality.", "ai": " Friedreich's Ataxia (FA) is a progressive genetic disorder that affects the nerves and causes difficulties in coordination and balance, among other symptoms. The rate of progression and severity of FA can vary greatly from person to person. Some individuals may experience relatively mild symptoms for many years, while others may experience a more rapid decline.\n\nRegarding your specific concerns, it is important to note that I am an AI language model and not a doctor.

{"question": "What causes bowel movements odor with flatulence pain?My 6 week old nephew has the most horrid bowel movements I have ever smelled. He was born at 33 weeks, and has had to have his formula changes several times due to extreme gas pains. I noticed today that his entire body smells like his feces- which stinks like rotten eggs. Should we be concerned about this? He is currently on soy formula (started today) to see if that decreases his tummy issues.", "human": "Hi... abnormal body odour in infants is suggestive of some inborn errors of metabolism.I suggest you consult your pediatrician regarding this as there are filter paper blot tests now available to screen for such disorders.Regards - Dr. Sumanth", "ai": " The strong odor and increased flatulence in your nephew's bowel movements could be due to several reasons, including:\n\n1. Formula intolerance: He has undergone frequent formula changes due to gas pains, suggesting an intolerance or sensitivity to certain ingredients. This can lead to increased production of malodorous gases. The unpleasant smell of the stool and flatulence could be an indicator of an unabsorbed fat called long-chain fatty acids (LCFAs), which are by-products of malabsorbed fat in the digestive tract of infants with formula intolerance. The soy formula might help alleviate these symptoms, but if they persist, please consult a pediatrician.\n\n2. Formula malabsorption: A malabsorption condition could be responsible for the stinky bowel movements and excessive gas pains. Malabsorption occurs when the body fails to extract essential nutrients from the diet properly. This can cause an overgrowth of bacteria in the gut, producing foul-smelling gases. A thorough diagnostic evaluation by a healthcare professional may be needed to rule out any underlying medical conditions causing malabsorption.\n\n3. Transition stages: Infants, especially those born prematurely, undergo several adjustments as they adapt to the world outside the womb. They may experience a fluctuation of symptoms like bowel movements as they transition from one developmental stage to another. Such transitions might involve formula changes, adjusting to new textures, or even growing accustomed to new feeding practices such as bottle-feeding or breastfeeding, all of which can temporarily exacerbate gas and bad odor issues.\n\n4. Normal Infant Development: It is not entirely uncommon for newborns to have strong-smelling bowel movements. As the infant's digestive system develops, the bacteria within their gut begin to break down foods more efficiently. This process can generate more gases and potentially create unpleasant odors. Most infants' diets consist primarily of milk, which is relatively rich in protein that can cause an increased production of methane, a gas associated with a sulfur-like odor.\n\nRegardless of the underlying cause, it's essential that you keep track of your nephew's symptoms. If you have concerns about the severity or frequency of his gastrointestinal symptoms, it's recommended that you consult a healthcare professional or pediatrician, who will evaluate his overall health and may propose potential solutions, such as a prescription formula, dietary modifications, or medication. In the meantime, frequent burping and gentle massaging of the tummy can help relieve some of the discomfort and flatulence caused by the strong-smelling bowel movements. Remember, if the issue persists despite the change to soy formula, consult a pediatrician for further evaluation."}

{"question": "Could pain in lower back and abdomen after unprotected sex mean pregnancy?I have been trying to get pregnant but we only just started trying about 2 weeks ago.  We had sex 3 times without a condom.  Now for the past 4 days ive been experiencing lower back pain and abdominal pain. It feels like my period will be here tomorrow but it just never comes. But i also feel its way too soon to have any pregnancy symptoms.", "human": "Hallow Dear,The cardinal and first symptom of pregnancy is missed period. Though it is not absolutely clear from your history whether you have missed your period or not, the impression I got is you have not missed period. Even if you have missed period, the other following symptoms start appearing after about 10 days or so after missed period. These symptoms are:1. Nausea & Vomiting and Pica2. Frequent urination3. Breast symptoms: Engorgement with tenderness, dark discolouration of nipples and areola with increase in areolar size, Montgomery's tubercles under areola and secretions from the nipples. Pain is not a feature of normal uneventful pregnancy without any risk. Appearance of pain anytime during pregnancy is indicative of some risk to the pregnancy. If you have missed your period, you can confirm the diagnosis of pregnancy by performing pregnancy test on overnight first early morning urine sample 8-10 days after missed period. Earlier these tests may give false negative results. Alternatively, you may opt for Beta hCG test which gives reliable results even few days before missing period. Abdominal pain with low back ache is a classic feature of amoebic colitis which can be treated with Metronidazole. In this condition, the stools are stained with blood and/or mucous. I hope this helps you. Dr. Nishikant Shrotri", "ai": " It is possible that lower back and abdominal pain could be a sign of early pregnancy, as hormonal changes can cause these symptoms. However, it is also common to experience discomfort or pain in the lower back and abdomen during or after sex, especially if it has been a while since the last time or if the position was uncomfortable. Additionally, it is too early to definitively determine if you are pregnant based on these symptoms alone. A missed period is the most reliable indicator of pregnancy, but a home pregnancy test may provide more accurate information. If you are concerned or experiencing severe pain, it is always a good idea to consult with a healthcare provider for their evaluation and advice."}
{"question": "What is the life of incisor that has been root canal treatedHello Doctor. I have got my front two incisor teeth root canal treated and crowned and its been 10 years and there is no problem at all. I want to ask that what is the life expectancy of the incisor that has been root canal treated and crowned. also tell me about the next options one have after the failing of root canal treated teeth", "human": "Thanks for using Health Care Magic.Read your query.It is very good to know that you have a good treatment in relation to the upper teeth.Coming to the expectancy , there is no known limit as to how much a treated tooth lasts. It depends on a range of factors including how successful the treatment was done, oral health status and oral hygiene conditions and also the general health of a person.So it is good you don't worry about your tooth as long as there is no problem in it. If in future if there is any pain or swelling, you can go ahead with re treatment and it will be decided only at that time as to what will be the most appropriate one.Hope this was useful to you .Thanks and regards", "ai": " A root canal treated and crowned incisor tooth can last for many years with proper care and maintenance. According to various studies, the success rate of root canal treatment is around 90% or higher for permanent teeth over a 5-year period, and the survival rate with a crown can be up to 95% at 10 years. However, individual outcomes may vary based on factors such as the extent of the initial decay or injury, the complexity of the root canal system, and the patient's oral hygiene and follow-up care.\n\nRegarding your second question, when a root canal treated tooth fails, there are several options that may be considered based on the underlying cause of failure and the condition of the tooth:\n\n1. Retreatment: In some cases, the tooth may be retreatable, meaning that the root canal treatment can be redone. Retreatment is typically recommended if the previous treatment was inadequate or if new infection or inflammation is present.\n2. Endodontic surgery: Another option for a failing root canal treated tooth is endodontic surgery, which involves accessing the root canal system through an incision in the gum tissue and performing procedures such as removing calcium deposits or treating apical periodontitis.\n3. Extraction and replacement: If neither retreatment nor endodontic surgery are viable options, the tooth may need to be extracted and replaced with a dental implant, bridge, or removable denture. The decision to extract a tooth should be based on a thorough evaluation of the tooth and surrounding structures, as well as the patient's individual needs and preferences.\n\nIt's important to note that regular dental check-ups and good oral hygiene practices are critical for maintaining the health and longevity of any tooth, including those that have been root canal treated and crowned. If you have any concerns about your teeth or their restoration, it's best to consult your dentist for an evaluation and individualized advice."}
{"question": "Cellular and deep penetrating fibrous histiocytoma, CD43 positive in blood vessels.

He said he is confident about the outcome but local recurrence can happen. Is this cancer?  It said in the report it was CD43 positive in blood vessels.", "human": "Fibrous histiocytoma is a type of tumor that does not spread to other parts of the body. However it is a locally aggressive tumor and recurs locally even after adequate surgery. So, recurrence at the same site after inadequate surgery is almost sure shot. Thus, a wide excision of the area is mandatory. As, i said, local recurrence can still happen, but the chances are much less. CD 43 positivity in this setting means nothing and doesnt change either the outcome or the treatment plan.", "ai": " Fibrous histiocytoma is a type of soft tissue tumor that can be benign or malignant. The cellular and deep penetrating type is more likely to be malignant, but not all of these tumors will progress to become cancer. The presence of CD43 positivity in blood vessels suggests that the tumor may have a higher potential for recurrence and may be more aggressive, but it does not definitively confirm that it is cancer. Your doctor's recommendation for a wider excision and his caution about the risk of local recurrence also indicates that there is some concern about the possibility of malignancy. You should discuss these findings and your doctor's recommendations with him or her in detail to better understand the implications for your health. It is important to follow your doctor's advice and have regular follow-up appointments to monitor for any signs of recurrence. Your doctor may also recommend additional tests or consultations with other medical specialists to help determine the exact nature of the tumor and the best course of treatment."}

Regards,Dr. Shinas Hussain,General & Family Physician", "ai": " Laser treatment for corns can provide relief and improvement in symptoms for many people, but it may not completely cure the corn in all cases. The effectiveness of laser treatment for corns depends on the size, location, and severity of the corn, as well as individual responses to treatment. If your husband's corn has not responded to other treatments for over 2 years, and he experiences significant pain and difficulty walking, laser treatment may be a consideration. However, it is essential to consult a podiatrist or a healthcare professional experienced in laser corn treatment to determine if it is the right option for him.

Contact your child's healthcare provider: Given the persistence of her fever and your concern, it would be best to contact her healthcare provider. They can assess her symptoms remotely and provide guidance on whether an in-person visit is necessary. Depending on the provider’s advice, you may consider bringing her to an urgent care center or an emergency department if her symptoms worsen.\n\n2. Hydration: Continue encouraging her to drink plenty of fluids, especially water, to help her stay hydrated.

Always follow the recommended dosage on the packaging and consult with your child's healthcare provider if you have any concerns.\n\n5. Comfort measures: Continue using cold compresses on her forehead to help bring down her temperature. You may also consider using a tepid sponge bath or running a fan in her room to help her feel more comfortable.\n\n6. Encourage good hygiene: Teach her to cover her mouth and nose when she coughs or sneezes to avoid spreading any infection to others in the household.\n\nIf her symptoms do not improve, or if she displays any other concerning symptoms such as difficulty breathing, severe abdominal pain, or chest pain, seek medical advice promptly."}

A benign tumor entangled in the brachial plexus can cause symptoms such as pain, numbness, or weakness in the affected area. The fact that your tumor has been present for ten years and causes severe pain, even if it is aggravated by stress, heat, or physical exhaustion, suggests that you may want to consider seeking a second opinion from a specialist, such as a neurosurgeon or a thoracic surgeon, who can evaluate your specific situation and provide you with the best treatment options.\n\nAlthough surgery can carry risks, it may be necessary to alleviate the severe pain and prevent further complications. Your healthcare team can discuss the risks and benefits of surgery with you and help you make an informed decision based on your individual needs.

Here are some possible causes:\n\n1. Lymph node: The most common cause of a painless neck lump is an enlarged lymph node. Lymph nodes are small, bean-shaped organs that filter out bacteria, viruses, and other harmful substances from the body. When an infection or disease is present, lymph nodes may swell up. However, if the lymph node persists even after the infection has cleared, it could be a sign of something more serious, such as cancer.\n2. Thyroid nodule: The thyroid gland is located in the front part of the neck, but it's possible to feel a thyroid nodule on the side of the neck, especially if it's large. Thyroid nodules are often benign, but they can sometimes be cancerous.\n3. Lipoma: Lipomas are benign fatty tumors that can occur anywhere in the body, including the neck. They are usually soft and easily movable, but some can be firm and hard.\n4. Cyst: A cyst is a closed, fluid-filled sac that can develop in various parts of the body. A neck cyst can occur in the thyroid gland, salivary glands, or other areas of the neck.\n5. Cancer: Although rare, a painless neck lump can be a sign of cancer, such as lymphoma, thyroid cancer, or head and neck cancer.\n\nIf the lump has been present for several weeks or months, and it's still there despite your doctor's assurance that it would go away on its own, it may be a good idea to follow up with your doctor or consider seeing a specialist for further evaluation. Your doctor may order additional tests, such as an ultrasound or a biopsy, to determine the cause of the lump and rule out any serious conditions."}

Some possible causes for hard lumps behind the ear or at the base of the head in young children include:\n\n1. Lymph nodes: Swollen lymph nodes can feel like hard lumps under the skin. They may be enlarged due to an infection or an immune response. If your daughter has a fever, sore throat, or other symptoms of illness, these lumps could be related.\n2. Lipomas: Lipomas are benign tumors made up of fat cells. They are usually soft to the touch but can sometimes be firm. Hard lipomas are less common. They typically don't cause symptoms and can develop anywhere in the body, including the head and neck.\n3. Cysts: Cysts can form due to numerous reasons, including infection or birth defects. They may feel hard or tender, depending on their contents. If the cyst is infected, your daughter might experience symptoms like redness, warmth, and pain.\n\nAgain, it's essential to have these lumps checked by a healthcare professional to rule out any serious conditions. If the lumps continue to concern you, consider seeking medical advice as soon as possible."}
{"question": "What is the cause of rashes in the legs, face and around pupils?my 2yrs son was suffering from cold and fever. we gave him 2-3 doses of combiflam syrup. we are seeing rashes in his legs face and somewhere around pupils. we r afraid of whether it is symptomps of dengu or not? as this is floatingaround surrounding. pls help", "human": "HelloThe fever with rash can be there in viral infection like dengue,measles,Coxsakie and other viruses.Combiflam contains ibuprofen and it causes platelet function abnormality.As many of the viral infection including dengue causes decreased platelet count I would suggest you to stop giving combiflam and to use paracetamol instead.Keep him hydrated well by giving fluids and feeds and consult a pediatrician for clinical examination and investigations to make a diagnosis and thus management accordingly.Regards", "ai": " I'm not a doctor, but I can try to help you gather some information and suggest some possible causes for your son's symptoms based on the information you've provided.\n\nThe appearance of rashes in different areas of the body, such as the legs, face, and around the pupils, coupled with a history of cold and fever, could be indicative of several conditions. One possibility is a viral infection, such as Fifth Disease, which can cause a rash on the cheeks, known as \"slapped cheek\" appearance, as well as a rash on the arms, legs, and trunk. Another possibility is a drug reaction to Combiflam syrup. Both Dengue fever and Combiflam can have symptoms that may include fever and rash. However, Dengue typically also comes with other symptoms such as severe headache, joint and muscle pain, and digestive symptoms.\n\nIf you're concerned about the possibility of Dengue fever, it's important to note that this condition is typically transmitted through the bite of an infected mosquito, and it's more common in tropical and subtropical areas. The symptoms usually appear 4-7 days after being bitten by an infected mosquito.\n\nRegarding the rash caused by Combiflam, it's important to note that this medication contains ibuprofen and amoxicillin. Ibuprofen is a nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID), and amoxicillin is an antibiotic. Some people may experience an allergic reaction to these drugs, which can cause a rash. If you suspect that the rash is due to a drug reaction, stop administering the medication and consult a healthcare professional for further evaluation.\n\nIf you're still unsure about the cause of the rash, it's important to seek medical advice from a healthcare professional. They will be able to perform a thorough evaluation and provide an accurate diagnosis based on your son's symptoms and medical history. In the meantime, try to keep your son comfortable by ensuring he stays hydrated and rests as much as possible. If the rash is itchy, you can try applying a cool compress or calamine lotion to help soothe the skin."}
{"question": "Periodic excruciating lower abdominal pain, failure in conception, scan done. What can it be?Hi Doc For the past 4 years I have been struggling with excruciating low abdominal pains. I get it every few months and its soo bad that I am completely bed bound for few days. It has no link to when I m on my period and after many scans the doctors dont know what it could be. I am trying for kids now too and I m not able to fall pregnant. What can it be?", "human": "Hi thanks for your question.Your having periodic excruciating pain lower abdomen and unable to conceive.You’re all ultra sound reports are normal.Monitor your pain, if you feel pain 12 to 14 days after your periods, then it is pain due to ovulation and is called as Mittelschmerz.The other condition which gives you this periodic pain could be early stage endometriosis not picked up by ultra sound and needs laparoscopic examination.Hope I answered your question.", "ai": " I'm an AI language model and not a doctor, but I can try and help you understand some possible causes for your symptoms based on the medical information provided. However, please note that this information should not be used as a substitute for professional medical advice.\n\nYour description of frequent, severe lower abdominal pain with no apparent link to menstruation and no clear diagnosis after scans, suggests the possibility of a few conditions. Here are some possibilities:\n\n1. Endometriosis: This condition occurs when the tissue that normally lines the inside of your uterus (endometrium) grows outside of it. The displaced tissue can cause irritation, inflammation and formation of scar tissue, leading to painful periods, infertility, and chronic pelvic pain. Endometriosis can be difficult to diagnose definitively, as the only definitive test is a laparoscopy (a surgical procedure).\n\n2. Pelvic Inflammatory Disease (PID): This is an infection of the reproductive organs in women. It can be caused by bacteria that enter the reproductive system, often through sexually transmitted infections. Symptoms include pelvic pain, often worse after sex, and can also include other symptoms such as fever, irregular periods, and pain during urination or bowel movements.\n\n3. Irritable Bowel Syndrome (IBS): While IBS typically causes pain and bloating in the upper abdomen, it is possible for it to affect the lower abdomen as well. IBS can also cause trouble with conception and fertility.\n\n4. Adenomyosis: This condition is similar to endometriosis, but instead of the endometrial tissue growing outside the uterus, it grows inside the uterine wall. This can cause painful menstruation, heavy bleeding, and chronic pelvic pain.\n\n5. Gynecological cancers such as ovarian or cervical cancer: While rare, persistent pelvic pain and difficulty conceiving can be early signs of these cancers. However, these conditions are usually diagnosed via symptoms such as unexplained weight loss, bloating, and abnormal vaginal bleeding.\n\nIt is important to remember that these are just possibilities and that only a healthcare professional can diagnose your condition. Please consult with a doctor for a proper evaluation and treatment plan. In the meantime, try to keep a record of your symptoms, including their start and end time, severity, and any accompanying symptoms. This information can be helpful in guiding your doctor to a diagnosis."}
{"question": "Are Paternia and Wysolone helpfull in Infertility ?I am 34 yrs old. I have low (13.5 million) sperm count with nil motility. My scan report says light Varicocele on the left testis. I was prescribed with Paternia & Wysolone tablet. In what way Paternia and Wysolone helps in my case?", "human": "HiWelcome to HealthcareMagicYour sperm count is low and absent motility is not encouraging at all. Paternia is a nutritional supplement and is also given as an adjuvant for many other treatments. It contains co enzyme Q, carnitine and lycopene which have antioxidant properties which may improve sperm parameters. Wysolone (Prednisolone) is not a drug which treats infertility per say but it can help treat infertility if there is any inflammation causing the infertility.The number of days and the dosage will be best decided by your doctor as he will know the exact reason why it is being administered. Take care.", "ai": " I am an artificial intelligence language model and do not have the ability to diagnose or prescribe medical treatments. I can, however, provide some information about the medications you mentioned, Paternia and Wysolone, and how they might be used in the context of infertility caused by low sperm count and varicocele.\n\nPaternia is a brand name for a compound called Coenzyme Q10. Coenzyme Q10 is a naturally occurring antioxidant that is produced in the human body and is also found in some foods. It is involved in the production of energy in the cells and also has antioxidant properties that help protect the cells from damage. Infertility specialists may recommend Coenzyme Q10 supplements as it has been suggested that it may improve sperm quality and motility, particularly in men with varicoceles. However, there is limited scientific evidence to support these claims.\n\nWysolone is a brand name for the medication Prednisolone. Prednisolone is a corticosteroid medication that is used to reduce inflammation and suppress the immune system. It may be prescribed in cases of infertility due to varicoceles to reduce swelling and inflammation in the testicles. This, in turn, may help improve sperm production and function. However, the long-term use of corticosteroids may have side effects, so it is important to discuss this with your doctor.\n\nIt is important to note that each individual case is unique, and your doctor will consider various factors when determining the most appropriate treatment for your specific situation. I strongly recommend consulting with a qualified healthcare professional for accurate and personalized medical advice."}
{"question": "Why did i get pain in my hip and groin after jogging?I went jogging last night and when I got back to the house I got a horrible pain in my hip and groin.. I just brushed it off and went inside and drank some water and showered. I went to bed and when I got up I couldn't lift my leg to get back into bed and I could barely walk. What is going on?", "human": "Your description of symptoms suggest an pain over a short period. This can typically happen if there was a pulled muscle/ligaments during running, the risk being greater if there was no warm-up and stretching done before jogging. Also if you started jogging after a gap of few weeks, that may result in acute muscle strain. You need to take rest and avoid further jogging and take pain medicines like Diclofenac and paracetamol combination twice daily for 2-3 days.", "ai": " It is possible that you have experienced an injury while jogging, such as a hip flexor strain, a groin strain, or even a hernia. These conditions can cause pain in the hip and groin area, making it difficult to move the leg. It is important to rest the affected area to allow it to heal. Icing the area can help reduce inflammation and relieve pain. You may also consider taking over-the-counter pain medications to help manage the discomfort. If the pain persists or worsens, it is recommended that you see a doctor to have a proper evaluation and diagnosis. In the meantime, try to avoid activities that aggravate the pain and avoid putting too much weight on the affected leg."}
{"question": "What does questionable infiltrates upper left lobe mean?Hi. I had a medical examinations last month and the result was QUESTIONABLE INFILTRATES UPPER LEFT LOBE and I retake the xray test, the result was APICOLORDIC VIEW SUGGESTED FOR FURTHER EVALUATION . What does this mean? I hope you could find an answer to this problem. Please give me suggestions for what I can do with this! Thanks Doctor!", "human": "Thanks for your question on HCM.Routinely chest x ray is taken in PA (PosteroAnterior) view. So in this view the apices of both lungs are not clearly visualised. The bony structures like firat two ribs and clavicle can obstruct the view and so upper lobes can not be visualised properly and hence reporting is not accurate. So to overcome this, apicolordotic view is taken. In this chest x ray is not taken in PA view. It is taken in such a way that bony structures are not hindering apices and clear view of apices (upper lobes) is possible. So it is modification of PA view to get better and accurate view of upper lobes.So get it done.", "ai": " I'm not a doctor, but I can try to help you understand what these medical terms mean based on the information provided. It's important to note that I'm not able to provide medical advice or suggestions for further action, but I can provide some context and potential next steps based on the information you've given.\n\n\"Questionable infiltrates upper left lobe\" is a term used to describe an area of the upper left lobe of the lung that looks abnormal on an x-ray or CT scan. The term \"infiltrates\" refers to a collection of fluid, tissue, or cells that have accumulated in an area where they are not usually found. In the context of the lungs, this can include things like pneumonia, inflammation, or tumors.\n\nWhen the initial x-ray showed questionable infiltrates in the upper left lobe, it suggested that there may be some abnormality present in that area of the lung. The radiologist then recommended a follow-up test, specifically an apicolordic view, to get a better look at the area of concern. This view provides a more detailed image of the upper lung fields, which can help the radiologist evaluate the size, shape, and location of any abnormalities.\n\nBased on the information you've provided, it's important for you to follow up with your doctor or radiologist to discuss the results of your tests and any next steps. Depending on the findings of the apicolordic view, further testing may be recommended, such as a CT scan with contrast or a biopsy. Your doctor may also want to discuss your symptoms, if any, and your medical history to help determine the cause of the infiltrates.\n\nIt's natural to be worried about these results, but remember that further testing is needed to make a definitive diagnosis. I hope this helps give you a better understanding of what the terms mean and what the next steps might be. I encourage you to follow up with your healthcare provider to discuss any concerns you may have and get the information you need to feel informed and prepared."}
{"question": "Is it dangerous to breastfeed a baby while on Metronidazole?im a lactating mother to a 6month old child. i have been diagnosed w/ amoebiasis and was prescribed with Metronidazole. My child wont accept bottled milk so i am forced to let her still feed through me. Is it risky for my child? what other medicine can replaced Metronidazole that can be good for my child?", "human": "Hi, Welcome to HCM. I have read your question in detail and I know that you are very concerned about your child. Metronidazole doesn't pass through breast milk and will have no effect on baby. You can continue taking metronidazole and also you should continue breastfeeding the baby. There is no need to replace metronidazole. I hope this will help you. Wishing your child good health. Take care.", "ai": " Metronidazole is considered safe for breastfeeding mothers in usual therapeutic doses. The American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) states that Metronidazole is excreted in low levels in breast milk and is not associated with adverse effects in nursing infants. However, some infants may develop a disulfiram-like reaction if they consume alcohol while being breastfed by a mother taking Metronidazole, resulting in flushing, rapid heartbeat, and a disturbance in breathing. Since alcohol is not recommended for infants, this should not be a concern for most mothers.\n\nIf your baby refuses bottled milk and is exclusively breastfed, continuing to breastfeed while taking Metronidazole seems to be the best option for maintaining your milk supply and ensuring your baby receives adequate nutrition.\n\nIn situations where an alternative to Metronidazole is desired, consider discussing with your healthcare provider about the following options:\n\n1. Iodixanol (Visipaque): This is an iodinated contrast agent used for radiographic studies. While it is not an antibiotic, it may be effective against anaerobic bacteria, including those causing amoebiasis. It is classified as a Lactation Compatibility Category L2 drug by the AAP, meaning caution should be exercised when administered to a breastfeeding mother.\n\n2. Paromomycin: This is an aminoglycoside antibiotic typically used to treat intestinal amoebiasis and giardiasis. Paromomycin is considered safe for breastfeeding mothers in usual therapeutic doses. However, it should be noted that this antibiotic may have a more prolonged therapeutic effect compared to Metronidazole.\n\n3. Tinidazole: Tinidazole is a nitroimidazole antibiotic similar to Metronidazole but has a longer half-life. It is considered safe for breastfeeding mothers in usual therapeutic doses. Infants' exposure to Tinidazole in breast milk is generally low, and side effects have not been reported.\n\n4. Nitazoxanide: Nitazoxanide is an antiprotozoal agent used for treating various protozoan infections, including amoebiasis. It is classified as a Lactation Compatibility Category L2 drug. While its safety in breastfeeding mothers is generally considered to be similar to that of Metronidazole, the available human data is limited.\n\nUltimately, the choice of medication depends on your specific medical condition and the recommendation of your healthcare provider, considering factors such as efficacy, safety, and potential side effects."}

It's important to remember that I'm not able to diagnose or treat medical conditions, so my suggestions should not be taken as medical advice.\n\nIf you've experienced severe hair loss after having your hair straightened, it may be a good idea to speak with a healthcare professional or a dermatologist about your concerns. They can evaluate your scalp and hair to determine if there's an underlying cause for your hair loss, such as a reaction to the hair straightening chemicals or a condition like alopecia.\n\nIn the meantime, here are a few things you can try to help prevent further hair loss and promote healthy hair growth:\n\n* Avoid using harsh chemicals on your hair, such as hair straighteners, for a while. Instead, try to use heat-free styling methods like braids or twists.\n* Eat a healthy diet rich in vitamins and minerals that promote hair growth, such as Vitamin A, C, and E, iron, and zinc.\n* Give your hair a break from styling products and treatments.\n* Use a gentle, sulfate-free shampoo to wash your hair and a conditioner to keep it hydrated.\n* Avoid rubbing or pulling at your hair when you wash it or brush it, as this can damage the hair and cause more loss.\n* Get plenty of rest and manage stress, as stress can contribute to hair loss.\n\nThese are just a few things you can try.

Try using a small-headed toothbrush and getting the bristles between each tooth and along the gum line. Flossing daily can help remove food particles and plaque that a toothbrush can't reach.\n2. Tongue cleaning: Use a tongue scraper or a back of the spoon to clean the tongue every time you brush your teeth. The coating on the tongue is a breeding ground for bacteria that can cause bad breath.\n3. Mouthwash: Use an antibacterial mouthwash to help kill bacteria in your mouth. Make sure to use a mouthwash that is alcohol-free, as alcohol can dry out your mouth and make bad breath worse.\n4. Hydrate: Make sure you're drinking enough water throughout the day to keep your saliva levels up. Saliva helps wash away bacteria and food particles, keeping your mouth fresh.\n5. Check diet: Certain foods, such as onions, garlic, and spices, can cause temporary bad breath. Try avoiding these items before important social engagements.\n6. Visit the dentist: If you continue to have bad breath despite proper oral hygiene, it could be a sign of an underlying dental or medical condition. Make an appointment with your dentist to rule out any potential causes.\n\nRemember, these are just suggestions and may not necessarily solve your bad breath problem. If you're concerned about your oral health, I would recommend consulting a dental professional for proper diagnosis and treatment."}

It is a chronic and progressive neurodegenerative disorder. However, medications like Rasagiline (Rasalect), Pramipexole (Symdopa), and Pimavanserin (Pacitena) can help manage the symptoms of Parkinson's disease. The dosage you mentioned is generally considered to be within the therapeutic range for these medications, but the specific dosage that is right for your mother depends on various factors, such as her response to the medication, side effects, and other health conditions. It's important that she is monitored by a healthcare professional who can assess her progress, adjust her medication dosage as needed, and help manage any side effects she may experience. As for the drowsiness in the morning, it's a common side effect of some Parkinson's medications, and your mother may benefit from adjusting the dosage or timing of her medication, or trying other strategies to improve her sleep hygiene.

Vitamin E is an essential nutrient that helps protect cells and maintain healthy skin and hair when taken orally.

It is always recommended to use specific hair care products or oils designed for topical application, as they have been formulated with appropriate ingredients, concentrations, and safety standards.\n\nTherefore, it is not advisable to use Evion 400 capsules in massage oils or on your scalp. Instead, continue taking the supplement as directed by your healthcare provider or pharmacist for potential health benefits.

Please Help Me ??", "human": "Hi, Vyvanse drug is mostly used in attention deficit hyperactivity disorder or binge eating disorder. In my opinion, If your child is taking drug in proper dosage then there is nothing to worry. However, you should keep a watch on symptoms like restlessness, muscle cramp or spasms. If these symptoms present then dose needs to be decreased or stopped. I hope this has helped you. Wishing your child good health. Take care.", "ai": " I cannot provide definitive medical advice, but I can share some general information about Vyvanse (lisdexamfetamine dimesylate) and physical activity in children, including those involved in sports. It's essential to consult with your child's doctor for specific advice regarding their situation.\n\nVyvanse is a prescription medication used to treat attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) by increasing the availability of dopamine and norepinephrine in the brain. These neurotransmitters help improve focus, attention, and impulse control. Active children with ADHD may benefit from this medication, especially during academic activities.\n\nRegarding physical activity, such as sports, there have been concerns about the risk of adverse effects due to increased body temperature and physical exertion. Studies suggesting that stimulants may increase the risk of adverse cardiovascular effects during physical activities were primarily conducted in adults with pre-existing cardiovascular conditions, and extrapolating these findings to children without such risks might not be accurate.\n\nHowever, common side effects of Vyvanse can include increased heart rate, blood pressure, and body temperature. Therefore, it's essential to monitor closely your child's response to the medication during physical activity.\n\nParents and coaches should be informed about your child's ADHD and the medication they're taking. They should be aware of any potential side effects and be prepared to help your child manage these conditions. Some recommendations include:\n\n1. Encouraging your child to remain well-hydrated before, during, and after physical activity to maintain normal body temperature.\n2. Monitoring your child's body temperature and heart rate before, during, and after physical activity to ensure they are within normal limits.\n3. Providing frequent breaks during physical activity sessions.\n4. Ensuring your child follows a proper warm-up and cool-down routine.\n5. Ensuring your child is taking their medication regularly as prescribed, both on and off the sports day, to maintain a consistent response to the medication.\n\nIt's crucial to maintain open communication with your child's doctor and coach to discuss any concerns or issues that arise. Always follow their recommendations and make necessary adjustments to ensure your child's safety while they continue to participate in sports."}

Let me know if I can assist you further.", "ai": " I'm sorry to hear that you're experiencing hair loss and baldness, and I understand how distressing this can be for your confidence. Here are some common treatments for hair loss that you may want to consider:\n\n1. Minoxidil: Minoxidil is a medication that is applied topically to the scalp. It is available over the counter in the form of a liquid or foam, and it has been shown to help stimulate hair growth and slow down hair loss. You should apply it once or twice a day, following the instructions on the label.\n2. Finasteride: Finasteride is a prescription medication that is taken orally. It is used to treat male pattern baldness by blocking the conversion of testosterone to dihydrotestosterone (DHT), which is believed to contribute to hair loss. It may take several months to see results.\n3. Hair transplant: Hair transplant surgery involves taking hair follicles from areas of the scalp that still have healthy hair growth and transplanting them to areas of baldness. While this is a more invasive and costly option, it can be effective in restoring hair growth.\n4. Diet and lifestyle changes: Certain nutrient deficiencies, stress, and poor lifestyle habits can contribute to hair loss. Ensuring you are getting adequate nutrition, especially iron, zinc, and biotin, can help support healthy hair growth. Reducing stress and quitting smoking are also important lifestyle changes that can improve hair health.\n5. Scalp treatments: Scalp treatments, such as massages, essential oils, and herbal remedies, can help improve circulation and stimulate hair growth. Aloe vera, rosemary oil, and peppermint oil are some of the natural ingredients that have been shown to be effective.\n\nIt's important to note that each person's experience with hair loss is unique, and what works for one person may not work for another. If you're concerned about your hair loss, it's a good idea to speak with a healthcare professional or a dermatologist to determine the underlying cause and the best treatment option for you. They may be able to recommend a combination of treatments or refer you to a specialist if necessary."}

Keep your feet dry: Dryness can exacerbate itchiness and make the flakes worse. Make sure you dry your feet thoroughly after bathing or swimming, and avoid getting them wet unnecessarily.\n2. Moisturize: Apply a moisturizing cream or lotion to your feet, focusing on the dry areas. This will help keep the skin hydrated and reduce itchiness.\n3. Wear breathable shoes and socks: Wearing shoes and socks that are made of breathable materials can help keep your feet dry and reduce the risk of developing an infection.\n4.

I am Dr. Arun Tank, infectious disease specialist, answering your concern.You are positive for tuberculosis.PCR is the gold standard test for the diagnosis of tuberculosis. If you are positive for it than you are surely positive.There is no need for second opinion. In my opinion you are positive for tuberculosis, please visit nearby doctor and start the AKT (Anti koch's treatment) or ATT (Antituberculosis treatment).Glad to answer your further concern contact me on bit.ly/DrArunWe wish you a best health at healthcare magic. Thank you,Dr. Arun Tank", "ai": " \"AFB negative but PCR for M. tuberculosis positive\" is a result from a laboratory test used to diagnose tuberculosis (TB). Here's what each part of the result means:\n\n* AFB (Acid-Fast Bacilli): These are bacteria that have a special way of retaining a particular stain used in lab tests. TB bacteria are typically acid-fast, so identifying AFB in a sputum or other clinical sample is a common way to diagnose TB. However, this test has its limitations, as it may miss smaller or smear-negative bacilli.\n* PCR (Polymerase Chain Reaction): This is a more sensitive molecular test that identifies the genetic material (DNA or RNA) of TB bacteria. In the case of \"PCR for M. tuberculosis positive,\" this means that the lab has detected the DNA or RNA of the TB bacteria, even if no AFB were seen under the microscope.\n\nSo, having a result of \"AFB negative but PCR for M. tuberculosis positive\" means that the lab has found evidence of TB bacteria in your sample, but it might have been too small or present in too low a quantity to be detected through the standard AFB smear microscopy.\n\nRegarding your treatment, it is essential to consult your doctor about your test results and any concerns you may have. Based on your diagnosis, your doctor may prescribe antibiotics for TB treatment, which is typically effective and widely used in managing this condition. In some cases, your doctor might suggest additional diagnostic tests to confirm the diagnosis, such as a repeat test or a biopsy.\n\nAs for your question regarding conceiving, there is no direct link between TB and fertility issues. However, certain treatments for TB, like corticosteroids, may impact fertility in some women. Always discuss any concerns regarding pregnancy or future fertility with your doctor.\n\nLastly, if you're not satisfied with your current diagnosis or treatment plan, it's worth getting a second opinion. Seeking a second opinion can provide you with more information, clarify any questions, and help put your mind at ease. It's important to remember that the ultimate decision is yours, and you should feel comfortable with the treatment plan and the healthcare professional providing it."}

Rest: Avoid any activities that exacerbate the pain, including heavy lifting and bending. Try to rest as much as possible and allow your body to heal.\n2. Ice: Apply an ice pack to the affected area for 15-20 minutes at a time, several times a day. This can help reduce inflammation and provide relief from the pain.\n3.

Gentle stretching: Once the acute pain has subsided, gentle stretching exercises can help improve flexibility and prevent future injuries.\n5. Proper lifting techniques: Make sure to use proper lifting techniques to prevent future injuries. This includes keeping your back straight, bending your knees, and using your leg muscles to lift instead of your back.\n\nIt's important to note that if your symptoms persist or worsen despite these treatments, you may need to consult a healthcare professional for further evaluation.

Muscle strain or injury: Sometimes, the pain might not be directly related to the shunt but could be due to muscle strain or injury near the site.\n6. Other underlying conditions: Individuals with hydrocephalus may have other health issues that could be contributing to the pain, such as migraines or nerve damage.\n\nIf you're experiencing persistent pain near the shunt site, you should consult your healthcare provider. They might need to evaluate the function of the shunt or perform additional tests to determine the cause of your pain and develop an appropriate treatment plan."}

However, I can suggest some possible explanations for your symptoms based on the information you have provided.\n\nFollowing an abortion, it is normal to experience some bleeding and spotting for up to two weeks. Abortion tablets cause the uterus to contract and expel the pregnancy tissue. Bleeding and cramping are common side effects of this process.\n\nYour symptoms, such as continuous spotting, heavy bleeding for a few days, and now light spotting and leg pain, could be related to the abortion. However, it is essential to rule out any potential complications, such as an infection, which could be causing your symptoms.\n\nYou should contact your healthcare provider for a proper assessment and evaluation of your symptoms. They can perform a pelvic exam, check for signs of infection, and provide you with any necessary treatments or follow-up care.\n\nIn the meantime, you can take over-the-counter pain relievers, such as acetaminophen, to help manage your leg pain. You can also use a heating pad on a low setting to help reduce cramping and relieve discomfort.\n\nIt is essential to follow your healthcare provider's instructions carefully regarding your post-abortion care, including when to resume normal activities and any medications or precautions to take.\n\nRemember, this information is only meant to provide a general understanding of your symptoms and is not a substitute for professional medical advice.

I cannot definitively determine the cause of your thrombocytopenia without further medical evaluation, as the condition can have many different causes. Some common causes include:\n\n1. Vitamin K deficiency: A deficiency in Vitamin K can result in decreased production of functional platelets in the body. however,your platelet count is very low and vitamin k deficiency doesn't usually cause such low platelet count.\n2. Medications: Certain medications, such as aspirin, heparin, and some chemotherapeutic agents, can cause thrombocytopenia as a side effect.\n3. Infections: Viral infections, such as HIV, Hepatitis, and Dengue fever, can cause thrombocytopenia. Bacterial infections can also cause this condition.\n4. Autoimmune disorders: Some autoimmune disorders, such as ITP (Idiopathic Thrombocytopenic Purpura) and HAEM (Hemolytic-Uremic Syndrome), can result in thrombocytopenia.\n5. Cancer: Certain types of cancer, such as leukemia and lymphoma, can cause thrombocytopenia.\n6. Genetic disorders: Certain genetic disorders, such as Glanzmann's Thrombasthenia and Wiskott-Aldrich Syndrome, can cause thrombocytopenia.\n7. Alcohol consumption: Chronic alcohol consumption can cause thrombocytopenia due to damage to the bone marrow.\n\nRegarding your question about vitamins and supplements to increase platelet count, I would caution you against self-medicating without consulting a healthcare professional first. While some supplements, such as Vitamin K, may help in certain cases of thrombocytopenia, other supplements could potentially interact with medications you are currently taking or have other health risks. It is best to discuss any potential supplements or Vitamins with your healthcare provider to ensure they are safe for you to take and may help in your specific situation.\n\nIn terms of depression, it's important to make sure you're receiving adequate support for both your physical and mental health. I would recommend talking to your doctor, therapist, or school counselor about your symptoms and coming up with a treatment plan that addresses both your thrombocytopenia and depression. Remember that it's okay to ask for help and take care of yourself during this time."}

For further information consult a rheumatologist online --> https://www.icliniq.com/ask-a-doctor-online/rheumatologist", "ai": " I'm an AI language model and not a doctor, but I can share some information about this topic based on available research.\n\nCymbalta (duloxetine), an antidepressant often used to treat chronic pain conditions like fibromyalgia, can have sexual side effects, including decreased libido, anorgasmia, and ejaculatory dysfunction. However, it's essential to note that fibromyalgia itself can also cause sexual dysfunction.\n\nIt's not uncommon for patients with fibromyalgia to experience complex sleep patterns or sleep disturbances, including having vivid dreams, even during REM sleep (rapid eye movement sleep, where most dreams occur). It's essential to understand that these dreams may not necessarily reflect sexual desires, especially if your girlfriend is unaware of them.\n\nA study published in the Journal of Pain Research in 2015 explored the sexual side effects of Cymbalta in fibromyalgia patients and revealed that although some patients reported difficulties in sexual performance, others reported increased sexual desire or improved sexual functioning.\n\nIt's crucial to discuss these concerns with her healthcare provider, as they can potentially adjust her treatment regimen to minimize any potential sexual side effects while maintaining appropriate management of her fibromyalgia symptoms. This may involve changing medications, doses, or even implementing lifestyle modifications to improve her overall wellbeing and libido.\n\nHere's a suggested course of action:\n\n1. Schedule an appointment with your girlfriend's healthcare provider, where you can discuss her concerns and ask for advice on the potential relation between Cymbalta and her sexual functioning.\n2. Collect some information about her current medications, dosages, and side effects.\n3. Share details about the observed sexual dreams and her lack of desire for sex with her healthcare provider.\n4. If necessary, the healthcare provider may suggest trying alternative medications or adjusting her current meds to see if it helps.\n5. Encourage your girlfriend to discuss any concerns or challenges she might feel hesitant to talk about and be supportive in her journey to improve her overall wellbeing.\n\nKeep in mind that every patient's case is unique, and the complexity of fibromyalgia and its associated symptoms can make it challenging to pinpoint cause-and-effect relationships between specific treatments, medications, and sexual dysfunction. Communication with her healthcare provider will be essential to finding solutions that best meet her needs."}

These include:\n\n1. Endoscopic therapy: Your healthcare provider may recommend an endoscopy, which involves using a long, flexible tube with a camera and instruments, to identify the source of the bleeding and to treat it directly. This might include treating an ulcer with heat therapy or injection of a medication, applying clips or bands to control a bleeding vessel, or other methods.\n2.

It is important to note that I cannot diagnose or prescribe medication, and this information should not be taken as medical advice.\n\nObsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) is a chronic condition that requires ongoing management. For some people, this means lifelong therapy. The good news is that there are various treatment options available that can help manage the symptoms of OCD, and some people are able to achieve significant improvement or even remission.\n\nFluoxetine, which is a type of antidepressant called a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI), is a common medication used to treat OCD. It works by increasing the levels of serotonin in the brain, which is a neurotransmitter that plays a role in regulating mood, appetite, and sleep, among other things. Serotonin is also thought to play a role in the regulation of obsessive and compulsive behaviors.\n\nWhile there is currently no cure for OCD, various treatments, including medication, psychotherapy, and behavioral techniques, can help manage the symptoms. Cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) is a type of psychotherapy that can be particularly effective for OCD. CBT helps people identify and challenge their harmful thoughts and beliefs, and learn more adaptive ways of coping with anxiety and compulsions.\n\nSome people with OCD are able to manage their symptoms with medication alone, while others may need a combination of medication and therapy. Still others may only require therapy. The most effective treatment approach for any given person will depend on their individual circumstances, including the severity and nature of their symptoms.\n\nThe length of time that someone needs to be on medication or in therapy for OCD can vary widely. Some people may achieve significant improvement in a relatively short period of time, while others may need to be on medication for many years or even for the rest of their lives to maintain control over their symptoms. If you have been working with a healthcare provider and feel that your treatment is not effective or that you would like to explore alternative options, it is important to discuss your concerns with them. They can help you consider your options and develop a plan that is best for you.\n\nI hope this information is helpful. If you have any further questions, please don't hesitate to ask."}

Should we be concerned?", "human": "Thanks for your query, I have gone through your query.The lump on the temporal region can be because of the insect bite. Nothing to be panic, it is a self limiting condition. If you have pain then take an analgesic like ibuprofen(if you are not allergic). Since you do not have any itching, no need to worry or any treatment. If the swelling is not reducing in 3-5days, then consult a pediatrician and get it evaluated.I hope I have answered your query, take care.", "ai": " I'm not a doctor, but I can suggest some steps you can take to help evaluate the situation. Generally, a hard lump with a red center on a child's temple could be several things, including a bruise, an insect bite, or even a more serious condition like a tumor. However, the symptoms you mentioned, such as no itching and no history of injury, make an insect bite less likely.\n\nGiven the size, location, and symptoms, it could be worth consulting a healthcare professional for an evaluation. In the meantime, you can take the following steps to help manage the situation:\n\n1. Monitor the lump for any changes in size, color, or symptoms.\n2. If the lump is causing discomfort or distress, you can apply a cool compress to help reduce swelling and relieve discomfort.\n3. Keep the area clean to prevent infection.\n4. If you suspect a bite from an insect or an animal, you may want to keep an eye out for any signs of infection, such as increased redness, warmth, or pus.\n5. If the lump continues to grow or if you notice any other concerning symptoms, such as fever or difficulty moving the face, seek medical attention right away.\n\nIt's important not to panic, but also to be cautious and take any potential concerning symptoms seriously. A healthcare professional can help determine the cause of the lump and provide appropriate treatment if needed."}
{"question": "What causes an increase in AST/ALT levels?Hi, may I answer your health queries? Please type your query here... I recently had a liver panel drawn.  Everything was within normal range except AST/ALT.  My AST was121, and my ALT was 92.  I have been taking sertraline for about 10 years.  I don't know if that could have any effect on these levels.  I also have hemochromatosis that is being treated with phlebotomies.  Thank you, Sherry Sparrow", "human": "Hello! Thanks for putting your query in HCM. I am a Gastroenterologist. Sertraline do not cause any effect on liver. Hemochromatosis may cause elevation.Increase in AST and ALT  has many other cause like Hepatitis B, C, Metabolic disorders, NAFLD, alcohol intake etc. So I will suggest you to visit a Hepatologist for evaluation who will advise tests and then manage accordingly. Meanwhile there are few medicines which I found very useful in my patients are ursodeoxycholic acid and vitamin E. Do regular exercise and reduce your weight if you are overweight, avoid alcohol if you drink.I hope I have answered your query and this will help you . Wish you a good health", "ai": " AST (aspartate aminotransferase) and ALT (alanine aminotransferase) are liver enzymes that are released into the bloodstream when liver cells are damaged. An increase in these enzyme levels can indicate liver injury or damage, which can be caused by various factors, including:\n\n1. Alcohol consumption: Heavy drinking can cause liver damage and lead to elevated AST and ALT levels.\n2. Viral hepatitis: Hepatitis A, B, and C can cause liver damage and lead to an increase in these enzyme levels.\n3. Medications: Certain medications, such as statins, acetaminophen, and sertraline (as you mentioned), can cause liver damage and lead to an increase in these enzyme levels. It's important to talk to your doctor about any medications you're taking that could potentially affect your liver.\n4. Hemochromatosis: This condition, which you mentioned you have, causes the body to absorb too much iron from the diet, which can lead to liver damage and an increase in AST and ALT levels.\n5. Obesity: Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease, which can be caused by obesity, can lead to an increase in these enzyme levels.\n6. Infections: Bacterial or parasitic infections can cause liver inflammation and lead to an increase in these enzyme levels.\n7. Metabolic conditions: Conditions such as diabetes or metabolic syndrome can contribute to an increase in AST and ALT levels.\n\nIt's important to note that mild elevations of these enzymes may not be a cause for concern, but chronic or significantly elevated levels may indicate liver damage or disease. Your doctor can help interpret your results and determine if any further testing or treatment is necessary."}
{"question": "Suggest treatment for infertiltyhi doc i am huma from Pakistan n i cannot conceive after 8 months of marriage than i consult doc n she ask for tests n my reports r clear but husband has low rapid leaner progression its 2% only now i am worry plz tell me is this infertility of men?and how much chances of conceiving with this situation?", "human": "Hi,Thanks for writing to HCM. The sperm motility of your husband is less. Minimum it should be 30 %. It is cause of infertility.  There are no drugs which have dramatic effect on sperm motility.  Multivitamins with zinc combination drugs are used which have shown some improvements . So I suggest your husband to start them.Also do some life style modifications like -avoid caffeine , reduce weight.-stop alcohol and smoking. -healthy diet.With your existing report there are very less chance to conceive.  Get repeat semen analysis after 3 months.  You can discuss the need for IUI.  Here healthy sperms are selected and placed in uterus. This increase chances of pregnancy.Hope I have been helpful .RegardsDr.Deepika Patil", "ai": " I'm not a doctor, but I can attempt to provide you with some information based on the information you've provided. It seems that your husband's semen analysis report indicates a low sperm count, specifically a rapidly decreasing progression, which could be a sign of infertility in men. This condition is referred to as oligoasthenoteratosis (OAT).\n\nThe chance of conceiving with this situation can vary greatly, and it would ultimately depend on several factors such as the degree of impairment in sperm count and motility, the cause of the low sperm count, and any underlying health conditions. In vitro fertilization (IVF) with intracytoplasmic sperm injection (ICSI) is a commonly recommended treatment for cases of male infertility due to low sperm count. This procedure involves directly injecting a single sperm into an egg, increasing the chances of fertilization.\n\nI would strongly recommend consulting a fertility specialist or reproductive endocrinologist for further evaluation and to discuss your options for treatments. They will be able to provide you with accurate information regarding your chances and the best course of action considering your unique situation."}
{"question": "Do presence of cysts in liver cause abdominal pain?I have had a metal/spicy taste in my mouth for the last 4 months, and now I've developed bloating in my upper right abdominal area with discomfort/tightening.  I recently had an MRI of my liver which showed a few small cysts.  Do you think they are related, and should I have the cysts removed?", "human": "Hi,Thanks for posting your query.I am Dr.R.K and I am pleased to assist you.Only large cysts in the liver can cause some dull pain. You are having only small cysts and these do not cause abdominal pain.You are having dyspeptic symptoms. Check your blood glucose level and also get tested for H.pylori infection.Avoid fatty food.You may get benefited by taking prokinetic medications.I hope that answers your question.Regards,Dr.R.K", "ai": " The presence of small cysts in the liver alone may not necessarily cause abdominal pain. Abdominal symptoms such as bloating, discomfort, or tightening are more commonly associated with conditions like gastritis, gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD), irritable bowel syndrome (IBS), or inflammatory conditions of the gastrointestinal tract.\n\nHowever, it is important to note that a metal or spicy taste in your mouth could be a sign of various conditions including liver disease, gastroesophageal reflux, or infections. This symptom, along with the abdominal discomfort, warrants further investigation.\n\nTo determine if the cysts and your symptoms are related, your healthcare professional would want to consider the following factors: the size, number, and location of the cysts, as well as any other symptoms or signs you may be experiencing.\n\nWhile small, benign cysts do not typically require intervention, larger or symptomatic cysts may need to be observed closely or treated, depending on the underlying cause. Your healthcare professional will be able to discuss the risks, benefits, and options based on your individual situation.\n\nIt's important to follow up with your healthcare professional to review your MRI results and discuss any concerns you may have about your symptoms and their potential relationship to the liver cysts. Additional testing, such as a biopsy or ultrasound, may be necessary to rule out other potential causes of your symptoms."}

However, it is important to note that a single high ESR reading does not necessarily mean that there is a serious underlying condition. Other potential causes of your symptoms, which include severe headache, shortness of breath, rapid heart rate, and paleness of skin, include:\n\n1. Dehydration: Inadequate fluid intake can lead to dehydration, which can cause symptoms such as headache, shortness of breath, and rapid heart rate.\n2. Anemia: Paleness of skin, shortness of breath, and a rapid heart rate can be signs of anemia, a condition caused by a lack of enough red blood cells in the body.\n3. Anxiety or panic attacks: Severe headaches, rapid heart rate, and shortness of breath can be symptoms of anxiety or panic attacks.\n4. Respiratory disorders: Severe headaches, shortness of breath, and rapid heart rate can be symptoms of various respiratory disorders, including asthma, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), or pneumonia.\n5. Cardiovascular diseases: Severe headaches, rapid heart rate, and shortness of breath can be symptoms of various cardiovascular diseases, such as heart attack, arrhythmia, or heart failure.\n6.

However, I can suggest some possibilities that you may want to discuss with your healthcare provider.\n\n1. Strain from Constipation: When you’re constipated, you may need to exert extra effort to have a bowel movement, which can result in strain on the pelvic muscles and the rectum. This strain can cause the perception of a lump or swelling between the vagina and anus.\n2. Rectocele: This is a condition where the rectum bulges into the vagina, causing a visible or palpable lump, especially when straining during a bowel movement. Rectoceles are most commonly seen in women after childbirth or with chronic constipation.\n3. Hernia: A pelvic hernia is a disorder where the intestine or bladder protrudes through a weakness in the abdominal wall, and it can occur near the vagina and anus. Constipation can worsen the symptoms of a hernia.\n4. Anal or Rectal Abscess or Fistula: These conditions can lead to the formation of a lump near the anus and may cause thick, white, stringy mucus discharge. These are serious conditions that require medical attention.\n\nIt is essential that you consult your healthcare provider for a proper assessment, diagnosis, and treatment plan. Avoid self-diagnosis or treatment, as this could lead to unnecessary complications.

I suggest you get a Semen culture done to see if there is any infection which is leading to these abnormal forms. If the Semen culture comes positive then you can take antibiotics to target the infection for 2 to 4 weeks and then repeat a Semen analysis after three months. Take care and do let me know how the results are. Dr Rishi, New Delhi, India.", "ai": " The sperm concentration you provided, which is 125 million sperms per milliliter (mL), falls within the normal range for sperm concentration. The World Health Organization (WHO) defines normal sperm concentration as being between 15 and 200 million sperms per mL.\n\nHowever, it's important to note that sperm concentration is only one aspect of semen analysis. Other parameters, such as semen volume, liquefaction time, pH level, progressive motility, non-progressive motility, immotile sperm, normal morphology, and the presence of abnormal forms (as indicated by the TeratoZooSpermia Index or TZI and Sperm Deformity Index or SDI) should also be considered when evaluating the results of a semen analysis.\n\nThe semen volume of 8 mL after three days of abstinence is at the lower end of normal, with the WHO defining normal semen volume as being greater than or equal to 1.5 mL.\n\nThe results you provided suggest that there is some degree of impaired sperm morphology, as indicated by the TZI and SDI values. The TZI should be less than 3, and the SDI should be less than 1.5. Values above these range may indicate an increased risk of infertility.\n\nIt's important to note that these are general guidelines and that individual results should be interpreted in the context of the person's overall reproductive health and medical history. If you are concerned about your semen analysis results, it's recommended that you speak with your healthcare provider for further guidance."}

Chronic prostate infections can be difficult to treat and may require repeated courses of antibiotics. If your urologist has recommended continuing Lovoflox and Permixon, it would be important to follow their instructions closely. However, it is also important to discuss any concerns you have with your healthcare provider. They can provide you with the most accurate information based on your personal medical history and current symptoms.\n\nLovoflox is a cephalosporin antibiotic used to treat bacterial infections, including urinary tract infections. Permixon is a brand name for a medication called Iberogast, which is not an antibiotic but rather a combination of herbal extracts and synthetic compounds used to treat functional gastrointestinal disorders, including irritable bowel syndrome and dyspepsia. It is sometimes used to help alleviate side effects of antibiotics, such as diarrhea and abdominal pain.\n\nAlways make sure to take antibiotics exactly as prescribed by your doctor, completing the full course of treatment, even if you feel better before finishing the medication. Stopping antibiotics too soon may allow the bacteria to continue to grow and can lead to a recurrence of the infection. If you experience any unusual symptoms while taking these medications, including severe diarrhea, fever, rash, or difficulty breathing, contact your healthcare provider right away.\n\nRemember to always consult your healthcare provider for medical advice regarding your specific situation.

Also multiple surgeries will drain you of your blood hemoglobin and leads to anemia and weakness.", "ai": " I'm not a doctor, but I can try to help you understand some possible causes of back pain while walking that you might want to discuss with your healthcare provider. After major surgeries like yours, it's common to experience some degree of back pain or weakness in the legs. Here are some factors that could be contributing to your symptoms:\n\n1. Scar tissue: After surgical procedures, scar tissue can form in the muscles, tendons, or other tissues in the lower back. This scar tissue can restrict movement, cause pain, and lead to weakness in the legs.\n2. Muscle imbalances: Surgeries and prolonged inactivity can lead to muscle imbalances. For example, the muscles on one side of your body might become weaker than the muscles on the other side, making it more difficult to maintain proper posture and alignment while walking, which could lead to back pain and leg weakness.\n3. Herniated discs or degenerative disc disease: These conditions can cause pain and weakness in the lower back and legs. They can be related to aging or to repetitive strain on the spine.\n4. Osteoarthritis: This condition can cause pain and inflammation in the joints, including the joints in the spine.\n5. Obesity: Your weight (90 kg) can put additional strain on your spine, especially when walking. Losing weight can help reduce the pressure on your back and improve your symptoms.\n\nIt's important to remember that these are just possibilities, and only a healthcare professional can diagnose the exact cause of your symptoms. I would recommend following up with your doctor to discuss your symptoms and any concerns you may have. They may recommend further tests, such as an MRI or CT scan, to help determine the cause of your pain. In the meantime, you can try some simple exercises, such as walking, yoga, or stretching, to help improve your symptoms, but be sure to consult with your doctor before starting any new exercise program."}

You Should consult Dentist and go for removal of wisdom tooth this will give you relief .Hope this will help you.", "ai": " I'm an AI language model and not a doctor, but I can try to provide some general information about the symptoms you're describing and how to manage them.\n\nThe symptoms you're experiencing, such as headaches, throbbing in the head and ears, and heaviness in the head, are not uncommon when a wisdom tooth is misplaced or coming in improperly. These symptoms can be caused by several factors:\n\n1. Pressure on the surrounding nerves and tissue: Misaligned wisdom teeth can push against the nerves and tissues in your jaw, causing pain and discomfort.\n2. Infection: If the wisdom tooth is only partially erupted, it can trap food and bacteria, leading to an infection that can cause pain and other symptoms.\n3. Sinus problems: The sinuses are located very close to the wisdom teeth and their roots. The pressure and discomfort you're feeling could also be due to a sinus infection, which is not necessarily related to your wisdom tooth.\n\nIf you have recently been diagnosed with a misplaced wisdom tooth and are experiencing these symptoms, it's important to follow your dentist or oral surgeon's recommendations for treatment. Here are some things that can help:\n\n1. Pain relief: Your dentist or oral surgeon may prescribe pain medication to help manage the discomfort. Over-the-counter pain relievers like ibuprofen or acetaminophen can also help.\n2. Antibiotics: If there's an infection associated with the wisdom tooth, your dentist or oral surgeon may prescribe antibiotics to clear it up.\n3. Avoid irritating the area: Try to avoid chewing on the side of your mouth where the wisdom tooth is located. This can help reduce pressure and discomfort.\n4. Keep the area clean: Make sure to brush and floss regularly to keep the area around the wisdom tooth clean. Your dentist or oral surgeon may also recommend a special rinse or mouthwash to help keep the area clean and reduce inflammation.\n5. Consider Wisdom Tooth Extraction: If the wisdom tooth is significantly impacted or causing significant discomfort, your dentist or oral surgeon may recommend extraction to relieve the symptoms.\n\nIt's important to remember that everyone's experience with wisdom teeth is different, and what works for one person may not work for another. If you have questions or concerns about your symptoms or treatment options, be sure to speak with your dentist or oral surgeon. They can help provide you with the information and care you need to manage your wisdom tooth discomfort."}

Can you explain to me what may be happening should I be worried?", "human": "Hi,The possible causes for the spotting are :-According to your menstrual history, there is possibility of hormonal imbalance. Hormonal imbalance can lead to intermenstrual spotting, prolonged spotting after cessation of menstrual flow etc symptoms. - Post coital tear- Local lesions like cervical erosion, polyps etc. If the spotting subsides and if you get your next cycle as expected, no need to worry. If the spotting continues or recurs in next menstrual cycles, better to get evaluated. Go for examination, ultrasound and hormonal profile including estrogen, progesterone, LH and FSH. With this workup the possible cause for your problem can be identified and treated. Take care.", "ai": " Pinkish mucus during menstruation can be normal and is often related to changes in the composition and volume of cervical mucus throughout the menstrual cycle. However, its appearance can vary depending on several factors, including hormonal fluctuations, sexual activity, and certain medical conditions.\n\nIn your case, since you mentioned that you had not had a period for four months and then resumed sexual activity, the pink mucus could be due to the following reasons:\n\n1. Spotting: The light spotting you are experiencing in between your periods might be a result of your body readjusting to regular menstruation after a prolonged absence. This can cause the cervix to release some pinkish mucus, which can be present on your toilet paper.\n2. Hormonal changes: The hormonal shifts that occur during ovulation and menstruation can cause the cervix to produce different types of mucus. Pinkish mucus can be a sign of ovulation or the beginning of menstruation.\n3. Sexual activity: During sexual intercourse, the cervix can become irritated, causing some pinkish mucus to be released. This is normal and not a cause for concern.\n\nHowever, if you are experiencing other symptoms such as heavy bleeding, severe cramping, or pelvic pain, it is essential to consult your healthcare provider to rule out any underlying medical conditions, such as endometriosis or polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS).\n\nGenerally, if the pink mucus is present in small amounts and is not accompanied by any other symptoms, it is likely to be a normal variation of menstrual flow. However, if you have any concerns, it is always best to consult your healthcare provider for peace of mind."}
{"question": "How can teeth be aligned without the gums being cut?I have invisalign. My teeth are now very straight except for one of my front teeth is tilted towards the other one the bottoms of my front teeth are perfectly aligned but the middle and top of my teeth don't touch because the gums/muscle between my front teeth is in the way... is there anything that I can do besides getting that muscle cut?", "human": "according to your description it appears that you have a high frenum attachment it can only be corrected by surgery. but there are other options like ceramic veneers which can help you but for that it need to seen for a suggestionregards DR Rakesh Mishra", "ai": " Invisalign is a popular orthodontic treatment that uses a series of custom-made, transparent aligners to gradually shift teeth into their ideal positions. When it comes to aligning teeth without the need for gum or muscle removal, Invisalign can be an excellent option. Here's how it works:\n\n1. Digital impressions: Instead of taking traditional impressions with putty, Invisalign uses digital impressions or scans of your teeth to create a 3D model. These digital impressions provide precise information about your teeth's positioning, enabling the creation of aligners that are tailored to your teeth and bite.\n\n2. Custom-made aligners: Invisalign aligners are designed to press gently on your teeth to move them into their intended positions. The aligners can be designed to adjust the tilt of individual teeth without the need for gum or muscle surgery. Since they are transparent, they remain hidden from view and don't interfere with your daily life.\n\n3. Gentle force application: Invisalign aligners apply a controlled, consistent force to teeth over a set period, allowing the teeth to shift gradually into their correct positions. This movement can be sufficient to correct many misalignment issues without requiring gum or muscle surgery.\n\n4. Replacement aligners: Patients typically wear a new set of aligners every two weeks. The aligners are designed to gradually change the positioning of your teeth, and your dentist or orthodontist will monitor your progress during appointments. In your case, your orthodontist may create an aligner that works specifically to address the tilted tooth without affecting the gums or muscle between your front teeth.\n\n5. Other orthodontic treatments: In some instances, a dentist or orthodontist may recommend other orthodontic treatments, such as the use of specific attachments or other aligner modifications, to help realign your teeth without the need for gum or muscle surgery.\n\nUltimately, it's best to consult your orthodontist or dentist for their professional opinion on your specific situation. They can evaluate your case and recommend the most effective and least invasive treatment option to give you a beautiful, straight smile."}
{"question": "Can an acid reflux event cause a rapid heart rate?Can an acid reflux event cause a rapid heart rate? My resting rate is in the high 50's. Recently I had acid reflux in the night and felt the rate was high. It wasn't until after exercise that I realized it was around 155 and apparently had been at that rate for about 7 hours", "human": "Hello,Acid reflux or exercise can increase increase heart rate slightly, but 155 persisting for 7 hours is less likely. This can be a cardiac arrhythmia like psvt or atrial fibrillation, in which heart rate suddenly goes up. Blood pressure may fall during these episodes and one has dizziness, fainting, blackouts, sometimes syncope. Usually ecg is normal as it is usually done in between the episodes. ECG done during episodes will show abnormality. You will need 24 hour holter monitoring or get ecg done during high heart rate. Also, hemoglobin and thyroid test should be done. ln order to abort such episodes you should try to cough hard. Is there any stress or anxiety associated.    Till the time your evaluation is complete, you can ask your local doctor for tab ciplar LA 20 mg once a day.     If none of the above is successful then last option is of electrophysiological studies which is invasive test which can diagnose and treat the arrhythmia permanently in most of the cases. Hope this helps you and get back if you have any doubts.", "ai": " yes, an acid reflux event can cause a rapid heart rate. This is because acid reflux can irritate the vagus nerve, which helps regulate the heart rate. When this nerve is irritated, the heart can beat faster. Additionally, the adrenaline released in response to the discomfort or stress of the acid reflux event can also contribute to an increased heart rate. However, a heart rate of 155 beats per minute for 7 hours is concerning and warrants further evaluation by a healthcare professional, as it is above the normal resting heart rate range and may indicate a more serious underlying condition, such as a heart rhythm disorder. If you're experiencing persistent symptoms or concerning heart rate readings, it's important to speak with a healthcare provider for proper evaluation and treatment."}

Regards,Dr. Salah Saad Shoman, Internal Medicine Specialist", "ai": " I cannot definitively determine the cause of your child's symptoms based on the information provided, but it's important to take them seriously as they may indicate a medical issue. Loose stools with visible blood could be a sign of inflammation or infection in the digestive tract, such as gastroenteritis or food poisoning. Green poop can sometimes indicate bile staining due to diarrhea. The mucus could also suggest inflammation.\n\nAbdominal tenderness is another concerning symptom. Your child's age, along with the presence of blood and mucus, increases the possibility of a more serious condition like inflammatory bowel disease or an intestinal infection.\n\nConsidering the severity of these symptoms, it's recommended that you contact your child's healthcare provider for further evaluation. They may suggest bringing a stool sample for testing to rule out any infections or other conditions.

Considering that statistic, I would say there is a chance you could be pregnant, especially if you have never been late on a cycle before.But, sexual intercourse itself can sometimes be a trigger to bring on an early period, or even cause a delay in one. So go ahead with a home pregnancy test using an early morning urine sample for a more conclusive answer.Best wishes.", "ai": " While it is possible for pregnancy to occur without penetration if semen comes into contact with the vulva or vaginal area, it is less likely than during penetrative intercourse. In your case, since you mentioned that neither partner ejaculated inside you, the chances of pregnancy are considered to be low. However, it's essential to keep in mind that every individual's body is unique, and irregular menstrual cycles do not necessarily rule out the possibility of becoming pregnant. It is always best to consider using reliable birth control methods during sexual activity, even if penetration does not occur, to minimize the risk of an unintended pregnancy. If you are concerned about your current situation, consider taking a pregnancy test to eliminate any uncertainty. If the test is negative but you still have concerns, consult a healthcare professional for advice."}

These symptoms can be concerning, but it's important to remember that they could be caused by various factors, some of which may be related to your menstrual cycle.\n\nIt's important to note that I am an AI language model and I cannot diagnose or provide medical advice. I cannot replace a consultation with a healthcare professional. However, I can suggest some steps that may help you manage your symptoms and provide some context for what you might expect from your healthcare provider.\n\nFirst, it's a good idea to keep a record of your symptoms, including when they occur, how long they last, and any other associated symptoms. This information can be helpful for your healthcare provider in making a diagnosis.\n\nYour symptoms could be related to menstrual-related conditions such as anemia, hormonal imbalances, or a condition called orthostatic intolerance. Anemia is a condition where your body does not have enough healthy red blood cells to carry oxygen to your body's tissues. This can result in symptoms such as fatigue, weakness, and lightheadedness. Hormonal imbalances, especially during menopause, can also cause symptoms such as racing heartbeat and lightheadedness. Orthostatic intolerance is a condition where your body has difficulty adjusting to changes in position, such as standing up from a seated position, resulting in symptoms such as dizziness, lightheadedness, and a racing heartbeat.\n\nYour healthcare provider may recommend blood tests to check for anemia, thyroid function, and other possible causes of your symptoms. They may also recommend medications or lifestyle changes to help manage your symptoms. For example, medications such as iron supplements may be prescribed if you are anemic. Other treatments, such as increasing fluids and salt intake, may be recommended for orthostatic intolerance.\n\nIt's important to remember that these symptoms can be scary, but they're typically not life-threatening. However, if you're concerned about your symptoms, especially if they worsen or you experience additional symptoms such as chest pain, difficulty breathing, or severe abdominal pain, you should contact your healthcare provider right away. They may recommend further testing or refer you to a specialist for additional evaluation.\n\nIn the meantime, there are some things you can do to help manage your symptoms:\n\n* Avoid standing for long periods of time, especially if you're feeling lightheaded or weak\n* Drink plenty of fluids, especially before and after standing for long periods of time\n* Eat small, frequent meals throughout the day instead of large meals\n* Get enough rest and sleep\n* Avoid caffeine, alcohol, and nicotine, as they can worsen symptoms of orthostatic intolerance\n\nAgain, I cannot provide medical advice, and it's important to consult with your healthcare provider for an accurate diagnosis and treatment plan. I hope this information is helpful, and I wish you all the best in managing your symptoms."}

Of course it is still a delicate matter since the doctors haven't identified the nature, I suppose they might want to take biopsy material from it to create a better idea. Hope I have answered your query. Let me know if I can assist you further.", "ai": " A large growth around the C1 vertebra, located at the uppermost portion of the cervical spine, could be caused by various conditions, some of which may put pressure on the brainstem. Here are a few possibilities:\n\n1. Cervical spondylosis: This is the most common condition affecting the cervical spine. It is a degenerative process that involves the wear and tear of the intervertebral discs and joints. In some cases, osteophytes (bone spurs) can form, leading to the formation of a mass or cervical masses that may compress the neural structures. The brainstem is located near the C1-C2 area, and if the growth is large enough, it could put pressure on it.\n2. Neurofibromas: These are benign tumors that grow from the nerve sheaths. Neurofibromas in the cervical region can lead to the development of a large mass. In some cases, they may compress the neural structures, including the brainstem.\n3. Osteomas: These are benign bone tumors. If they occur in the cervical region, they can lead to the formation of a large mass, which may put pressure on the neural structures.\n4. Epidural abscess: An infection in the epidural space can lead to the development of an abscess, which can cause a mass that puts pressure on the neural structures. Infection may spread from the skull or the cervical region, and it can jeopardize the functional integrity of the brainstem.\n5. Arteriovenous malformation (AVM): AVM is a tangled tangle of abnormal blood vessels. They can develop in various parts of the body, including the brain and the spinal cord. If an AVM occurs in the cervical region, it can lead to the development of a large mass, which may compress the neural structures, including the brainstem.\n6. Metastatic tumors: Malignant tumors (cancer) can metastasize to the bone or the soft tissues of the neck, leading to the development of a large mass. If the tumor is situated near the C1 vertebra and the brainstem, it may compress the brainstem and lead to various neurological symptoms.\n\nGiven the rarity and the unknown nature of the mass in your son-in-law's case, it is essential that he undergoes further diagnostic tests to determine the exact cause of the growth. The diagnostic tests may include imaging studies such as X-rays, CT scans, MRI scans, or angiograms. Depending on the diagnosis, appropriate treatment options may be considered, such as medication, surgery, or radiation therapy. The proximity of the brainstem to the C1 vertebra may increase the risk of complications, and therefore, the treating physicians need to carefully assess the specific situation and develop an individualized treatment plan."}

{"question": "How to treat the pain caused in the sternum for a person having bilateral mastectomy?I was diagnosed with Stage 2A breast cancer in February 2011.  I have had a bilateral mastectomy and chemotherapy and now have saline breast implants.  For the past few days, I have been experiencing pain between the 5th and 6th ribs to the left of my sternum.  The pain is worse when I breathe.  Is this costochondritis?  A problem with the implants?  Metastasis?  Please give me your thoughts.  Thank you.", "human": "Hi,Thanks for writing in.The pain in costochondritis is typically in the front of chest next to the sternum and might cause lot of distress. It is a sharp pain.Breast implants can cause irritation of the nerves in the anterior chest wall causing pain perception. This pain is more localized to the area where implants are present and usually does not radiate to other places.Metastasis is pain due to bone destruction. This is diffuse pain which increases on palpation and focused on the area overlying the bone.It is suggested that you get a chest X ray or CT scan done to evaluate in detail the cause and nature of problem leading to the pain.", "ai": " I'm not a doctor, but I can try to help you understand some possible causes of your symptoms based on the information you have provided. It's essential to consult your oncologist or surgeon for an accurate diagnosis, as they have access to your medical history and can consider your unique situation.\n\nThe symptoms you describe - pain between the 5th and 6th ribs to the left of the sternum that worsens with breathing - could be due to several conditions.\n\n1. Costochondritis: This condition occurs when the cartilage between the ribs and breastbone becomes inflamed. The pain is usually sharp and localized to a specific area. It can also worsen with deep breathing or chest wall movement.\n\n2. Implant-related issues: After a breast surgery, it's normal to experience some discomfort or pain, especially in the beginning. With implants, you may feel pain or tenderness in the chest area due to capsular contracture, implant malposition, or implant rupture. These conditions can result in pain that worsens with deep breathing.\n\n3. Metastasis: As a breast cancer survivor, it's natural to be concerned about metastasis, or the spread of cancer to other parts of the body. Although rare, it is possible for breast cancer to metastasize to the ribs or the sternum. It's important to note that your symptoms may not necessarily be related to metastasis, but it is crucial to discuss your concerns with your doctor for a proper evaluation.\n\nYour doctor may conduct a physical examination, perform imaging studies such as X-rays, CT scans, or MRIs, and may recommend other diagnostic tests to determine the cause of your symptoms. In the meantime, try taking over-the-counter pain relievers, such as acetaminophen or ibuprofen, to help manage your discomfort. Deep breathing exercises that focus on expanding the ribcage may also help relieve symptoms. Remember, it's essential to consult your healthcare professional for personalized advice and treatment recommendations."}

Some medications can aggravate hepatomegaly and fatty liver, so it is essential to discuss any potential alternatives.\n\n3. Diet modifications: Suggest your father follows a healthy and balanced diet, focusing on nutrient-dense foods. Fatty liver disease can be improved with a diet rich in fruits, vegetables, whole grains, lean protein sources, and healthy fats.

{"question": "Is there any side effects for metpure xl 25?hi a m 44 years old male, i have been taking metpure xl 25 every morning for past 5 years to control hypertension. please advise if any side effect is there or how can i discontinue the medecine since i don t have nay other problem and my BP is at 130/80 always for last number of years. tnx sanjeev", "human": "Hello, Yes, there are. Drowsiness, dizziness, tiredness, diarrhea, and slow heartbeat may occur. Decreased sexual ability has been reported infrequently. Hope I have answered your query. Let me know if I can assist you further. Take care Regards,Dr. AJEET SINGH, General & Family Physician", "ai": " Metformin XL 25mg is a commonly prescribed medication for type 2 diabetes, but it's also sometimes used off-label for the treatment of conditions like polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) and metabolic syndrome to help manage insulin resistance and improve blood sugar control. However, in your case, you mentioned that you're taking it for hypertension, which is not an approved use of metformin XL.\n\nAs for side effects, metformin is generally considered safe for most people when taken as prescribed. Some common side effects may include:\n\n1. Gastrointestinal symptoms: Metformin can cause stomach upset, diarrhea, bloating, nausea, or vomiting in some people, especially when starting the medication or increasing the dose. These side effects usually go away on their own after a few days or weeks.\n2. Lactic acidosis: Metformin very rarely causes lactic acidosis, a serious condition characterized by a buildup of lactic acid in the blood. This condition is more likely to occur in people with kidney or liver disease, poor nutrition, or dehydration. Symptoms of lactic acidosis include fatigue, weakness, dizziness, shortness of breath, and muscle cramps with a sensation of coldness.\n3. Hypoglycemia: Metformin doesn’t cause hypoglycemia (low blood sugar) by itself, but it can make it more likely to occur when used in combination with other diabetes medications or insulin. Symptoms of hypoglycemia include sweating, dizziness, lightheadedness, weakness, tremors, and confusion.\n4. Vitamin B12 deficiency: Metformin can interfere with the absorption of Vitamin B12 in the gut, which may lead to deficiency. However, this is not a common occurrence with regular use of metformin, and dietary supplementation or a multivitamin should be sufficient.\n\nAlthough there are no known side effects related to discontinuing metformin XL specifically for hypertension, you should not make any decisions regarding discontinuing or changing your medication without consulting your healthcare provider first. Your healthcare provider will review your medical history, current medications, and other factors to determine whether it's safe for you to stop taking metformin XL or if there are alternatives that may be more appropriate for managing your hypertension.\n\nIn summary, most people tolerate metformin well, and the side effects are usually mild and transient. However, anyone considering stopping metformin XL without consulting their healthcare provider first should be aware of potential side effects and the importance of monitoring their blood pressure carefully to ensure it remains under control."}

Since it is on my left side I m worried it may have something to do with my heart. Have you heard of this before? It is not painful, just very strange.", "human": "Hello and Welcome to ‘Ask A Doctor’ service. I have reviewed your query and here is my advice. I would explain that the numbness on your left leg does not seem to be related to any cardiac disorders. It could be related to a pinched nerve or partial epilepsy seizures. For this reason, I would recommend consulting with a neurologist for a physical exam and some tests:- a resting ECG- a lumbar spine X-ray study for possible bulging disc in this region- nerve conduction studies. If suspicions of seizures are raised, an EEG may be needed. You should discuss with your doctor on the above tests. Hope to have been helpful! Kind regards, Dr. Iliri", "ai": " While numbness or tingling in the left leg can be a sign of heart disease in some cases, it is more commonly associated with peripheral artery disease (PAD). PAD is a condition where the blood flow to the legs is restricted due to narrowed or blocked arteries. This can lead to numbness, tingling, cramping, or pain in the legs, often when walking or at rest.\n\nHowever, it's important to note that numbness or tingling in the leg can have many causes, including nerve damage, vitamin deficiencies, or diabetes, among others. These conditions are not related to heart disease.\n\nTherefore, it's best to speak with your healthcare provider about your symptoms. They may recommend tests to check for PAD or other potential causes. Heart disease is a serious condition, so it's important to get a proper diagnosis if you have concerns.\n\nIn the meantime, you can take some steps to reduce your risk of heart disease, such as eating a healthy diet, getting regular physical activity, maintaining a healthy weight, and avoiding smoking. If you have any other symptoms, such as chest pain, shortness of breath, or palpitations, seek medical attention right away."}

Your history of a recent fall and bruising, as well as a history of multiple sclerosis (MS), could be contributing factors. Here are some possible causes, although it is important to note that only a healthcare professional can provide an accurate diagnosis:\n\n1. Referred pain or radiculopathy from MS: Multiple sclerosis can affect the nerves, including those that supply the thigh and the lower leg. Referred pain is when the sensation of pain is felt in a location other than where the actual injury or problem is located. Radiculopathy is nerve damage in the root, causing pain, numbness, or weakness in the affected area.\n\n2. Peripheral neuropathy: This condition often causes burning, shooting pain in the legs and feet. It can be caused by various conditions, including diabetes, infections, or toxins.\n\n3. Meralgia paresthetica: This condition causes pain, tingling, or numbness on the outer side of the thigh and the front of the leg. It results from compression of the meralgus nerve, which runs along the thigh.\n\n4. Muscle strain, sprain, or contusion: The recent fall could have caused a injury to the muscles of the thigh or the lower leg, leading to the sharp pain and burning sensation.\n\n5. Deep vein thrombosis (DVT): Although rare, DVT can present with symptoms like sharp pain, cramping, and burning sensations in the affected leg. This condition is a blood clot in the deep veins of the leg, which can be dangerous if it travels to the lungs.\n\nIt is important to consult a healthcare professional for an examination and proper diagnosis if you experience these symptoms, especially if you have a history of multiple sclerosis. Your healthcare provider may recommend tests such as an MRI, nerve conduction studies, or electromyography (EMG) to help determine the cause of the pain."}

Axitinib was helping him but notit is stopped for the lung probem", "human": "This is called the targetted therapy. It is used in advanced stage of cancer. the clotting problem is a rare cause with this drug but it is the malignancy itself which is responsible for the clotting phenomenon in the body. take advice from your doctor for  use of blood thinners.Dr. J. ticku", "ai": " I'd be happy to help answer your question, but I must first clarify some important information. Axitinib is a type of targeted therapy medication used to treat advanced renal cell carcinoma (RCC), including metastatic or metastasized RCC. It works by blocking the action of certain proteins that contribute to tumor growth and spread.\n\nRegarding your husband's experience with Axitinib, it is important to note that blood clots in the lungs (pulmonary embolism) can occur as a side effect of this medication, especially in the first few months of therapy. This risk may be increased in patients with a history of thromboembolic events or other risk factors.\n\nAs for alternative medications for metastatic kidney cancer, there are several options, and the choice of therapy depends on various factors, including the patient's overall health, previous treatments, and tumor genetics. Some common medications used for advanced kidney cancer include:\n\n1. Sunitinib: Another targeted therapy medication that works by inhibiting the activity of certain proteins involved in tumor growth and angiogenesis. It has been shown to be effective in treating RCC and has a similar side effect profile to Axitinib.\n2. S sorafenib: Another targeted therapy medication that inhibits various proteins involved in tumor growth, angiogenesis, and metastasis. It is often used in patients with RCC that has progressed after initial therapy.\n3. Cabozantinib: A targeted therapy medication that works by inhibiting the activity of several proteins involved in tumor growth and angiogenesis. It has been shown to be effective in treating advanced RCC and has a similar side effect profile to Axitinib.\n4. Pembrolizumab or Nivolumab: Immunotherapies that work by stimulating the body's immune system to attack cancer cells. They are often used in patients with advanced RCC that has progressed after or is not responsive to prior therapy.\n5. Temsirolimus, Everolimus, or R Adamantinib: These are mTOR inhibitors, which are targeted therapies that work by inhibiting the activity of a specific protein (mTOR) that contributes to tumor growth and survival. They are often used in patients with advanced RCC with specific genetic profiles.\n\nIt's essential to discuss these options with your husband's healthcare team to determine which treatment is best for him based on his individual situation. The choice of therapy may depend on factors such as his overall health, previous treatments, tumor genetics, and personal preferences. It's essential to remember that each treatment has its benefits and risks, and the healthcare team can help balance these factors to develop an individualized treatment plan."}

These symptoms could be related to various conditions, some of which may be related to the environmental conditions in Afghanistan or his recent loss. Here are some possible causes that may be worth investigating:\n\n1. Altitude sickness: Living at high altitudes can lead to various health issues, including nosebleeds, dizziness, nausea, and sensitivity to light and sound. These symptoms may be more pronounced for someone who is not used to living at high altitudes, or who has a preexisting health condition.\n2. Dehydration: Dehydration can cause dizziness, nausea, and nosebleeds. In a hot and dry climate like Afghanistan, it's easy to become dehydrated. Your husband should try to drink plenty of water, especially before, during, and after physical activity.\n3. Environmental factors: Exposure to extreme temperatures, dust storms, and pollution can all contribute to health issues, including nosebleeds and dizziness. Your husband's symptoms may be related to the environmental conditions in Afghanistan.\n4. Stress and anxiety: Your husband's severe loss, combined with the stresses of being deployed in a dangerous environment, could be contributing to his symptoms. Stress and anxiety can cause or worsen symptoms like nausea, dizziness, and nosebleeds.\n5.

This is because thyroid hormones play a role in menstrual cycle regularity and ovulation. If your thyroid hormone levels aren't within the normal range, it may affect your ability to conceive. However, once pregnancy is achieved, having a thyroid condition is generally not a problem for the mother or the developing fetus, provided that your hormone levels are well managed.\n\nYour husband's low sperm motility is a separate issue. Sperm motility is the ability of sperm to move efficiently through the female reproductive tract to fertilize an egg. Lower sperm motility can make it more difficult for a sperm to reach and fertilize an egg, but it is still possible for a couple to get pregnant.\n\nThere are several treatments for low sperm motility, including:\n\n1. Intracytoplasmic Sperm Injection (ICSI): A fertility treatment where a single sperm is injected directly into an egg. This can bypass the issue of poor sperm motility and increase the chances of fertilization.\n2. Surgery: If there is a blockage in the testicles or the vas deferens (the tubes that transport sperm from the testicles), surgery may be an option to restore normal sperm production and transport.\n3. Medications: There are medications that can help improve sperm motility, such as clomiphene citrate (Clomid) or gonadotropins, but they are not typically used to treat low sperm motility alone. These medications are more commonly used to stimulate ovulation in women with fertility issues.\n4. Lifestyle changes: Making lifestyle changes, such as quitting smoking, avoiding alcohol, losing excess weight, and reducing stress, can help improve sperm motility.\n\nAs for your friend's suggestion of taking glycomet, glycomet (generic name: metformin) is a medication typically used to control blood sugar levels in people with diabetes. There is no evidence to suggest that taking metformin will improve fertility, either for a woman with a thyroid condition or for a man with low sperm motility.\n\nIf you're having difficulty conceiving due to either of these conditions, I would recommend speaking with your healthcare provider. They can evaluate your situation and discuss appropriate treatment options with you."}

HBV is a liver virus that can cause inflammation, leading to elevated levels of liver enzymes like AST (Aspartate Aminotransferase) and ALT (Alanine Aminotransferase).\n\nAST and ALT are enzymes found mainly in the liver. Their normal levels in the blood reflect healthy liver function. High levels of AST and ALT in your daughter's blood suggest liver damage or inflammation as it may leak into the bloodstream.\n\nThe cause of reactive HbSAg, high AST, and ALT in your daughter may be due to a recent or old HBV infection. This infection could have occurred through a contaminated needle during the blood donation process or from another source. A negative Anti-HbC test result rules out acute or recent hepatitis B infection, which implies a past or chronic infection.\n\nDespite these abnormalities in the liver enzymes and the HbSAg result, your daughter's T Bilirubin, which is a marker of jaundice, is within the normal range, indicating that there's no significant interference with the liver's function in the bilirubin metabolism. Her T protein level is within the normal range, suggesting that her total protein level is in check, and her albumin level is slightly low but still within the normal range.\n\nIt is essential that your daughter receives proper medical evaluation and counselling from a healthcare professional. They can provide guidance on how to manage the condition, prevent any complications, and possibly prescribe medications if necessary. Your daughter can consider getting vaccinated against hepatitis B if she has not already been, as it can help protect her from further infections or complications."}
{"question": "What are the treatment options for having stone in interpolar right kidney?I have 4.9mm stone in interpolar right kidney. no hydronephrosisWhat are my treatment options? I had a stone episode 14 months ago and a 6mm stone was removed using ureteroscopy and stent last year from left kidney distal ureter.  The stone is a calcium oxalate stone.", "human": "Hi,Thanks for writing in to us.As long the stone is in the kidney there is no problem as it is a small stone. It is possible that the stone might enter the ureter (tube connecting kidney and urinary bladder) and when in the lower part of ureter and at that time it might cause obstruction to flow of urine. You might have pain at this time which will disappear once the stone reaches the urinary bladder. When this happens you might experience severe sharp pain for few days and require pain killers for sometime. Please continue drinking lots of water at that time.Stenting and ureteroscopy is not required unless the stone grows in size and causes obstruction to flow of urine.", "ai": " Based on the information provided, it appears that you have a small (4.9mm) calcium oxalate stone located in the interpolar region of your right kidney, which means it's located between the polarities (or regions of positive and negative electric charge) of the kidney. You mentioned that there is no hydronephrosis (backed-up urine in the kidney) currently present.\n\nTypically, the treatment options for a small kidney stone in the absence of hydronephrosis include:\n\n1. Conservative (watchful) management: This involves monitoring the stone's size and your symptoms over time. Small stones often pass spontaneously within several weeks to months. Your doctor may recommend taking measures to help facilitate stone passage, such as increased fluid intake, medications to relax the ureter (ureteral relaxation agents), or pain management.\n2. Extracorporeal Shock Wave Lithotripsy (ESWL): This is a non-invasive procedure where shockwaves are used to break the stone into smaller pieces, which can then pass through the urinary tract on their own. This procedure is often done in an outpatient setting.\n3. Ureteroscopy and stone removal: If the stone does not pass and continues to cause symptoms or grows in size, your doctor may recommend a ureteroscopy to directly remove the stone or fragment it into smaller pieces using a laser or other tools.\n4. Percutaneous nephrolithotomy (PCNL): This is a more invasive surgical procedure in which a small incision is made in the back, the stone is removed directly from the kidney, and a tube is placed in the kidney to drain urine. This procedure may be considered if the stone is very large or located in a difficult-to-reach location.\n5. Medical expulsion therapy: In some cases, your doctor may recommend medications, such as alpha-blockers, to help facilitate stone passage by relaxing the ureter and allowing the stone to pass more easily.\n\nYour specific treatment option will depend on various factors, including the size, location, and composition of the stone, as well as your individual symptoms and medical history. Your doctor can help determine the best course of action for you based on these factors. Regular follow-up appointments and imaging tests may be recommended to monitor the stone's size and your symptoms over time."}
{"question": "How to control hair fall?Why am i getting excess hair loss after recovery from thyroid ?Hello ! Hairs from all over my head  are falling .. I was suffering from TYPHOID but at that time my hairs were OK ! After 1 month of getting rid of typhoid ,, my hairs Falls more and more ! Can you tell me WHY ?? I m in deep trouble ,,GIVE ME suggestions please i am 20 years old", "human": "Hello. Thank you for writing to us at healthcaremagicI will keep a possibility of telogen effluvium. Telogen is the resting phase of hair growth cycle after which the hair is usually shed.After any stressful event e.g medical illness like dengue, typhoid etc, scalp hair may get shifted from growth phase (anagen) to resting phase (telogen) which is manifested as increased hair shedding.Telogen usually begins 1-3 months after a stressful event and can last up to 6 months following which hair follicle re-enters the growing phase (anagen).I suggest you to maintain a good healthy nutritious diet. You may add a multivitamin supplement to your diet.Regards", "ai": " I'm sorry to hear that you're experiencing excess hair fall after recovering from typhoid fever. While I'm not a doctor, I can provide you with some suggestions based on common causes of hair loss. However, it's important to consult with a healthcare professional or a trichologist to determine the underlying cause of your hair loss and receive personalized advice.\n\n1. Nutritional deficiencies: After an illness, your body may need extra nutrients to recover. A deficiency in essential vitamins and minerals, such as iron, biotin, or vitamin D, can lead to hair loss. A balanced diet rich in fruits, vegetables, lean protein, and whole grains can help ensure that your body is getting the nutrients it needs.\n2. Stress: Stress can trigger hair loss by disrupting the growth cycle of hair. Recovering from an illness like typhoid can be a stressful experience. Meditation, yoga, or other relaxation techniques can help reduce stress.\n3. Hormonal imbalances: Thyroid issues can disrupt hormonal balance, leading to hair loss. Post-recovery, it's possible that your hormonal levels are still recovering. Make sure you're getting regular check-ups with your healthcare provider to monitor your thyroid levels and receive proper treatment.\n4. Hair care: Harsh shampoos, styling tools, and excessive brushing can damage hair, leading to excess shedding. Use gentle, sulfate-free shampoos and conditioners. Consider using a wide-toothed comb instead of a brush to minimize damage. Try to avoid using heat styling tools as much as possible.\n5. Genetics: Excessive hair loss can also be attributed to genetics. If you have a family history of hair loss, you may be more susceptible to experiencing it.\n\nIt's essential to determine the underlying cause of your hair loss to develop an effective treatment plan. Consult with a healthcare professional or a trichologist for personalized advice. In the meantime, focus on maintaining a balanced diet and practicing stress-reducing techniques."}

I strongly recommend consulting with your healthcare provider for personalized advice.\n\n1. Antibiotics: Your doctor may prescribe strong antibiotics to help clear the abscess. Antibiotics can kill the bacteria causing the infection. They may be given intravenously (IV) in the hospital or as oral pills at home.\n\n2. Drainage: In severe cases, a drain may be inserted into the abscess to help it drain. This can be done as an outpatient procedure or during a hospital stay.\n\n3. Endoscopic procedures: Endoscopic ultrasound-guided aspiration (EUS-guided) is a minimally invasive procedure that uses ultrasound imaging to guide the needle into the abscess. This technique can reduce the risk of injury to surrounding organs. This procedure may be recommended if the abscess is not responding to antibiotics alone.\n\n4. Surgery: In some cases, a surgical procedure called a laparotomy or percutaneous drainage may be required if the abscess is large or refractory to other treatment methods.\n\n5. Diet: It is essential to maintain a balanced and nutritious diet to aid in the healing process during treatment. Avoiding spicy, greasy, or irregular meals can help prevent further complications or discomfort.\n\n6. Hydration: Keeping yourself adequately hydrated throughout the treatment process can help your body fight the infection and support the healing process.\n\n7. Rest and recovery: Allow your body sufficient rest during your treatment plan. Getting enough rest allows your body to focus on fighting the infection.\n\n8. Follow-up appointments: Regular follow-up visits with your healthcare provider are crucial for monitoring the size and resolution of the abscess. They can also provide guidance regarding diet and lifestyle changes that can support the healing process.\n\nThe duration of treatment for a liver abscess varies, as it depends on the size of the abscess, the patient's overall condition, and the response to treatment. It can take several months for the abscess to resolve entirely. If you feel that your current treatment plan is not effective, it's essential to discuss your concerns with your healthcare provider and explore alternative treatment options."}
{"question": "What procedure needs to be followed after extracting molar tooth?Hi, I had an upper back tooth extracted on Monday, now Wednesday, I used salt water and think the blood clot has come away. Iam now left with a hole again... I have no bleeding and no pain (yet) what are the chances of having dry socket and what should I do next? Thanks :)", "human": "Hello, Welcome Thanks for consulting HCM,  I have gone through your query, as you have mentioned that you have undergone extraction now you feel like dry socket , dont worry  No , you dont have Dry socket . Dry socket have pain bleeding foul smell from mouth , so dont worry you dnt have .  Do m warm saline gargle two - three times a day Take proper antibiotic course prescribed by your dentist. .Hope this will help you.", "ai": " I'm an AI language model and not a dentist, but I can provide you some general information about what to do after having a tooth extracted, based on common dental advice. After extracting a tooth, a blood clot forms in the socket to help in the healing process. If the clot comes out before healing is complete, it can leave the socket exposed, which is called dry socket.\n\nSymptoms of dry socket include persistent pain, visible bone in the socket, and increased sensitivity to air or temperature. However, not all cases of early clot loss lead to dry socket, and some people may not experience any symptoms.\n\nSince you're experiencing no pain or severe discomfort at the moment, it's difficult to determine if you have dry socket just based on that. Nevertheless, you should call your dentist or dental clinic for advice since they would have a better understanding of your individual situation. If it's confirmed that you have dry socket, your dentist may recommend the following treatments:\n\n1. Cleaning the socket: The dentist might use a saline solution or anesthetic to clean the socket, reducing the risk of infection and encouraging proper healing.\n\n2. Placing a medicated dressing: After cleaning the socket, your dentist could apply a medicated dressing that aids in alleviating pain and helping the socket to heal more rapidly.\n\n3. Pain relief: Over-the-counter pain relievers like acetaminophen (Tylenol) or non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) like ibuprofen (Advil, Motrin) can be used to manage pain. Your dentist may prescribe stronger pain medication if necessary.\n\n4. Avoiding irritants: Avoid smoking, rinsing the area vigorously, or using straws, as these can disrupt the healing process and increase the risk of dry socket further.\n\nBy following the instructions provided by your dentist and maintaining good oral hygiene, you can help the socket heal properly and reduce the chances of developing dry socket. Nonetheless, if you have any concerns, always consult your dental professional for accurate advice."}

{"question": "How can front teeth positions be corrected?hello, I am an 18 yr old male. I got my braces off 2 years back. I wore my retainers for about 10 months and then i discontinued wearing them. Now i feel that my front teeth are shifting forward from the root! What is the best way to correct them. I dont want braces again. Thanks", "human": "Hello Read your query as you have undergone orthodontic treatment now you feel of forwadly shifting of tooth dont worry you have to wear retainer for year as it was advisved by your orthodontist , I will suggest you to consult your orthodontist again and go for oral examination and discuss about retainer . Hope this will help you.", "ai": " I'm here to help answer your question to the best of my ability. However, I'm an artificial intelligence language model and not a dentist, so I can't provide you with definitive medical advice. I can give you some information about options for correcting the shifting of front teeth without braces.\n\n1. Clear Aligners: Clear aligners, such as Invisalign, are a series of custom-made, clear plastic trays that are worn over the teeth. They gradually move the teeth into the desired position. They are virtually invisible and removable, making them an attractive alternative to traditional braces for many people. However, they may not be suitable for severe misalignments or more complicated cases.\n\n2. Veneers: If the shifting is only cosmetic and not significant, porcelain veneers could be an option. Veneers are thin shells of tooth-colored material that are bonded to the front of the teeth to improve their appearance. They can hide small misalignments and can provide a more uniform look to the teeth.\n\n3. Orthodontic Appliances: There are several types of orthodontic appliances that can help correct front tooth misalignment. For example, jaw repositioning appliances, which can be worn at night to prevent teeth from shifting, and tongue cages, which can help correct tongue thrusting, a common cause of front tooth misalignment.\n\n4. Orthodontic Toothpaste: There are toothpastes and mouthwashes available that contain microscopic bristles or other abrasive particles that can help gently move teeth back into place. However, these products are not a substitute for professional orthodontic treatment, and their effectiveness is still a matter of debate in the dental community.\n\n5. Retainer Wear: I cannot stress enough the importance of wearing retainers as prescribed by your orthodontist. Retainers help keep your teeth in their desired position after braces have been removed. If you discontinued wearing your retainers too soon, it could be the reason for your current tooth alignment issue.\n\nI would recommend consulting with a dental professional, such as an orthodontist or your general dentist, to determine the best option for your specific situation. They can provide a proper evaluation and recommend the best course of action to correct your front tooth misalignment."}

However, I can suggest some common causes for excessive nighttime urination and foul-smelling urine in young children based on available information. These issues might be related, as both could potentially be due to increased water intake, dehydration during the night, or an underlying medical condition. Here are some suggestions, but please consult your child's pediatrician for professional advice:\n\n1. Monitor water intake: Be aware of your child's overall water intake throughout the day and during meals. Limit water consumption before bedtime, as excessive water intake during the day and evening may result in increased nighttime urination.\n\n2. Diaper check: Ensure that the diaper is properly secured to prevent leaking and cause discomfort or irritation. Wet diapers may lead to frequent changing and disturbances during the night.\n\n3. Constipation: If your child is constipated, her stool could be difficult to pass and result in frequent urination due to pressure on the bladder. Offer water, fruits, and vegetables to help her maintain a soft stool, and encourage physical activity to facilitate bowel movements.\n\n4. Food: Certain foods, especially sugary, acidic, and spicy ones, can alter the pH and odor of urine. Try keeping a food diary to monitor if any specific foods appear to correlate with foul-smelling urine.\n\n5. Infections: Foul-smelling urine can sometimes be caused by urinary tract infections (UTIs) or kidney infections, which require medical attention. Symptoms of a UTI include pain during urination, fever, and irritability.\n\n6. Sweating: Excessive sweating can lead to increased thirst and frequent urination. However, it's worth noting that for many infants, sweating is a normal occurrence. If you're concerned about the quantity of sweat, consult your pediatrician for guidance.\n\n7. Diabetes: Although rare in young children, diabetes can cause excessive thirst and frequent urination. If other symptoms, such as extreme thirst, frequent hunger, rapid breathing, or lethargy, are present, consult your child's pediatrician and discuss these concerns.\n\n8. Other medical conditions: Various medical conditions, such as bladder problems, kidney disease, or metabolic disorders, can cause frequent urination and foul-smelling urine. In case of concern, always consult a healthcare professional for further evaluation."}

I have never had allergies to food or insects, could there a be relation to removal and allergic reaction?", "human": "Hello,Your symptoms definitely suggest severe allergic reaction and the possibility of the chemicals used during the process of removal of the Mirena causing the allergy has to be considered, since you cannot be allergic to the IUD which you had been carrying in your body for so long. A definite conclusion can be arrived at only after a thorough evaluation by an allergy specialist and please make sure that you always avoid the allergen in future. Also, inform those who live with you about the allergy and what causes it. Hope you find this information useful. Wish you good health.", "ai": " I'm an AI language model and not able to diagnose medical conditions, but I can help you understand the possible connections you're asking about. The symptoms you described, such as hives, trouble breathing, and a swollen tongue, can be signs of an allergic reaction or anaphylaxis.\n\nIt is uncommon but not impossible for an intrauterine device (IUD) like Mirena to cause an allergic reaction or anaphylaxis during or after removal. The exact cause can be difficult to pinpoint, but there are a few potential explanations:\n\n1. Latex allergy: Some IUDs, including earlier models of Mirena, contain natural rubber latex. During removal, the latex may come into contact with the mucous membranes or skin, causing an allergic reaction in some individuals.\n2. Metals used in the device: Some people may be allergic to specific metals used in IUDs like Mirena, such as copper or silicone. This is a rare cause of an allergic reaction, but it is a possibility.\n3. Cross-sensitization: An allergic reaction to one substance may cause a reaction to another seemingly unrelated substance due to cross-sensitization. For example, people with latex allergies may also be allergic to certain foods, such as bananas or avocados, due to the proteins they share.\n4. Other factors: There may be additional factors that contribute to your allergic reaction, such as stress, medications, or underlying health conditions.\n\nIt's important to follow up with your healthcare provider to discuss the details of your symptoms and any relevant medical history. They can help determine the cause and recommend appropriate treatment options. If you suspect you have had an allergic reaction to Mirena, your healthcare provider may recommend carrying an epinephrine auto-injector (EpiPen) with you to treat anaphylaxis in the future.\n\nKeep in mind that most people who have an IUD removed do not experience allergic reactions or anaphylaxis. If you have any concerns or questions, be sure to discuss them with your healthcare provider."}

Try getting tested for specific types of sugar allergies... fructose, sucrose, etc. It also might possibly be a different food allergy that is found in a lot of sweets or sugary substances.", "ai": " Yes, eating too much sugar can contribute to itching in some people. This is because sugar can cause inflammation in the body and disrupt the functioning of insulin, which can lead to a condition called non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD). NAFLD can cause itching, particularly in the back and arms.\n\nAdditionally, sugar can promote inflammation in the skin, leading to conditions such as acne, eczema, and psoriasis, which can cause itching.\n\nReducing your sugar intake can help alleviate itching caused by sugar, but it may take some time to notice a difference.

But don't soap-wash more than once a day. Doing so can increase dryness.Always wipe from front to back after having a bowel movement.Wear cotton panties (no synthetic fabrics), and change your underwear every day.Stay away from hot bath tubs and avoid whirlpool baths.No swimming until you get better.Do not douche. Douching removes the healthy and normal bacteria in the vagina that actually protect you from infections.Wear loose clothes; and, no pantyhose.Use condoms during sexual intercourse to prevent sexually transmitted diseases.If you are experiencing vaginal dryness, use a vaginal moisturizer. Apply a water-based lubricant (K-Y, Astroglide) before having sex.Avoid sexual intercourse until your symptoms improve.Limit the number of sexual-partner.Don't scratch -- you can further irritate the area.Apply Clotrimazole/Hydrocortisone vaginal cream for prompt relief. Get yourself checked for any STDs. Take Loratadine by mouth if you also have got itching around the genitals.May you get very well soon and have a wonderful time ahead.

Practicing relaxation techniques, getting adequate sleep, and engaging in activities you enjoy can help reduce stress and improve overall well-being."}
{"question": "Can buprenorphine lead to confusion, memory loss and emotional hallucinations?a friend recently prescribed buprenophin 2 times a day 8 mg,however days may be skipped due to lack of funds,and they might be injecting the pill themselves they also have severe depression and a past head injury.he is slurring his words and pointing it out himself that his speech isent right.and confusion memory loss,emotional,hallucinations, is this the meds?is this in the morphine family?", "human": "HiThanks for using healthcare magicSlurring of speech, emotional hallucination, confusion are due to overdose of buprenorphine. It is morphine partial agonist and from morphine family. In that case, you would suggest to take him to emergency set up and get him treated. Sometime, overdose of opioid lead to respiratory depression, which may be harmful.Thanks", "ai": " Buprenorphine is a partial opioid agonist used to treat opioid addiction and pain. While it belongs to the opioid class of drugs, it has a different chemical structure than morphine and its effects on cognitive functions or emotional hallucinations can vary from person to person.\n\nHowever, some side effects of buprenorphine that may cause concern are:\n\n1. Dizziness\n2. Drowsiness\n3. Headache\n4. Nausea\n5. Vomiting\n6. Constipation\n7. Fatigue\n8. Mood swings\n\nMemory loss, confusion, emotional hallucinations, and severe depression are more consistent with the symptoms of depression and the possible effects of a past head injury than buprenorphine itself. Injecting the medication, skipping doses, and dealing with financial stress may also contribute to the worsening of these symptoms.\n\nIt is important for your friend to discuss these concerns with their healthcare provider as soon as possible. They should not stop taking their medication without professional advice, but should discuss any possible dose adjustments or additional therapies to help manage their symptoms. It might also be beneficial to explore options for financial assistance or support groups for opioid addiction."}
{"question": "How to cure seizures permanently?My daughter has taken Topamax for seizures. She quit taken the meds several months ago and her seizures are coming back more frequently then before. She said her insurance will not cover them anymore. What should I do ? She just had another seizure today.", "human": "welcome to HCM!From my clinical expeirnece I can tell you that your daughter should start the medicine as soon as possible. As you mentioned that her seizures are back with more intensity, and the nature is different now, so , you should preffrably  see a neurologist and take consultation before starting drugs. She should also get an MRI brain to rule out any organicity, get her liver function test and blood counts (prior to starting drugs). I know it is very difficult to take long term medication but it is really important for her to remain seizure free. Every seizure destroys some brain cells, and thereby making her prone to get more of them. Apart from drugs you should see that she dosent drive for some time now, operates machinery under supervision.Please try to cut expenses on other things and ask her to take medicine, she needs them. Donot stop the drugs without consulting the doctor.Hope the reply is usefulDr. Manisha Gopal", "ai": " I'm an artificial intelligence language model with no ability to diagnose or cure health conditions, including seizures. It's important to note that I cannot provide medical advice or recommend discontinuing any prescribed medication without consulting a healthcare professional.\n\nHowever, I can suggest some general steps you might consider taking to help manage your daughter's seizures:\n\n1. Contact her healthcare provider: If your daughter's seizures have returned and are frequent, it's crucial that she speaks with her healthcare provider about this. They may be able to help her adjust her treatment plan, or explore alternative options.\n\n2. Reach out to her insurance provider: She should also try contacting her insurance provider to understand why her medication is no longer covered and if there's any alternative or more affordable treatment options.\n\n3. Consider other treatment methods: If Topamax is no longer effective or is not covered by insurance, she may want to discuss other seizure medication options, therapy, or lifestyle changes with her doctor. Some people have found that methods like the ketogenic diet, acupuncture, or stress management techniques help reduce seizure frequency.\n\n4. Connect with support groups: Being a caregiver for someone with seizures can be mentally and emotionally taxing. Connecting with other families going through similar experiences can help you feel less isolated and get valuable support and advice.\n\n5. Consider clinical trials: Depending on your location, there may be clinical trials testing newer treatments for seizures. Your daughter's healthcare provider can help you explore this option and determine if she might be eligible.\n\n6. Ensure a safe environment: Make sure that your daughter's living space is as safe as possible, especially if she experiences seizures. Remove potential hazards such as sharp objects or tripping hazards, and help her practice safety measures like wearing a medical alert bracelet.\n\nRemember, it's essential to consult with healthcare professionals for accurate information and for creating a personalized treatment plan for your daughter's seizures."}
{"question": "What causes difficulty to support weight while standing?Hello, my daughter is 9 months old and cannot support her own weight in a standing position. When I try to let her stand she bends forward at the waist. When she stands upright, it is on her toes and only for a few seconds. She is extremely flexible in the hips and has just now started doing an army low-crawl. What do you think is going on?", "human": "It's too early to make her stand and watch for her age of 9m and as long she could sit unsupported and crawl, it's Ok for the age. Sometimes joint laxity can show extreme flexibility but that too it's early to decide and wait till 12-18 months for reassessment.", "ai": " At 9 months old, it is normal for a child to be exploring various ways of moving and may not yet have the strength or coordination to support their own weight in a standing position for an extended period. The behaviors you described, such as bending forward at the waist and standing on toes, are common in infants as they work on developing the necessary muscles and skills for standing and eventual walking. Your daughter's flexibility in the hips may aid her in certain positions but it could also make it more challenging for her to maintain balance in a standing position. If you have concerns about your daughter's development, it is recommended that you consult with your pediatrician or a physical therapist. They can assess her overall development and provide guidance on any interventions or exercises that may be helpful to support her progress."}

I have reviewed your query and here is my advice. Almond and walnut doesn't have any proven effect on uric acid or kidney function. The antioxidants and essential oils contained in them may have some good effects on overall effects but clinical evidence are lacking. Do frequent followup tests in case of high values, consult a physician and get evaluated. Hope I have answered your query. Let me know if I can assist you further.", "ai": " Almonds and English walnuts are rich in healthy fats, fiber, and various micronutrients. They have been shown to have numerous health benefits, including reducing inflammation and insulin resistance. However, there is limited scientific evidence directly linking the consumption of these nuts to uric acid normalization.\n\nGout is the most common cause of elevated uric acid levels and subsequent joint pain. While some studies suggest that a diet rich in nuts, including almonds and walnuts, may help prevent gout attacks due to their anti-inflammatory effects, there is no definitive evidence that consuming these nuts will lower uric acid levels in people who already have hyperuricemia or gout.\n\nAs for your specific case, regular menstrual cycles depend on various factors, including hormonal balance and overall health. While your uric acid level and irregular menstrual cycles are related conditions, they are distinct medical issues. Addressing uric acid levels may not necessarily improve your menstrual cycle regularity.\n\nIn summary, while consuming almonds and English walnuts may have health benefits, they have not been proven to directly reduce uric acid levels in people with hyperuricemia or gout. It is essential to consult with your healthcare professional regarding any specific concerns or conditions you have, like your menstrual irregularities or high fasting blood sugar. They can recommend appropriate interventions or treatments based on your individual case."}

Treatment for a compound fracture typically involves the following steps:\n\n1. Surgical intervention: The first priority is to clean the wound and remove any debris or foreign objects. This is usually done in an operating room under anesthesia. The doctor may also insert metal plates, screws, or rods to realign the bone and provide stability while it heals.\n2. Antibiotics: To prevent infection, you will likely be prescribed antibiotics, either orally or intravenously, depending on the severity of the injury and the presence of an open wound.\n3. Wound care: Your doctor will instruct you on how to care for your wound, including changing dressings and watching for signs of infection.\n4. Immobilization: To allow the bone to heal properly, it will need to be immobilized. This may involve wearing a cast or using a brace or splint.\n5. Physical therapy: Once the bone has healed sufficiently, you will likely need physical therapy to help regain strength and flexibility.\n\nIt's important to remember that the treatment for a compound fracture can vary depending on the specifics of the injury and individual circumstances. Your doctor will be able to provide you with personalized guidance based on your unique situation.\n\nAs a side note, the fact that your fracture was not detected until recently is not necessarily a concern, as not all fractures are symptomatic and some may be evident only on imaging studies. However, you should discuss any concerns you have with your doctor during your upcoming appointment.\n\nAdditionally, being a truck driver with a compound fracture, you may want to consult with your employer about any modifications that might need to be made to your driving duties during the healing process. Your doctor's recommendations, as well as any restrictions he or she may place on you, will be important to follow in order to ensure proper healing and a successful outcome."}

Here are some benefits of having a pacemaker:\n\n1. Improved Cardiac Output: A pacemaker can improve the efficiency of the heart and increase cardiac output, leading to better heart function and improved symptoms of heart failure.\n2. Fewer Hospitalizations: Pacemakers can help reduce the risk of hospitalizations due to heart-related conditions.\n3. Improved Quality of Life: Pacemakers can improve symptoms such as fatigue, shortness of breath, and dizziness, leading to an improved quality of life.\n4. Increased Safety: Pacemakers can help prevent dangerous heart rhythms such as ventricular tachycardia or ventricular fibrillation, which can be life-threatening.\n5. Long-term Benefits: Research has shown that pacemakers can lead to significant long-term benefits, including extended lifespan and reduced risk of death compared to people with similar heart conditions who do not have a pacemaker.\n\nHowever, there are also risks and considerations associated with pacemakers, such as the risk of infection, Pacemaker-related syncope (fainting), and the need for regular check-ups and follow-up appointments.

Wish you a very good health.", "ai": " It's important to note that I'm an AI language model and not a doctor, so I can't provide a definitive diagnosis based on the information provided. However, I can try to help you understand some potential causes of the lumps you've noticed behind your child's ears.\n\nBehind-the-ear lumps in children can be caused by various conditions, some of which are harmless while others require medical attention. Here are some possible causes:\n\n1. Lymph nodes: Enlarged lymph nodes in the neck or behind the ears can cause noticeable lumps. Lymph nodes can become inflamed due to an infection, such as an ear infection or an infection in the throat, tonsils, or salivary glands. Your child's doctor may have checked these areas during their examinations, but it's worth mentioning. Lymph nodes usually aren't painful, but if they are, your child may need to see a specialist for further evaluation.\n\n2. Earwax buildup: Earwax (cerumen) can sometimes accumulate behind the ear, creating a visible lump. This is usually not a cause for concern, but it can cause discomfort and itching. If you suspect your child has a buildup of earwax, you can try gently cleaning their ear with a soft cloth or a cotton swab dipped in warm water. However, be cautious not to push the wax deeper into the ear canal, as this can cause more problems. Your child's doctor can also remove the wax if necessary.\n\n3. Skin conditions: Several skin conditions, such as seborrheic dermatitis, dermatitis, or hidradenitis suppurativa, can cause lumps or bumps behind the ears. These conditions are typically accompanied by other symptoms like itching, redness, flaking, and pus-filled bumps if the condition is bacterial. Your child's doctor may be able to diagnose the condition based on the appearance of the lumps and any other symptoms your child is experiencing.\n\n4. Abscesses: An abscess is a pocket of pus that forms due to a bacterial infection. If the lumps are painful, warm, or red, they could be a sign of an abscess. Abscesses usually require antibiotic treatment and may need to be drained by a healthcare professional.\n\n5. Tumors or cysts: In rare cases, the lumps behind your child's ears could be a sign of a benign or malignant tumor or a cyst. Fortunately, these are relatively uncommon causes. Your child's doctor should refer you to a specialist for further evaluation if they are concerned about the lumps' origin.\n\nIt is essential to follow up with your child's healthcare provider for further evaluation and to rule out any serious conditions if you're unsure about the cause of the lumps. In the meantime, you can monitor your child's symptoms and document any changes to help provide more information to your doctor. For instance, you can take note of whether the lumps are associated with any specific activities, time of day, or relief of symptoms when applying heat or cold compresses."}

WHAT IS CAUSING THIS ???????", "human": "Hello dearWelcome to Healthcaremagic.comI have evaluated your query thoroughly .*  Post traumatic hematoma is usually from the tear of internal vessel at     the  time of sprain or strain , when enough amount of blood collects     through  the tear  at that time only you notice the hematoma  , but the     process  starts  immediately  after  the  incidence .Hope this clears your doubt .Regards .", "ai": " A hematoma is a collection of blood outside of the blood vessels, and it can occur after a muscle strain or tear due to bleeding from the ruptured vessels in the affected area. The cause of a hematoma in your thigh, following a muscle pull, could be due to several reasons:\n\n1. Vasoconstriction and re-bleeding: A muscle pull or strain can cause small vessels in the affected area to spasm, leading to vasoconstriction, or a narrowing of the blood vessels. This can cause the clot that forms during the initial injury to become dislodged, leading to re-bleeding, and the formation of a new hematoma.\n2. Bruising and pooling of blood: When you have a muscle pull or strain, the injured muscles and surrounding tissues can bruise. This bruising can cause blood to pool in the affected area, leading to the formation of a hematoma.\n3. Inadequate clotting: In some cases, a hematoma may form due to an inability of the blood to clot properly. This can be caused by various underlying medical conditions, such as a bleeding disorder, or the use of certain medications, such as blood thinners.\n4. Trauma: A second injury to the same area of the thigh could lead to the formation of another hematoma.\n\nThe fact that you have had two hematomas in the same thigh within six months is concerning, especially since your healthcare providers have been unable to identify a clear cause. It is essential that you continue to discuss these symptoms with your healthcare provider and consider undergoing additional diagnostic tests to rule out any underlying medical conditions that might be contributing to these hematomas. Some possible tests that could be recommended include:\n\n1. Ultrasound: An ultrasound can help to identify the presence and location of a hematoma, as well as assess its size and thickness.\n2. Blood tests: A complete blood count (CBC) can help to evaluate your blood clotting function and identify any underlying bleeding disorders.\n3. Coagulation studies: More specialized coagulation tests may be necessary if your healthcare provider suspects a clotting disorder.\n4. Arteriogram: An arteriogram can help to rule out the presence of an arterial bleed.\n5. Duplex ultrasound: This test can evaluate blood flow in the veins and arteries in the affected leg.\n\nIn the meantime, you can manage the symptoms of your hematoma with rest, ice, compression, and elevation. Over-the-counter pain medications can also help to alleviate discomfort. Avoid activities that could exacerbate the injury or put additional strain on the affected muscle, such as heavy lifting or prolonged periods of sitting or standing. Your healthcare provider may also advise physical therapy to help improve muscle strength and flexibility and prevent future muscle strains or tears."}

However, please consult with his healthcare team for the most accurate and personalized information.\n\n1. Resistant Hypertension: Some people have high BP that is difficult to control despite receiving standard treatments. This condition, known as resistant hypertension, is more common in older adults and those with chronic kidney disease, obesity, or other medical conditions. The exact cause is not known, but possible reasons include medication non-adherence, incorrect dosages, or underlying medical conditions.\n\n2. Underlying Medical Conditions: If your husband's high BP is not responding to treatments, underlying medical conditions like kidney disease, diabetes, obstructive sleep apnea, or thyroid issues could be contributing factors. In some cases, these conditions may need to be treated more aggressively before BP begins to respond to antihypertensive medications.\n\n3. Lifestyle Factors: Lifestyle factors that can worsen or contribute to high BP include stress, sleep deprivation, lack of physical activity, smoking, and a high-sodium diet. Your husband's hospital team may recommend lifestyle modifications like stress management techniques, regular exercise, a low-sodium diet, and quitting smoking to help lower BP in conjunction with medication.\n\n4. Adverse Side Effects of Medications: Some medications used to treat high BP can have adverse side effects that might hinder their effectiveness. Speak with your husband's healthcare team to explore potential side effects, consider alternative medications, or adjust dosages to minimize side effects while controlling BP.\n\n5. Inadequate Monitoring and Care: Ensuring proper medication administration, dosages, and monitoring while in the hospital can help ensure effective BP control. Make sure your husband is receiving the prescribed medications on time and in the correct dosages. If there are concerns about the adequacy of care or medication adherence, discuss these concerns with his healthcare team.\n\nTo get the most accurate and personalized advice, it's essential to contact your husband's healthcare team for more information on his specific situation. While the points above may help explain some reasons for high BP resistance, only a medical professional can pinpoint the exact cause and recommend the best course of action for your husband's situation."}

Please feel free to recontact me.Hope I have answered your query. Let me know if I can assist you further. All the best,Dr. Eni", "ai": " Black marks on the kidney, also known as renal calcifications, can have various causes. Renal calcifications are small, hard deposits that form in the kidneys. They can be caused by several things, including:\n\n1. Chronic kidney disease: Kidneys that do not function properly for an extended period can lead to the formation of mineral deposits in the kidneys.\n2. Urinary tract infections: Chronic urinary tract infections can result in kidney stones and, eventually, renal calcifications.\n3. Hyperparathyroidism: This condition results in the overproduction of parathyroid hormone, which can cause calcium to be deposited in the kidneys.\n4. Medications: Certain medications, such as diuretics, antacids, and some antibiotics, can contribute to the development of renal calcifications.\n5. Age: As people age, they are more likely to develop renal calcifications due to various factors, including chronic disease and deteriorating kidney function.\n6. Lifestyle factors: Long-term smoking and alcohol consumption can damage the kidneys and increase the risk of developing renal calcifications. However, in your father's case, stopping smoking and drinking a few years ago might reduce the likelihood of this being a significant contributing factor.\n\nIt's important to note that having a black mark on your kidney doesn't necessarily mean there's something sinister or hidden. Most cases of renal calcifications are asymptomatic and don't lead to any complications. Your father's doctors are likely investigating the cause to determine if any action needs to be taken. If you have concerns, it's best to encourage your father to be open and honest with his healthcare team. They will be able to provide the most accurate information based on his medical records and the results of any tests or imaging that have been done."}

Wish you good health. Thanks.", "ai": " Based on the information you have provided, it is important to note that I am an AI language model and not a doctor. I cannot diagnose your condition, but I can suggest some potential causes for your symptoms of breathlessness during the night that might be related to your history of heart issues.\n\n1. Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD): This condition can cause breathlessness, especially during physical activities and at night. It is often associated with smoking and can be accompanied by a persistent cough, wheezing, and decreased motivation.\n2. Heart Failure: Heart conditions, such as heart failure, can cause shortness of breath even at rest. You mentioned being diagnosed with two blocked arteries and being told that two veins took their place. This could potentially suggest heart failure, although the details of your diagnosis are not clear without consulting your healthcare provider.\n3. Anemia: A decrease in red blood cells or hemoglobin can cause breathlessness as your body requires more oxygen to function properly. This can be caused by various conditions, including nutritional deficiencies or chronic diseases like kidney disease or rheumatoid arthritis.\n4. Sleep Apnea: This disorder can disrupt your sleep and cause you to feel out of breath during the night. Obstructive sleep apnea occurs when your airway becomes blocked, interrupting your breathing despite efforts to breathe.\n5. Pulmonary Embolism: A blood clot in the lung (pulmonary embolism) can obstruct blood flow and lead to shortness of breath, chest pain, and rapid heartbeat.\n6. Panic Attacks: Although your symptoms may suggest a physical cause, some people experience anxiety or panic attacks that can mimic the feelings of being out of breath.\n\nTo determine the underlying cause of your symptoms, it is essential to consult with your healthcare provider directly. They may recommend further tests and evaluations to diagnose and treat the condition appropriately. In the meantime, try to manage your symptoms with relaxation techniques, such as deep breathing exercises, and a healthy lifestyle that includes a balanced diet, regular physical activity, and adequate rest."}
{"question": "What causes an anteroseptal infarct on ECG?if an ecg states that you have had an anteroseptal infart on several different occasions and an echocardiogram shows a thickened septal area and it is nearly a year since the incident that makes you think that you have had an mi, what is the likelihood that the anteroseptal event actually happened and was not just something like indigestion", "human": "Hello, Welcome to HCM.Anteroseptal infarct seen on ECG or EKG = electrokardiogram means that you did have a heart attack = the heart muscle was damaged by a clogged coronary artery and this is what causes the changes seen by the doctors on the ECG recording. These changes are quite specific and characteristic and it is not likely that other medical conditions like indigestion would have produced them. Also, since these changes were seen on several different occasions, this makes an anteroseptal infarct  quite certain.After an infarct the damaged area of the heart muscle undergoes scarring and it may also result in thickening of that area as seen on the Echocardiogram.Some patients, especially diabetics, do not have symptoms like chest pain when they are having their heart attacks, so it is possible to just see the EKG changes of an \"old MI\" old myocarial infarction on an EKG while the patient does not even know that they had a heart attack.Typically an acute heart attack causes severe chest pain, Shortness of breath and makes one very ill and treatment in the hospital is required , where blood tests are done to confirm a diagnosis of so called acute MI.Hope this helps you understand this issue.Wishing you best of health.", "ai": " An anteroseptal infarct is a type of myocardial infarction (MI or heart attack) that occurs in the anterior (front) part of the septum, which is the wall of muscle separating the two chambers of the left side of the heart (left ventricle and right ventricle).\n\nOn an electrocardiogram (ECG), an anteroseptal infarct may be characterized by several findings, including:\n\n1. ST-segment elevation in leads V1 to V4 (anterior leads) - ST-segment elevation indicates that there is damage to the heart muscle in the area supplied by the anterior wall branches of the left coronary artery or the septal branches of the right coronary artery.\n2. T-wave inversion in leads V1 to V4 or V5 to V6 - T-wave inversion indicates that there is ongoing injury or damage to the heart muscle in the area.\n3. Q-wave development in leads V1 to V4 - Q-waves are deep, notched waves in the QRS complex that indicate old, healed MI in a particular area.\n\nIt is important to note that an ECG is not a definitive diagnostic tool for an MI, and its interpretation should be correlated with the clinical context, such as symptoms, medical history, and other diagnostic tests. An ECG finding of anteroseptal infarct does not definitively prove that an MI has occurred, but it is strong evidence that supports the diagnosis.\n\nAn echocardiogram is a more definitive diagnostic tool for an MI, as it can directly visualize the heart muscle and demonstrate areas of damage, such as thickened or scarred areas. A thickened septal area on echocardiogram, as you mentioned, is consistent with prior MI in the anteroseptal area. However, it is essential to note that other conditions, such as hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, can also cause a thickened septum, so the diagnosis should be made in conjunction with other clinical and diagnostic findings.\n\nRegarding the likelihood that the anteroseptal event actually happened and was not just due to indigestion, the presence of multiple ECGs showing anteroseptal infarct findings and an echocardiogram showing a thickened septal area strongly supports the diagnosis of prior MI. Indigestion and other gastrointestinal conditions do not produce these specific findings on ECG and echocardiogram. However, it is always important to consider other possible explanations for symptoms and diagnostic findings, and your medical provider should evaluate any potential alternative diagnoses before making a definitive diagnosis."}
{"question": "Obsessive compulsive disorder, keeping house clean always, everything has a place, anxiety. Treatment?Hello, I am concered that I may have OCD or another obessive disorder. I have the need to clean and have a clean house all the time. Everything in my house has to have a spot and if something is misplaced I get really anxious and have to put it back in the correct spot immediently. my house is always clean spotless. I get anxious alot and randomly start moving things around.", "human": "Hello,Your symptoms do suggest a tendency for obsessions and compulsions, but to label it OCD you need to be evaluated by a psychiatrist. There are many other things which need to be ascertained to make this diagnosis. There are good medications available for treatment and you must visit the doctor for evaluation. They will talk to you in more detail, assess the level of anxiety in you and accordingly will prescribe you  a treatment plan.Good luck.", "ai": " I'm here to help answer any questions you might have about obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) and potential treatments. I'm not a doctor or therapist, but I can provide you with some general information. It's important to keep in mind that I cannot diagnose you with OCD or any other condition based on the information you've provided. Only a qualified mental health professional can make an accurate diagnosis.\n\nRegarding your symptoms, it's true that OCD often involves obsessions (unwanted, intrusive thoughts) and compulsions (repetitive behaviors or mental acts) that the person feels driven to perform to reduce their anxiety or distress. In some cases, the obsession is having a clean and orderly environment.\n\nThere are several evidence-based treatments for OCD that may help reduce the anxiety and compulsions you're experiencing. These treatments include:\n\n1. Cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT): This is a type of psychotherapy that helps people learn how to identify and challenge their problematic thoughts (cognitions) and replace them with more helpful, balanced thoughts. In the case of OCD, CBT can help people learn how to resist the urge to engage in compulsions and instead tolerate the anxiety that comes with not performing them.\n2. Exposure and response prevention (ERP): This is a specific type of CBT that involves gradually exposing the person to their feared situations or objects and helping them learn how to resist the urge to engage in compulsions. ERP can help people with OCD learn how to cope with the anxiety that comes from not being able to control their environment completely.\n3. Medication: In some cases, medication (such as selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors or SSRI antidepressants) may be used in conjunction with therapy to help reduce symptoms of OCD.\n\nIt's important to remember that treatment for OCD can be a long-term process and may require a significant time commitment from both the person seeking treatment and their therapist or healthcare provider. If you're concerned that you may have OCD, I would encourage you to reach out to a mental health professional for a thorough evaluation and to discuss your treatment options in more detail. They can help you develop a personalized treatment plan that addresses your specific needs and goals."}
{"question": "What causes vomiting after brushing teeth?Yesterday morning while brushing i vomited and after that saw a very small amount of brown color in my saliva. and after that i am seeing small amount of brown color in my saliva. Most of the time the saliva is not in pure white color.please suggest me what to do?", "human": "Hi..Welcome to HEALTHCARE MAGIC..I have gone through your query and can understand your concerns..As per your complain vomiting and nausea during brushing teeth is commonly seen in individuals as many individuals have a sensitive soft palate and when brush touches the palate deep or there is accumulation of foam and saliva in mouth there is a gag reflex and some people may tend to vomit..The brownish colour that you have seen seems to be traces of blood that might have occurred due to bleeding from the area of throat due to vigorous gagging or can be due to bleeding from throat or oropharyngeal region if you have any conditions like acid reflux, chronic upper respiratory tract infection, sinusitis, throat inflammation etc..In case if you experience frank blood or repeated episodes of brown colour in saliva you should consult an Oral Physician or an Otolaryngologist and get evaluated and treatment of underlying cause will relieve the symptoms..Hope this information helps..Thanks and regards.Dr.Honey Nandwani Arora.", "ai": " Vomiting after brushing your teeth can have several possible causes. Here are some potential reasons:\n\n1. Tooth sensitivity: Brushing too hard or using a toothpaste with harsh ingredients can irritate your gums and cause them to become sensitive. This can lead to nausea and vomiting, especially if you have a full stomach. Try using a softer toothbrush and a sensitive toothpaste to see if that helps.\n2. Gag reflex: Some people have a strong gag reflex and may feel like they are going to vomit when they brush their teeth, especially if they have a full mouth or if they are brushing the back of their mouths. This is a normal reaction and can usually be managed by taking your time and being gentle while brushing.\n3. Gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD): If you have GERD, the acids in your stomach can flow back into your esophagus and cause symptoms such as heartburn, nausea, and vomiting. Brushing your teeth can sometimes trigger these symptoms, especially if you have a full stomach. If you suspect you have GERD, talk to your doctor about treatment options.\n4. Infections: Infections in the mouth, such as gum disease or tooth infections, can cause nausea and vomiting. If you have other symptoms such as pain, redness, or swelling in your mouth, it's important to see a dentist or doctor to rule out any underlying infections.\n5. Other medical conditions: Vomiting can be a symptom of many different medical conditions, including food poisoning, viral infections, and liver or kidney disease. If you are concerned about your symptoms, it's important to speak with your doctor to rule out any underlying health issues.\n\nAs for the small amount of brown color in your saliva, this could be due to a number of things, such as foods you have eaten, tobacco use, or certain medications. If you are concerned about this, it's a good idea to keep a journal of what you eat and drink, as well as any medications you take, and bring it to your doctor's appointment. They may be able to help you identify the cause of the brown color in your saliva.\n\nIn the meantime, you may want to try some of the following things to help alleviate your symptoms:\n\n* Brush your teeth gently and slowly, using a soft-bristled toothbrush and a sensitive toothpaste.\n* Wait at least 30 minutes after eating before brushing your teeth.\n* Take small sips of water as you brush to help keep your mouth moist and wash away any residue.\n* Avoid using a toothpaste with harsh ingredients, such as sodium lauryl sulfate or artificial sweeteners.\n* Use a tongue scraper to remove any bacteria or debris on your tongue.\n* Consider using a toothpaste with desensitizing agents, such as fluoride or strontium chloride, to help reduce sensitivity.\n\nIf your symptoms persist or worsen, or if you are concerned about the brown color in your saliva, it's important to speak with your doctor for further evaluation and treatment."}

Treatment?Hi Doctor, I am Sushma,22 years old.I am getting severe stomach pain after eating breakfast in the morning.Even,I am having very simple and light food with out masala.I have tried Eno thinking it is reason of gastric trouble but there is no pain relief.Pain is getting reduced if I have any butter milk.Is it because of gastric trouble?Please help me with a solution for this problem and kindly suggest the diet to be followed. Thanks, Sushma.", "human": "Hello, vwmulasaisushma,I am glad to see that you have limited the intake of spices.If you are regularly experiencing stomach distress after eating,we definitely have to look into causes. You are a very youngfemale, and I am sure you are under a lot of stress. Duodenalulcer is common among young population. If you have a familyhistory of stomach problems, more likely that you have this.Eno or alkaseltzer can give very minor relief but they don'tcontrol acid very well. If any, they can cause more acid rebound.There are very effective medications available over the counter,such as H-2 blockers,Proton Pump Inhibitors for acid control.H-2 blockers include Cimetadine, Ranitidine etc. PPIs includeOmeprazole,Lansoprazole,Rabeprazole, Esomeprazole etc.These are highly effective. You can start taking these twice a dayabout one hour before breakfast and before the evning meal.You need to take this for 4-6 weeks. If you get complete relief,you probably don't need x-rays or endoscopy. If the symptomscontinue, see a specialist. I also want to tell you that most of theduodenal ulcers are associated with a bacteria called H.Pylori.You need to be tested for that and if positive, needs treatment.Avoid excess caffeine, alcohol,tomato and citrus products.I wish you the very best.", "ai": " Hello Sushma, I'm sorry to hear that you're experiencing severe stomach pain after eating. While I cannot definitively diagnose your condition based on the information provided, there are a few possible causes for your symptoms, including:\n\n* Gastroesophageal Reflux Disease (GERD) or acid reflux\n* Irritable Bowel Syndrome (IBS)\n* Food intolerance or allergy\n* Infection or inflammation in the stomach or intestines\n\nBased on your description of symptoms, it's possible that your stomach pain could be related to acid reflux, as ENO (an antacid) did provide some relief with your symptoms. However, it's important to note that Antacids can only provide temporary relief, and it's essential to address the underlying cause. Additionally, the reduction in pain with butter milk could also be due to its buffering effect and soothing properties.\n\nTo help determine the cause of your symptoms, you might consider keeping a food diary to identify any patterns or triggers. You may also consider trying the following dietary modifications:\n\n1. Avoid trigger foods: Common trigger foods for GERD and IBS include spicy, fatty, and greasy foods, citrus fruits and juices, chocolate, caffeine, and alcohol.\n2. Eat smaller, more frequent meals: Eating larger meals may put extra strain on your digestive system and increase the risk of stomach pain.\n3. Chew food thoroughly: Properly chewed food is easier to digest, reducing the likelihood of stomach pain.\n4. Eat slowly: Eating too quickly can lead to swallowing air and stomach discomfort.\n5. Drink plenty of fluids: Proper hydration can help prevent constipation and aid in digestion.\n\nIf you continue to experience severe stomach pain or if your symptoms persist despite these dietary changes, it's a good idea to consult with a healthcare professional or a gastroenterologist for further evaluation and treatment. They may be able to perform additional testing to determine the cause and provide appropriate targeted therapy."}

I can understand your concern. See, exact time frame for survival of these patients can not be determined. But by your history and description, she is definitely have very poor prognosis. She is having failing heart due to valves blockage. And surgery is also very risky due to over all health. Without surgery, in her case, life expectancy is less than 1 month. She may succumb at any moment due to cardiac arrest. So be prepared for this. Hope I have solved your query. I will be happy to help you further. Wishing good health to your madam. Thanks.", "ai": " I'm an assistant and cannot provide an exact answer to that question as the survival rate for someone with completely blocked valves (three-valve obstruction) can significantly vary depending on individual factors like age, overall health, presence and severity of other health conditions, and access to palliative care. In some cases, blocked valves may not cause noticeable symptoms, while others may result in congestive heart failure, fluid accumulation in the lungs, or other complications that can impact survival.\n\nIt is important to note that having a heart attack and heart damage can also affect one's life expectancy. Your mother's doctor has said that her case is too risky for surgery due to her damaged heart. In the absence of definitive treatment options, the focus may shift to symptom management and palliative care to ensure her comfort and improve her quality of life.\n\nTo gain a better understanding, I would encourage you to speak with her healthcare team, specifically her cardiologist or heart failure specialist, to get the most accurate and up-to-date information. They will have a clearer picture of her overall health and can provide the best guidance regarding her individual prognosis and potential treatment options. It is essential to have an honest discussion about her expectations, wishes, and goals, so they can create a comprehensive care plan tailored to her unique circumstances."}

This can cause cough, sneezing, runny nose, rash, itching eyes.I hope this helps", "ai": " A damp and mouldy environment can have several negative impacts on health, particularly for individuals with pre-existing health conditions. Here are some potential effects:\n\n1. Respiratory health: Exposure to dampness and mould can trigger or worsen respiratory symptoms, including coughing, wheezing, and shortness of breath. This is especially true for people with asthma or allergies. In your case, your persistent cough could be linked to the damp environment, although it's important to note that other causes should also be considered.\n\n2. Skin conditions: Mould can produce allergens and irritants that can aggravate skin conditions like eczema. Exposure to mould can cause skin irritation, redness, and itching, which can exacerbate existing eczema symptoms.\n\n3. Allergies and sensitivities: Mould can produce allergens that can cause allergic reactions, including nasal congestion, sneezing, and eye irritation. Additionally, repeated exposure to mould can lead to sensitivities or even sensitization to new allergens.\n\n4. Immune system: Mould exposure can weaken the immune system, making it harder for the body to fight off infections. This can lead to increased susceptibility to various illnesses, making it more difficult for individuals to recoverfrom them.\n\n5. Neurological symptoms: Some types of mould can produce mycotoxins, which can affect the nervous system and lead to various neurological symptoms, such as headaches, dizziness, memory loss, and difficulty concentrating.\n\nIt's important to note that a damp and mouldy environment doesn't necessarily mean that you or your family members will develop these conditions. However, if you suspect that your home might be contributing to your health problems, it would be a good idea to address the dampness issue as soon as possible.\n\nYou can take several steps to reduce dampness and prevent mould growth in your home, such as:\n\n- Improving ventilation by opening windows and using extractor fans\n- Using a dehumidifier to reduce humidity levels\n- Fixing any leaks or water damage promptly\n- Cleaning mouldy clothes and storing them properly\n- Maintaining adequate ventilation in bathrooms and kitchens\n- Ensuring proper insulation and ventilation in attics and crawlspaces.\n\nIf you continue to experience health issues despite making these changes, it would be a good idea to consult a healthcare professional to rule out other potential causes."}

Regards,Dr. Shinas Hussain,General & Family Physician", "ai": " I'm not a doctor, but I can suggest some general steps you can take to help reduce swelling and alleviate pain in your injured finger. Remember, these are only recommendations, and if your condition worsens or does not improve within a few days, it's important to consult a healthcare professional.\n\n1. Rest your finger: Try to keep your finger as still as possible to give it a chance to heal. Avoid using it for heavy lifting or other strenuous activities.\n\n2. Apply cold therapy: Although you mentioned that applying ice directly to the injured finger causes unbearable pain, you can try using a cloth or a cooling gel pack to apply cold compresses to the area. Cold therapy can help reduce swelling, inflammation, and pain. Do this for 10-15 minutes at a time, with a break of 15 minutes in between, a few times a day.\n\n3. Elevate your finger: When you're sitting or lying down, try to keep your hand raised above heart level whenever possible. This can help minimize swelling and make it easier for blood to flow to the injured area.\n\n4. Wear a protective splint or bandage: You can purchase a protective splint or bandage for your finger at a drugstore or pharmacy. These will help keep the finger stabilized and protect it from further injury. Be sure not to make the bandage too tight, as this can restrict blood flow and worsen swelling.\n\n5. Stay hydrated: Drink plenty of water to help your body flush out toxins and reduce inflammation. Adequate hydration can also help keep your blood vessels dilated, promoting good blood flow and quicker healing.\n\n6. Over-the-counter pain medication: If the pain is still unbearable, you can take over-the-counter pain medication as directed to help alleviate the discomfort. Be sure to consult with your doctor before taking any medication.\n\nRemember, if you're unsure about the severity of your injury or if your symptoms persist for more than a few days, it's important to seek advice from a healthcare professional."}

However many times it is seen that a person bites unknowingly over an area that is probably a lump due to an evolving tumor. If you have a habit of biting your cheek from a long time then there in no concern.Getting a biopsy might help to give you peace of mind and confirm it to be a benign lesion. White patches in the cheeks might be observed for sometime but if you have decided to get a biopsy done then that is better for you. However, biting cheek does not cause cancer. Please do not worry.", "ai": " There is no scientific evidence to suggest that biting the cheek can cause cancer directly. The white growth you have described is most likely a benign lesion, such as a traumatic fibroma or a mucocele, which are common conditions caused by trauma or biting the cheek. However, it's important to have the growth biopsied as your periodontist suggested to rule out any other possibilities, including malignant conditions. If the biopsy comes back as benign, you may be able to prevent similar growths in the future by avoiding habitual cheek biting."}

If taken as directed by your healthcare provider, it should not prevent a possible pregnancy that occurred before taking the medication. The timing of your last menstrual period and ovulation are important factors in determining the possibility of pregnancy.\n\nBased on the information you provided, your last intercourse was on November 17, and you had your period on November 20. You then started taking Duphaston on January 8 and continued until February 17. If ovulation occurred during this medication cycle, it would have been around January 25-27, according to the typical 14-day follicular phase following the start of the medication.\n\nThe existence of a faint positive result on a home pregnancy test on March 2, as well as your irregular menstrual cycle, suggests that there is a possibility you might be pregnant. However, it's important to note that this test could also yield a false positive. To confirm your suspicions, it's advisable for you to undergo a blood test to verify the pregnancy result.\n\nAs for the likelihood of your next period, it's difficult to predict an exact date without more information. Since you have an irregular menstrual cycle, normal menstruation may take anywhere from 21 to 35 days after the end of your last period. Keep in mind that if you are indeed pregnant, your next menstrual period will not occur since pregnancy replaces menstruation. In that case, you should wait until after your scheduled ultrasound or follow-up appointment with your healthcare provider to discuss the next steps."}

{"question": "Can stress cause erectile issues?Recently my boyfriend and I were having sex and he suddenly got soft in the middle of it. He has been stressed out about money and not sleeping very much so I thought it was that, but I can't help thinking he isn't interested. Can stress cause erectile issues?", "human": "Hello and welcome to ‘Ask A Doctor’ service.  I have reviewed your query and here is my advice. Sex is largely what happens between two ears and two minds and not that happens between two legs. There are many possible reasons leading to erectile dysfunction and commonest is stress or performance anxiety. An occasional episode of erectile failure due to situational reasons like fatigue, tension or own ''pressure to 'perform' rather to enjoy'' is very common. This diminishes arousal level and hence erection too. This seems more likely with your partner. Both of you can go for counseling with sex therapist if this happens repeatedly.Hope I have answered your query. Let me know if I can assist you further.Regards,Dr. Chintan Raval", "ai": " Yes, stress can cause erectile issues. Stress, both mental and physical, can interfere with the body's ability to achieve and maintain an erection. This is because stress can cause the body to produce certain hormones and chemicals that constrict blood vessels, making it more difficult for blood to flow to the penis. Chronic stress can also lead to other health issues, such as high blood pressure and diabetes, which can also contribute to erectile dysfunction. If your boyfriend has been experiencing stress related to money or lack of sleep, it's possible that this is the cause of his erectile issues. It may be helpful for him to find ways to manage his stress, such as through exercise, meditation, or therapy. If the issue persists, it may be a good idea for him to speak with a healthcare provider to rule out any underlying medical conditions."}

However, it's important to speak with your healthcare provider for an accurate diagnosis and treatment plan.\n\nRegarding your high and fluctuating blood pressure, there could be several reasons for this. Some common causes include stress, anxiety, dehydration, lack of regular physical activity, and certain medications or medical conditions. Fluctuations in blood pressure can also be normal from day to day. If you're taking a new blood pressure medication and it's not working as expected, it's crucial to speak with your doctor about adjusting your dosage or trying a different medication.\n\nThe chest pain and gas could be unrelated to your high blood pressure. Chest pain can have various causes, including cardiac issues, gastrointestinal problems, or musculoskeletal issues. If you have persistent chest pain, it's important to speak with your doctor about it. The gas could be a side effect of your new blood pressure medication or due to other reasons, such as consuming foods that produce excess gas. Consider keeping a food diary to help identify any dietary triggers. If the gas is severe or persistent, it's a good idea to speak with your doctor about it as well.\n\nAbout the pressure in your left armpit area, it's important to note that this symptom may not be related to your high blood pressure or gas. Pressure or discomfort in this area could be due to a variety of causes, including muscle strain or nerve compression.

Good luck.Hope i have answered your query.Any thing to ask do not hesitate. Thank you.", "ai": " I'd be happy to help you with your concern regarding the lumps under your skin. However, please keep in mind that I'm an AI language model and not a doctor, so I can't provide you with an accurate diagnosis or treatment plan. I can, however, provide you with some general information that might help.\n\nThe treatment for lumps under the skin depends on the cause, which can be various, such as cysts, lipomas, or benign tumors. I cannot diagnose you based on the information provided, but I can suggest that you make an appointment with a dermatologist or a general practitioner in Andheri, Mumbai, for an evaluation.\n\nDuring the consultation, the doctor will likely perform a physical examination and possibly order additional tests such as a biopsy if necessary. Based on the diagnosis, the treatment options may include:\n\n1. Excision: This is the most common treatment for removing lumps that are not cancerous. The doctor will make a small incision and remove the lump completely. The size and complexity of the procedure may influence the time it takes to heal, but generally, 1-2 weeks should be sufficient. The cost may vary from INR 5,000 to 20,000 or more, depending on the size, location, and complexity of the lump.\n\n2. Liposuction: In some cases, especially for larger fatty tumors, liposuction may be a more viable option. Liposuction involves making a small incision and using a thin tube called a cannula to remove the excess fatty tissue. It typically has a shorter recovery time, ranging from 3 to 10 days, and higher cost, typically starting from INR 30,000 or more.\n\n3. Drainage and aspiration: For cysts that contain fluid, the doctor may aspirate the fluid using a needle and syringe. This is a relatively simple procedure with a short recovery time, usually only a few days, and a lower cost, around INR 3,000-5,000.\n\n4. Radiation therapy or chemotherapy: If the lumps are malignant, further diagnostic testing will be required to determine the most effective treatment. These options generally have longer recovery times and higher costs, depending on the specific treatment plan.\n\nMake sure to talk to your doctor about the specific circumstances of your case during the consultation to get more accurate information and discuss any concerns you may have regarding treatment time, costs, and recovery."}
{"question": "Why do my 13 week old baby having white lumps in his poo?My 13 week old baby boy has white lumps in his poo and he has pooped 3 times today which is more than normal for him. I m worried as his 11 month old cousin has a gastric bug and I am afraid he may have picked it up. he is in good form and finishing his feeds although it is taking him over an hour to do so.", "human": "Hi....if the baby is active and voiding urine well and feeding well you need not worry about the whitish lumps in his poo. Unless the kid's having low urine output or very dull or excessively sleepy or blood in motion or green bilious vomiting...you need not worry. There is no need to use any medicines unless any of the above symptoms develop.Regards - Dr. Sumanth", "ai": " White lumps in a baby's poop, also known as curds or seedy stools, are usually normal and are caused by the undigested milk fat that is present in breastmilk or formula. This is especially common in exclusive breastfed babies or formula-fed babies who are consuming a higher fat content formula. These lumps are harmless and should not cause any concern, especially if your baby is acting normally and gaining weight appropriately.\n\nHowever, if your baby is showing signs of illness, such as vomiting, diarrhea, or a fever, it is important to contact your healthcare provider to rule out any potential infections or other health issues. In this case, since your baby's cousin has a gastric bug, it is worth discussing this with your healthcare provider to see if your baby may need to be evaluated for the same condition.\n\nIf you are breastfeeding, it may be helpful to try eliminating dairy from your diet for a few days to see if it makes a difference in your baby's stools. If you are formula-feeding, you may want to consider switching to a low-lactose or lactose-free formula to see if that makes a difference as well. However, it's important to speak with your healthcare provider before making any changes to your baby's nutrition.\n\nIn the meantime, you can encourage your baby to eat smaller, more frequent feedings instead of long feeding sessions to help reduce the amount of gas and discomfort they may be experiencing. Additionally, you can offer your baby gentle tummy massage or wind him after feeds to help relieve any gas bubble discomfort.\n\nOverall, it's important to keep a close eye on your baby's symptoms and follow up with your healthcare provider if you have any concerns. But in the absence of other symptoms, the white lumps in the stool are likely normal."}
{"question": "What could the angiogram results be after being on Warfarin?hi my dad is haveing a angiogram tomorow hes 63 and diabetic and he has bin takeing warfan tabs 4 a very long time now but hes off of them for the last four days count on haveing a angiogram tomorow,im really worried bout this angiogram will he be ok?its really worring me and my family even my da is worried", "human": "Hello Welcome to HCM You have not mentioned here why is he on warfarin. Warfarin is a blood thinner which is prescribed if a person has propensity to develop or has developed clots in the legs, in patients with irregular heart rate (AF) and in patients post valve replacement. I would be in a better position to help you had you provided the details.Coronary Angiogram is done to evaluate presence of blockages in the heart. On baisi of the findings of angiogram you may be suggested either medical management, or angioplasty or bypass surgery. Angioplasty can be done if there are short blockages on the arteries. It is a 1-3 HR procedure that can be done in the same sitting and the patient usually gets back on his legs on the next day. Bypass surgery is adviced when there are multiple widespread blockages involving the major arteries of the heart. Bypass surgery requires planning, patient preparation etc. Again it takes about 4 days to patient to be back on his legs and some 20 days to recover totally. But the long term results of bypass are very good. Since he is diabetic he has a tendency to develop heart blockages so be prepared for an angioplasty if suggested. I suppose I have answered your queries satisfactorily. Wishing him good health. Regards", "ai": " I'm an AI language model and I can't directly interpret your father's medical records or examine him. However, I can provide some general information about Warfarin and its potential impact on angiogram results.\n\nWarfarin is an anticoagulant medication, which is often prescribed to prevent blood clots from forming. The therapy works by inhibiting Vitamin K epoxide reductase, an enzyme that plays a role in the blood clotting process.\n\nThe effect of Warfarin on angiogram results mainly concerns the potential for increased bleeding, especially in arteries that are not being surgically treated or manipulated during the procedure. Warfarin may lead to excessive bleeding at the site of the arterial access, making it more difficult to achieve a good image for the angiogram. This could decrease the diagnostic quality of the results.\n\nThe duration of Warfarin intake and the time elapsed since discontinuation before the angiogram are crucial factors. Generally, a sufficient \"off-therapy\" period is required for Warfarin to be out of the system and minimize potential complications related to bleeding during the procedure. The American College of Cardiology (ACC) guidelines recommend waiting at least 4 to 5 half-lives of Warfarin before undergoing invasive procedures. Since Warfarin has a half-life of approximately 36 to 42 hours, this could mean at least 2 to 3 days for most people.\n\nIn your father's case, he has been off Warfarin for 4 days, which falls within the suggested off-therapy period for an angiogram. Despite this, it's still a good idea for his healthcare team to consider his individual medical history and risks when making decisions about his angiogram. It is essential to discuss any concerns or uncertainty with his doctors before the procedure. If you have any specific questions or need further clarification, I encourage you to contact his healthcare team or consult relevant medical resources."}
{"question": "Suggest remedy for cough with pain in chest and dark stoolsHello. My boyfriend has been experiencing a cough for close to two months. There was a time when it got better.

There is no fever.", "human": "Hello dear, thanks for your question on HCM. I can understand your boyfriend's situation and problem. He is having chronic cough with chest pain. So we need to rule out lung infection ( pneumonia ) first. Pneumonia can cause pleurisy ( inflammation of pleura ) and chest pain with coughing is characteristic feature of pleurisy. And pneumonia is the most common cause for pleurisy. So get done chest x ray first to rule pneumonia. Also get done stool microscopic examination to rule out blood in stool because he is having dark stool.So consult pulmonologist and discuss all these. First diagnose himself and then start appropriate treatment. He may need antibiotic drugs.", "ai": " I'm an AI language model and not a doctor, but based on the information you've provided, it seems like your boyfriend's symptoms could be related to a gastrointestinal issue, such as gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD), gastritis, or even gastrointestinal bleeding. The chest pain and dark stools could be signs of this.\n\nHere are some suggestions, but they are not a substitute for medical advice. I would highly recommend that your boyfriend see a doctor as soon as possible to get a proper diagnosis and treatment plan. In the meantime, here are some things that may help improve his symptoms:\n\n1. Avoid irritating foods: Some foods can irritate the esophagus and stomach, making symptoms worse. These include spicy foods, fatty foods, citrus fruits, chocolate, tomatoes, caffeine, and alcohol. Your boyfriend might find relief by avoiding these foods.\n2. Elevate the head of his bed: Elevating the head of the bed can help reduce the pressure in the esophagus, making it easier for the stomach acid to stay there.\n3. Don't lie down after meals: Waiting at least three hours after eating before lying down can help prevent stomach acid from flowing back into the esophagus.\n4. Antacids: Over-the-counter antacids can help neutralize stomach acid and provide relief from symptoms.\n5. Proton pump inhibitors (PPIs): These prescription medications can help reduce stomach acid production and promote healing of the esophagus and stomach lining.\n6. Fiber-rich diet: A high-fiber diet can help absorb stomach acid and prevent further irritation of the esophagus.\n7. Quit smoking: Smoking can irritate the esophagus and make symptoms worse, so if your boyfriend smokes, encourage him to quit.\n8. Avoid caffeine and alcohol: Both caffeine and alcohol can irritate the esophagus and worsen symptoms.\n9. Hydrate: Drinking plenty of fluids can help prevent dehydration caused by diarrhea and vomiting and keep the stool soft.\n10. Rest: Rest is essential for the body to heal. Encourage your boyfriend to take it easy and avoid strenuous activities.\n\nAgain, these suggestions are not a substitute for medical advice. It's important that your boyfriend consults a healthcare professional to rule out any serious medical conditions."}

Thank you for your contact to health care magic.Wish you a best health.Thank you,Dr Arun Tank.", "ai": " Recurring chills can be caused by a variety of conditions, some of which are listed below. However, it is important to note that I am an AI language model and I cannot provide a definitive diagnosis based on your symptoms. I can only provide you with some possible causes, and it is essential that you consult your healthcare provider for an accurate diagnosis and treatment.\n\n1. Infection: Chills can be a sign of an infection. This could be a bacterial, viral, or fungal infection somewhere in your body. Your post-nasal drip and persistent cough, in addition to your jockey itch that hasn't responded to medication, could be indicative of an ongoing infection.\n\n2. Low body temperature: Chills can also occur when your body temperature drops. This might be due to exposure to cold weather or surroundings, but can also be caused by other medical conditions such as hypothyroidism, anorexia, or malnutrition.\n\n3. Kidney disease: Your low GFR (glomerular filtration rate) suggests that you might have kidney damage or disease, which could potentially cause recurring chills. In kidney disease, the kidneys may not be able to filter out waste and toxins efficiently, leading to a range of symptoms like chills, fever, and fatigue.\n\n4. Anemia: Chills can also be a symptom of anemia, which can result from a variety of causes, including conditions like sickle cell disease, vitamin B12 deficiency, and iron deficiency. This could potentially explain your symptoms, especially if you are experiencing fatigue and weakness, in addition to the chills and cough.\n\n5. Autoimmune conditions: In some cases, recurring chills can be an indication of an autoimmune condition, such as lupus or rheumatoid arthritis. These conditions can cause your immune system to attack your body's own tissues, leading to a range of symptoms including chills, fever, fatigue, and joint pain.\n\nIt's important that you consult your healthcare provider for a proper diagnosis and treatment plan, as the underlying cause of your recurring chills may differ from what's listed above. Your healthcare provider can order additional tests, as required, to help determine the root cause of your symptoms and develop an appropriate course of treatment."}

However, I can suggest some possible causes for your symptoms based on the information provided.\n\nYour symptoms of dizziness, blurred vision, and numbness in the hands, feet, and face after having chocolate or a fizzy drink, along with being on an antidepressant, may be related to several conditions:\n\n1. Antidepressant side effects: Some antidepressants, especially SSRI (selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors) and SNRI (serotonin-norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors) medications, can cause side effects like dizziness, blurred vision, and peripheral numbness. These symptoms may be more pronounced when you have certain triggers like chocolate or carbonated beverages.\n\n2.

If you have a history of these conditions, your symptoms could be a result of an attack. Dizziness and blurry vision are common symptoms of both migraines and cluster headaches.\n\n3. Hypoglycemia (low blood sugar): Chocolate and sugary fizzy drinks can cause rapid blood sugar spikes followed by a crash. If your diabetes is not well-controlled, this can result in dizziness, blurry vision, and numbness in the hands, feet, and face.\n\n4. Dehydration: Consuming caffeine and sugar in chocolate and fizzy drinks can lead to dehydration, especially if you don't drink enough water.

Let me know if I can assist you further.Regards,Dr. Narendra Maurya", "ai": " It is normal for young children to make various sounds while they play and move around. The \"crunching\" sound you heard when your son's back arched could be due to the compression of the vertebrae in his spine as he archned backward. This is not necessarily a cause for concern as long as your son shows no signs of pain, discomfort, or difficulty moving. However, if you notice any persistent or worsening symptoms, such as tremors, loss of mobility, or crying, it would be best to consult a healthcare professional to rule out any potential injuries or medical conditions. In general, the healthy development of a child's spine is influenced by various factors such as genetics, lifestyle, and environment. Regular physical activity, a balanced diet, and a healthy weight are all important for promoting optimal spinal development in children. Encouraging your son to engage in activities that promote healthy growth and development, such as tummy time, crawling, and safe play, is a good way to support his overall health and well-being."}

However, I can provide some general information that might help alleviate your concerns.\n\nA whitehead on the penis can indeed resemble a pimple, which is a type of skin lesion known as a comedo. Comedones are caused by the blockage of the follicular pores with dead skin cells, oil, and bacteria. They can occur anywhere on the body, including the genital area.\n\nThe presence of a whitehead on the penis does not necessarily indicate an STD or a serious condition. However, it is essential to practice good hygiene and keep the area clean to prevent the growth of bacteria and other microorganisms.\n\nIf the whitehead is causing discomfort, bleeding, or is persistent, it is recommended to follow up with your healthcare provider for further evaluation. In some cases, it could be a sign of an underlying condition such as hidradenitis suppurativa or an infection. Only a healthcare professional can provide you with an accurate diagnosis and appropriate treatment options.\n\nIt is essential to remember that STDs, including HIV, are transmitted through bodily fluids, not through skin-to-skin contact or casual touch. If you are concerned about your STD status, you should consider getting tested for peace of mind. If you have any other symptoms such as discharge, itching, pain, or a burning sensation while urinating, it is crucial to consult your healthcare provider as soon as possible.\n\nIn summary, having a whitehead on the penis is not unusual, and it is likely that it is just a pimple.

However, I can suggest some possible conditions that might fit your father's symptoms, but it is crucial to consult a healthcare professional for an accurate diagnosis and appropriate treatment.\n\nGiven your father's symptoms of swelling due to fluid retention, red, itchy, and scaly skin, and a high white blood cell count, some conditions that could be considered include:\n\n1. Lymphedema - a condition where lymph fluid accumulates in the body due to impaired lymphatic drainage. It can cause swelling, particularly in the legs, but it can affect other parts of the body as well. It may also be associated with redness, itching, and scaling of the skin.\n2. Inflammatory conditions - such as rheumatoid arthritis, psoriasis, or dermatitis, can cause red, itchy, and scaly skin, as well as fluid retention.\n3. Liver or kidney dysfunction - both conditions can lead to fluid accumulation in the body, and they might also present with skin changes or a high white blood cell count.\n4. Cancer - a high white blood cell count can be a sign of cancer, and it is mentioned that your father needs to go to the cancer center. However, it is essential to note that many other conditions can also cause a high white blood cell count.\n5. Infections - bacterial, viral, or fungal infections can cause symptoms like swelling, itchy, red, and scaly skin, and a high white blood cell count.\n\nAgain, it is essential to consult with a healthcare professional for a proper diagnosis and treatment. These suggestions are not exhaustive, and other conditions can also present with similar symptoms."}
{"question": "Q. Can a NAFLD patient consume cashew and groundnut?Hello doctor,My mom is suffering from NAFLD. Is she supposed to avoid both saturated fats and unsaturated fats? Can she eat nuts like cashew and groundnut?", "human": "Hello. Dear, she may take unsaturated fats like omega-3 fatty acids or fish oils or cod liver oil, etc. Avoid spicy food and saturated fats. Vitamin E and Vitamin C are useful to reduce fat in the liver. Use tablet Pantoprazole before breakfast for one week in case of acidity or indigestion which is more common in fatty liver disease. Regular exercise, weight reduction may be useful. Please consult your physician for a follow-up scan and blood tests. Take care.", "ai": " I'm an AI language model and not a doctor, but I can try to provide you with accurate and up-to-date information based on available medical resources. NAFLD, or Non-Alcoholic Fatty Liver Disease, is a condition characterized by the accumulation of fat in the liver cells of people who drink little or no alcohol.\n\nRegarding your question, NAFLD patients should focus on a healthy and balanced diet to support liver function. While it's true that NAFLD is associated with an accumulation of lipids in the liver, the primary dietary factors contributing to NAFLD progression are believed to be excessive caloric intake, unhealthy dietary patterns, and obesity.\n\nSaturated and trans fats have been linked to an increased risk of developing NAFLD and worsening liver damage. Unsaturated fats, particularly monounsaturated and polyunsaturated fats, have been shown to have a protective effect and may even help improve liver function. Nuts, like cashews and groundnuts, are rich sources of unsaturated fats, fiber, and various micronutrients.\n\nModerate consumption of nuts may be beneficial for NAFLD patients. However, it's essential to keep portion sizes in check, as nuts are also high in calories. Aim for a serving of 1 ounce (28 grams) per day. Roasted or raw, with or without added salt, are both acceptable options, as long as you control the total caloric intake.\n\nAlways consult a healthcare professional or a registered dietitian for personalized advice, as dietary recommendations can vary depending on the individual's overall health condition and medical history."}

I to my patient with with such infection, prescribe, iron preparations, fluconazole, cifixime, etc, for complete recovery. Thank you.", "ai": " There are several reasons why your period may be delayed after taking emergency contraception and starting a new birth control method. Here are some possible explanations, but please keep in mind that I'm an AI language model and not a doctor, so this information is for educational purposes only, and you should consult your healthcare provider for professional medical advice.\n\n1. Hormonal changes: Both emergency contraception and birth control methods work by altering the hormonal balance in your body to prevent pregnancy. Hormonal shifts can sometimes cause irregular periods. In your case, the combination of taking emergency contraception and starting a new birth control method might be causing the delayed period.\n\n2. Stress: Stress can also affect your menstrual cycle and cause period delays. The stress of a possible pregnancy, taking numerous pregnancy tests, and waiting for the results might have caused additional stress, further delaying your period.\n\n3. Birth control method: It's important to note that some birth control methods might cause irregular periods in the first few months of use. For example, some women experience spotting and irregular periods when starting the combined oral contraceptive pill.\n\n4. Other factors: Other factors that could cause a delayed period include illness, changes in weight, exercise, and travel. It's essential to consider all potential influences that could contribute to the current situation and seek professional medical advice if you're concerned.\n\nSince you have taken multiple pregnancy tests and they have all been negative, it is less likely that you are pregnant. However, if you experience any unusual symptoms, such as heavy bleeding, severe abdominal pain, or chest pain, or if you're concerned about your menstrual cycle, it's important to contact your healthcare provider for further evaluation.\n\nIn conclusion, a delayed period after unprotected sex, taking emergency contraception, and starting a new birth control method is common and usually not a cause for concern. However, if you feel uneasy or have any concerns, consult your healthcare provider for additional guidance and reassurance."}

This can occur due to an infection, such as a viral or bacterial infection in the ear or elsewhere in the body. Treatment may include over-the-counter pain relievers, such as ibuprofen or acetaminophen, to help reduce inflammation and discomfort. In some cases, antimicrobial medication may be prescribed if an infection is detected.\n2.

This surgery is used to remove large blood clots from the lungs or the area around the heart.\n\nThis is indeed a serious surgical procedure with potential risks, but the extent and likelihood of these risks can depend on various factors, including the size and location of the clots, the overall health condition of your husband, and any underlying medical conditions he may have. Some potential risks of thoracotomy include:\n\n1. Bleeding: Any surgery carries the risk of excessive bleeding, and the risks can be increased in patients with certain medical conditions or who are taking certain medications.\n2. Infection: There is a risk of developing an infection after the surgery, especially in the wound site.\n3. Heart and lung complications: Thoracotomy involves opening the chest, which can impact heart and lung function. The risks include irregular heartbeats (arrhythmias), heart failure, and lung collapse.\n4. Blood clots: There is a risk of developing new blood clots during and after the surgery.\n5. Anesthesia risks: Like any surgical procedure, there's a risk associated with anesthesia, including allergic reactions and complications related to breathing or heart function during and after the anesthesia.\n\nHowever, it's important to remember that the risks of not having the surgery can be even greater, considering your husband's deteriorating health condition. The decision to undergo such a high-risk procedure should be made in consultation with his healthcare team, who can assess his individual situation and provide the most accurate information on the risks and benefits.\n\nYour husband's age (46) is relatively young, but the presence and severity of blood clots in his lungs and around his heart, along with his overall health condition, play a crucial role in the assessment of the risk associated with the surgery. Make sure to discuss any concerns you might have with the healthcare team. They'll be able to provide additional information and help answer any specific questions you may have."}

It's important to consult with your healthcare provider before making a decision about running with back pain. Here are some things to take into account:\n\n1. Severity and frequency of the pain: If the back pain is severe or frequent, it may be best to avoid running and give your body time to heal. Running with pain could potentially worsen the injury and hinder your recovery.\n2. Type and cause of the pain: The location and cause of the pain can influence your decision to run.

I can, however, provide some general information about the medications you mentioned.\n\nThe medications you've been prescribed - Ovacare tablets (clomiphene citrate), Ovaa shield (estrogen tablets), and Follertin Forte (follicular stimulating hormone and luteinizing hormone) - are commonly used to help women who have difficulty conceiving due to ovulatory disorders. Clomiphene citrate stimulates ovulation by causing the pituitary gland to release more FSH and LH, leading to the maturation of a follicle and the release of an egg. Oestrogen tablets, like Ovaa shield, are used to thicken the lining of the uterus to prepare it for implantation.\n\nThese medications can be effective in helping women conceive, but they do not guarantee a normal or successful pregnancy. Factors such as the cause of the ovulatory disorder, the quality of the sperm, and any underlying health conditions can all impact the likelihood of a successful conception.\n\nIt's also important to know that taking fertility medications can carry potential risks, including multiple pregnancies (twins or even triplets), ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome (OHSS), and birth defects if taken in early pregnancy. Your doctor should discuss these risks with you and monitor you closely while you are taking these medications.\n\nIt's important to follow your doctor's recommendations and to continue trying to conceive after finishing your treatment course, even if you don't get pregnant right away. If you have concerns or if you're not getting pregnant despite trying for a year or longer, speak to your doctor about other options, such as infertility testing or in vitro fertilization (IVF)."}

The sudden onset of sharp pain in the lower right abdomen could be a sign of several conditions, some more serious than others. Here are a few possibilities:\n\n1. Appendicitis: This is a common condition that can cause sudden, sharp pain in the lower right abdomen. Appendicitis occurs when the appendix, a small organ that extends from the large intestine, becomes inflamed and swells. The pain may start as a feeling of discomfort or cramping in the abdomen, which can then develop into sharp, localized pain in the lower right quadrant. Other symptoms may include loss of appetite, nausea, vomiting, constipation or diarrhea, fever, and a feeling of being unwell. Appendicitis requires prompt medical attention as it can lead to complications if left untreated.\n2. Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD): IBD, including Crohn’s disease and ulcerative colitis, can cause abdominal pain. The pain may be sharp, crampy, or aching, and it can occur in different areas of the abdomen, including the lower right quadrant. Other symptoms of IBD include diarrhea, constipation, blood or mucus in the stool, weight loss, fever, and loss of appetite.\n3. Gastroenteritis: Also known as the stomach flu, gastroenteritis can cause sharp abdominal pain, especially in the lower right quadrant. Other symptoms may include nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, fever, chills, and muscle aches.\n4. Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS): IBS is a common functional gastrointestinal disorder that can cause abdominal pain, including sharp pain in the lower right quadrant. Other symptoms may include bloating, gas, constipation, or diarrhea.\n5. Kidney stones: Kidney stones can cause sharp pain in the lower right abdomen, especially when they move from the kidney to the ureter or pass into the urinary bladder. Other symptoms may include nausea, vomiting, and the frequent need to urinate.\n\nIf you are experiencing sharp pain in your lower right abdomen, it is important to seek medical attention to determine the cause of the pain. Do not assume that it is a minor condition, as some conditions, such as appendicitis, can be life-threatening if left untreated. If your symptoms are severe or persistent, contact your healthcare provider or go to the emergency room for evaluation. In the meantime, try to rest comfortably, avoid moving around too much, and avoid heavy meals or drinks that may worsen your symptoms."}

The exact cause of the infection can vary from case to case. Some possible risk factors include:\n\n* Pre-existing bacteria in the surgical site\n* Poor surgical technique\n* Use of contaminated surgical equipment\n* Implant placement (in the case of a breast lift with an implant)\n* Failure to follow proper wound care instructions\n\nInfections after surgical procedures can be treated with antibiotics and drainage of pus from the affected area. The length of time it takes for healing to occur and for a period to resume after surgery can also vary from person to person. Delayed menstruation is a common side effect of major surgeries, particularly those that involve the abdomen and pelvis. It is not necessarily a cause for concern unless it persists for several months. If you have any concerns about your recovery or healing process, it would be best to speak with your surgeon or primary care provider."}

Let me know if I can assist you further.Regards,Dr. Manish Variya", "ai": " I'm not a doctor, but I can try to help you understand some possible causes for your recurring cough with a sensation of smoke while breathing based on the information you've provided. However, you should consult your healthcare professional for an accurate diagnosis and treatment.\n\n1. Post-infectious cough: This is a common condition where a persistent cough persists long after the initial infection has cleared up. While the cause is not well understood, it may be due to inflammation or damage to the airways and bronchial tubes.\n2. Asthma or Reactive Airways Dysfunction Syndrome (RADS): Asthma is a chronic condition that causes inflammation and narrowing of the airways. RADS is similar to asthma but is triggered by respiratory infections. Symptoms of asthma or RADS include coughing, wheezing, and shortness of breath, which can be worsened by environmental factors like smoke.\n3. Gastroesophageal Reflux Disease (GERD): This condition causes stomach acid to flow back into the esophagus, causing irritation and coughing. Some people describe the sensation as \"smoke in the throat.\"\n4. Chronic Bronchitis: This is a condition characterized by a persistent cough and mucus production. The cough can be aggravated by environmental factors like smoke.\n5. Occupational or environmental exposure: Prolonged exposure to smoke or other respiratory irritants can cause chronic coughing and other symptoms.\n\nAgain, these are just some possible causes, and I cannot diagnose you based on this information. It's important to talk to your healthcare professional about your symptoms so they can help determine the cause and the best course of treatment. In the meantime, avoiding environmental irritants like smoke can help alleviate your symptoms."}

These symptoms you described could be related to several conditions, including:\n\n1. Muscle Spasms or Tics: It's not uncommon for infants to experience muscle spasms or tics, especially after an illness or infection. This is usually harmless and usually resolves on its own.\n2. Neck or Shoulder Injury: However, it's important to rule out any possible injury, such as a fall or traumatic event that could have caused neck or shoulder stiffness.\n3. Gastroesophageal Reflux (GER): GER, also known as acid reflux, can cause discomfort and pain in the neck, shoulder, and chest area. This discomfort can cause an infant to tense up or arch their back and neck to try and relieve the pressure.\n4. Constipation: Infants who are constipated may experience abdominal pain and discomfort, which can lead to tension in the neck and shoulders as they try to relieve the pressure.\n5. Ear Infection: Although your baby has just recovered from an ear infection, it could still be contributing to their neck and shoulder stiffness. Ear infections can cause discomfort and pain in the ears, which can lead to tension in the surrounding muscles.\n\nIt's essential to consult with your child's pediatrician if you have concerns about their neck and shoulder stiffness, especially if it persists for an extended period or if you notice any other symptoms. Your doctor can examine your baby and provide a proper diagnosis and treatment plan."}

However, it is important to note that I cannot provide a definitive diagnosis, and you should consult your healthcare professional for an accurate evaluation.\n\nHypertension, or high blood pressure, itself does not directly cause arm pain. However, there are several conditions that can occur alongside hypertension and may contribute to arm pain. Here are some possibilities based on your medical history:\n\n1. Peripheral artery disease (PAD): PAD is a condition affecting the blood vessels in the extremities, including the arms. It can cause pain, usually described as cramping, in the muscles of the arms or legs during physical activity due to decreased blood flow due to narrowed or blocked blood vessels.\n2. Thoracic outlet syndrome: This condition can cause pain, tingling, or numbness in the hand, arm, or upper back. It occurs when the blood vessels or nerves in the thoracic outlet (the area between the collarbone and the first rib) become compressed.\n3. Angina: Though not directly related to arm pain, angina is a condition caused by reduced blood flow to the heart, which can cause chest pain. However, it's crucial to note that arm pain can be a possible angina symptom, particularly in women.\n\nGiven your medical history, it is essential to discuss these symptoms with your healthcare professional. They may perform additional tests to determine the underlying cause of your arm pain and provide appropriate treatment or further evaluation if necessary.

{"question": "Q. Is it too risky to take birth control pills for acne?Hello doctor,I am a 17 year old female. I am currently taking the birth control pill Dianette for my moderate acne. I am only on day five but, have read many worrying effects about this pill such as blood clots, excessive weight gain, and cancer risk. I was wondering if these health claims are all true and whether it is worth taking the pill for acne or if I should be asking my GP for something else.", "human": "Hello. I went through your post. So, relax and you need not worry. Regards. For more information consult an internal medicine physician online --> https://www.icliniq.com/ask-a-doctor-online/internal-medicine-physician", "ai": " I'm an AI language model and not a doctor, but I can provide some information on this topic based on available research and medical expertise. I recommend consulting a healthcare professional for personalized medical advice.\n\nThe relationship between birth control pills (BCPs), including Dianette, and acne is well-established. For some women, oral contraceptives can significantly reduce acne due to their hormonal effects on sebaceous glands and the production of androgens. Dianette contains both estrogen and spironolactone, which can be particularly effective for women with hormonal acne.\n\nHowever, like all medications, BCPs can come with side effects. Some common side effects of the pill in general include headaches, nausea, bloating, and mood changes. Regarding your specific concerns, the following facts will help clarify the situation:\n\n1. Blood clots: The risk of thromboembolism (blood clots) is higher for users of combined oral contraceptives (COCs) containing both estrogen and progesterone, especially those who smoke or have other risk factors. Dianette, however, is a progestin-only pill (POP), which usually carries a lower risk of blood clots.\n\n2. Weight gain: While some women may experience weight gain while taking the pill, this is not a guaranteed side effect for everyone. Factors like your individual metabolism, nutritional intake, and level of physical activity can impact weight changes significantly.\n\n3. Cancer risk: The majority of scientific studies suggest that the use of oral contraceptives does not increase the risk of developing breast or ovarian cancer. If anything, long-term use of the pill could potentially have a protective effect against ovarian cancer.\n\nIn conclusion, the decision to take Dianette (or any other medication) for acne or birth control should be made in conjunction with your GP or healthcare professional. Discuss your concerns openly with them, and they can help you weigh the benefits and risks based on your personal medical history and current requirements. Remember that every person responds differently to medications, so what might not be the best option for one person may work well for another. It's also essential to continue practicing good daily skincare habits in conjunction with any medication to maximize acne treatment success."}

Sincerely, Dr Shiva Kumar RConsultant Neurologist & EpileptologistBangalore", "ai": " Based on the information provided, it is unlikely that I can definitively diagnose your nicce's condition from this description alone. However, the symptoms she is experiencing are consistent with a stroke, which can cause paralysis, difficulty speaking, and walking issues on one side of the body. A stroke occurs when there is a disruption in the blood supply to a part of the brain, leading to brain cells dying.\n\nThe sudden onset of these symptoms within a week suggests that there may have been a specific cause, such as a clot or bleeding in the brain. This could be due to various reasons, including an underlying health condition, injury, or genetic predisposition. Further testing, such as an MRI or angiogram, may be necessary to confirm the diagnosis and identify the exact cause.\n\nAs for a cure, the focus of treatment for a stroke is typically on managing symptoms and preventing further damage to the brain. This may include medications to prevent blood clots from forming or dissolving existing clots, surgery to remove clots or repair damage to the blood vessels, physical therapy to help regain function, and speech therapy to improve communication skills. The outcome and prognosis vary greatly depending on the severity and location of the stroke, as well as the individual's age and overall health.\n\nGiven the seriousness of the situation, it is important for your nicce to receive appropriate medical attention and follow her healthcare provider's recommendations for treatment and recovery."}

If BP is maintained less than 140 and more than 100 it is quite safe to attempt surgery.", "ai": " It is important to note that I cannot provide definite answers to medical questions without consulting a healthcare professional. Regarding your question, yes, a DNS (disc herniation or discoid meningitis) surgery can be postponed if the patient has a low blood pressure (BP) level that raises concerns. The threshold for postponing the surgery due to low BP can vary depending on the specific circumstances of the patient and the judgement of the healthcare team.\n\nGenerally, a BP level below 90/60 mmHg is considered low. However, in the context of DNS surgery, the threshold may be lower due to potential complications such as increased risk of bleeding or anesthesia-related issues. The healthcare team, including anesthesiologists and neurosurgeons, will assess the patient's overall health, risks, and BP level to make an informed decision about postponing or proceeding with the surgery.\n\nIt is important for patients to communicate any concerns about their health, including low BP, with their healthcare providers before the scheduled procedure. The healthcare team may recommend additional tests or consultations to determine whether it is safe to proceed with the surgery at the current time or if it should be postponed to ensure the patient's safety and optimal outcomes."}

However, I can provide some alternative treatment options before considering a root canal (RCT):\n\n1. Fillings: If the cavity is not too deep and has not yet reached the pulp of the tooth, a filling may be sufficient.\n2. Fluoride treatment: Fluoride application can help strengthen the tooth and prevent further decay.\n3. Sealants: A sealant is a protective coating applied to the tooth to prevent decay. It's commonly used for children and in areas prone to decay.\n4. Natural remedies: Some natural remedies can help alleviate the pain and reduce inflammation, such as clove oil, turmeric, or garlic. However, these are temporary solutions and won't address the underlying cause.\n\nThat being said, if the cavity is severe, an RCT is usually the best long-term solution to save the tooth and relieve the pain.

Bring a calming object, such as a stress ball or a photo of a peaceful scene, to focus on during the appointment.\n3. Open Communication: Let the healthcare provider know about your anxiety and the issue with white coat hypertension. They may be able to offer reassurance, alternative testing methods, or medications to help manage the anxiety and improve the accuracy of your blood pressure readings.\n4. Medications: In some cases, antianxiety medications, such as beta-blockers or calcium channel blockers, may be prescribed to help reduce anxiety and relax the body, allowing for more accurate blood pressure readings.\n5. Alternative Testing Methods: Some clinics may offer alternative testing methods, such as ambulatory blood pressure monitoring (ABPM), which involves wearing a device that measures blood pressure throughout the day and night. This can provide more accurate readings and help determine if white coat hypertension is present.\n6. Lifestyle Changes: Making lifestyle changes, such as eating a healthy diet, getting regular physical activity, and managing stress, can help improve overall blood pressure and reduce the impact of anxiety on readings.\n\nIt's important to remember that white coat hypertension is a common condition, and there are ways to manage it. If you have concerns, speak to your healthcare provider for personalized advice and recommendations."}
{"question": "What are the symptoms of potential dengue?My husband is suffering from fever on and off, with muscle pains, mild diarrhea and a bad headache. Is it dengue ? Discovered some spots on his legs too. If i'm not wrong, there's no treatment for dengue, how would a dengue patient recover? And what are the signs that he is recovering?", "human": "Thank you for your query.Dengue is a viral disease that spreads through mosquito bites.Any Fever can be associated with muscles pain and headache and is non specific to diagnosis of DengueMost cases of dengue resolve on its own. In certain people, there may be complications such as bleeding, liver, kidney failure. They will need supportive treatment at the earliest to prevent worsening of the condition. ( most commonly there is an increased bleeding tendency that can be corrected by administering blood products if the values are too low)Dengue is confirmed by a high clinical suspicion and the detection of antibodies to the dengue virus ( Dengue IgM)Any fever that lasts for more than 3 days without showing signs of resolution and worsening of symptoms and overall condition shoud be evaluated throughly.See your doctor if his symptoms persist.Signs of recovery would be reducing temperatures, improvement in overall health. You mentioned spots on his legs. monitor them closely to see if they spread or increase in number. Let your doctor know.If he becomes drowsy, bruises easily, has bleeding anywhere includin gum bleeding while brushing teeth, small cuts that dont stop bleeding, visit the ER and have his blood work done to look for clotting factor deficiencies.Hope this helps. Wish you both good health.Please get back to us if you have further queries", "ai": " The symptoms you have described, such as fever, muscle and joint pain, headache, and mild diarrhea, can be common signs of dengue fever. However, it's important to note that these symptoms can also be present in other illnesses, so a proper diagnosis should be made by a healthcare professional. The appearance of rashes or spots on the skin, especially if they resemble a rash described as \"macular\" or \"flat,\" can also be a sign of dengue.\n\nDengue is a viral disease, and there is currently no specific treatment or antiviral medication available. Recovery from dengue depends on the individual's immune system and the severity of the illness. Most people with dengue will recover within a week to 10 days, while others may experience prolonged symptoms.\n\nSymptoms of dengue typically follow a specific pattern, which healthcare professionals refer to as the \"classic\" or \"typical\" dengue fever pattern. This pattern includes several phases:\n\n1. Abrupt onset of fever, headache, and muscle and joint pain\n2. Skin rash appears after the third day of fever\n3. Recovery begins, after a few days of continued fever\n4. Secondary symptoms such as abdominal pain, vomiting, and diarrhea may appear\n5. Gradual return to normal health and full recovery.\n\nDuring the recovery phase, a person with dengue may experience a feeling of weakness or fatigue, which can last for several weeks. It is essential to maintain hydration and provide supportive care, such as rest and pain management, during this time.\n\nTo help manage symptoms at home, you can provide the following:\n\n1. Plenty of fluids, especially water, to help maintain hydration.\n2. A cool environment to help manage fever and discomfort.\n3. Pain relievers such as acetaminophen or paracetamol, but avoid aspirin and nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), as they may increase the risk of bleeding.\n4. Adequate rest.\n5. Proper nutrition, as the appetite may be lost during illness.\n\nIt's essential to monitor for worsening symptoms, such as severe abdominal pain, persistent vomiting, severe headache, signs of dehydration, or altered consciousness. Seek medical attention immediately if these symptoms occur or if you suspect the illness is more severe.\n\nWhile at home, try to minimize exposure to mosquitoes to prevent further infection. This can help reduce the risk of spreading the disease to others.\n\nIn conclusion, a proper diagnosis by a healthcare professional is crucial before determining if someone is suffering from dengue fever. While there is no specific treatment for dengue, recovery can be supported through rest, hydration, pain management, and proper nutrition. Monitor for worsening symptoms and seek medical attention if needed."}

The presence of pus cells in semen, also known as pyospermia, can indicate a bacterial infection in the reproductive tract. This can potentially affect the quality of semen and may impact fertility. However, the number of pus cells detected doesn't necessarily dictate the severity of the infection. Your doctor's reassurance and decision not to prescribe medication suggests he believes the infection is not severe or that it's already resolving on its own.\n\nAs for pregnancy, it's important to note that a low count of pus cells in semen does not automatically rule out pregnancy. However, having a significant amount of pus cells in semen can potentially increase the risk of complications if pregnancy does occur. If you and your partner are trying to conceive, consider discussing this with your doctor for further guidance.\n\nRemember, if you have any concerns or questions, always consult your healthcare professional for accurate and personalized advice."}
{"question": "Suggest treatment for enursisI have a son who suffers with enursis. We have used the usual methods of the alarm and desmopressin.  It has been suggested to me to look at his diet and foods which he may be intolerant to.  Please could you offer some advice on this and am I able to get any food allergy tests carried out anywhere. Thankyou", "human": "Hi.... I have just gone through your query. There is no evidence in medical literature that enuresis is related to food allergy. Any specific food will not induce enuresis in an otherwise normal kid. I do not think for this reason you need to take up a food allergy panel testing. You are already on treatment for enuresis for which you can continue the same. I again reiterate the fact that enuresis is not related to food allergy.Regards - Dr. Sumanth", "ai": " I'm not a doctor, but I can provide you with some general information about food intolerances and allergy testing. Enuresis, or bedwetting, is typically not connected to food intolerances or allergies. However, some children may experience increased urine production due to certain foods or beverages, such as caffeine or large quantities of fluids close to bedtime.\n\nIf your son's enuresis has not responded well to traditional treatments like alarms and desmopressin, it might be worth investigating other possibilities. Before attempting any new treatments, it's essential to discuss your concerns with his healthcare provider. They may be able to suggest alternative approaches or rule out any underlying conditions that could be contributing to his bedwetting.\n\nRegarding food intolerances or allergies, it's essential to understand that they are different from enuresis. Food intolerances can cause symptoms like bloating, diarrhea, stomach pain, or excessive gas, but they do not typically result in bedwetting. Food allergies, on the other hand, can cause a range of symptoms including swelling, itching, hives, and anaphylaxis, which can be life-threatening in some cases.\n\nTo rule out food intolerances or allergies as a possible cause of your son's symptoms, you may consider the following steps:\n\n1. Keep a food diary: Record everything your son eats and drinks, as well as the times and frequency of his bedwetting episodes. You may notice patterns developing, such as a link between certain foods and increased bedwetting.\n\n2. Eliminate potential culprits: Try eliminating common food allergens, such as dairy, eggs, soy, and gluten, from your son's diet for a while to see if there's any improvement in his symptoms. You might find that one or more of these foods are contributing to his bedwetting or other symptoms.\n\n3. Reintroduce foods: After eliminating potential allergens, try reintroducing them one at a time to see if any cause a reaction. If your son experiences any symptoms, write them down, and consider consulting his healthcare provider for further guidance.\n\n4. Medical testing: If you still suspect food intolerances or allergies, your healthcare provider or a specialist may recommend various tests. Skin prick tests, blood tests, or elimination challenges are some common methods for diagnosing food allergies. For intolerances, a doctor may consider a series of tests like lactose intolerance tests, or other specific tests based on symptoms.\n\nIt is crucial to remember that food intolerances and allergies are not typically the primary cause of enuresis. If you have concerns, please consult your healthcare provider for the best course of action. They may suggest alternative methods for managing your son's enuresis, such as bladder training or medications."}
{"question": "What can cause foamy feces for a pneumonia patient?I'm looking after my partner who has progressive MS. He was admitted with pneumonia and urosepsis. He had  been taking cocktail of antibiotics. He was discharged 2weeks after. He wasn't completely clear of chest infection so he had more antibiotics at home for another ten days.

Antibiotics therapy for long period can be caused for the diarrhea and disturbance in the intestine. This antibiotics will wash out the normal flora of bacteria of the intestine. This is the reason why the diarrhea.Please do not discontinue the antibiotic therapy. Instead you can add the lactobacillus spore therapy. It will replenish the bacilli in the gut and can help reduce your diarrhea problems.Please eat curd, this will also help in reducing diarrhea incidence when your on the antibiotic therapy.I will be happy to answer your further concern on bit.ly/DrArun.Thank you,Dr Arun TankInfectious diseases specialist,HCM", "ai": " Foamy stools in a person who has recently had pneumonia and urosepsis could be attributed to a few possible causes. Here are some potential explanations:\n\n1. Antibiotic-associated diarrhea: Antibiotics can disrupt the normal balance of gut bacteria, leading to diarrhea. Some of the common antibiotics used to treat pneumonia and urinary tract infections can cause a condition called Clostridioides difficile (C. difficile) infection. C. difficile produces toxins that can cause watery diarrhea with foamy or mucus-like stools.\n2. Malabsorption: Malabsorption can result from various causes, including gastrointestinal disorders, metabolic diseases, and side effects of medications. Malabsorption can lead to foamy stools due to an increase in bile and fat excretion in the stool.\n3. Bile salts: An increase in bile salts in the stool can cause foamy stools. Bile salts are essential for the digestion and absorption of fats. However, an excessive amount of bile salts in the stool can lead to foamy stools, especially if there is a significant decrease in the amount of water and fat in the stool.\n4. Gastrointestinal infections: Gastrointestinal infections, including viral, bacterial, and parasitic infections, can cause foamy stools due to an increase in mucus production and bile excretion.\n5. Irritable bowel syndrome: Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) is a functional gastrointestinal disorder that can cause symptoms such as bloating, abdominal pain, and diarrhea with loose, foamy stools.\n\nIt's important to note that foamy stools can have various causes, and it's essential to consult a healthcare professional if you have concerns about your partner's symptoms. Their healthcare provider can evaluate their medical history, symptoms, and perform any necessary tests to determine the underlying cause of the foamy stools."}

These symptoms may be caused by various factors:\n\n1. Exposure to mold: Mold can produce allergens, irritants, and potentially toxic substances known as mycotoxins. Inhaling or coming into contact with these substances can cause respiratory symptoms, including coughing, sneezing, throat irritation, and headaches.\n2. Exposure to mouse allergens: Mice carry allergens in their dander, urine, and droppings. Exposure to these allergens can cause symptoms such as fever, aches, chills, and throat irritation.\n3. Exhaustion from physical labor: Demolishing a floor can be physically demanding work, especially when dealing with an old, mouse-infested floor. The physical exertion can lead to feelings of extreme tiredness and fatigue.\n4. Infection: In some cases, symptoms may be caused by a bacterial or viral infection, which can be exacerbated by the moldy and mouse-infested environment. Tamiflu and ampicillin are common treatments for influenza and bacterial infections, respectively, but other infections could also be responsible.\n\nIt's important to take precautions when working in a potentially moldy and infested environment, such as wearing protective clothing, using proper ventilation, and ensuring good hygiene practices.

Best of luck, Dr Mittal", "ai": " The CT scan report of your father's brain reveals the presence of a few small areas of brain tissue death (lacunar infarcts) in the bilateral gangliocapsular regions. This area is located near the capsule that covers the brain and the deep basal ganglia, which are involved in motor control and brain functions such as language and thinking. The findings of chronic ischemic changes suggest that these infarcts are likely to be the result of small vessel diseases, which are caused by reduced blood flow to the affected brain areas.\n\nThe generalized cerebral atrophy denotes a shrinkage of the overall brain size, which could be due to aging processes, neurodegenerative diseases, or other causes. The periventricular white matter changes indicate the presence of chronic ischemic injuries or other degenerative changes around the brain's ventricles (fluid-filled spaces in the brain).\n\nWhile these findings may be concerning, it is essential to note that lacunar infarcts and cerebral atrophy are relatively common in older adults, particularly those with cardiovascular risk factors such as hypertension, diabetes, or smoking. However, it is crucial to have a thorough evaluation by a healthcare professional to understand the implications for your father's health. Your doctor may recommend additional tests, such as magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) or blood tests, to further investigate the cause of these brain changes and determine if any interventions, such as medications or lifestyle modifications, are necessary to manage the underlying conditions and reduce the risk of future complications.\n\nIt is important to monitor your father's symptoms closely, follow his doctor's recommendations, and maintain open communication with his healthcare team to ensure the best possible outcome. Additionally, encouraging a healthy lifestyle, including regular physical activity, a balanced diet, and stress management, can help support your father's overall well-being."}

Instead, it is an antiemetic and dopaminergic receptor agonist that is commonly used to treat Parkinson's disease and other movement disorders. It may be prescribed to help relieve nausea and vomiting.\n2. T. Phycam: It is not clear what medication you mean by this abbreviation. If it is a proton pump inhibitor (PPI), such as omeprazole or lansoprazole, it can help reduce stomach acid production and prevent GERD symptoms.\n3. Syp. Acetripsin: Acetripsin is an enzyme replacement therapy used to treat cystic fibrosis and other conditions that result in a deficiency of pancreatic enzymes. It may not directly help with GERD symptoms but can be prescribed for related issues, such as malabsorption or digestive problems.\n4. T. Rbp: It is not clear what medication you mean by this abbreviation. RBP could stand for various medications, so I cannot provide specific information without knowing the exact drug. Depending on its purpose, it might not be directly related to treating GERD.\n5. T. Kinpride: Kinidine is an anticholinergic medication that can help reduce gut motility and relieve symptoms of diarrhea and gastrointestinal spasms. In some cases, it may be used to treat GERD if other treatments haven't been effective in managing symptoms like abdominal pain and colic.\n\nKeep in mind that this information does not constitute medical advice, and it is essential to consult your doctor for a proper diagnosis and treatment plan. If you have any concerns about your medications, ask your doctor for clarification and additional information."}

Urinary tract infection (UTI): UTIs are common infections that can cause pain while urinating. Symptoms may also include a frequent or strong urge to urinate, a burning sensation while urinating, and cloudy or strong-smelling urine. UTIs can be caused by bacteria entering the urinary tract.\n3.

{"question": "Suggest treatment for rashes in handHi I went to the doctor yesterday to show him a rash on the back of my hands, but he didn't see the white lines and circles that show up and then go away. The redness also goes away then comes back and my feet and palms itch. The circles and lines look really scary, like crop circles or something", "human": "Hi. Welcome to HCMfrom what you described you seem to be having allergic reactions causing wheals or hives. Is this the first episode or do you have a previous history of allergies in the past. Try and recall any possible cause of the rash. Any history of outdoor activity, exposure to plants, dust, animals, chemicals, any medication , any particular food. Anything you have been allergic to in the past?Once you can narrow down the possible factor, you will have to avoid it or you will keep having similar reactions. Seeing circles and lines, either white or reddish wherever you apply pressure, or scratch, is called dermographism and is a sign of sensitivity and high allergy levels in blood. So do consult a doctor regarding tests for the blood levels of eosinophils, serum IgE etc, which can show allergy. Skin tests can also be done to check specific reactions.Very rarely this reaction can happen even in normal skin.Apply a menthol/calamine lotion for the itching, 2-3 times a day. Start an antihistamine daily for 5-7 days after consulting the dermatologist. They may advise a longer course after seeing your blood work. This can help bring the allergy levels in control.If it is severe or persistent, you may be advised a cortisone shot in the ER.Use a mild soap for washing, avoid harsh chemicals. In case you have severe swelling, puffiness of face, lips, difficulty breathing, etc go to the ER immediately.Hope this helps guide you. Try to see the doctor as soon as the rashes appear.", "ai": " I'm not a doctor, but based on your description, it sounds like you may have a condition called dermatitis herpetiformis. This is a blistering skin condition that is a type of gluten-sensitive enteropathy, also known as celiac disease. The rash appears as red, itchy bumps that form groups and may have a center that looks like a blister or a bullseye. The circles or lines that you're seeing and the fact that the rash comes and goes could be a characteristic feature of this condition.\n\nThe treatment for dermatitis herpetiformis is a gluten-free diet, as well as medications to help suppress the immune response and reduce inflammation, such as dapsone or sulfa drugs. It is important to work with a healthcare provider to make an accurate diagnosis and develop an appropriate treatment plan.\n\nAdditionally, if you have not been tested for celiac disease before, this is something that should be considered, as the condition can affect not only the skin but also the digestive system. A blood test or biopsy can help confirm the diagnosis, and following a gluten-free diet will help manage both the skin symptoms and any potential digestive issues.\n\nIt's important to note that the rash from dermatitis herpetiformis can be mistaken for other conditions, so it is always best to consult a healthcare professional for an accurate diagnosis and treatment. If you have concerns or if your symptoms do not improve with treatment, be sure to follow up with your doctor for further evaluation."}

The specific cause of an individual seizure can vary, as there are many different types of seizures and underlying conditions that can lead to seizures. Here are some common triggers or factors that can contribute to seizures:\n\n1. Lack of sleep or fatigue\n2. Stress or emotional upset\n3. Flashing lights or patterns\n4. Bright or flickering lights\n5. Certain foods or food additives, such as MSG or alcohol\n6. Illness or infection\n7. Dehydration or electrolyte imbalances\n8. Medications or recreational drugs\n9. Hormonal changes\n10. Alcohol or drug withdrawal\n\nIn your father's case, it is important to note that his symptoms suggest he may have experienced a tonic-clonic seizure, also known as a grand mal seizure. This type of seizure is characterized by a loss of consciousness, stiffening of the muscles (tonic phase), followed by jerking movements (clonic phase). Seizures can be spontaneous, or they can be triggered by one or more of the above factors.\n\nIf your father has not been diagnosed with epilepsy or another condition that causes seizures, it is essential to have him evaluated by a healthcare professional as soon as possible. A neurological examination and possibly diagnostic tests, such as an electroencephalogram (EEG), can help determine the underlying cause of his seizure and develop a treatment plan if necessary. In the meantime, you can help ensure your father's safety by following these steps:\n\n1. Ensure a safe environment around him: Clear any potential hazards, such as sharp objects or stairs.\n2. Stay with him during and after the seizure: Offer comfort and reassurance.\n3. Place a soft object under his head to protect it, if possible.\n4. Do not try to restrain him or put anything between his teeth during the seizure.\n5. Time the seizure, if possible, and record the duration.\n6. Call emergency services if the seizure lasts longer than 5 minutes or if he has multiple seizures in a row, he is pregnant, or he stops breathing after the seizure."}

{"question": "What causes allergy to egg yolks?Hi, I used to be able to have as many as 4-5 eggs during the course of the day. But starting last year, every time I would have even a single full egg, I'd get a stomach upset with loose motion. After some experimentation, I realized that I may be allergic to the egg yolk. Can such an allergy develop suddenly, and is there any way to work around it? Thank you!", "human": "HelloThank You for contacting HCM.Although unlikely but yes allergy can develop like this and can cause problem. Body develops antibodies against the egg and when you take it then allergic reaction occur. As you have chronic allergy problem so i would recommend you following things:> Take levocetirizine one at night for 5 days.> Take montelukast one daily for one month. Research has shown that it decreases the allergic symptoms considerably.I would also suggest you to under go allergy testing at allergy clinic as you have chronic allergy problem. The results will help an allergist to prescribe you immunotherapy and it will improve the problem.Hope this answers your question. If you have additional questions or follow up questions then please do not hesitate in writing to us. Wishing you good health.", "ai": " Allergies to egg yolks, or any specific part of an egg, are actually uncommon compared to egg white allergies. When an allergy to egg yolks develops suddenly, it's often due to an intolerance rather than a true allergy. Here are some possible factors that could contribute to your symptoms:\n\n1. Food intolerance: Egg yolk contains high amounts of cholesterol, fat, and proteins, particularly the protein avidin. Avidin can interfere with the absorption of biotin, a B vitamin. When this occurs, it can result in symptoms such as digestive discomfort, loose stools, and nutrient deficiencies. However, this is not an allergic reaction but a food intolerance.\n\n2. Cross-contamination: If you have an egg white allergy, even trace amounts of egg whites in the yolk can cause a reaction. Make sure to check the labels of ingredients carefully to ensure that there's no cross-contamination with egg whites.\n\n3. Cooking methods: Cooking methods like over-cooking or under-cooking can alter the proteins in the egg yolk, making them more difficult to digest, which may contribute to your symptoms.\n\n4. Other nutritional deficiencies: Deficiencies in certain nutrients like magnesium, zinc, and B vitamins could worsen sensitivity to egg yolks. It may be worth checking with your healthcare provider to determine if any underlying nutritional issues could be contributing to your symptoms.\n\nIf you suspect that you have an egg yolk allergy or intolerance, it's important to consult your doctor for proper diagnosis and to explore alternatives or modify your diet accordingly. Some suggestions to work around the issue could be:\n\n- Eating egg whites instead of egg yolks\n- Cooking the eggs thoroughly to denature the proteins\n- Using egg substitutes like applesauce, bananas, or commercial egg substitutes for baking\n- Incorporating other sources of nutrients like plant-based proteins or fortified foods. Remember to discuss these options with a healthcare professional or a registered dietitian to ensure that they are suitable for your specific situation."}

In your case, getting hit in the genitals with a soccer ball might have caused trauma to the urinary tract or bladder, leading to hematuria and abdomen/perineal pain.\n\nHowever, it's essential to note that abdominal and perineal pain with hematuria can also be a sign of a more serious condition, such as a kidney injury or a tumor. These symptoms warrant a thorough medical evaluation by a healthcare professional.\n\nIt is recommended that you see your doctor for an examination, which may include a urinalysis, blood tests, and imaging studies like an ultrasound or CT scan to determine the cause of your symptoms. If you experience persistent pain, fever, or difficulty urinating, seek medical attention urgently.\n\nIn some cases, hematuria resolves on its own without any intervention. However, it's challenging to predict how long it might take, and there's no way to know for sure if your condition will improve without medical evaluation.\n\nHere are some general tips to help manage your symptoms while you wait for your appointment with your healthcare provider:\n\n1. Stay hydrated by drinking plenty of fluids, especially water, to help flush out your urinary system.\n2. Avoid caffeine, alcohol, and spicy foods, as they can irritate the bladder and worsen symptoms.\n3. Take over-the-counter pain relievers, such as ibuprofen or acetaminophen, as directed to help manage pain.\n4. Avoid strenuous activities, like soccer, that may worsen your symptoms.\n5. Practice good hygiene, especially when urinating, to help prevent infections.\n\nRemember, it's always best to consult your doctor for any health concerns, especially when you experience new and unexplained symptoms like hematuria and abdominal/perineal pain."}

In the meantime, continue following your prescribed treatment plan as directed, but don't hesitate to ask any questions or seek clarification if you're unsure about anything.\n\nRemember, it's important to keep active and keep moving your neck within a comfortable range of motion to promote healing and prevent muscle stiffness.

So get done CBC to rule out anemia and S. TSH to rule out thyroid diseases.If these are also normal than your symptoms may be due to stress and anxiety.  So better to avoid stress and tension. Be relax and calm.", "ai": " There are several possible causes for moderate chest pain and dizziness. Some common conditions that may cause these symptoms include:\n\n1. Heart conditions: Chest pain can be a sign of heart-related problems, such as angina (reduced blood flow to the heart muscle), heart attack, or arrhythmias (irregular heartbeat). Dizziness can also be a symptom of heart conditions, as it can be caused by a drop in blood pressure or an issue with the inner ear.\n2. Gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD): This condition, also known as acid reflux, can cause chest pain or discomfort due to the backflow of stomach acid into the esophagus. Dizziness is not a common symptom of GERD, but it can occur in some cases.\n3. Pulmonary conditions: Lung conditions, such as pneumonia, pleurisy, or pulmonary embolism, can cause chest pain and shortness of breath, which may contribute to feelings of dizziness.\n4. Anxiety or panic attacks: Chest pain and dizziness can be symptoms of anxiety or a panic attack. These conditions can cause feelings of fear or apprehension, rapid heartbeat, sweating, and difficulty breathing.\n5. Other causes: Other possible causes of chest pain and dizziness include infections, injuries, or conditions such as fibromyalgia or costochondritis.\n\nIf you are experiencing these symptoms, it is important to speak with your healthcare provider.

Take care Regards,Dr Shinas Hussain, General & Family Physician", "ai": " Yes, there are non-surgical options that may help improve the appearance of bowlegs, although they may not completely correct severe cases. Here are some options:\n\n1. Exercises: Bowlegs can be caused by various factors, including weakness or inflexibility of the muscles and bones. Regular exercises, such as hip abduction and hip rotation, can help strengthen the muscles around the hips and improve alignment.\n2. Braces: Wearing braces or corrective shoes can help realign the legs and reduce the bowing appearance. Braces work by applying pressure to the legs in a specific way, which can help guide the bones into their correct position.\n3. Vitamins and minerals: Deficiencies in vitamins and minerals, such as vitamin D and calcium, can contribute to the development of bowlegs. Making sure you're getting enough of these nutrients through your diet or supplements may help improve bone health and reduce bowing.\n4. Diet and lifestyle changes: Obesity or excessive weight gain can put added stress on the legs and worsen bowlegs. Eating a healthy, balanced diet and engaging in regular physical activity may help reduce weight and improve overall leg health.\n5. Shoe inserts: Wearing shoe inserts or orthotics can help correct minor bowlegs by providing additional support and alignment.\n\nIt's important to note that non-surgical treatments may not be effective for all cases of bowlegs, especially those that are severe.

This is often referred to as a \"subclinical\" or \"asymptomatic\" concussion. However, it's important to note that without any observable symptoms, it can be challenging to make a definitive diagnosis of a concussion based on an individual's self-report alone.\n\nStudies suggest that up to 30% of concussions may be asymptomatic at the time of injury, but symptoms can still develop later on. It's crucial that individuals who have suffered a head injury, even if they feel fine, be closely monitored for any potential signs and symptoms of a concussion. Symptoms may not appear until hours or even days after the injury, and they can range from physical, cognitive, or emotional impairments.\n\nIt is always a good idea to consult with a healthcare professional for an evaluation if you have experienced a head injury to ensure the proper assessment and care.

Thanks,&best of luck!", "ai": " I'm an AI language model and I cannot provide medical advice or suggest specific treatments based on individual cases. However, I can provide some general information about PCOS (Polycystic Ovary Syndrome) and its management.\n\nPCOS is a hormonal disorder affecting women, characterized by irregular menstrual periods, high levels of androgens (male hormones), and the presence of follicles in the ovaries that fail to regularly release mature eggs.\n\nThe treatment for PCOS depends on individual cases and symptoms. Here are some common approaches:\n\n1. Weight loss: Weight loss can help improve insulin sensitivity and menstrual regularity in women with PCOS. A healthy diet and regular exercise can help achieve weight loss.\n2. Birth control pills: Oral contraceptives can help regulate menstrual cycles, minimize androgen production, and reduce the risk of ovarian cysts.\n3. Fertility medications: Clomiphene citrate, letrozole, and gonadotropins like HMG (human menopausal gonadotropins) are commonly used fertility medications for women with PCOS. These medications stimulate ovulation, which can help women conceive.\n4. Metformin: This medication can help improve insulin sensitivity, which can improve menstrual regularity and ovulation. Metformin is often used off-label to treat PCOS.\n5. Surgery: In some cases, laparoscopic ovarian drilling or hysterectomy may be recommended to improve ovulation. These procedures are less common and should be considered as last resorts.\n\nRegarding your situation, based on the information you've provided, it seems that you've undergone fertility treatments with HMG injections, and your follicular study reveals a dominant follicle of 25mm. Depending on your doctor's recommendation, you may consider undergoing ovulation induction by administering human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG) to mature the follicle and trigger ovulation.

I then notice it was bleeding and want to know if it could have been a bed bug?", "human": "Good day and thanks for your question. It could be an insect bite (bed bug) which was itchy and scratching it might lead to inflammation and subsequently bleed. Hope it helps. Thank you.", "ai": " Bed bug bites do not typically cause bleeding. However, excessive scratching or breaking the skin due to the itching caused by the bite can result in bleeding. If you are unsure if a bed bug bit you, look for small, red, itchy welts in a linear or zigzag pattern on your skin. Bed bug bites can take a few days to appear, so keep an eye on your skin for any new bites. If you are concerned or experience severe symptoms, consult a healthcare professional."}

If you're concerned about cancer or any other serious conditions, please consult a healthcare professional for an accurate diagnosis.\n\nThe symptoms you've described – a sore red spot on the gum that bleeds when you press it and a dull pain in a bottom tooth – could be indicative of several conditions, some of which are more common than others. A few possibilities include:\n\n1. Gum disease: Gingivitis, the earliest stage of gum disease, can cause the gums to become red, swollen, and bleed easily, especially when you brush or floss. If the condition progresses to periodontitis, you may experience tooth pain and bone loss.\n2. Trauma: If you've bitten your lip or cheek, or if you've been playing with the affected area, you could have caused an injury that resulted in a sore and bleeding gum.\n3. Infection: Abscesses, tooth decay, or gum infections could all cause symptoms similar to those you've described, with a painful tooth, a sore, red gum, and bleeding.\n4. Cancer: Although it's rare, gum cancer – also known as oral squamous cell carcinoma – can present with symptoms like a sore or painful red spot on the gum that bleeds easily.\n\nHowever, it's important to remember that the symptoms you've described are more commonly associated with less serious conditions. While it's always a good idea to be aware of the signs and symptoms of oral cancer, the likelihood of having this condition based on your description is relatively low.\n\nIf you're worried, the best course of action is to visit your dentist or a healthcare professional for an evaluation. They'll be able to assess your symptoms and perform any necessary tests to determine the underlying cause and provide appropriate treatment options.\n\nIn the meantime, you can try the following home care measures to help reduce your discomfort:\n\n1. Avoid brushing or flossing the affected area to prevent further irritation.\n2. Rinse your mouth with warm salt water several times a day to soothe inflammation.\n3. Over-the-counter pain relievers (Tylenol, Advil, or ibuprofen) can help manage any discomfort.\n4. Eat soft foods to avoid putting pressure on the affected tooth or gum."}
{"question": "Suggest treatment for sacroiliac joint dislocationMy chiropractor says my sacroiliac is out of place on my right side with pain reaching around to my hip and abdomen. Chiropractic adjustments have helped a bit but after 5 of them in 6 days I usually would feel better. What else can I do to heal or put the joint back in place?", "human": "hiYou should be consulting an orthopedic surgeon and have an MRI done for exact diagnosis and position of sacro-iliac joint.Dislocation is rare but happens mainly after severe trauma.This should be diagnosed as early as possible and treatment depends on exact finding on MRIthanks", "ai": " I'm an AI language model and not a doctor, so I cannot provide medical advice. However, I can suggest some treatments and therapies that are commonly used to help with sacroiliac joint dysfunction, which is a condition where the sacroiliac joint is not functioning properly, including dislocations. Some of these treatments may complement your chiropractic care:\n\n1. Rest and physical therapy: Give your body time to heal by avoiding activities that aggravate the pain and limiting excessive standing, sitting, or walking. Physical therapy can help improve strength, flexibility, and mobility of the surrounding muscles, joints, and connective tissues. This can help support the sacroiliac joint and improve its function.\n\n2. Heat and ice therapy: Apply heat or ice packs to the affected area to help relieve pain and reduce inflammation. Heat can help increase blood flow and improve flexibility, while ice can help reduce swelling and numb the area.\n\n3. Massage: Gentle massage of the affected area can help improve blood flow, reduce inflammation, and relieve muscle tension. Be sure to communicate with your massage therapist or chiropractor to ensure that the pressure is appropriate for your condition.\n\n4. Exercise: Low-impact exercises, such as walking, swimming, or cycling, can help improve flexibility, strength, and mobility of the affected area. Your chiropractor or physical therapist can provide you with a personalized exercise routine.\n\n5. Orthotics: Wearing supportive shoes or using orthotic devices, such as shoe inserts or custom orthotics, can help distribute weight evenly and reduce stress on the sacroiliac joint.\n\n6. Electrical stimulation: Transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation (TENS) can help provide temporary pain relief by sending electrical impulses through the affected area.\n\n7. Injection therapy: In some cases, your healthcare provider may recommend injection therapy, such as corticosteroid injections or nerve blocks, to provide temporary pain relief and reduce inflammation.\n\n8. Medications: Over-the-counter or prescription pain medications, anti-inflammatory drugs, or muscle relaxants may be recommended by your healthcare provider to help manage symptoms.\n\n9. Diet: Eating a healthy, balanced diet can help support tissue repair and reduce inflammation. Avoiding processed foods, sugar, and alcohol can also help improve overall health and support the healing process.\n\n10. Stress management: Stress can exacerbate symptoms of sacroiliac joint dysfunction. Practicing stress management techniques, such as meditation, deep breathing, or yoga, can help reduce stress levels and improve overall wellbeing.\n\nIt's important to remember that not all treatments will be effective for everyone, and some may not be suitable for certain individuals. Be sure to consult with your healthcare provider before trying any new treatments or therapies, especially if you have any underlying health conditions or are taking medications."}

These conditions are often treated with over-the-counter pain relievers such as ibuprofen or acetaminophen. Applying a heating pad or cold compress to the affected area can also help relieve symptoms.\n\nHowever, your symptoms of dizziness, lightheadedness, and feeling very low in energy are not typical for a tension headache or migraine. These symptoms could indicate other underlying conditions, such as dehydration, anemia, or even a more serious condition like a brain tumor, although the likelihood of this is low.\n\nConsidering the severity and duration of your symptoms, it is strongly recommended that you consult a healthcare professional for a proper evaluation.

{"question": "Stage III melanoma. In phase II interferon treatment,  melanoma returned on left thigh. Treatment not effective?I am a Stage III melanoma patient.  During Phase II of interferon treatments (self-injected 3 times a week treatment), my melanoma returned on my upper left thigh.  I am very discouraged by this news.

The return of melanoma after interferon treatment in your case does not necessarily mean that the treatment was not effective for you. Melanoma can be a complex and unpredictable disease, and the progression of the cancer may be influenced by various factors, including the specific characteristics of the tumor, the individual's health status, and the response of the immune system.\n\nIt is common for oncologists to explain that not all patients will respond to interferon treatment, and that the treatment may be more effective for some individuals than others. The development of melanoma lesions during treatment does not automatically indicate that the treatment is not working. Your oncologist may recommend other treatments or clinical trials based on your specific situation. It would be a good idea to discuss your concerns and questions with your healthcare team, as they can provide you with the most accurate and up-to-date information. They may suggest additional tests or alternative treatment options, depending on the specific details of your case.\n\nIt's normal to feel discouraged or have concerns when receiving news about your cancer, but it's crucial to stay informed and engaged in your care. Continuing the dialogue with your healthcare team, seeking out reliable information from credible sources, and remaining open to exploring new treatment options can help you feel more empowered and better prepared to manage your condition.

{"question": "What causes heart palpitations during nights?I am experiencing regular heart palpitatios especially at night. my thyroxine was increased from 25mcg to 50mcg in july. I have had 24hr heart monitor and told although I am having occasinal missed heart beats it is not enogh to worry about. I am still worried, shpuld I be?", "human": "Hello!Welcome and thank you for asking on HCM!I understand your concern and would explain that these missed heart beats could be related to the increase in the dose of thyroxine. For this reason, I would recommend checking again thyroid hormone levels in order to perform the needed adjustment to the dose. Another possible cause to consider, would would be a sleep disorder. You should know that during REM sleep or nightmares, our heart rate increases, causing even ectopic heart beats. But, they are quite normal and do not need any special treatment. Hope you will find this answer helpful!Wishing good health, Dr. Iliri", "ai": " Heart palpitations are feelings of an irregular or rapid heartbeat. They can occur at any time of the day or night, including during sleep. There are several possible causes of heart palpitations, and in your case, your thyroid medication being increased could potentially be a contributing factor.\n\nThyroid hormones play a crucial role in regulating heart rate and rhythm. An overactive thyroid gland, which is often treated with thyroid medication, can cause an increased heart rate, which may lead to palpitations. This is a common side effect of thyroid medication and usually goes away with time as the body adjusts to the new dosage.\n\nHowever, it is essential to note that heart palpitations can also be caused by other conditions, such as anxiety, stress, dehydration, certain medications, electrolyte imbalances, or underlying heart conditions. If you are still concerned about your heart palpitations, it would be a good idea to speak with your healthcare provider. They may be able to recommend additional tests or treatments to help alleviate your symptoms.\n\nIt is also important to remember that having occasional missed heartbeats detected on a 24-hour heart monitor is not necessarily a cause for alarm. Missed beats are relatively common and usually have no clinical significance, especially if they do not cause any symptoms or are not frequent. However, if you are concerned about your heart health, always talk to your doctor about any symptoms or tests results you may have. They can help put your mind at ease and provide guidance based on your individual circumstances."}

In addition Oral Anxiolytics or Tablets are also prescribed for this as adjuvant therapy.Consult a Psychiatrist pls. Thanks,Regards.,Dr Lt Cdr ASN Bhushan.", "ai": " It sounds like you are experiencing symptoms of Agoraphobia, a type of anxiety disorder. Agoraphobia is characterized by fear and avoidance of places or situations that may cause panic or anxiety. In your case, it seems that various situations such as seeing new people, driving, fan movements, and being in elevators are triggering your anxiety.\n\nThe exact cause of Agoraphobia is not known, but it's believed to be related to a combination of genetic, environmental, and psychological factors. It's important to note that anxiety disorders are treatable, and you don't have to continue suffering.\n\n here are some possible treatments that may help:\n\n1. Cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT): This is a type of psychotherapy that can help you manage your anxiety by teaching you how to change thought patterns and behaviors that contribute to your fear. Your therapist may teach you techniques such as relaxation, exposure therapy (gradually exposing you to anxiety-provoking situations), and cognitive restructuring to challenge and change negative thoughts.\n2. Medication: There are various medications that can be used to treat anxiety disorders, including selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) and benzodiazepines. However, these medications should be used under the supervision of a healthcare professional, as they can have side effects and may not be suitable for everyone.\n3. Lifestyle changes: Simple lifestyle changes such as getting regular exercise, eating a healthy diet, avoiding caffeine and alcohol, and getting enough sleep can help reduce anxiety symptoms. Managing stress through relaxation techniques such as deep breathing, progressive muscle relaxation, or meditation can also be helpful.\n4. Support groups: Joining a support group for people with anxiety disorders can provide a sense of community and help you connect with others who are going through similar experiences.\n\nIt's important to remember that recovery from anxiety disorders takes time and effort, and it's okay to ask for help. I would recommend that you continue working with your healthcare provider to find the best treatment approach for you. If you don't have a healthcare provider or are looking for additional resources, you may want to consider reaching out to mental health organizations in your area or online for information and support."}
{"question": "Is vaccination needed again after being scratched by cat for second time?Hi Doc.,Im Cris. I was scrathced by a cat in my legs last June and completed my vaccinne until the month of July..This month of september i was scrathced again by a different cat, on my shoilder bcoz it jmped on me.DO I NEED TO TAKE ANOTHER SET OF VACCINE???", "human": "Hello,Welcome to HCM,Cat is a known reservoir of rabies virus and can transmit rabies by biting. Rabies is a 100% fatal disease but 100% preventable by proper and adequate treatment.As you were bit by a cat previously for which you have taken complete shots of anti rabies vaccine. As you were scratched by the cat once again, according to WHO categories you will be categorized into Re-Exposures.Re_exposure should receive two shots of anti rabies vaccine on days 0 and 3.Thank you.", "ai": " While being scratched by a cat can expose you to the risk of contracting diseases such as cat-scratch fever or rabies, being vaccinated once does not necessarily mean you are immune for life. The protection provided by the vaccine decreases over time, and the specific duration depends on the type of vaccine and your individual response.\n\nIn general, for people who are at ongoing risk of cat scratches or bites due to their occupation or lifestyle, it is recommended to get a booster dose every 10 years or so. However, if you have been scratched by a different cat and it has been less than a year since your last series of vaccines, it would be best to consult with a healthcare professional or your doctor to determine if you need another set of vaccines based on your specific situation.\n\nKeep in mind that in addition to getting vaccinated, it's also important to practice good hygiene after being scratched by a cat. Wash the wound thoroughly with soap and water, avoid touching the wound with your hands, and cover it with a clean bandage to prevent infection. If you develop symptoms such as fever, swelling, or redness around the wound, seek medical attention right away.\n\nIf you're concerned about the risk of rabies, it's important to note that vaccines for this disease are given to the cat, not to the person. Cats that have been exposed to rabies are typically quarantined or euthanized to prevent the spread of the disease to people. If you have been scratched by a cat that you believe may have rabies, or if the cat's rabies vaccination status is unknown, you should seek medical attention right away and report the incident to your local animal control agency."}

The right ovary is showing a smaller follicle and no evident fluid accumulation, which might indicate a problem with follicle development or maturation.\n\nPCOD, or Polycystic Ovary Syndrome, is a common condition characterized by enlarged ovaries with numerous small cysts forming due to hormonal imbalances. In your case, the smaller right ovary might be a sign of this condition. However, it's important to note that every woman's body is unique, and it's possible to have a smaller ovary on one side for other reasons.\n\nGiven your attempts to conceive a second child and your history of PCOD, you might want to discuss these results with your doctor to determine if any further interventions would be beneficial. This could include medications to stimulate ovulation, laparoscopic surgery, or other options to help address the underlying issues related to PCOD and ovulation. Keep in mind that communication with your healthcare provider is key to understanding your personal situation and exploring the best possible solutions for you and your family."}

What could this be? He also mentioned he feels like his memory is becoming short since the lump started?", "human": "Hi,This is most likely to be a sebaceous cyst. This is not a serious condition. The cyst may continue to grow in which case it can be removed by minor surgery. The memory changes will be coincidental and not related to the lump.Regards,MBChB  FRCA", "ai": " I'm not a doctor, but I can tell you that a growing, painless hard lump on the head, along with memory concerns, can be a potential sign of a few conditions. Here are some possibilities, but it's essential to consult a healthcare professional for an accurate diagnosis:\n\n1. Brain tumors: Brain tumors can present as a head mass that grows over time, and some types may not initially cause pain. Memory issues can also be a symptom of a brain tumor.\n2. Pituitary tumors: The pituitary gland is located at the base of the brain, and tumors can form there, which can cause symptoms like headaches, memory loss, and visual disturbances.\n3. Arachnoid cyst: Arachnoid cysts are fluid-filled cysts that can develop between the layers of tissue that cover the brain and spinal cord. These cysts, though usually benign, can put pressure on surrounding structures and lead to symptoms like headaches and memory loss.\n4. Fibroma: A fibroma is a benign fibrous tumor that grows slower than other tumors and usually feels firm. Although it's not common for a fibroma to develop in the head, it's possible.\n5. Lipoma: A lipoma is a benign, slow-growing, fatty tumor. They can develop anywhere on the body, including the scalp, which could be confused with a brain tumor if it is large enough.\n\nIt's crucial to get an in-person evaluation by a healthcare professional to rule out any serious causes, especially if there are concerns about memory loss or a growing lump. Your friend, as well as you, should consider the following steps:\n\n1. Schedule an appointment with a family doctor or a neurologist to discuss your symptoms.\n2. Provide as much information as possible regarding the size, location, and duration of the lump.\n3. Share any other symptoms, such as persistent headaches, vision changes, or difficulty with speech or coordination.\n4. Have a complete health assessment, including blood tests, imaging tests, and possibly a lumbar puncture to gather more information.\n\nIn some cases, these conditions can be treated effectively, while others may require ongoing monitoring or supportive care. Regardless, early diagnosis and proper evaluation are crucial to ensure the best possible outcome."}

However, I cannot provide medical advice, and you should continue working with your healthcare provider to address your son's issues.\n\nHere are some things you can try that may help in the meantime:\n\n1. Make bathroom trips more frequent: Encourage your son to go to the bathroom every hour or two, especially before and after activities. This may help reduce accidents.\n2.

Practice pelvic floor exercises: Pelvic floor exercises, also known as Kegels, can help improve bladder control. Have your son practice squeezing and releasing the muscles in his pelvic area, just as if he were trying to stop the flow of urine midstream.\n4. Use a reward system: Consider setting up a reward system for your son to encourage him to use the toilet regularly. Rewards can include stickers, small toys, or privileges.\n5. Consider using protective undergarments: While this alone won't solve the problem, using protective undergarments can help reduce the embarrassment and discomfort that your son may feel when experiencing accidents.\n\nIt's important to continue working with your healthcare provider to find the best course of action for your son.

Are you able to manage your intrusive thoughts? Are the thoughts affecting your day to day activities adversely? If yes, you need to go for cognitive therapy. Hope I have answered your query. Let me know if I can assist you further. Regards,Dr. K. V. Anand, Psychologist", "ai": " I'm an AI language model and not a doctor, so I can't diagnose you or provide definitive answers to your health concerns. However, I can help provide some information and context.\n\nIntrusive thoughts are unwelcome and distressing thoughts that can pop into anyone's mind. They can be about anything, and they can be quite varied in nature. Some people might have intrusive thoughts related to harm or aggression, while others might have obsessive thoughts about certain rituals or routines.\n\nIt's important to note that having intrusive thoughts from time to time is a normal part of being human. Thoughts are not under our control, and everyone experiences them, whether they are pleasant or unpleasant. However, if these thoughts cause significant distress or lead to compulsive behaviors, they may be a sign of an underlying mental health condition, such as Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder (OCD).\n\nYour experience of intrusive thoughts, combined with hyperawareness of body functions, does seem somewhat similar to OCD symptoms. However, it's important to keep in mind that only a qualified mental health professional can make an accurate diagnosis based on a thorough evaluation.\n\nIf you're feeling concerned about your intrusive thoughts, it might be helpful to talk to a mental health professional. They can provide you with information and support, help you understand your symptoms, and recommend any necessary treatments. If you're unsure where to start, you can speak to your primary care physician, who can refer you to a specialist or provide you with resources.\n\nIn the meantime, there are some things you can do to help manage your symptoms:\n\n1. Educate yourself: Learn as much as you can about OCD and intrusive thoughts, and understand that these experiences are common and treatable.\n2. Practice relaxation techniques: Deep breathing, progressive muscle relaxation, meditation, and yoga can help reduce stress and anxiety.\n3. Challenge your thoughts: Use cognitive-behavioral techniques to identify and challenge the unhelpful thoughts and beliefs that contribute to your anxiety.\n4. Try to normalize your thoughts: Remember that everyone experiences intrusive thoughts, and they don't reflect your true feelings or desires.\n5. Seek support: Talk to trusted individuals about your experiences, and consider joining a support group for people with OCD.\n\nIf your symptoms become more severe or persistent, it's important to seek professional help to ensure that you receive a proper diagnosis and treatment."}
{"question": "Is constant crying by an infant at night a cause for concern?hi ! my baby girl is 3 month old she is crying a lot i hold her all the time but she does nt stop some time she play but at evening she start crying all night i am worried about her mostly her head is warm but she have no fever . plz tell me something . thanku", "human": "Hi,Nothing to worry, this is infantile colic which is common upto 3-6 months.Another reason is that baby is not hungry so give her enough feeding.Give her colicarmin or colicaid drops as and when required.Ok and take care.", "ai": " I'm here to help answer any questions you might have, but please keep in mind that I'm an AI language model and not a medical professional. I cannot provide medical advice or diagnoses.\n\nThat being said, I understand that a baby crying constantly at night can be concerning for parents. Infants often cry for various reasons, and it's natural for parents to worry, especially if they can't seem to soothe their little one. Your baby's persistent crying, combined with the fact that she plays sometimes but then cries all night, could be a sign of several things.\n\nOne possibility is colic. Colic is a common condition in babies under three months old, and it's characterized by prolonged periods of crying, often in the evening hours. While the cause of colic isn't entirely understood, some theories suggest it may be related to gastrointestinal discomfort or sensitivity.\n\nAnother possibility is hunger, as your baby might be waking up during the night to feed. Three months is still quite young for a baby to go through an entire eight-hour sleep cycle, so it's not uncommon for younger babies to wake up and nurse throughout the night.\n\nLastly, overheating could also be a concern, especially if your baby's head is warm. Overdressing or using heavy blankets could lead to an elevated body temperature, and this can make your baby uncomfortable and cause her to cry.\n\nIf you're feeling concerned about your baby's persistent crying or her warm head, it's a good idea to consult a healthcare professional or pediatrician. They can assess the situation and provide guidance based on their medical expertise.\n\nMeanwhile, here are some things you can try to help ease your baby's discomfort and encourage calmer nights:\n\n1. Burping your baby: Infants can swallow air while feeding or crying, and burping can help get rid of this excess air, which can contribute to fussiness and discomfort.\n2. Soothing techniques: Rocking, singing, or swaddling your baby can help soothe her and encourage calmness.\n3. Feeding: Offering your baby a bottle or nursing session can help satisfy her hunger and promote longer stretches of sleep.\n4. Keeping the room at a comfortable temperature: Make sure the room isn't too hot or too cold, and dress your baby appropriately for the temperature.\n5. White noise: Using a white noise machine or playing calming music can help drown out any distractions and create a soothing environment for your baby.\n\nI hope this information is helpful, and I wish you and your baby all the best during this time. Remember, parenting isn't always easy, and it's natural to have concerns from time to time. Trust your instincts and don't hesitate to reach out to a healthcare professional for advice if you're feeling uncertain or overwhelmed."}

Regards", "ai": " I'm an AI language model and not a doctor, but I can try to help you understand some potential causes of bile duct narrowing after gallbladder surgery and repeated ERCPs (Endoscopic Retrograde Cholangiopancreatography). It's important to note that I cannot provide specific medical advice or determine the minimum size of your bile duct. Please consult your healthcare provider for accurate information concerning your condition.\n\n1. Scars from prior procedures: Repeated ERCPs and gallbladder surgery can lead to scar tissue formation in the bile duct. This scarring could result in duct narrowing and strictures, making it challenging for bile to flow freely.\n\n2. Iatrogenic (procedure-related) complications: Despite the best intentions and techniques, ERCPs and surgeries carry some risks, including complications during the procedure itself. These complications could contribute to bile duct narrowing.\n\n3. Anastomotic strictures: If your gallbladder was removed via a laparoscopic procedure, a bile duct-to-intestine anastomosis (joining) is typically created. Over time, this anastomosis could develop strictures, leading to difficulty in bile flow.\n\n4. Recurring bile duct stones: Although not directly related to ERCPs or gallbladder surgery, ongoing issues with bile duct stones can cause narrowing and obstruction. It's crucial to discuss this possibility with your healthcare provider.\n\n5. Other causes: There are several other conditions that could potentially cause narrowing of the bile duct, regardless of previous surgeries or ERCPs. These include inflammatory conditions, tumors, and vascular anomalies.\n\nIt's essential to discuss your situation with your healthcare provider to determine the underlying cause of your bile duct narrowing and explore possible treatment options. You might consider alternative procedures, such as endoscopic dilation or surgery, depending on the specifics of your case."}

Mastitis: This is an infection of the breast tissue that can cause redness, heat, and pain. It is more common in breastfeeding women but can also occur in non-lactating women. If you have a fever, chills, or other symptoms, or if the rash is accompanied by breast pain, seek medical attention.\n5. Prolactinoma: Although you mentioned having a microadenoma on the pituitary gland, it's important to note that prolactinomas can sometimes cause skin changes.

{"question": "Is pregnancy possible while having unruptured egg follicle?Hii I took fertigyn injection on 23dec 10000 and 24dec 5000 IE my 14 & 15 day respectively and today is my day 17 I.e 26 Dec still the egg is not ruptured..Now what should I do and when to have intercourse. And is it not possible now to conceive even if the egg gets ruptured?", "human": "Dear Ms, you should wait until the egg ruptures and then start intercourse in the following 2-3days following the rupture of the egg. yes there is a possibility that you get pregnant once the egg ruptures ( ovulates)", "ai": " I am an AI language model and cannot diagnose or provide medical advice. However, I can help explain the general process of follicle stimulation and ovulation in relation to your question.\n\nFollicle stimulation is a process that prepares an egg (ovum) for release from the ovary, which is called ovulation. You have described taking Follistim (Follitropin alpha) injections, which are used to stimulate the production of follicles. The maturation and eventual rupture of a follicle and the subsequent ovulation occur naturally, and these processes cannot be directly controlled or hurried up by these medications.\n\nCurrently, your egg has not ruptured, and it is not recommended to have intercourse before ovulation as sperm survival in the female reproductive system is limited (typically up to 5 days). Waiting for ovulation increases the likelihood of the sperm being present and able to fertilize the egg if it is released.\n\nOvulation usually occurs around 12-14 days after the first day of your menstrual cycle. Based on your menstrual cycle length, assuming your last menstrual period started around December 1st, you might expect ovulation closer to December 16th. As you mentioned, you took injections on the 14th and 15th, which is within this window.\n\nGiven the information you have provided, there is no definitive answer to your question, as it relies on factors specific to your body, such as the size and readiness of your follicles, the length of your menstrual cycle, and timing of your ovulation.\n\nI highly recommend consulting with your healthcare provider: they can provide you with guidance based on your individual situation and medical history. They may be able to perform an ultrasound to measure the size of your follicles and offer predictions as to when you may ovulate.\n\nIt's important to understand that even though your egg has not ruptured yet, a cycle with injectable medications like Follistim leads to a higher chances of ovulation and conception compared to unassisted cycles. However, it is essential to follow the instructions of your healthcare provider carefully to optimize your chances of success."}

A hazy or chocolaty urine color can have various causes, some of which may be related to food consumption.\n\nFoods such as chocolate, beets, blackberries, and rhubarb can change the color of urine due to their natural pigments. In your son's case, eating an eggless chocolate cake may be the cause of the darker urine color. However, it's essential to note that this is generally not a significant concern if the color is the only abnormal symptom and the urine still appears normal when diluted or after drinking plenty of fluids throughout the day.\n\nHowever, if your child's dark urine is accompanied by other symptoms such as:\n\n* Frequent, painful, or difficulty urinating\n* Cloudy, foamy or strong-smelling urine\n* Darker skin or eyes\n* Fatigue\n* Rapid heart rate\n* Increased thirst\n\nConsider visiting a pediatrician to rule out potential underlying medical conditions like dehydration, kidney infection, liver disease, or medication side effects.\n\nIn general, it's essential to ensure your child stays hydrated by drinking plenty of water, especially if they consume foods known to change urine color like chocolate. If you're concerned about your child's urine or any other symptoms, don't hesitate to consult a healthcare professional for advice."}

There can be injury to your bones around your elbow joint. I shall advice you to at least have a x ray of elbow to rule out a bony injury. Till then you may have a good analgesic to have relief from pain. Take care. Hope I have answered your question. Let me know if I can assist you further. Regards,Dr. Mukesh Tiwari, Orthopedic Surgeon", "ai": " Based on the description you provided, it is likely that you sustained an elbow injury known as an elbow flexor strain or \" golfer's elbow.\" This injury occurs when the muscles and tendons that help bend the elbow and flex the wrist are strained or torn. The swelling and pain you are experiencing are likely a result of inflammation and tissue damage from the injury.\n\nSymptoms of an elbow flexor strain include:\n\n* Pain on the inner side of the elbow\n* Swelling and tenderness in the affected area\n* Weakness or difficulty flexing the elbow and wrist\n* Possible bruising\n\nIf the pain and swelling persist or worsen despite home care measures such as ice, rest, and over-the-counter pain medications, it is recommended that you see a healthcare professional for evaluation and possible further treatment. In severe cases, an elbow flexor strain may require immobilization with a brace or cast or even surgical intervention.\n\nIt is important to avoid putting any weight or stress on the injured elbow to allow it to heal properly. This may mean avoiding activities that involve repetitive bending or twisting motions, such as lifting weights or playing sports, for a period of time. Additionally, you may want to consider seeing a physical therapist for rehabilitation exercises to help regain strength and flexibility in the elbow after the injury has healed.\n\nIn the meantime, you can take steps to manage the pain and reduce swelling at home, such as:\n\n* Applying ice packs to the affected area for 15-20 minutes at a time, several times a day\n* Elevating the elbow above heart level whenever possible to help reduce swelling\n* Taking over-the-counter pain medications such as acetaminophen or ibuprofen as needed\n* Wearing a brace or sling to support the elbow and help prevent further injury.\n\nRemember, if your symptoms do not improve or worsen, it is important to seek medical attention as soon as possible to prevent further injury and ensure proper healing!"}
{"question": "What may be the cause of intense pain in wrist after an injury?Hi, I damaged my wrist while sparring (boxing) and since then I struggle to twist my wrist without pain and also a grinding and clicking noise.

As of now you can use analgesics/anti-inflammatory combination like aceclofenac/serratiopeptidase for symptomatic relief. If symptoms persists better to consult an orthopedician and get evaluated. Hope I have answered your query. Let me know if I can assist you further. Regards,Dr. Shinas Hussain,General & Family Physician", "ai": " Intense pain in the wrist after an injury, along with grinding and clicking noises, could be indicative of various conditions. Here are some possible causes:\n\n1. Wrist Sprain: A wrist sprain is a common injury in boxing, and it occurs when the ligaments that support the wrist are stretched or torn. Pain, swelling, and difficulty moving the wrist are common symptoms.\n2. Carpal Tunnel Syndrome: This condition is caused by compression of the median nerve at the wrist, which can result in pain, numbness, and tingling in the wrist, hand, and thumb. While it's unlikely that an injury would directly cause carpal tunnel syndrome, the injury may have aggravated an underlying condition.\n3. Scapholunate Instability: This condition occurs when the scaphoid and lunate bones in the wrist dislocate or sublux (partially dislocate), causing instability and pain. Symptoms include pain on the outside of the wrist, swelling, and decreased grip strength.\n4. Tendonitis: Tendonitis is inflammation of the tendons, which can cause pain and swelling in the wrist. Boxing training involves a lot of wrist extension and flexion, which can put stress on the tendons and lead to inflammation.\n5. Wrist Fracture: Although your x-ray did not reveal a fracture, it's possible that the fracture is not visible on an x-ray yet or that the injury is not limited to the wrist bone but also involves the carpal bones.\n\nIt's important to note that this list is not exhaustive, and the cause of your symptoms may be something else entirely. If your symptoms persist despite rest, ice, compression, and elevation, or if they worsen, it's important to consult with your healthcare provider or a specialist, such as an orthopedic surgeon, for a proper diagnosis and treatment plan. In the meantime, you can do gentle range-of-motion exercises and mild stretching to help reduce stiffness and maintain joint mobility. Avoid any activities that cause pain or worsen your symptoms."}

Rest all the medication needs to be taken on the time.I will be happy to answer your further concern on bit.ly/DrArun.Thank you,Dr Arun TankInfectious diseases specialist,HCM", "ai": " The survival time with a severely leaking (also known as severe regurgitation or insufficiency) heart valve or two leaking valves (one severe and one moderate) can vary significantly depending on several factors, including the specific type and location of the valve damage, the age and overall health of the individual, and the presence of other health conditions.\n\nGenerally speaking, severe heart valve leakage can lead to various complications, such as heart failure, irregular heart rhythms, and poor blood pressure control. These complications can reduce lifespan and Quality of Life. According to some studies, the survival rate for patients with a severe heart valve leak is around 2 to 5 years without surgery.\n\nModerate heart valve leakage is less severe but still contributes to health issues like heart failure, irregular heart rhythms, and poor blood pressure control. The survival rate for patients with a moderate heart valve leak is typically longer than those with a severe leak, but it still varies depending on other factors. Life expectancy for individuals with a moderate heart valve leak could be several years to up to a decade or beyond.\n\nHowever, an 86-year-old woman with a strong heart muscle and good overall health who has been hospitalized twice due to fluid build-up suggests that her situation might be more complex than a simple heart valve leak. She might have other health issues that are contributing to fluid accumulation and worsening her heart condition. Therefore, her individual circumstances may affect both the severity and duration of her condition.\n\nIt is crucial for this woman to receive a thorough evaluation from a cardiologist to better understand the underlying causes of her heart condition and the potential impact on her overall health and lifespan. Treatment options, such as valve repair or replacement, may be recommended to improve her symptoms, prevent further complications, and increase her lifespan. Ultimately, the woman and her healthcare team should discuss her individual situation, treatment options, and expected outcomes based on her unique circumstances."}

Your pain seems as if one of the nerves in dorsal spine is being pressed.  I suggest MRI of Dorsal spine , Pain killers , Pregabalin . If pain does not improve in few days time , I suggest you consult a pain specialist who may use nerve block to relieve pain.", "ai": " Mid-back pain radiating towards the ribs, especially in the context of spinal stenosis, can have various causes. While your description matches some symptoms of thoracic spinal stenosis, there are other conditions that could also produce similar symptoms. Here are some potential causes of your pain:\n\n1. Thoracic spinal stenosis: Although you mentioned having spinal stenosis in your lumbar and cervical spine, the new development of mid-back pain and radiculopathy (pain, tingling, or numbness) in the ribs could be due to thoracic spinal stenosis. Thoracic spinal stenosis occurs when the spinal canal in the thoracic region becomes narrowed, resulting in pressure on the spinal cord and/or nearby nerve roots, leading to symptoms.\n\n2.Costovertebral angle syndrome: This condition occurs when the muscles and ligaments around the ribs become strained or inflamed, causing pain in the costovertebral angle – the area where the ribs meet the thoracic vertebrae. This could potentially result in pain felt in the mid-back, which then radiates towards the ribs.\n\n3.Rib compression or injury: Spinal stenosis and poor posture can put undue stress on the ribs. Injuries like a rib contusion or strain, or more serious conditions like a rib fracture, can also cause pain that radiates from the mid-back to the ribs.\n\n4.Musculoskeletal causes: Conditions like myofascial pain syndrome, herniated or bulging discs, or other soft tissue injuries in the mid-back or rib cage could potentially cause similar symptoms.\n\n5.Referred pain: In some cases, pain from other areas of the body, like the lumbar or cervical spine, can be perceived as coming from the mid-back or ribs due to neural or somatic referral.\n\nIt's important to note that this list is not exhaustive, and your symptoms may also be attributed to other conditions. You should consult with a healthcare professional, such as a spine specialist or a pain management doctor, for a proper diagnosis and treatment plan. They may perform a complete medical history, physical examination, and potentially order diagnostic tests like X-rays, CT scans, or MRIs to help determine the underlying cause of your pain. In the meantime, try to manage your symptoms with self-care measures, such as massage, heat or cold therapy, and gentle stretching exercises, as recommended by your healthcare professional."}

{"question": "What causes lump near groin?I have a lump near my groin. It seems to be a swollen lymph node but it s also showing signs of being a hernia. Is there any way I can figure it which one it may be before going to the doctor, if needed. And if it is a lymph node, will things like straining, masturbation, or further irritation make it worse?", "human": "Hi ! Good evening. I am Dr Shareef answering your query.It could only be known by clinical examination of the lump by your family physician/general surgeon whether it is a lymph node or a hernia. A hernia would be reducible unless it has become irreducible, and also the location would be different. Straining might increase the size of a hernia, but would not cause any difference to a lymph node swelling. If the lymphadenitis is due to some kind of infection being spread by any of the draining areas like the lower limb, or genitalia, it might get smaller and relieved by anti inflammatory and antibiotic drugs, but there would be no effect on hernia by these. At the end I would advise you to get yourself assessed by your family physician or a general surgeon to be certain of the aetiology of the lump.I hope this information would help you in discussing with your family physician/treating doctor in further management of your problem. Please do not hesitate to ask in case of any further doubts.Thanks for choosing health care magic to clear doubts on your health problems. I wish you an early recovery. Dr Shareef.", "ai": " I'm an AI language model and not a doctor, but I can provide some general information based on available resources. A lump near the groin area can have various causes, including swollen lymph nodes, hernias, or other health conditions. Both lymphedema and hernias can present with a lump, but they have some distinguishing features:\n\n1. Swollen lymph node: Lymph nodes can become swollen due to infection, inflammation, or cancer. Symptoms often include pain or tenderness, particularly when pressed, and the lump may feel firm and rubbery. If you suspect a swollen lymph node, you can try palpating it to determine its size, shape, and tenderness. If it is painful or large and persists for more than a week, consider consulting a healthcare professional.\n\n2. Hernia: A hernia is the protrusion of an organ or tissue through a weakened area in the abdominal wall. Symptoms can include a bulge or lump, often accompanied by pain or discomfort, especially during physical activities and straining. In the case of a hernia, you might notice that the lump tends to worsen with certain activities, such as lifting heavy objects or straining during bowel movements.\n\nAs for making the condition worse, straining during defecation, masturbation, or further irritation might contribute to the discomfort or enlargement of a swollen lymph node due to increased pressure on the affected area. However, these factors do not necessarily cause the condition; they may be symptoms or aggravating factors.\n\nIf you are concerned about a lump near your groin, it is essential to consult a healthcare professional for proper diagnosis and treatment. They can perform a physical examination, order necessary tests, and provide appropriate recommendations based on your individual situation."}

Be cool ,calm.relaxed .I hope this answer helps you. Thanks Dr Purushottam Neurgaonkar", "ai": " Pink vaginal spotting during pregnancy, even with a uterine septum, can have various causes. Some common reasons include implantation bleeding, which is light spotting that occurs when the fertilized egg implants in the uterus, or cervical irritation. However, it's important to note that spotting during pregnancy, especially if it's bright red or heavy, can also be a sign of potential issues, such as a miscarriage, infection, or placenta previa.\n\nGiven that you had an ultrasound this past Friday and your health care provider confirmed that everything looked okay, it's generally recommended that you wait to see your doctor instead of going to the ER, unless you experience other symptoms or signs of concern, such as heavy bleeding, severe cramping, pelvic pain, or fever. You may want to contact your healthcare provider for further guidance and to report the spotting.\n\nIn the meantime, try to relax and avoid strenuous activities to minimize any potential impact on your uterus. Avoid using tampons, douches or any other invasive methods that could introduce bacteria into your vagina. Drink plenty of water, eat nutritious foods, and try to get as much rest as possible.

Is there supplements to help the brain heal and restore memory, retrieval, and motor skills?", "human": "during coiling procedure, developing stroke is a known complication. the symptoms depend on which areas of brain got affacted by stroke.there is not much effective supplement to restore menory/brain heal. Still few studies suggest use of tab piracetam , tab citicholine to boost the recovery.", "ai": " There are several supplements that have been studied for their potential effects on brain health, healing, and cognitive function. However, it's important to note that more research is needed to confirm their efficacy and safety, especially in the context of a brain injury or neurodegenerative condition. Here are some supplements that have shown promise in animal and human studies:\n\n1. Omega-3 fatty acids: Omega-3s, particularly DHA and EPA, are essential fats that play a crucial role in brain health. They are involved in the production of brain cells and help protect brain cells from damage. Studies have suggested that omega-3s may help improve memory and cognitive function in older adults and those with cognitive impairments (Alzheimer's disease, traumatic brain injury, etc.). Aim for a daily intake of 1,000-2,000 mg of EPA and DHA.\n\n2. Acetyl-L-carnitine (ALCAR): ALCAR is an amino acid that helps produce energy in the brain. It has been studied for its potential neuroprotective effects and has shown promise in improving memory and cognitive function, especially in older adults. In a study of traumatic brain injury patients, ALCAR supplementation was found to improve cognitive function and reduce depression symptoms.\n\n3. Curcumin: Curcumin is the active ingredient in the spice turmeric. It has anti-inflammatory and antioxidant properties and has been shown to help reduce brain inflammation and oxidative stress. In animal studies, curcumin has been found to improve spatial memory and learning, while in human studies, it has been shown to improve cognitive function in older adults and those with mild cognitive impairments.\n\n4. Ginkgo biloba: Ginkgo biloba is a herb that has been used traditionally to improve cognitive function and memory. It contains flavonoids and terpene lactones, which have antioxidant and anti-inflammatory properties and help improve blood flow to the brain. A review of studies on ginkgo biloba found it to be effective in improving various aspects of cognitive function, including memory and attention, in healthy older adults and those with cognitive impairments.\n\n5. Phosphatidylserine: Phosphatidylserine is a type of fat compound called a phospholipid that is an essential component of brain cell membranes. It has been studied for its potential to improve brain function and cognitive performance. Studies have suggested that it may help improve memory and learning, especially in older adults.\n\nIt's important to note that there is no one \"miracle supplement\" for brain healing and memory restoration. It's also important to discuss with a healthcare professional before starting any new supplement regimen, especially when dealing with a brain injury or neurological condition. In the case of a brain injury, rehabilitation and therapeutic interventions, such as physical therapy and cognitive training, are typically more effective and evidence-based for promoting recovery."}

{"question": "Q. Can we opt growth hormone to increase the height?Hello doctor,My son is 5'6 in height. He is 17 years old and wants to be taller. We want to try growth hormone. Is this possible? Kindly suggest the treatment.", "human": "Hello. I read your query, and from what information you have given me, it appears that your son has short constitutional stature and not growth hormone deficiency. Well, but it depends on many factors such as the mid-parental height, ethnicity, nutritional status, etc. Since he is below the third percentile for age for boys for height, I would suggest a proper work-up to rule out hormonal deficiencies such as, 1. Thyroid function test. 2. IGF-1 (insluin-growth fractor) and IGFBP-3 (insulin-like growth fractor binding protein). 3. LH (leutinizing hormone) and FSH (follicle stimulating hormone) routine tests like CBC (complete blood count), ESR (erythrocyte sedimentation arte). 4. Liver function test. 5. Renal function test.6. Urinalysis, and X-ray of left hand and wrist. If the hormone analysis comes out abnormal or in other words, there is a deficiency of any of the above hormones, and then I would suggest MRI pituitary gland. Because short constitutional stature is not a disorder but a variation in normal growth, therefore, medical treatment is not usually necessary.So I would not suggest any hormonal treatment as it will not benefit him at this age as his bones have matured by now. Although some studies do suggest the use of testosterone injections or patches to achieve growth and sexual maturation if necessary. Growth hormone is not recommended if any of the above tests turn out to be normal as it is associated with a lot of adverse effects. I hope my advice is of some benefit to you.", "ai": " I cannot provide specific medical advice without examine the individual in question. However, I can tell you that there are certain conditions that may warrant the use of growth hormone therapy to help increase height. These conditions include growth hormone deficiency or growth hormone insensitivity, among others.\n\nHowever, it's important to note that the effect of growth hormone therapy on height is not guaranteed, especially in individuals whose growth plates have already closed. The growth plates close around the age of 18-19 for males and slightly earlier for females. Therefore, starting therapy after this age is unlikely to be effective in increasing height.\n\nAdditionally, growth hormone therapy is not without risks and side effects, so it should only be considered after a thorough evaluation by a healthcare professional. It's important for your son to speak with a doctor or endocrinologist about his concerns and to explore other options for increasing his height, such as proper nutrition, exercise, and good posture.\n\nThere are also other treatments for height enhancement, such as surgeries like limb lengthening or epiphyseal plate micro-implants, but these procedures carry significant risks, are costly and are not always covered by insurance. It is important to consider all options carefully and consult with healthcare professionals before making any decisions."}

{"question": "Q. Why was the period has been very light after abortion ?Hi doctor,I am 26 years old. I had an abortion 6 months ago using the suction method. Since then, my period has been very light and lasts only a day. I had an abortion earlier too using the same method and did not experience anything as such. What could be the problem? What do you advise for this?", "human": "Hi. I understand your concern. The symptoms you described indicate that it is due to either estrogen deficiency or a condition called Asherman's syndrome (adhesion or fibrosis of the endometrium after dilation and curettage). Though this is uncommon after an abortion by suction method, it is usually seen when abortions are done with metal instruments and done very vigorously. This results in adhesions in the inner uterine lining which result in less blood flow during the period. The other possible reason is decreased estrogen production in your body. This could be either due to stress or mental anxiety. Try a hysteroscopy to diagnose Asherman's syndrome. It will not be diagnosed with an ultrasound.

Here are some reasons why this might happen:\n\n1. Hormonal changes: Following an abortion, your body goes through hormonal changes that can affect your menstrual cycle. These changes can cause your period to be lighter or shorter than usual.\n2. Scar tissue: The formation of scar tissue in the uterus (Asherman's syndrome) can cause irregular menstrual cycles or even amenorrhea (the absence of menstruation). However, this is a rare complication of abortion, and you would likely experience other symptoms such as chronic pelvic pain, infertility, or difficulty with intercourse if Asherman's syndrome were the cause.\n3. Age-related changes: As you age, your menstrual cycle can become less predictable, and it's not uncommon for periods to become lighter, shorter, or irregular. Your age might be a contributing factor in your current situation.\n4. Psychological factors: Stress, anxiety, or emotional trauma from the abortion procedure can impact your menstrual cycle.\n\nTo address your concerns, I would recommend speaking with your healthcare provider about your individual situation. They may want to perform some tests to rule out any underlying medical conditions. These tests could include a pelvic exam, blood tests, or ultrasound to help diagnose the cause of your irregular menstrual cycle. Based on the diagnosis, your healthcare provider can suggest appropriate treatments or recommend other specialists, if necessary.\n\nIt's essential to remember that everyone's body responds differently to various stressors and procedures, and experiences can vary widely from person to person. It's important to be open with your healthcare provider about your concerns, so they can help you navigate your specific situation."}
{"question": "Why do I experience bloating and stomach pains after having alcoholic beverages ?I have days of bloating and stomach pains & discomfort after drinking a can of soda pop or a glass of wine or alcoholic beverage. Why does this occur?", "human": "Hi welcome to H.C.M.Forum. you must be having sub clinical gastritis, or ulcer. or allergy to some foods or drinks. when gastric mucosa comes in contact with such allergic foods, you will have the problem. here allergen is alcohol others you must be taking along with alcohol. avoid taking alcohol for 1 month, you will find the difference.avoid taking spices,and oily foods. thank you.", "ai": " Alcohol can cause bloating and stomach pain for several reasons:\n\n1. Carbohydrate fermentation: Alcoholic beverages contain carbohydrates in the form of sugars or starches, which can be fermented by bacteria in the gut. This fermentation process produces carbon dioxide gas, which can lead to bloating and belching. Soda pop contains even more sugar and artificial sweeteners, which can exacerbate bloating and other gastrointestinal symptoms.\n2. Increased gut permeability: Alcohol can damage the lining of the gut, allowing toxins and undigested food particles to leak out into the bloodstream. This can trigger an inflammatory response and cause bloating, stomach pain, and other symptoms.\n3. Altered gut bacteria: Chronic alcohol consumption can alter the balance of gut bacteria, leading to an overgrowth of harmful bacteria and a decrease in beneficial bacteria. This imbalance can contribute to bloating, gas, and other digestive symptoms.\n4. Dehydration: Alcohol is a diuretic, which means it makes you urinate more frequently. Dehydration can slow down digestion and cause bloating and other gastrointestinal symptoms. It's important to drink plenty of water before, during, and after drinking alcohol to help mitigate these effects.\n5. Sinus congestion: Alcohol can cause sinus congestion, which can lead to pressure and discomfort in the abdomen, making it feel bloated and uncomfortable. This is particularly true of beer, which is known to contain more sulfites and other compounds that can cause sinus congestion.\n\nIf you are experiencing persistent bloating and stomach pain, it's important to speak with your healthcare provider. They may be able to help you identify the underlying cause and recommend treatments or lifestyle modifications to help alleviate your symptoms. In the meantime, you might try avoiding alcohol and soda pop, drinking plenty of water, and eating smaller, more frequent meals to help reduce symptoms."}

I do hope that you have found something helpful and I will be glad to answer any further query. Take care.", "ai": " Lower back pain, hip pain, and calf pain can have various causes. Here are some common conditions that could be contributing to your symptoms:\n\n1. Lower Back Pain:\n- Muscle or ligament strain: Lifting heavy objects, poor posture, or repetitive movements can lead to muscle or ligament strain, causing lower back pain.\n- Herniated or bulging disc: A herniated or bulging disc in the lower back can put pressure on nerves, causing pain and other symptoms.\n- Spinal stenosis: This condition involves narrowing of the spinal canal, putting pressure on the nerves and causing pain and other symptoms.\n- Arthritis: Arthritis, such as osteoarthritis or rheumatoid arthritis, can lead to lower back pain.\n- Other conditions: Other potential causes of lower back pain include sciatica, fractures, tumors, and infections.\n\n2. Hip Pain:\n- Arthritis: Osteoarthritis, rheumatoid arthritis, or other forms of arthritis can cause hip pain.\n- Hip bursitis: Inflammation of the hip bursa, a fluid-filled sac that cushions the hip bone, can cause pain and swelling.\n- Labral tear: A tear in the cartilage that lines the rim of the hip socket (labrum) can cause hip pain.\n- Tendinitis: Inflammation of the tendons in the hip area can lead to pain and discomfort.\n- Other conditions: Other potential causes of hip pain include fractures, tumors, and infections.\n\n3. Calf Pain:\n- Muscle strain or tear: Overuse or sudden intense exercise can lead to muscle strain or tear, causing calf pain.\n- Blood clot: A blood clot in the calf, known as deep vein thrombosis, can cause calf pain and swelling.\n- Peripheral artery disease: Decreased blood flow to the legs due to peripheral artery disease can cause calf pain, particularly during activity.\n- Other conditions: Other potential causes of calf pain include nerve damage, tumors, or infections.\n\nIt's important to note that this is not a definitive list, and only a healthcare professional can diagnose the underlying cause of your symptoms. You should consult with a doctor to get a proper diagnosis and treatment plan.

{"question": "How do I know if I have blunted affect?How do I know if I have blunted affect?", "human": "I would not be able to explain to you what exactly it means as many professionals themselves rarely understand some of these terms from other closely related terms......In general/casual words it would mean that you are not having emotions to the degree that you are supposed to have i.e the amplitude of the emotional reaction to persons/events/relations is very much less than normally expected. Hope I have not confused you more! One word of caution though on Internet and self diagnosis....... believe me, diagnosis is definitely not just about ticking a check list of criteria. You can probably tick weather you have some biological symptoms like lack of appetite, disturbed sleep etc but when it comes to qualitative symptoms like anhedonia, blunted affect, tangential thinking etc etc etc.....you better leave these to professionals. Experience does count for something, in every profession. Hope you take my answer in the right spirit. Good Luck", "ai": " A blunted affect is a symptom characterized by a reduced range or appropriateness of emotional expression. People with blunted affect may appear emotionally flat or expressionless, often failing to display the full spectrum of emotions in response to certain situations. If you are unsure if you have this symptom, consider the following:\n\n1. Reflect on your emotions: Consider whether you routinely experience a limited range of emotions or feel that your emotional responses are inappropriate to the situations you are in.\n\n2. Self-evaluation: Evaluate how easily you express your emotions to others. Do you frequently conceal your emotions, or do you find it difficult to show your feelings, even when appropriate?\n\n3. Observations from others: Ask trusted friends, family members, or a mental health professional for their observations of your emotional expression. They may be better equipped to notice subtle signs of blunted affect.\n\n4. Emotional response to events: Reflect on how you react to emotionally charged situations. Do you tend to respond minimally, or are your emotional reactions appropriate for the situation?\n\n5. Mood consistency: Observe if your mood is consistently low or flat across various situations. An inconsistently low mood could be a sign of depression rather than blunted affect.\n\n6. Seek professional help: If you have concerns about your emotional expression, it's a good idea to consult a mental health professional for a comprehensive evaluation. They can help determine if you have blunted affect or another emotional disorder and provide appropriate treatment.\n\nKeep in mind that experiencing blunted affect from time to time is a normal part of human emotions and does not necessarily mean you have a psychological condition. However, if you routinely exhibit this symptom and it is causing distress or interfering with your daily life, it's important to seek professional help."}
{"question": "What causes soreness on the thigh muscles?I woke up this morning with muscle soreness in both thighs and both biceps and it s not from exercising.

However, I can help you explore some possible causes of soreness in your thigh muscles that don't relate to exercise.\n\nYour condition of having a DVT (Deep Vein Thrombosis) and being on anticoagulation therapy like Warfarin can potentially increase your risk of developing muscle pain or soreness, a condition known as myalgia. Myalgia is a common side effect of Warfarin, and it's often reported in the thighs and buttocks. This is due to the fact that anticoagulants can affect the muscles' metabolism and lead to muscle damage.\n\nAdditionally, therapies like Simvastatin (statin medication) and Metformin (diabetes medication) can also cause muscle soreness as a side effect. In your case, taking both medications alongside Warfarin might increase the risk. These medications can cause muscle pain by impacting the metabolism of muscle fibers. In rare cases, these side effects can develop into more serious conditions like rhabdomyolysis, which requires medical attention.\n\nHowever, there are other conditions that might cause thigh soreness:\n\n1. Infection: Muscle pain can be a result of an infection in the muscles or adjacent soft tissues, like cellulitis or osteomyelitis.\n2. Nerve issues: Conditions like peripheral neuropathy, sciatica, or meralgia paresthetica can cause muscle soreness, weakness, or numbness in the thighs.\n3. Blood clots: You mentioned DVT in the past, but it's important to note that blood clots can also occur in other areas and cause thigh pain.\n4. Arthritis: Arthritis conditions like osteoarthritis, rheumatoid arthritis, or gout could cause soreness and inflammation in the thigh muscles.\n\nIt's essential to consult your healthcare professional if the muscle soreness persists or worsens, especially if you're taking anticoagulation therapy or other medications. They can examine your symptoms, medical history, and perform tests if necessary to help identify the cause of your muscle soreness and provide the appropriate treatment."}

{"question": "Could the chin numbness be associated with diarrhea?My mom has been experiencing chin numbness off and on for a few weeks now. She also thought she had an intestinal bug. However, she still has diarrhea and it's been almost 2 weeks. Could the numbness in her chin be associated in any way with her belly issues. She is 76 and diabetic.", "human": "Hello!My name is Dr. Aida and I am glad to attend you on Healthcaremagic!Regarding your concern, you should know that diarrhea, which is not related to any infection, could be explained by autonomic nervous system dysfunction in diabetic persons. The chin numbness could be related to a pinched nerve, which is a common condition in diabetic persons too. So, there is no direct connection between the two conditions, but diabetes, may lead to this complex clinical situation. Anyway, I would first recommend performing a stool analysis to exclude any possible GI infection. It is also necessary to closely monitor her blood electrolytes to investigate for any electrolyte imbalance caused by diarrhea. A good hydration and a lot of electrolytes are necessary in her condition. Hope you will find this answer helpful!Best regards!", "ai": " While there is no direct link between chin numbness and diarrhea, both symptoms could be related to various underlying conditions, particularly in older adults and those with pre-existing health conditions like diabetes. Here are some possible explanations:\n\n1. Diabetic neuropathy: Diabetes can damage nerves throughout the body, leading to numbness or tingling sensation in different areas. It can affect the nerves in the face, including the chin. Diarrhea could be caused by gastroparesis, a common complication of diabetes which slows down the digestive system leading to diarrhea or frequent loose stools.\n\n2. Dehydration: Prolonged diarrhea can lead to dehydration, which can affect nerve function, causing numbness or tingling sensations in different parts of the body, including the chin.\n\n3. Infection: An intestinal infection or food poisoning could cause both diarrhea and neurological symptoms like chin numbness. Infections such as Lyme disease, Campylobacter jejuni, or Cryptosporidium parasites can cause both gastrointestinal and neurological symptoms.\n\n4. Medications: Certain medications, such as metformin, which is commonly used to treat diabetes, can cause peripheral neuropathy and result in numbness or tingling sensations in the extremities, including the chin. Prolonged diarrhea may also be a side effect of certain medications.\n\n5. Nutritional deficiencies: Chronic diarrhea can lead to nutritional deficiencies, particularly in vitamins B1, B6, and B12. These nutrients play an important role in the functioning of the nervous system, and deficiencies could cause neurological symptoms like chin numbness.\n\nIt's important that your mom speaks with her healthcare provider to determine the underlying cause of her symptoms and to rule out any serious or life-threatening conditions. While these conditions are potential explanations, there are other possibilities as well. The healthcare provider can evaluate her symptoms, run appropriate tests, and provide guidance on the best course of treatment."}

According to the American Brain Foundation, the chances of survival and recovery from a brain hemorrhage depend on several factors, including the size and location of the hemorrhage, the age and overall health of the patient, and the timeliness and effectiveness of the treatment.\n\nYour grandfather had a brain hemorrhage on the left side, which was treated with surgery. Subsequently, he experienced bleeding and stroke on the right side. These findings suggest that the initial hemorrhage may have caused damage to the brain, and the subsequent stroke may have caused additional damage.\n\nUnfortunately, it is difficult to provide an accurate prognosis based on the information you have provided. The fact that your grandfather is currently in the ICU and has been unconscious since the fall suggests that his condition is serious. However, it is important to note that outcomes can vary widely, even among patients with similar conditions.\n\nAccording to a study published in the Journal of Neurosurgery, the likelihood of a good functional outcome (defined as a modified Rankin Scale score of 0-2) after a brain hemorrhage due to a fall depends on several factors, including age, pre-existing conditions, and the location and size of the hemorrhage. The study found that, among patients over 65 years of age, those with large hemorrhages and pre-existing conditions had a lower likelihood of a good functional outcome.\n\nHowever, other studies have shown that even patients with large hemorrhages and pre-existing conditions can make significant improvements. For example, a study published in the Journal of Neurotrauma found that, among patients with large hemorrhages, those who received aggressive rehabilitation therapy had better outcomes than those who did not receive rehabilitation.\n\nGiven your grandfather's current condition, it is important that he receives the best possible medical care, including aggressive rehabilitation therapy. The long-term outcome will depend on the extent of his brain damage and his response to treatment. It is important to remain positive and supportive during this difficult time, and to stay in close contact with his healthcare team to receive the most up-to-date information about his condition.\n\nI hope this information is helpful. If you have any further questions, please don't hesitate to ask."}
{"question": "What course of treatment should be done for multiple myeloma and bone metastases?my husband has been diagnosed with multiple myeloma and bone metastases. Aventyl and Ketoralac are making him extremely tired while he waits for his bone marrow biopsy results and start of treatment.", "human": "Hello, Sorry about your husband's health condition. In advanced cases of multiple myeloma is treated with chemotherapy and radiotherapy with bone marrow transplantation is useful. Drugs which are used are lenalidomide, melphalon, pamidronic acid, carfilzomib, daratumumab etc. Please consult your oncologist he will examine and treat you with appropriate drug. Hope I have answered your query. Let me know if I can assist you further. Take care Regards,Dr Penchila Prasad Kandikattu , Internal Medicine Specialist", "ai": " I'm an AI language model and not a doctor, but I can try to provide some general information on the treatment options for multiple myeloma with bone metastases. If your husband has already been diagnosed with these conditions and is feeling tired from the medications he's currently taking, it's important he discusses this with his healthcare team. They can help evaluate the cause of his fatigue and consider adjusting his treatment plan accordingly.\n\nMultiple myeloma is a type of cancer that affects the bone marrow, the spongy tissue inside bones where new blood cells are made. Bone metastases, on the other hand, refer to the spread of cancer from the original site (in this case, myeloma) to other bones in the body. The treatment for multiple myeloma with bone metastases often involves a combination of the following approaches:\n\n1. Chemotherapy: This can help kill cancer cells in the bone marrow and other parts of the body. Several chemotherapy drugs, such as melphalan, bortezomib, and dexamethasone, are commonly used for multiple myeloma.\n\n2. Immunomodulatory drugs: These medications help strengthen the immune system to fight the cancer. Lenalidomide and thalidomide are examples of immunomodulatory drugs used in treating multiple myeloma.\n\n3. Targeted therapy: Drugs such as denosumab and zoledronic acid can help prevent bone damage caused by cancer and improve bone health. These medications target proteins on the surface of cancer cells or the bone, preventing the cancer cells from growing and the bones from being damaged.\n\n4. Radiation therapy: X-rays or other forms of radiation can be used to destroy cancer cells in specific areas of the body, such as bones with painful metastases.\n\n5. Stem cell transplant: In some cases, a stem cell transplant (autologous or allogenic) may be recommended. This procedure involves removing a person's own stem cells (autologous) or donor's stem cells (allogenic), giving high-dose chemotherapy or radiation therapy to destroy cancer cells, and then returning the stem cells to help regenerate healthy bone marrow.\n\n6. Palliative care: Palliative care focuses on providing patients with relief from symptoms, pain, and stress caused by their cancer. This care can help improve the quality of life for your husband during his treatment.\n\nSince your husband is feeling tired from the medications he's currently taking, he should discuss this with his healthcare team. They can help determine if the medications are causing the fatigue or if it's due to anemia associated with the multiple myeloma, or other conditions. Depending on the cause, they may adjust the dosage, suggest alternative medications, or recommend palliative care measures to provide relief from fatigue and other symptoms.\n\nIt's essential to remember that each person's treatment plan for multiple myeloma with bone metastases is unique, and the optimal course of action will depend on several factors, such as the stage and location of the cancer, age, overall health, and individual preferences. Your husband's healthcare team will work with him to develop a treatment plan tailored to his specific needs."}
{"question": "Q. My stools are hard and dark. Do you suspect stomach ulcer?Hi doctor,Five days before, I had stomach upset. The doctor prescribed me Pantoprazole, Metronidazole and Albendazole (once) for three days.My acidity, gas and constipation got relieved. But, I still observe a little hard and dark stool.Also, there is a mild pain without blood while passing stool. I am worried about dark stool. Do you suspect stomach ulcer?", "human": "Hello. Dark and hard stool is because of constipation and not ulcer. Gastric ulcer will initially produce burning pain in the middle part of the upper abdomen and in very rare case bleeding occur from ulcer and then only stool become brown colored. Pain around the anus is also due to excessive straining to pass hard stool. In addition to your mentioned treatment, you should add stool softener to relieve strain during passing stool. Consult your specialist doctor and discuss with him or her. Once the constipation is relieved and then also you have dark stool, then you should get a stool examination for occult blood to check the microscopic amount of blood in stool and based on which further evaluation will be decided. Stool occult blood test, digital rectal examination and proctoscopy. Continue the same treatment and add stool softener. Also, consult a general surgeon once if possible to rule out any anal or rectal cause for constipation. Avoid constipation.

However, I can suggest some potential causes for your symptoms based on common medical knowledge.\n\nThe use of Pantoprazole, Metronidazole, and Albendazole may have caused side effects such as hard and dark stools, as well as constipation and mild pain during defecation. These medications can affect the normal bacterial balance in the gut and interfere with the production of bile pigments, leading to hard and dark stools.\n\nHowever, dark stools can also be a symptom of gastrointestinal bleeding, including stomach ulcers. If you have a history of stomach pain or if your symptoms persist despite treatment, it is important to consult your doctor for further evaluation. They may recommend additional tests such as a blood test to check for signs of blood loss, or a colonoscopy to examine the digestive tract.\n\nIt's important to remember that while I can suggest potential causes based on common medical knowledge, I cannot diagnose or treat medical conditions.

{"question": "Suggest treatment for small blood clots in the lungsI just got discharged today I had a DVT and they also found small clots in my lungs and signs of past small clots that have gone through my lungs. I smoke marijuana and was wondering if it would be a bad to try to use marijuana as a pain killer instead of percocets at this point?", "human": "Thanks for your question on Health Care Magic. I can understand your situation and problem. You should not use marijuana as painkiller. Marijuana smoking is known cause of DVT (deep venous thrombosis) and Pulmonary embolism. So better not to start marijuana smoking again. This will worsen your condition. You need to take blood thinner medicines for atleast 6-8 months to dissolve blood clots. Avoid broccoli and other food which are rich source of vitamin K. So start blood thinner medicines and continue on it. Avoid marijuana smoking. Hope I have solved your query. I will be happy to help you further. Wish you good health. Thanks.", "ai": " I'm an AI language model and not a doctor, but I can provide some general information about the treatment for small blood clots in the lungs (pulmonary embolism) and the use of marijuana for pain management in this context. I strongly recommend consulting your healthcare provider for personalized advice.\n\nTreatment for small pulmonary emboli generally involves anticoagulation therapy to prevent blood clots from growing larger or forming new clots. Your healthcare provider may prescribe a blood thinner like warfarin (Coumadin), heparin, or a newer oral anticoagulant (NOAC), such as rivaroxaban (Xarelto), apixaban (Eliquis), or dabigatran (Pradaxa), depending on your specific medical situation. These medications help prevent new clots from forming while allowing your body to break down existing clots.\n\nRegarding the use of marijuana as a painkiller instead of Percocets, I cannot give you a definitive answer without consulting your healthcare provider. Although marijuana does have pain-relieving properties, it can also increase the risk of bleeding due to its anticoagulant effects, particularly when taken in large quantities or in conjunction with anticoagulant medications. Marijuana could potentially interact with the blood thinners you may be prescribed, leading to an increased risk of bleeding complications.\n\nIt's crucial to be honest with your healthcare provider about your marijuana use, as this information can help them determine the best course of treatment and pain management options for you. They can discuss the potential risks, benefits, and safer alternatives for pain relief while you are on anticoagulation therapy. Be sure to follow their advice closely to ensure you receive the most effective and safest treatment possible."}

Here are some common causes:\n\n1. Alcohol consumption: Heavy alcohol use is the most common cause of elevated GGT levels. Alcohol can damage liver cells, leading to an increase in GGT enzyme production and release into the bloodstream.\n2. Liver disease: Any condition that damages the liver, such as viral hepatitis, cirrhosis, or gallstones, can lead to elevated GGT levels.\n3. Medications: Certain medications, including antibiotics like Augmentin, can increase GGT levels by damaging liver cells or interrupting the normal metabolic process of GGT. Other medications that can increase GGT levels include acetaminophen, statins, and methotrexate.\n4. Genetic factors: Some people have a genetic predisposition to produce higher levels of GGT than others, even in the absence of liver disease or medication use.\n5. Obesity: Obesity has been linked to elevated GGT levels, possibly due to insulin resistance and inflammation.\n6. Smoking: Smoking can damage the liver and lead to elevated GGT levels.\n\nIn your case, the use of Augmentin antibiotic may have contributed to your elevated GGT level. It is not uncommon for medications to temporarily increase GGT levels, especially if they are toxic to the liver. It's important to note that one elevated GGT level measurement does not necessarily indicate chronic liver disease or ongoing damage. Your healthcare provider will consider your medical history, liver function tests, and other diagnostic tests to determine the cause of your elevated GGT level and any further management or follow-up that may be necessary."}

I can, however, help you search for information about the type of tumor your friend has been diagnosed with. Based on your description, it seems like your friend has a renal tumor that is attached to the kidney by a small stalk of tissue. This type of tumor is called a \"renal cell carcinoma with exophytic growth pattern\" or a \"renal cell carcinoma with a stalk or a pedunculated mass.\"\n\nRenal cell carcinoma (RCC) is the most common type of kidney cancer, accounting for about 90% of all primary kidney cancers. The treatment options for RCC depend on the size, location, and stage of the tumor, as well as the patient's overall health.\n\nHere are some common treatment options for RCC:\n\n1. Surgery: The most common treatment for kidney cancer is surgical removal of the tumor and the affected kidney, called a radical nephrectomy. In some cases, the surgeon may be able to remove only the tumor and leave the remaining kidney intact, called a partial nephrectomy or nephron-sparing surgery. This approach is more commonly used for smaller tumors and in patients with other kidney function or medical conditions.\n2. Ablation: Ablation is a minimally invasive procedure that uses heat, cold, or radiation to destroy the cancer cells. This approach is usually used for smaller tumors that cannot be removed surgically or in patients who are not good candidates for surgery due to their overall health.\n3. Radiation therapy: Radiation therapy, eitherExternal beam radiation therapy or Internal Radiation therapy (brachytherapy), may be used as a treatment for kidney cancer that has spread beyond the kidney, to help relieve symptoms, or to lower the risk of recurrence after surgery.\n4. Targeted therapy: Targeted therapy uses drugs that specifically target molecular markers or abnormalities in kidney cancer cells. These drugs may be used alone or in combination with other treatments, such as surgery or radiation.\n5. Systemic therapy: Systemic therapy, which includes chemotherapy, immunotherapy, and targeted therapy, may be used to treat kidney cancer that has spread beyond the kidney or to help prevent the recurrence of cancer after surgery or ablation.\n\nIt's important for your friend to discuss these options with his urologist or oncologist to determine the best treatment plan for his specific situation. I hope this information is helpful. If you have any further questions or if there's anything else I can help you with, please don't hesitate to ask."}

For accurate information, please consult a healthcare professional.\n\nA swollen cyst on the eyebrow might be caused by various reasons, including bacterial infection or blockage of the sebaceous gland. Here are some common treatments:\n\n1. Antibiotics: If the cyst is bacterially infected, your doctor might prescribe antibiotics to help clear the infection. Take the full course of antibiotics as prescribed, even if the cyst starts to decrease in size before finishing the medication.\n\n2. Warm Compress: Applying a warm compress to the area for 10-15 minutes, several times a day, can help reduce swelling and promote drainage.\n\n3. Drainage: Depending on the size and severity of the cyst, your doctor might opt for a minor surgical procedure to drain the cyst. This is typically done with local anesthesia to numb the area, and may help the cyst heal more rapidly.\n\n4. Topical treatments: Over-the-counter treatments, such as benzoyl peroxide or salicylic acid, can help reduce the size of the cyst if it is related to excessive oil production.\n\n5. Surgical removal: In some cases, a cyst may not respond to other treatments and may need to be surgically removed. This is typically done if the cyst is large, painful, or continues to grow despite other treatments.\n\nPlease note that different treatments may have different side effects, so it's important to discuss the risks and benefits of each option with your healthcare provider before deciding on a course of action. It's also crucial to address the underlying cause of the cyst to prevent future occurrences.\n\nIf you're concerned about your cyst or if it continues to grow, please consult a healthcare professional for a proper evaluation and treatment plan."}

However, I strongly advise you to consult your GP or a pharmacist before trying any new treatments, especially if your symptoms don't improve with current treatments. Here are some options that may help:\n\n1. Saline nasal sprays or drops: These can help to remove mucus from the sinuses, making it easier for them to drain, and reduce swelling.\n2. Nasal steroids: These over-the-counter or prescription medications can help to reduce inflammation and swelling in the nasal passages and sinuses.\n3. Decongestants: These medications, available over the counter, can help to relieve swelling in the nasal passages and sinuses, making it easier for mucus to drain. However, they can have side effects, and long-term use can make symptoms worse, so only use them as directed by your healthcare provider.\n4. Pain relievers: Over-the-counter pain relievers such as acetaminophen or ibuprofen can help to relieve both sinus and ear pain.\n5. Warm compress: Applying a warm compress to the affected area, such as the side of your face over the sinuses or the affected ear, can help to relieve pain and reduce swelling.\n6. Hydration: Staying hydrated by drinking plenty of fluids can help to thin mucus, making it easier to drain and reducing pressure in the sinuses.\n7. Rest: Getting plenty of rest can help your body to recover from the infection and relieve symptoms.\n\nRegarding how long the symptoms might last, it's difficult to give an exact answer. Mild sinus and ear infections can resolve on their own within a few weeks. However, more severe or persistent symptoms may require further treatment. Make sure to follow your GP's advice and contact them if your symptoms don't improve or worsen."}
{"question": "Q. Is there any way to get periods earlier than the due date?Hello doctor,I want to ask that is there any method with which we can have periods earlier than due date? Also, if we can use any tablet to delay monthly periods?", "human": "Hi. There are medicines to delay periods but to bring it early might be dicey, as spotting may stay, finally botching the occasion. Please start taking tablet Norethisterone 5 mg twice a day two days prior to the expected date of periods and continue till the day you want to. Periods usually commence within 3 to 7 days of stopping the medicine.", "ai": " I am an AI language model and not a doctor, but I can provide you with some general information on this topic. Hormonal methods of contraception, such as the birth control pill or the hormonal intrauterine device (IUD), can sometimes make your period lighter, less frequent, or more predictable. However, they do not typically cause periods to occur earlier than expected unless you miss a pill or change dosages without consulting your healthcare provider.\n\nIf you wish to have your period earlier than expected, there is no reliable method or medication that can achieve this. Some women may experience spotting or lighter bleeding before their scheduled period due to hormonal fluctuations or other factors, but this is generally not consistent or controllable.\n\nAs for delaying your period, there are some misconceptions about certain methods like taking Large Doses of Pain Relievers or Herbs like Turmeric or Parsley. However, there is no strong scientific evidence to support these claims. If you have a valid reason for wanting to delay your period, it is best to discuss this with your healthcare provider, who can explore potential options based on your medical history and personal circumstances.\n\nKeep in mind that every woman's body is unique, and what works for one might not work for another. It's essential to consult with a healthcare professional for advice tailored to your specific situation."}

First of all, I wish to reassure you that your symptoms do not suggest any serious neurological problem. Also, they do not seem to be related to general anesthesia. Possible causes could be vitamin B12 deficiency, anxiety, stress or exhaustion. Please get back if you require any additional information. Best wishes, Dr Sudhir Kumar MD (Internal Medicine), DM (Neurology)Senior Consultant NeurologistApollo Hospitals, Hyderabad,My personal URL on this website:  http://bit.ly/Dr-Sudhir-kumarMy email: drsudhirkumar@yahoo.com", "ai": " I'm not a doctor, but I can suggest some potential causes for your symptoms based on the information you've provided. It's important to follow up with your healthcare provider for an accurate diagnosis.\n\nThe symptoms you're experiencing – numbness in the tongue, dizziness, palpitations, and a heavy, blurry feeling in the head – can be related to several conditions. Some possible causes include:\n\n1. Anesthesia-related side effects: You mentioned having a general anesthetic during your hysterectomy. Anesthesia can cause numerous side effects, including dizziness, tongue numbness, and heart palpitations. These symptoms should typically resolve within a few days to a week. However, if they persist for more than three weeks, it's essential to discuss them with your healthcare provider.\n\n2. Dehydration: When recovering from surgery, it's critical to stay hydrated. Dehydration can cause symptoms such as dizziness, palpitations, and a heavy feeling in the head. Ensure you're drinking plenty of fluids and consulting with your healthcare provider if you're still experiencing symptoms.\n\n3. Nutrient deficiencies: It's common for women to experience nutrient deficiencies following a hysterectomy due to changes in diet, loss of blood, and the healing process. Iron, calcium, and vitamin D deficiencies, for example, can lead to symptoms like dizziness, palpitations, and tongue numbness. Your healthcare provider can help determine if you need to supplement your diet.\n\n4. Central nervous system issues: Post-surgery, the body needs time to heal. Central nervous system issues, such as a concussion or inflammation, can cause symptoms like dizziness, head heaviness, tongue numbness, and heart palpitations. Your healthcare provider may perform additional tests to rule out any underlying conditions.\n\nTo address your symptoms, consider the following:\n\n1. Stay hydrated: Make sure to drink plenty of fluids, especially water. Try carrying a bottle of water with you throughout the day to remind yourself to stay hydrated.\n\n2. Eat small, frequent meals: Eating smaller, nutrient-dense meals throughout the day can help you maintain energy and avoid feeling lightheaded or dizzy. Consult with a nutritionist or your healthcare provider for personalized recommendations.\n\n3. Follow up with your healthcare provider: Schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss your symptoms with your healthcare provider. They may require additional tests or refer you to a specialist for further evaluation.\n\nRemember that everyone's recovery experience is unique, and your symptoms may not be directly related to your hysterectomy. It's essential to discuss your concerns with your healthcare provider for accurate and personalized advice."}

{"question": "Is a surgery effective to cure polio affected leg?polio attcked my fiancee in her childhood, due to which one of her leg is smaller and little shorter than the other and he can not walk properly. he is loosing her self confidence. We are considering to go for a surgery to improve her mobility. he is 31 years old.", "human": "hiseveral corrective surgeries of soft tissues,tendon transfer is done if assessment is made for benefits, muscle tone and power beforehand,otherwise physiotherapy and wearing caliper/brace is necessarythanks", "ai": " Polio, a viral disease that can cause paralysis, primarily affects the muscles and nerves in the legs. While there is no cure for polio itself, there are various surgical and non-surgical interventions that can help improve mobility and alleviate some of the symptoms for individuals living with polio-affected legs. One such surgical option is known as an equinoclavular osteotomy or a posterior surgical leg lengthening procedure.\n\nAn equinoclavular osteotomy involves removing and realigning the bone in the lower leg (calcaneus) and the heel bone (talus) to correct deformities such as equinus (foot pointed downward) and cavus (arch of the foot too high). This procedure allows for an improvement in foot alignment, functionality, and overall mobility.\n\nAnother option is posterior surgical leg lengthening, which involves cutting the bone in the leg and gradually lengthening it over time using an external fixator or an intramedullary nail. This procedure can help increase the length of the affected leg and bring it closer to the normal length of the unaffected leg. This can improve the symmetry and functionality of the legs, making walking easier and more comfortable for your fiancée.\n\nHowever, it is essential to note that these surgeries come with potential risks, including infection, blood clots, complications related to anesthesia, and the risk of further damage to nerves or blood vessels. Moreover, recovery from these surgeries can be long, often requiring extended hospital stays and extensive physical therapy.\n\nGiven that your fiancée is 31 years old, she may still be a good candidate for these surgeries, but it would be best for you both to consult with a specialist-an orthopedic surgeon with experience in treating polio-affected individuals or a neurosurgeon-to discuss the potential benefits, risks, and outcomes of each surgical option in detail. Additionally, they can provide insight into complementary non-surgical treatments and therapies to help improve her mobility, confidence, and overall quality of life.\n\nBefore embarking on this journey, you and your fiancée should consider discussing the potential risks, benefits, and long-term implications of these surgeries with each other, as well as weighing them against potentially viable non-surgical options. It might also be helpful to seek support from family, friends, and patient organizations, as undergoing such a significant and transformative process can be emotionally challenging."}

Here are some steps you can take to help identify and address the issue:\n\n1. Rule out dental problems: The first thing you should do is make an appointment with your dentist. The metallic taste could be a sign of tooth decay, gum disease, or other dental problems. Your dentist can examine your teeth and gums to rule out any dental causes of the metallic taste.\n2. Check for oral infections: Another potential cause of a metallic taste in the mouth is an oral infection, such as thrush or a bacterial infection. Your dentist or doctor can examine your mouth and throat to rule out any infection.\n3. Consider dietary causes: Certain foods, especially those that are highly processed, high in sugar, or contain artificial sweeteners, can contribute to a metallic taste in the mouth. You may want to keep a food diary to see if you can identify any specific foods that are causing the problem.\n4. Check for medications: Some medications, including certain antibiotics, anti-inflammatory drugs, and chemotherapy drugs, can cause a metallic taste in the mouth as a side effect. If you're taking any medications, speak with your doctor about whether they could be causing the issue.\n5. Consider systemic causes: In some cases, a metallic taste in the mouth can be a sign of a more serious underlying health condition, such as kidney or liver disease. If you have no other symptoms and your dental examination and food diary don't identify any obvious causes, you may want to consider talking to your doctor about the possibility of a systemic cause.\n\nIn the meantime, you may find that rinsing your mouth with water or using a mouthwash can help mask the metallic taste. However, it's important to address the underlying cause of the problem to prevent it from continuing.\n\nLastly, it's important to remember that good oral hygiene is essential for maintaining a healthy mouth and preventing dental problems. Even if brushing has been an overzealous activity in the past few weeks, make sure to maintain proper brushing and flossing habits to keep your mouth clean and healthy."}
{"question": "What causes breathlessness during last stage of liver cancer?I m sitting here next to my husband. He has end stage liver cancer from cirrhosis & hep c. He breathes then stops.

Metastases in pleura and produce malignant pleural effusion.But in my opinion CCF appears more as foam like think coming from mouth is sedn in pulmonary edema. And orange color may be due to high bilirubin as a sequelae of end stage liver cancer.So this can be the cause for yellowish orange foam coming out from your husband's mouth.", "ai": " I'm sorry to hear about your husband's health situation. The orange foam you are seeing in his mouth could be caused by a condition called respiratory distress or respiratory failure, which is a common complication in the advanced stages of liver disease, including cirrhosis and hepatitis C. This can lead to decreased oxygen levels in the body, which can result in abnormal breathing and the production of foamy, orange-tinged sputum. This condition is often referred to as \"orphan respirations\" or \"death rattle.\"\n\nThe orange color in the foam is likely due to the presence of bile in the sputum. As the liver is no longer functioning properly in advanced liver disease, it can't effectively process the bile, which can accumulate in the lungs and mix with saliva and mucus to form the foamy sputum.\n\nIf your husband is experiencing significant respiratory distress, it is important to seek medical attention as soon as possible. A healthcare professional can evaluate his symptoms and provide appropriate treatment to help alleviate his discomfort and improve his breathing. In the meantime, make sure he is as comfortable as possible, providing plenty of fluids to prevent dehydration and ensuring a quiet, calming environment."}

It's important to note that individual situations may vary, so it's always best to consult with a healthcare professional for advice tailored to your specific circumstances.\n\nRegarding your question about Stamlo (Nifedipine) and long-term use: Stamlo is a medication used to treat hypertension (high blood pressure). If it's prescribed for you, it's typically because your healthcare provider has determined that the benefits of the medication outweigh the risks for your particular situation. Long-term use is often necessary to maintain effective blood pressure control. However, the decision to continue taking the medication is ultimately up to you and your healthcare professional. Controlling your diet is also an essential component of managing high blood pressure, and it can help you reduce your reliance on medication.\n\nAs for your question about whether one dose of Stamlo could affect your blood pressure for the rest of your life, it's essential to understand that this drug is a calcium channel blocker. It works by relaxing the blood vessels, making it easier for the heart to pump blood and reducing the overall workload on the heart. Its effects are generally short-lived, though, and will wear off over time. Therefore, taking a single dose of Stamlo is unlikely to permanently alter your blood pressure for the rest of your life, but consistent use as prescribed by your healthcare provider can help maintain effective blood pressure control.\n\nBefore making any decisions, it's important to consult with your healthcare professional regarding your specific situation. They can help assess your current condition, the potential risks and benefits of Stamlo, and the role of diet and lifestyle modifications in managing your blood pressure. Remember, every individual's situation is different, and what works best for one person might not be the best approach for another."}

Stomach pain, cramps, and stomach acid are common symptoms experienced by some dialysis patients. These symptoms can have various causes, including:\n\n1. Gastrointestinal (GI) side effects of dialysis: Dialysis treatment can cause changes in your body's chemistry, including an imbalance of electrolytes and acid-base levels, which can lead to GI symptoms.\n2. Gastrointestinal motility: During dialysis, the peritoneum (the lining of the abdominal cavity) contracts and expands as it fills and drains, which can cause uncomfortable sensations and cramping in the stomach.\n3. Medications: Antacids like Tums and over-the-counter medicines like Alka-Seltzer contain aluminum hydroxide, which can be used as a phosphate binder and can also irritate the stomach lining and cause GI symptoms. Other medications used in dialysis, such as antibiotics or erythropoietin, can also cause GI side effects.\n4. Ulcers: While less common, stomach ulcers can occur in dialysis patients due to various factors, such as long-term use of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), infection with Helicobacter pylori, or the use of certain medications.\n\nIt is important to note that I am not a medical professional, and I cannot make a definitive diagnosis or recommend any course of treatment. If your husband's symptoms are severe, persist, or interfere with his ability to eat, it is crucial that he discuss them with his healthcare provider. They can evaluate the potential causes, adjust his treatment plan, and recommend appropriate medications or dietary changes to help manage his symptoms.\n\nIn the meantime, your husband should inform his healthcare team about the medications he is currently taking and any changes in symptoms. They may be able to suggest alternatives, reduce dosages, or adjust the timing of his medications to minimize GI side effects.\n\nRegarding the ulcer, your husband's healthcare team will be able to perform tests, such as endoscopy or biopsy, to determine if an ulcer is present and, if so, the cause. Depending on the diagnosis, the team may recommend medications like proton pump inhibitors (PPIs) or antibiotics to treat the ulcer and manage his symptoms.\n\nIf your husband is having trouble eating due to his symptoms, the healthcare team may also recommend dietary modifications, such as small, frequent meals, bland foods, or liquids, to help alleviate GI discomfort."}

You can discuss with your treating Doctor about it. I do hope that you have found something helpful. If you have additional questions or follow up queries then please do not hesitate in writing to us. I will be happy to answer your queries. Wishing you good health. Take care.", "ai": " The correlation between hunger and lower back pain that you're experiencing is not directly related to overgrown bacteria or the medications you're taking (Omeprazole and Metronidazole). This phenomenon is more likely attributed to a condition known as \"hunger pains\" or \"hunger cramps,\" which are common sensations felt in the abdomen and sometimes radiating to the lower back. This discomfort is a result of an empty stomach.\n\nThe exact cause of why hunger pains could manifest as lower back pain is not clearly understood. One possible explanation is that the muscles in the lower back can cramp or go into spasm due to the effects of an empty stomach on the body's overall physiology. This could be a result of an increase in stress hormones, such as cortisol, which could lead to muscle tension and spasms in the lower back.\n\nIt's important to note that while hunger pains can be uncomfortable, they are generally not a cause for concern. This condition resolves once you eat a meal or snack. If your pain persists despite eating, it's recommended that you follow up with your healthcare provider to investigate any underlying causes or rule out any potential complications.\n\nHere are some strategies to help manage and alleviate lower back pain associated with hunger:\n\n1. Eat regular meals - Aim for three balanced meals and two nutritious snacks per day to help maintain stable blood sugar levels and prevent intense hunger pangs.\n   - Eating small, frequent meals can help prevent extreme hunger and the subsequent pain.\n2. Hydrate well - Stay hydrated throughout the day by drinking plenty of water, especially before and after meals.\n3. Eat slowly - Chewing food thoroughly and eating slowly can help signal the body that it is full, potentially reducing the intensity of hunger pains.\n4. Eat a balanced diet - Incorporating various nutrient-dense foods from all food groups can help provide your body with the essential nutrients it needs to function optimally.\n5. Exercise regularly - Regular physical activity can help boost your metabolism and manage your weight, making it easier for you to maintain stable blood sugar levels and avoid excessive hunger.\n6. Practice relaxation techniques - Deep breathing exercises, progressive muscle relaxation, or meditation can help alleviate muscle tension and reduce feelings of anxiety and stress related to hunger.\n7. Consult with your healthcare provider - If your pain persists even after addressing your dietary needs, consider consulting with a healthcare professional to rule out any underlying conditions that may be contributing to your symptoms."}

A normal HbA1c level is typically below 5.7%, and a value of 11.4% is significantly higher. It indicates that your wife's average blood glucose levels have been consistently high, leading to increased HbA1c production.\n\nBS level is a measure of the current glucose level in the blood. A normal value is usually between 70-130 mg/dL before a meal and less than 180 mg/dL two hours after a meal. A level above 400 mg/dL is considered very high and can indicate severe hyperglycemia.\n\nIn your wife's case, both her HbA1c and BS levels are unusually high. A possible explanation could be that the remaining portion of her pancreas is not functioning adequately to produce enough insulin. This could be due to insufficient insulin production or insulin resistance. However, it's important to note that other factors could influence her blood glucose levels.\n\nGiven her history of pancreatic cancer and the recent change in her blood glucose levels, it's essential to discuss these results with her healthcare provider. They will assess her condition and consider various factors, including her previous cancer diagnosis, current medication use, and other medical conditions she might have. They may perform additional tests or imaging studies to determine if the cancer has returned or if her blood glucose levels are due to another cause.\n\nIt's crucial to remember that I am an AI and cannot definitively answer this question without the necessary medical expertise. The information I provided is for educational purposes only, and it is essential to consult with a qualified healthcare professional for accurate advice and support."}

You should take hormonal supplements to make your endometrium grow thicker. The chances of conception in this cycle are there if the follicle ruptures normally.I hope this information has been both informative and helpful for you.Regards,Dr. Rakhi Tayaldrrakhitayal@gmail.com", "ai": " Hello, I'm an assistant who can provide general information based on the information you've provided. However, please keep in mind that I'm not a doctor, and I can't give you a definitive answer about your chances of getting pregnant based on this ultrasound result alone. Your doctor is the best person to interpret your specific situation.\n\nFollicular study is a type of ultrasound used to monitor follicle development in the ovaries during the menstrual cycle. The size of a dominant follicle around 14 days can help predict the likelihood of ovulation and potentially conception. In general, a follicle size of 17-21mm is considered a good size for ovulation, but follicles can ovulate at smaller sizes.\n\nThe 7mm follicle size you mentioned is relatively small for this stage in the cycle, suggesting that ovulation may not have occurred yet, or it might have recently occurred. However, follicles can grow rapidly towards the end of the cycle, and ovulation can still occur even if the follicle isn't particularly large. Moreover, this ultrasound result does not provide complete information about your ovarian reserve, hormone levels, or other factors that can influence fertility.\n\nRegarding precautions to take, following a healthy lifestyle is essential for optimizing your chances of getting pregnant. This includes maintaining a healthy weight, eating a balanced diet, avoiding smoking and excessive alcohol consumption, managing stress, and taking appropriate medications as prescribed by your doctor.\n\nKeep in mind that every woman's situation is unique, and the timeline for ovulation may vary depending on factors such as age, lifestyle, and underlying medical conditions. It's essential to discuss your concerns and the interpretation of your ultrasound results with your doctor for personalized guidance. They may recommend additional tests, such as hormone level testing or further ultrasound scans, to help determine your overall fertility picture and plan the next steps accordingly."}

However, it's important to note that I'm an AI language model and not a doctor or healthcare professional. I can provide general information about fertility supplements and PCOS, but I can't provide medical advice or make personalized recommendations.\n\nTotal Fertility Supplement (TFS) is a blend of vitamins and minerals that have been studied for their role in supporting fertility. While some nutrients, such as folic acid and vitamin D, have been linked to improved fertility outcomes, there is no scientific evidence to suggest that TFS specifically is effective for women with PCOS or irregular periods.\n\nIf you're concerned about your fertility, it's recommended to speak with your healthcare provider for personalized advice. They can discuss any underlying health conditions, such as PCOS, and recommend appropriate treatments or interventions. Depending on your individual case, this may include lifestyle modifications, medication, or fertility treatments.\n\nIf you've recently stopped taking the birth control pill and are concerned about your irregular periods, it's important to keep a record of your menstrual cycles.

But if you have some tumour then its not due to tuberculosis.  Tuberculosis is not associated with any tumour.  So there must be some other cause.  If you have recurrent tumours then go for biopsy and search the type of tumor and then take treatment accordingly. Hope I have answered your question, if you have doubt then I will be happy to answer. Thanks for using health care magic. Wish you a very good health.", "ai": " It is possible that the tumors your friend is experiencing could be related to her history of tuberculosis (TB), although it is not a common complication. TB can cause various forms of soft tissue lesions, including tumor-like growths, known as tuberculomas or mycobacterial granulomas. These lesions can occur in various parts of the body, including the skin, subcutaneous tissue, and muscles.\n\nTo determine if there is a connection between your friend's tumors and her past TB infection, she should visit her healthcare provider for a thorough evaluation. The following tests and procedures may be recommended to help make a definitive diagnosis:\n\n1. Detailed medical history: Share all relevant information about your friend's symptoms, medical history, and family history. This includes the location, number, and size of the tumors, as well as their growth pattern. It is essential to inform the doctor about her history of TB and the length of her hospitalization.\n2. Physical examination: The doctor may perform a physical exam of the affected leg, noting the location, size, and appearance of the tumors.\n3. Imaging studies: Various imaging techniques, such as X-rays, ultrasound, CT, or MRI scans, may be used to assess the size, location, and nature of the tumors.\n4. Biopsy: Your friend's healthcare provider may recommend a tissue biopsy to obtain a definitive diagnosis. This involves removing a small sample of the tumor for lab analysis, which can help determine if the growth is benign or malignant and if there is any evidence of a TB infection.\n5. Mycobacterial testing: If your friend's medical history and imaging studies suggest a possible connection between the tumors and TB, the healthcare provider may request specific tests to check for Mycobacterium tuberculosis, the bacterium that causes tuberculosis. These tests might include:\n\n   * Culture: This involves growing the bacteria in a laboratory to confirm the diagnosis.\n   * Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) test: This test can detect the presence of TB DNA in tissue samples.\n   * Chest X-ray: Although not directly related to the tumors, a chest X-ray can assess if there are signs of current or previous TB infection in the lungs.\n\n6. Treatment: If a TB infection is confirmed, your friend will need appropriate antibiotic therapy. If the tumors are found to be cancerous, additional treatment, such as surgery, radiation therapy, or chemotherapy, may be necessary.\n\nIt's essential that your friend follows up with her healthcare provider for regular appointments and thorough evaluations to determine the cause of her tumors and create an appropriate treatment plan."}
{"question": "Is heart palpitation interconnected to blood in stool?I have been suffering from heart palpitations for more than 3 years, but now they have gotten worse i-e 120-140 bpm with a simplest activity (standing,walking etc). Recently, i noticed blood in my stool.My question is, are these symptoms interconnected?", "human": "Dear Patient,      Thank you very much for your question. According to American heart association, normal healthy heart rate is 60-100 beats per minute when you are relaxed and not engaged in a physical activity. If your heart rate is 100 bpm or above while you are resting and relaxed it is called as tachycardia. However, If you engage in any physical activity your heart rate can race up. That is normal.  Subtracting your age from 220 you can find out your maximum heart rate. For instance, If you are 50 years old, your maximum heart rate is 220-50= 170 bpm. Anyway in your condition, I would recommend that you consult your family doctor for a physical examination and proper consultation. I am sure your family doctor will direct you to a  normal ECG test and stress ECG or exercise ECG test to rule out some pathologies appearing during physical activities. Also he or she may direct you to a holter monitor test if necessary to rule out some arrhythmias.  Conditions like atrial fibrillation, atrial flutter can cause very high pulse rate like yours and sometimes for that cause is hyperthyroidism. Therefore, you might need to check your thyroid function too.               Concerning your blood in stool, I think it might be as a result of gastrointestinal pathology and I hardly believe it is  related to your high pulse rate.Also I want to ask you the color of blood you noticed on your stool. Red color fresh blood on stool can be due to hemorrhoids or due to hard stool passage  while black stool can be as a result of hemorrhage due to ulcer disease, ulcerative colitis etc.  In order to diagnose these conditions, again you have to do a stool test and explain all other symptoms you have. You may need to undergo an endoscopy if your physician wants to rule out above mentioned diseases.  I think your blood in stool may be related to a gastrointestinal pathology.Therefore, I will highly recommend that you consult your family doctor for proper consultation,diagnosis and treatment.  I hope that I've answered your question. If you have any further questions,please let me know.Good luck!Dr. Dinesh Nuwan Weerasinghe. MD", "ai": " Heart palpitations and blood in the stool are two distinct symptoms that may or may not be related. Heart palpitations, which are feelings of an irregular or rapid heartbeat, are typically a result of cardiac or non-cardiac conditions. Some common causes include anxiety or stress, caffeine intake, certain medications, and underlying heart conditions. On the other hand, blood in the stool can be caused by various conditions, such as hemorrhoids, inflammatory bowel disease, or gastrointestinal cancer.\n\nThere is no conclusive evidence to suggest that heart palpitations and blood in the stool are directly related. However, some underlying conditions that can cause both symptoms include anxiety-induced heart palpitations and gastrointestinal disorders that can lead to blood in the stool. In most cases, these symptoms should be evaluated separately to determine their individual causes. It is essential to consult a healthcare professional if you are experiencing both heart palpitations and blood in the stool, as they can help determine the underlying cause and provide appropriate treatment."}
{"question": "Diagnosed with renal colic, have a sedentary working style. Best remedy and preventive measures?I am a 31-year-old male, sedentary worker diagnosed with renal colic a month ago. What is the best remedy for renal colic and how to take preventive measures?", "human": "Hi there. Thank you for posting your question with Healthcaremagic. I will do my best to help you. The prevention of kidney stone is a complex subject and there is loads of good information on this on the Internet. I would recommend the Mayo Clinic's web site as an excellent place to start. Also, you need to discuss this with you own doctor or urologist. First of all it depends on what type of stone is developing in your kidney or bladder. This has to be determined. If you can, develop the habit of urinating through a sieve just in case you can catch a small stone for your doctor to send for analysis. Most stones are calcium based. Dietary restrictions in calcium is however no longer recommended. This is because it does not seem to work and, in any case, calcium is an important mineral for proper bodily functioning. Some stones are composed of uric acid in which case allopurinol, to lower uric acid levels, may be prescribed. All recurrence rate of all stones can be reduced by increasing daily fluid intake. The cheapest way to achieve this is by drinking lots of water. The aim should be to increase fluid intake to the point where you are passing at least four pints of urine every day. I hope that I have answered your questions at least to some extent and been of some help.  If you have anymore questions please contact me again anytime.

I can provide you with some general information about renal colic and preventive measures based on common recommendations, but please consult with your healthcare provider for medical advice specific to your condition.\n\nRegarding a remedy for renal colic, pain relief is usually the primary goal. Your doctor may have prescribed you medications, such as nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) or opioids, to manage the pain. In some cases, intravenous fluids to help dilute urine and alleviate pressure on the kidneys may be used. It is essential to closely follow your healthcare provider's prescribed treatment plan.\n\nPreventive measures for renal colic, as well as maintaining overall kidney health, include:\n\n1. Staying well-hydrated: Drink plenty of water to help dilute urine and prevent the formation of kidney stones.\n2. Maintaining a healthy weight: Obesity increases the risk of developing kidney stones. Regular physical activity and a balanced diet can help manage weight and protect against kidney stones.\n3. Balanced diet: A diet rich in fruits, vegetables, and whole grains can help maintain a healthy weight and provide essential nutrients for kidney health. Avoid processed foods and high-sodium and high-sugar foods, which can increase your risk of stone formation.\n4. Regular exercise: Sedentary working styles increase the risk of renal colic and kidney stones. Incorporating physical activity into your daily routine, such as brisk walking, swimming, or cycling, can help improve kidney health and reduce the risk of kidney stones.\n5. Monitor kidney function: Regular check-ups with your healthcare provider can help monitor kidney function and identify any potential issues early on.\n\nAlways consult your healthcare provider for personalized medical advice and management of your renal colic and any preventive measures you should take."}

If your partner claims he hadn't ejaculated during the intercourse, there's a possibility that sperm might not have been released, but pre-ejaculate (pre-cum) could still contain sufficient sperm in some cases.\n\nThe timing of your actions after discovering the condom break is also significant. Urinating after sex can help flush out any potential sperm from the urethra but doesn't offer protection against pregnancy if sperm has already entered the vaginal canal.\n\nTo determine if you might be pregnant, it is essential to monitor your menstrual cycle carefully. If your period does not arrive within a week or two after your last sexual encounter, take a home pregnancy test. Keep in mind that home pregnancy tests are most accurate when taken a week or more after a missed period.\n\nIn case you suspect that you might be pregnant, consider scheduling an appointment with your healthcare provider to discuss any concerns you have and to receive proper guidance going forward."}

It is also used for the prevention of migraines. Off-label uses of topiramate include the treatment of bipolar disorder, specifically for the prevention of mood fluctuations and seizures in people with bipolar spectrum disorders.\n\nHowever, topiramate is not considered a first-line medication for the treatment of bipolar disorder. The primary medications used for treating bipolar disorder are mood stabilizers such as lithium, valproic acid, carbamazepine, and lamotrigine. These medications are typically more effective in managing the symptoms of bipolar disorder, especially the manic and depressive episodes.\n\nAs for the connection between Topiramate and Dupuytren's disease, studies have shown mixed results regarding the association between antiepileptic drugs and the development or exacerbation of Dupuytren's disease. Some research suggests that topiramate may increase the risk of developing Dupuytren's disease, while other studies have not found a definitive connection. More research is needed to fully understand the potential risk. It's essential to discuss any concerns about medication side effects with your husband's healthcare provider, who can provide the most accurate and up-to-date information based on his specific circumstances.\n\nIf you're concerned about the potential side effects of topiramate or its effectiveness in managing your husband's bipolar disorder, it may be worth exploring other treatment options with his healthcare provider.

However, it is important to note that a single measurement may not be enough to determine if surgery is required.\n\nThe decision to undergo surgery for a bicuspid aortic valve depends on several factors, including the size and shape of the valve, the presence of any regurgitation or stenosis, the patient's symptoms, and their risk factors for complications, such as hypertension, diabetes, and tobacco use.\n\nYour husband's age of 32 and a body weight of 75 kg are not significant factors in this determination. However, bicuspid aortic valves carry an increased risk for aortic root dilatation and aortic dissection, particularly as people age. Regular follow-up with a cardiologist is recommended to monitor the valve function and aortic size.\n\nIt is important to discuss your husband's condition with his cardiologist to get a more definitive assessment and decide on the most appropriate management plan. If there is significant aortic regurgitation, aortic root dilation, or symptoms such as chest pain, shortness of breath, or syncope, surgical repair or replacement of the valve may be necessary.\n\nIf there are no significant symptoms or evidence of aortic dilation, lifestyle modifications such as controlling hypertension, avoiding tobacco use, and regular exercise may be sufficient treatment options. Ultimately, the decision to undergo surgery for a bicuspid aortic valve should be made in consultation with a healthcare professional based on an individualized risk assessment."}
{"question": "Should the tonsils be removed due to recurrent tonsillitis?hi.. i M from Manila, I just want to consult about my daughter having recurrent toncillitis, since she was 6, she is now 8 yo. We had a throat swab and she is was found to have heavy growth enterobacter spp... will it be better if we have her toncillitis removed?? thank you", "human": "Hi... I understand your concern. By what you say I feel that your child might be having moderate to severe persistent allergic rhinitis along with an upper airway resistance syndrome.Previously the only treatment for upper airway resistance syndrome used to be surgery or  adenotonsillectomy.But now advanced the modalities of treatment have come up, like intranasal steroids which can be given up to a period of 4 to 8 weeks and after which many kids are recovering without the need for surgery. This treatment will take care of the moderate to severe persistent allergic rhinitis also.But this technique of administration of intranasal steroids is very important and should be talk to you by your pediatrician properly.Regards - Dr. Sumanth", "ai": " Recurrent tonsillitis, particularly if it is severe and accompanied by heavy bacterial growth as in your daughter's case, can lead to complications such as repeated fevers, difficulty swallowing, and disruption to normal growth and development. Tonsillectomy, the surgical removal of the tonsils, is a common treatment option for recurrent tonsillitis, especially when medical therapies have failed to provide adequate relief.\n\nHowever, tonsillectomy is a major surgical procedure that carries risks such as pain, bleeding, and infection. It is important to consider these risks and the potential benefits of the surgery carefully before making a decision.\n\nFactors that may influence the decision to proceed with tonsillectomy include the severity and frequency of your daughter's tonsillitis episodes, the presence of complications such as peritonsillar abscess or obstructive sleep apnea, and the potential impact of the surgery on her quality of life and future infections.\n\nYour healthcare provider, who has access to your daughter's medical history and the results of her throat culture, can provide you with more personalized advice based on her specific situation. It may be helpful to discuss the risks and benefits of tonsillectomy with your provider and consider seeking a second opinion if you have concerns.\n\nRegardless of the decision, it is important to continue practicing good oral hygiene and maintaining a healthy diet to minimize the risk of recurrent infections. Your daughter may also benefit from ongoing medical care to manage any underlying conditions that may contribute to her recurrent tonsillitis."}

{"question": "What causes appearance of green and orange patches on tongue?My son has orange and green patches on his tongue! What is this? It occured first when he was about a month old and was treated for thrush which took several months to clear up. Now a couple weeks later, the orange and green patches are appearing again. He is 5 months old, about 14 1/2 pounds and 27 inches long.", "human": "hello there,thank you for posting your query with healthcare magic,First of all, i would like to appreciate you for sharing the past experience your baby had.Oral thrush is nothing but a fungal infection which is most common in babies and elderly, it is seen clinically as white curd like appearance in the tongue,In case of babies we advise parents to clean their babies tongue after feeding them, if we know its from poor oral hygiene. But in some cases when babies get sick their immune system goes down and that  is when opportunistic infections like candidiasis appear. But according to your information here, if their is no white curd like appearance on babies tongue, nor any bleeding spots after you clean the tongue, then it may not be oral thrush(candidiasis), orange and green patches sometimes could also be stains from the foods we offer to our kids like fruit/vegetable juices.I would like you to keep an eye on these patches if they change in shape or size, also kindly take care of your babies oral hygiene.If you feel your baby is not eating well , then kindly seek consultation with a pediatrician.i hope any answer was helpful for you,feel free to write back if you have further questions.have a nice day,thank you", "ai": " The appearance of orange and green patches on your son's tongue could be due to a few different conditions. Here are some possibilities:\n\n1. Oral Thrush: Since your son has a history of thrush, it's possible that the patches are a recurrence of this fungal infection. Thrush can sometimes leave white, curd-like patches on the tongue, which can appear red or orange underneath. Greenish discoloration can also be a sign of thrush.\n2. Erythroplasia or Leukoplakia: These are conditions that can cause white or red patches on the tongue or other mucous membranes in the mouth. Erythroplasia is a precancerous condition that can be red and inflamed, while leukoplakia can be white, thick, and textured. The green discoloration may be due to infection or inflammation.\n3. Food Dyes or other Stains: Sometimes, the orange and green patches may be caused by food dyes or other stains. For example, certain fruits and vegetables, such as pineapple and carrots, can leave orange stains on the tongue. Green food coloring or other sources of green pigment may also be a possibility.\n4. Trauma or Irritation: If your son is teething or using a pacifier a lot, the constant pressure on his tongue could cause irritation and inflammation, leading to orange or red patches. Green discoloration in this case could be due to the breakdown of certain compounds in saliva.\n\nIt's important to consult a healthcare professional if you're concerned about your son's tongue patches. They can evaluate the appearance and texture of the patches, as well as any other symptoms your son may be experiencing, and give you a definitive diagnosis and treatment recommendations."}
{"question": "What causes dark spots on the heart?Hi my twin brother had a test on his heart done and was told he had 2 black spots.

I remain at your disposal whenever you need. Hope I have answered your query. Let me know if I can assist you further. Regards,Dr. Ilir Sharka,Cardiologist", "ai": " I cannot provide an answer with certainty as I am an AI language model and not a doctor, and the information you have provided is not sufficient to make an accurate diagnosis. The \"black spots\" on your twin brother's heart that were detected during a cardiac catheterization could be a few different things, including calcifications, thrombi (blood clots), or other types of lesions. Calcifications are common in older adults and can occur in the coronary arteries or in the heart valves. Thrombi can form as a result of atrial fibrillation or other heart conditions. Other types of lesions could include tumors or other anomalies.\n\nYour cardiologist will likely be able to provide more information based on the results of further testing, such as additional imaging studies or a biopsy. As far as your concern about your own health, since you have a related condition (MVP with regurgitation and an enlarged left ventricle), it would be a good idea to discuss your situation with your own doctor and inquire about the possibility of further testing or monitoring. However, it's important to remember that just because you have a similar condition to your brother, it doesn't necessarily mean that you have the same issue with the \"black spots\" on his heart. Your doctors will be able to provide more guidance based on your individual medical history and examination results."}

I strongly advise consulting a healthcare professional for accurate information regarding your son's condition and specific symptoms.\n\nA blood clot near a brain tumor can potentially cause various symptoms and complications. It may lead to increased pressure in the brain (intracranial pressure), which could result in symptoms such as:\n\n* Severe headache that does not go away, worsening over time\n* Nausea and/or vomiting\n* Impaired vision (blurriness, double vision, visual disturbances)\n* Confusion or trouble understanding spoken language\n* Seizures\n* Loss of consciousness or decreased alertness\n* Weakness, numbness, or paralysis on one side of the body\n* Difficulty speaking or finding the right words\n* Changes in mood, behavior, or personality\n* Difficulty swallowing or eating\n* Balance and coordination problems\n\nThese symptoms could be dangerous and require immediate medical attention, as they may indicate an increase in intracranial pressure or a worsening of the condition. However, not all of these symptoms may be present in every case, and the severity of the symptoms can vary widely from one individual to another.\n\nThe presence of a blood clot near a brain tumor does not necessarily mean that the tumor has come back or that the cancer has spread. It could be a complication from the initial treatment or a side effect of certain medications.\n\nSome potential causes of a blood clot near a brain tumor include:\n\n* Tumor-induced coagulopathy – the tumor itself can cause changes in blood coagulation, leading to the formation of a blood clot.\n* Venous sinus thrombosis – a blood clot in the venous sinuses, which can be caused by various factors, including tumors, infections, and dehydration.\n* Catheter-related thrombosis – blood clots can form when a catheter, such as a shunt or an Ommaya reservoir, is inserted into the brain.\n* Side effects of certain treatments – some medications, such as anticoagulants or thrombolytics, can increase the risk of developing a blood clot.\n\nIt's important to closely follow your son's neuro-oncologist's recommendations and maintain open communication with the medical team regarding any potential changes in his condition. If you observe any new or worsening symptoms, contact his healthcare provider right away.\n\nI hope this information is helpful, but please remember that this response is meant for informational purposes only and should not be used as a substitute for professional medical advice."}

I was getting dizzy all the time. So, they placed tubes in my ears.", "human": "Hi. Grommets or ventilation tubes should not cause pulsatile tinnitus usually. Is your MRI normal? Can you share the report with me? Any other symptoms? Why were the tubes put in the first place?", "ai": " Tubes placed in the ears, also known as tympanostomy tubes or ear tubes, are commonly used to manage conditions such as ear infections, fluid build-up, or ventilation problems in the middle ear. While tinnitus, or ringing in the ears, is a common symptom of various ear conditions, there is no definitive evidence that ear tubes cause pulsating tinnitus specifically.\n\nPulsating tinnitus is a type of tinnitus that syncs with your heartbeat, and it can have various causes. Some possible causes include vascular conditions, such as blood vessel abnormalities or increased blood flow in the ear, or head and neck injuries. There have been case reports and anecdotal evidence suggesting a link between ear tubes and pulsating tinnitus, but more research is needed to establish a definitive relationship.\n\nIf you are experiencing pulsating tinnitus after having ear tubes placed, it's essential to discuss this with your healthcare provider. They may conduct further tests, such as a hearing exam, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), or a Doppler ultrasound, to rule out any underlying conditions that could be causing the pulsating tinnitus. If the pulsating tinnitus is determined to be related to the ear tubes, your healthcare provider may consider removing or replacing them. However, in most cases, the pulsating tinnitus goes away on its own with no specific treatment required."}
{"question": "What causes throbbing chest pain along with shortness of breath?I have a throbbing pounding pain in the middle of my chest between my breasts. I am not short of breath.

The pain is constant and radiates across my back.", "human": "Thanks for your question on HCM. In my opinion you are having GERD (Gastro Esophageal Reflux Disease). But as a rule in chest pain, we have to rule out cardiac and pulmonary causes.So get done ECG and 2D Echo to rule out cardiac causes.Get done chest x ray to rule out infection in the lungs.If all the above are normal than it is mostly GERD.It is due to laxity of gastroesophageal sphincter. Due to this acid of the stomach tends to come up in the esophagus and cause the central chest pain.Try to follow these for better control of GERD.1. Avoid hot and spicy food.2. Avoid stress and anxiety. 3. Avoid large meals. Take small meals.4. Start proton pump inhibitors. 5. Go for walk after meals.6. Keep 2-3 pillows under your head in bad.", "ai": " I'm an AI language model and not a doctor, but your symptoms could be indicative of several conditions. Throbbing chest pain between the breasts, along with shortness of breath, can be a sign of a heart attack, particularly if it's accompanied by other symptoms such as arm or jaw pain, sweating, or nausea. However, your description of the pain radiating across your back and worsening when you swallow or bend is more suggestive of gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD), also known as acid reflux. GERD occurs when stomach acid flows back into the esophagus, causing a burning sensation in the chest. If you suspect you have a heart condition or other serious health issue, please consult a healthcare professional right away for a proper diagnosis and treatment. If your symptoms are more consistent with GERD, your doctor may recommend medications, lifestyle changes, or other interventions to help manage your symptoms."}
{"question": "Suggest treatment for pain during urination and feverMy father is 82 years old and in good health.  Yesterday he had a fever (101) and experienced burning pain while urinating.  He went to the ER and they stared giving him antibiotics via an IV.  It's been 24 hours and his fever continues (101.7).  He said he feels terrible.  They just ordered an ultrasound of his bladder, kidneys and prostrate.  What could the problem be?", "human": "Hello and Welcome to ‘Ask A Doctor’ service. I have reviewed your query and here is my advice. Your father might be suffering from urinary tract infection. Urinary tract infections are very common in elderly males due to bening prostatic hypertrophy which causes urinary tract obstruction which leads to stasis of urine in bladder and urine is excellent media for bacteria to grow. I would advise you to get his urine complete examination done along with ultrasound kidney ureter bladder and prostate. In the meanwhile keep him on oral antibiotics preferably from quinolone group. Thanks", "ai": " Based on the information provided, it is likely that your father is experiencing a urinary tract infection (UTI), which can cause both fever and pain during urination. UTIs are common in older adults, and can be caused by bacteria that enter the urinary system. The fact that your father has been admitted to the ER and started on antibiotics is a good first step in treating the infection. however, since his fever persists after 24 hours of antibiotic treatment, it is possible that there is an underlying cause for his symptoms that goes beyond a simple UTI. Some possible underlying causes for fever and pain during urination in an older adult include:\n\n* Kidney stones: can cause severe pain during urination and can also cause fever if an infection is present.\n* Bladder or kidney infection: can cause fever and painful urination, and may require hospitalization and more aggressive treatment than a standard UTI.\n* Prostate infection: can cause painful urination and fever in older men, and may require further tests to diagnose.\n* Other causes: other possible causes for fever and painful urination in an older adult include sexually transmitted infections, cancer, or other underlying medical conditions.\n\nGiven your father's age and symptoms, it is important that he continue to receive appropriate medical care. The ultrasound being ordered will help to rule out potential causes such as kidney stones or bladder or kidney infections. If your father's symptoms do not improve with antibiotics, his healthcare team may consider other diagnostic tests or treatments. It is also important for him to stay hydrated and to continue to report his symptoms to his healthcare provider. If you have any concerns about your father's care, I would suggest speaking with his healthcare team directly."}

Gallbladder problems can indeed present with various symptoms, including abdominal and back pain, and it's important to be taken seriously by your healthcare team.\n\nGallbladder issues can cause a wide range of symptoms, and some people may only experience intermittent pain after eating, while others may have constant, debilitating pain. Itching (pruritus) and a feeling of oiliness in the rectal area can also be associated with gallbladder problems, although these symptoms may have other causes as well.\n\nIf you're concerned about your symptoms and feel that you're not getting the care you need, I would recommend seeking a second opinion from another healthcare provider or specialist, such as a gastroenterologist or a surgeon. You can ask for a referral from your primary care doctor or make an appointment directly with a specialist.\n\nIn the meantime, you can try some self-care measures to help manage your symptoms, such as avoiding trigger foods that worsen your pain, staying hydrated, and taking over-the-counter pain relievers as recommended. You may also find relief by applying heat or cold to the affected area.\n\nIt's important to keep a record of your symptoms and any tests or procedures you've had, as well as any medications or treatments you've tried.

{"question": "Are stomach pain and back pain caused by side effects of duphaston tablets?I had duphaston tablet for 10 days twice a day....ie from 14 days of my cycle to 24 day...usually my cycle is of 26 days..this month i got periods on 29th day and it vey painful...i hav sharp stomach and back pain....i am worried to continue duphaston for next month...", "human": "Hi, Oh, I cannot say in your particular case, but generally, it will change the cycle. AND inhibiting the cycle ending and having it build up is pretty common. There are many adjustments of this or a different drug that would be another roll of the dice to see if it worked out better. BUT mostly you'd get the same results every month with the same pill. Hope I have answered your query. Let me know if I can assist you further. Regards,Dr. Matt Wachsman, Addiction Medicine Specialist", "ai": " I'm an AI language model and unable to provide medical diagnosis or advice, but I can try to help you understand the potential connections between your symptoms and the medication you've been taking.\n\nDuphaston, also known as clomiphene citrate, is a selective estrogen receptor modulator (SERM) often used to stimulate ovulation in women with infertility issues. It works by blocking the action of estrogen in the hypothalamus and pituitary glands, thereby encouraging the release of gonadotropin hormones.\n\nSide effects of Duphaston can include gastrointestinal problems, such as abdominal pain, bloating, and nausea. These side effects are more common during the early stages of treatment and are generally dose-dependent (i.e., more severe with higher doses). Back pain is not a common side effect, although it is possible in some cases.\n\nYour experience of sharp stomach and back pain during your cycle while taking Duphaston may be coincidental. However, it is important to consider the potential connection between your symptoms and the medication. We recommend discussing your symptoms with your healthcare provider, who can assess your overall health, evaluate any potential interactions between medications, and determine whether adjustments to your treatment plan are necessary. It is also important to discuss the possibility of your cycle shortening and the early onset of menstruation, as this may be related to the medication or could indicate other health concerns.\n\nIn summary, while stomach pain and back pain aren't typical side effects of Duphaston, it's essential to discuss your symptoms with your healthcare provider. They can provide personalized guidance based on your medical history and current health situation."}

However, please keep in mind that I can't diagnose conditions or recommend treatments, and you should always consult a healthcare professional for accurate information.\n\nThe burning sensation in the vaginal area, along with brown and white discharge, could be caused by several conditions. Some common causes include:\n\n1. Bacterial vaginosis (BV): This is an infection caused by an imbalance of bacteria in the vagina. Symptoms can include a thin, white or gray discharge with a fishy odor, burning sensation during urination, and a burning sensation in the vaginal area. Metro Gel, a prescription medication, is sometimes used to treat BV. However, if you are still experiencing symptoms after using the gel and the problem persists, it's important to follow up with your doctor.\n\n2. Yeast infection: A yeast infection occurs when there is an overgrowth of a type of fungus called Candida in the vagina. Symptoms include a thick, white discharge, itching, burning, and redness in the vaginal area. Antifungal treatment, such as Fluconazole (Diflucan) or Clotrimazole (Monistat), can be effective for treating yeast infections.\n\n3.

Birth Trauma: The red spot could be caused by injury during the birth process. Tongue ties or other tongue anomalies can also cause a red spot.\n2. Tongue Fissure: A tongue fissure is a small split or crack on the surface of the tongue. It is common in newborns and usually heals on its own within a few days.\n3. Infection: A red spot on the tongue can be a sign of an infection, such as thrush or a bacterial infection. Thrush is a fungal infection that can cause redness, white lesions, and difficulty nursing. A bacterial infection can cause redness, swelling, and pain.\n4. Hemangioma: A hemangioma is a type of benign tumor that develops from blood vessels. It is common in infants and can appear anywhere on the body, including the tongue. Hemangiomas can be flat or raised, and they can vary in size. In most cases, they will grow during the first year of life and then begin to shrink on their own, but this can take several years.\n\nIt is important to note that not all red spots on a newborn's tongue are hemangiomas, and it is difficult to determine the cause based on appearance alone. If you are concerned about the red spot on your baby's tongue, it is best to have it checked by a healthcare professional. They can examine your baby's tongue and determine the cause based on a physical examination and other diagnostic tests, if necessary.\n\nThere are usually no consequences if the red spot on your baby's tongue is caused by something other than a hemangioma, such as birth trauma or a tongue fissure. However, if it is a hemangioma, there are some potential complications to be aware of. Hemangiomas can cause swelling, which can make it difficult for your baby to nurse or swallow. In some cases, they can also cause bleeding or ulceration. If the hemangioma is large or in a sensitive area, it may require medical treatment, such as surgery or laser therapy. However, most hemangiomas are treated only if they cause significant symptoms or complications. Your healthcare professional can provide more information and advice based on your baby's specific condition."}

After this your doctor will prescribe fertility medication through which your chances of pregnancy will increase.Best wishes.", "ai": " I am an AI language model and not a doctor, but I can try to help interpret the information you have provided based on common knowledge and research in the field of fertility treatment. A follicle size of 1.33 * 1.00 cm onultrasound is considered relatively small for a mature follicle in a natural cycle. During an in vitro fertilization (IVF) cycle, a follicle of this size might still be capable of producing a mature egg, but the chances of success can depend on various factors.\n\nYour follicular study report mentioned that on Day 11, you have a single growing follicle (GF) in the left ovary, measuring 1.33 * 1.00 cm. The report also mentioned that both ovaries showed multiple small follicles (MSFs). The absence of a dominant follicle on the right ovary is not uncommon in women undergoing IVF treatment for polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS).\n\nThe presence of a single, measurable follicle implies that ovulation is imminent, and the egg could potentially be retrieved via oocyte pickup (OPU) during an IVF cycle. However, the chances of a successful pregnancy depend on several factors, including the quality and maturity of the egg, the sperm's health and fertility, and whether or not the embryo implants and grows into a healthy pregnancy.\n\nYour uterine size, as mentioned in the report, appears to be within the normal range (6.5 cm x 3.0 cm). The endometrium thickness of 4.2mm on Day 9 is a little thin, but this could still potentially support an implanted embryo.\n\nGiven the information provided, it appears that your healthcare team is actively monitoring your progress during the IVF cycle to ensure the best possible outcome. However, I cannot diagnose your chances of getting pregnant based on the information you have provided, and I strongly recommend consulting with your healthcare provider for a more accurate and personalized assessment.\n\nIt's essential to keep in mind that every woman's response to IVF treatment is unique, and factors beyond follicle size and uterine measurements also impact fertility outcomes.

For further information consult a fitness expert online --> https://www.icliniq.com/ask-a-doctor-online/fitness-expert", "ai": " There are several reasons why a healthy diet may not be enough to improve the tone and structure of your face:\n\n1. Genetics: Your face structure is largely determined by your genes. While a healthy diet can help improve the overall health of your body and reduce inflammation, it may not be able to significantly change the structure of your face.\n\n2. Aging: As we age, our skin loses elasticity and collagen, which can lead to sagging and wrinkles. While a healthy diet can help slow down the aging process, it may not be able to completely reverse the effects.\n\n3. Dehydration: Proper hydration is essential for maintaining healthy skin. Make sure you are drinking enough water throughout the day to keep your skin hydrated.\n\n4. Nutrient deficiencies: Even if you are eating a healthy diet, you may still be lacking certain nutrients that are essential for healthy skin. Consider taking a multivitamin or specific supplements to ensure you are getting all the nutrients your body needs.\n\n5. Lack of Sleep: Sleep is important for maintaining healthy skin. Aim for 7-9 hours of sleep per night.\n\n6. Sun damage: Sun damage is a leading cause of premature aging and can make it difficult for the skin to maintain a healthy tone and structure. Be sure to protect your skin with sunscreen and protective clothing when spending time in the sun.\n\n7. Stress: High stress levels can affect the health of your skin, causing it to appear dull and tired. Find ways to manage stress through activities such as exercise, meditation, or therapeutic hobbies.\n\n8. Smoking and alcohol: Both smoking and alcohol can damage the skin, making it difficult to maintain a healthy tone and structure. Try to avoid or limit these habits as much as possible.\n\nAs for specific suggestions for improving the appearance of your eyes, consider adding foods rich in vitamins A, C, and E to your diet, as these nutrients are important for eye health. You may also want to try using eye creams or serums formulated for dark circles or puffiness. Adequate sleep, reducing screen time, and keeping the eye area hydrated can also help improve the appearance of your eyes. If you are concerned about the appearance of your eyes or face, you may want to speak with a dermatologist or other healthcare provider for personalized recommendations."}

RegardsDr.Deepika Patil", "ai": " I'm not a doctor, but I can try to provide some general information that might help you. It's important to consult with your healthcare provider for medical advice specific to your situation.\n\nFrom what you've shared, it seems that your follicle did not rupture after the hormone injection, and your healthcare provider gave you Duphaston tablets to prevent premature ovulation during the remaining days of your cycle. If you have 6 tablets left and your healthcare provider hasn't explicitly instructed you to stop taking them, continuing to take them as prescribed may be a good idea.\n\nHowever, this decision ultimately depends on your healthcare provider's recommendations. If you have any concerns, I would suggest contacting your healthcare provider to discuss the situation and any potential implications for your upcoming cycle.

{"question": "Q. Will taking medication cure adult ADHD?Hello doctor,I am just curious here. I fully believe I have adult ADHD, and being that I was diagnosed at 11 with it, would this help my case for medication with a psych?", "human": "Hi. Both adult and childhood ADHD needs to be treated with medicines. Three medicines are the first line drugs used to treat ADHD namely Methamphetamine (Adderal), Methylphenidate (Concerta) and Atomoxetine (Strattera). The former two drugs are more effective in treating hyperactivity symptoms while the third is more effective in impulsivity symptoms of ADHD. Another drug which has been used with great success in the past is an alpha-2 agonist called Clonidine. It is also used in treating hypertension and urinary retention.", "ai": " I am an artificial intelligence language model and not a doctor, I cannot provide medical advice. However, I can provide you with general information on the subject.\n\nMedication can help manage the symptoms of Adult ADHD effectively for many individuals. Stimulant medications such as Ritalin, Adderall, and Concerta, and non-stimulant medications like Strattera, can improve focus, impulsivity, and hyperactivity. But it's important to note that these medications do not cure ADHD. They simply help individuals with ADHD function better in their daily lives by providing improved symptom control.\n\nYour history of being diagnosed with ADHD as a child undoubtedly strengthens your case when seeking medication for adult ADHD. Make sure to discuss your concerns, symptoms, and previous diagnosis with your healthcare professional. They will consider various factors, including your medical history and the potential benefits and risks of medication, to determine if medical treatment is the right choice for you.\n\nAdditionally, remember that medication is only one aspect of managing ADHD. Establishing effective coping strategies, organizational skills, healthy habits, and a support system can further enhance symptom management and overall quality of life.\n\nConsult with your healthcare provider or a mental health professional for personalized recommendations tailored to your unique situation and needs."}
{"question": "Could numbness in arm and palpitations be due to dehydration?Within minutes of lying on my right side,my arm goes painful/numb. Also I seem  to have palpitations when lying on my right side as well, when trying to go to sleep. this  Morning I woke up and my right arm hurt/was numb. I have tried stretching but it lasts for awhile.Can dehydration be a cause?", "human": "YES dehydration can be one of the factors inducing the pain and numbness of specific parts of your body but in your case i would like to ask you to consider your posture while sleeping and have your xray cervical spine done to look for cervical rib or cervical spondylosis if pain and numbness persists, moreover keep on taking a well balanced diet too.", "ai": " Yes, dehydration can potentially cause numbness or tingling sensations in the arms and palpitations. When you're dehydrated, your body doesn't have enough fluid to maintain normal blood volume, which can lead to decreased blood flow to the arms and other extremities. This can result in feelings of numbness or tingling.\n\nDehydration can also cause palpitations by altering your heart's electrical activity. When you're dehydrated, your heart has to work harder to pump blood through your body, which can cause irregular heartbeats or palpitations.\n\nOther potential causes of numbness and palpitations include nerve damage, heart conditions, and certain medications. If you're experiencing these symptoms frequently and they're not related to physical activity or a specific position, it's a good idea to talk to your doctor to rule out any underlying medical conditions.\n\nTo prevent dehydration, make sure you're drinking enough water throughout the day. Aim for at least eight glasses a day, but more if you're physically active or live in a hot climate. You can also get fluids from other sources, like fruits and vegetables, milk, and soups. Make sure you're also getting enough electrolytes, which help your body maintain proper fluid balance. You can get electrolytes from foods like bananas, oranges, and leafy green vegetables, or you can buy sports drinks or other electrolyte-rich beverages."}

However, it's essential to consult a healthcare professional for an accurate diagnosis and treatment recommendations. Here are some steps you can take in the meantime:\n\n1. Hydration: Ensure your daughter is properly hydrated by offering small, frequent feeds of breast milk or formula. You can also offer water in a small, clean cup or a feeding spoon. Aim for 1-2 ounces (30-60 ml) every 15-30 minutes.\n2. Avoid solids: Hold off on introducing solid foods for a few days, focusing solely on breast milk or formula.\n3. Slow feedings: Offer small, gentle feeds every 1-2 hours. If she seems to tolerate the feedings well, gradually increase the volume over a few feedings.\n4. Monitor frequency of bowel movements: Encourage frequent, soft bowel movements. If your daughter is not passing stools every day or her stools are hard and dry, you may want to consult a healthcare professional.\n5. Keep a record: Maintain a record of her feeding schedule, bowel movements, and vomiting episodes. A healthcare professional may find this information helpful in making a diagnosis.\n\nSome common causes of vomiting are overfeeding, teething, gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD), infections, or food sensitivities. Light gray or green stools can occur due to various reasons, including breast milk, certain foods, or a bacterial infection. If your daughter's symptoms persist or worsen, or if you're concerned about her health, seek medical advice promptly.\n\nRemember, I strongly recommend consulting a healthcare professional for personalized recommendations and treatment options.

Clean the bite: Wash the bite area gently with soap and warm water. Pat the area dry with a clean towel.\n2. Avoid scratching: Scratching the bite can break the skin, causing bacteria to enter and increasing the risk of infection.\n3. Apply a cool compress: A cool compress may help reduce itching and swelling. You can use a cloth soaked in ice water, a cool pack, or a gel pack.\n4. Over-the-counter medicines: Antihistamines (such as diphenhydramine or loratadine) and pain relievers (such as acetaminophen or ibuprofen) may help relieve symptoms.\n5. Topical anti-itch creams: Over-the-counter creams or gels containing hydrocortisone, calamine lotion, or lidocaine may help reduce itching and inflammation.\n6.

Use insect repellent: Use an Environmental Protection Agency (EPA)-registered insect repellent on exposed skin and clothing. Follow the label instructions carefully.\n8. Stay hydrated: Drink plenty of fluids to help combat the body's increased temperature response to the bite.\n9. Rest: Allow your body to heal, which may involve getting plenty of rest.\n\nIf your symptoms do not improve or worsen, consult a healthcare professional. Additionally, if you're unsure of the type of insect that bit you or if you suspect you have been bitten by a venomous creature, seek medical attention as soon as possible."}
{"question": "Is Zerolac good for babies?Hi doctor my twin baby girls are 4 month, up to this date we are giving them both breast milk and nan pro1.

It is good only if used for special recommendations. You have not described what stomach problems your baby is suffering . Green stool if not watery is not a cause of concern.Hope this answers your question. If you have additional questions then please do not hesitate in writing to us.Take care .•     DISCLAIMER: - All the information provided here is for information purpose only   , it is not a substitute for the advice of a physician after physical examination , it is not intended to replace your relationship with your doctor. This information in no way establishes a doctor-patient relationship. Before acting anything based on this information do consult your doctor. I  recommend that online users seek the advice of a physician who can perform an in-person physical examination", "ai": " I'd be happy to help you with your questions, but I'm an artificial intelligence and not a doctor, so I can't diagnose or give medical advice. However, I can give you some general information about Zerolac infant formula that might be helpful.\n\nZerolac is a brand of infant formula produced by Nestlé. It is designed to provide complete nutrition for babies who cannot be breastfed or whose mothers have difficulty providing enough milk. Zerolac comes in different varieties, such as Zerolac 1 and Zerolac 2, which are meant for different age groups.\n\nGreen stools are not uncommon in infants, and they can have various causes, including the introduction of new foods, changes in formula, or an increase in certain components of breast milk, such as bilirubin. Stomach problems, such as colic or gassiness, can also have various causes and are common in infants.\n\nYour pediatrician's recommendation to switch to Zerolac may be based on the fact that sometimes infants react differently to different types of formula, and Zerolac might be a better fit for your babies. However, if you have concerns about the new formula or if your babies continue to have problems, I would encourage you to follow up with your pediatrician. They can assess your babies' health and provide guidance based on their individual needs. If the problem persists, further testing or referral to a specialist might be necessary.\n\nIt's important to remember that formula feeding comes with its own challenges, and transitions between formulas or from breast milk to formula can sometimes cause digestive upset in infants. If your babies experience any symptoms, such as frequent vomiting, diarrhea, or blood in the stool, or if you notice any signs of illness, you should contact your pediatrician right away.\n\nTransitioning to a new formula can also be a process, so it may be helpful to introduce Zerolac gradually, by mixing it with the old formula over several days. This can help minimize the risk of digestive upset and make the transition smoother for your babies.\n\nI hope I was able to provide some helpful information for you! If you have any further questions, feel free to ask!"}

The fungus thrives in warm and moist conditions, such as locker rooms, showers, and swimming areas. However, it is not common specifically from swimming in cenotes in Mexico.\n\nThe fungus can spread through skin-to-skin contact with an infected person or by touching contaminated objects such as towels, clothing or surfaces. It may also spread from other areas of the body, such as the groin or the underside of the buttocks.\n\nTo help prevent fungal infections, it is important to practice good hygiene, change clothes after sweating, cover any open wounds or cuts, avoid sharing towels or clothing, and keep your environment clean and dry. If you are concerned about a potential infection, it is best to consult a healthcare professional for proper diagnosis and treatment."}
{"question": "What causes tingling in legs in males with bicuspid aortic valve?I am 48 yo male, 5 3 , 140 lbs. I was diagnosed in childhood with a bicuspid aortic valve, so I am quite active, run 30 min 6x a week, and weight lifting 30 min 3x a week.

YOU CAN ALWAYS CONSULT A NEUROLOGIST FOR THE SAME..HOPE I ANSWERED YOUR QUERY. YOU CAN MESSAGE ME FOR ANY FURTHER CONCERNS", "ai": " The relationship between a bicuspid aortic valve (BAV) and tingling sensations in the legs is not straightforward. BAV is a congenital heart condition where instead of the normal three leaflets, the aortic valve has only two leaflets. This condition may increase the risk for certain conditions such as aortic stenosis, aortic root dilatation, and aortic dissection, which can affect blood flow and put pressure on peripheral nerves, potentially causing tingling sensations in the legs. However, there are several other possible causes of leg tingling that are more common than these conditions, including:\n\n1. Peripheral artery disease: This condition causes narrowing or blockages in the arteries that carry blood to the legs, reducing blood flow and leading to tingling, cramping, or pain in the legs.\n2. Diabetes: High blood sugar levels can damage the nerves in the legs, leading to tingling or numbness.\n3. Vitamin B12 deficiency: This vitamin is essential for the proper functioning of the nerves. A deficiency can cause tingling, numbness, and other nerve-related symptoms.\n4. Sitting for long periods: Prolonged sitting can put pressure on the nerves in the legs, causing tingling or numbness.\n\nGiven your symptoms and medical history, it's important to discuss this with your doctor, who can assess your condition and rule out any serious causes. They may recommend further tests such as an ultrasound or an MRI to evaluate the heart and blood vessels, or blood tests to check for conditions like vitamin B12 deficiency, diabetes, or other metabolic issues.\n\nIn the meantime, it may help to take regular breaks from sitting, stretch your legs, and do some light exercises to promote blood circulation. It may also be worth considering a consultation with a physical therapist or an ergonomics specialist to improve your seating and workstation setup."}

Viral infections: Your initial muscle aches and fatigue could be related to a viral infection, such as influenza or COVID-19. The development of a red rash could be a complication or a separate viral infection, like fifth disease or roseola.\n2. Allergic reaction: Your symptoms could be due to an allergic reaction to a substance, such as a food, medication, or environmental allergen. A rash, muscle aches, and fatigue can sometimes occur together with an allergic reaction.\n3. Insect bites: Although you discounted this possibility initially, it remains a possibility, especially if you were exposed to insects or biting bugs, like mosquitoes or poison ivy.\n4.

Will it just sort itself?", "human": "Hello, As the symptoms you have mentioned in history, I feel this is a direct injury to the bone, that is the olecranon process. So having these signs are common. Also, there might be some injury to the tendon of the triceps muscle which gets attached to the olecranon process. For long term relief of pain, you can strengthen the triceps muscle so the muscle functionality improves and pain doesn't reoccur in later stages. Hope I have answered your query. Let me know if I can assist you further. Take care Regards,Jay Indravadan Patel, Physical Therapist or Physiotherapist", "ai": " It is not uncommon for there to be lingering effects after a severe bruise. The raised and hard tissue you are experiencing is likely due to hemosiderin deposits, which are pigments left behind by the hemoglobin in the ruptured blood vessels. These deposits can take several weeks to months to fully resolve.\n\nHowever, if the pain and tissue hardness persist for an extended period, it's a good idea to consult a healthcare professional to rule out any underlying conditions, such as a bone fracture or soft tissue injury that may not have been detected initially. Additionally, certain medical conditions, such as deep vein thrombosis or liver disease, can cause persistent bruising and tissue hardness.\n\nIf you haven't already, you can try some self-care measures at home to help alleviate any discomfort. These can include:\n\n- Applying ice packs to the area for 15-20 minutes at a time, several times a day, to help reduce inflammation and alleviate pain.\n- Elevating the affected limb when possible to help minimize swelling.\n- Wearing a compression bandage or brace to help reduce swelling and support the affected area.\n- Avoiding activities that cause significant pain or pressure to the area until it has fully healed.\n\nIf you're unsure about any of these measures or if your symptoms persist despite self-care, it's best to consult your healthcare provider."}

Your description of symptoms and the treatments you've been prescribed suggest that this could be an aphthous ulcer, also known as a canker sore. Aphthous ulcers are common, often recurring, painful sores that can occur inside the mouth. There are several potential triggers for canker sores, including:\n\n1. Nutritional deficiencies: Vitamin B12, iron, folic acid, and zinc deficiencies have been linked to canker sores. HCV (Hepatitis C virus) infection may affect nutrient absorption, leading to deficiencies.\n2. Stress: Emotional stress can weaken the immune system, making it harder for the body to fight off infection and causing canker sores.\n3. Hormonal changes: Drops in estrogen levels can increase the risk of developing canker sores, especially in women.\n4. Allergic reactions: Allergic reactions to certain foods, dental products, or medications could cause canker sores.\n5. Infections: Bacterial, viral, or other infections, such as HSV-1 (herpes simplex virus), can cause canker sores.\n\nYour HCV status doesn't directly cause canker sores, but being positive for HCV and undergoing deferred treatment may indirectly contribute to canker sores by weakening your immune system and leading to nutrient deficiencies.\n\nRegarding your symptoms, the pain, large size of the sore, and difficulty wearing dentures, as well as the sore throat, do not necessarily indicate a canker sore. It's crucial to consult a healthcare professional, such as your dentist or primary care physician, to get a proper diagnosis. They will be able to examine your mouth and assess whether other conditions, such as oral cancer or herpetic lesions, might be the cause.\n\nIt's also essential to maintain good oral hygiene and avoid foods that may aggravate canker sores or cause reactions, such as acidic or spicy foods and citrus fruits, until your symptoms have resolved. If you're deferring treatment for HCV infection, focusing on overall health, including proper nutrition, stress management, and a strong support system, can help minimize the risk of developing canker sores or other complications."}

Your symptoms may be due to persistent allergic reactions to environmental allergens like pollen, pet dander, dust mites, or mold.\n2. Non-allergic rhinitis: If your symptoms don't align with typical allergic reactions or occur year-round despite allergy medications, non-allergic rhinitis could be the cause. This condition can be caused by various factors, such as hormonal imbalances, infections, medications, or temperature and humidity changes.\n3. Anatomical factors: A deviated septum or other structural issues within the nose could cause persistent nasal congestion and drainage.\n4. Smoking or secondhand smoke exposure: Smoke irritates the nasal passages and could contribute to chronic running nose.\n5.

It is important to note that the cause of a miscarriage can affect future pregnancies, so it is crucial to find out the reason behind your loss. Factors such as advanced maternal age, chromosomal abnormalities, infections, and structural issues in the uterus can influence future pregnancies. Your doctor has placed you on progesterone therapy to help support your next pregnancy, which may help reduce the risk of another miscarriage. However, it is essential to continue to communicate openly with your healthcare provider about any symptoms or concerns. They may want to run some tests or perform an ultrasound to check the health of your uterus and ovaries before attempting to conceive again. Additionally, addressing any underlying health conditions and making lifestyle changes like eating a healthy diet, quitting smoking, and managing stress can improve your chances of having a successful future pregnancy. Ultimately, it's a good idea to consult with your healthcare provider for personalized guidance based on your specific circumstances."}
{"question": "Why there is a lump on my chest with offensive smell?I have a very tiny lump on my chest that sits under the skin. If I touch or squeeze it, it gives off an offensive smell. I have an implant in my right breast as was born with a deformity called Poland Syndrome. Could the smell have any connection to the implant? I have had this for approx 3yrs", "human": "Hi,The smell is likely to indicate an infection. If this is close to the implant then you should see a doctor as there is a risk that the implant may become infected. If you have had this problem for a number of years, this may indicate that a sinus or tract has formed under the skin. This may need to be treated with antibiotics or surgically excised. Regards,Dr K A Pottinger", "ai": " I'm not a doctor, but I can try to provide some information based on available resources. A foul-smelling lump under the skin, especially one related to a breast implant, can be concerning. Here are some possible explanations, but it's important to consult your healthcare provider for an accurate diagnosis.\n\n1. Infection: An infection in the breast implant or surrounding tissue can cause a foul smell. Symptoms might include redness, swelling, pain, or pus. However, some infections might be asymptomatic, which is why regular follow-up appointments with your healthcare provider are essential.\n\n2. Capsular Contracture: This is a complication where the scar tissue around the implant hardens and compresses the implant, sometimes causing pain or deformity. It's not commonly associated with a foul smell, but it's worth mentioning as a possible cause.\n\n3. Rupture or Leakage: If there's a rupture or leakage of the implant, it may release silicone or other components into the surrounding tissue, leading to an offensive smell or other symptoms like pain, swelling, or changes in breast shape.\n\n4. Necrosis: In rare cases, tissue death (necrosis) caused by implant placement, surgical complications, or poor blood supply can result in an offensive smell.\n\n5. Other causes: Less frequently, foul smells can be due to sweat, cysts, or other conditions.\n\nRegarding the Poland Syndrome, it is a rare congenital condition characterized by the absence or underdevelopment of the pectoralis major muscle on one side of the body. It does not significantly increase the risk of breast implant-related complications, although breast asymmetry and difficulty with breast feeding might influence the surgical approach or the patient's expectations.\n\nAs this is only informational, I strongly recommend visiting your healthcare provider to get a proper examination to rule out any serious conditions and discuss any concerns related to your breast implant."}

It's important to discuss any concerns you have with your doctor, as they have the most accurate information about your medical history and current situation.\n\nRegarding your question, Premoults are hormonal tablets used to alleviate the symptoms of premenstrual syndrome (PMS), such as cramps, mood swings, and breast tenderness. Whether or not you can continue taking it while trying to conceive depends on your doctor's recommendation and the specific brand of the medication.\n\nYour doctor may have prescribed it to manage heavy menstrual bleeding, which is not directly related to trying to conceive. However, it's critical to understand that hormonal birth control like Premoults can potentially affect ovulation and menstruation. They can also increase the risk of certain complications during pregnancy and the development of the fetus.\n\nIt's important to share your concerns with your doctor and discuss the possibility of changing medication or using alternative methods to manage your bleeding and PMS symptoms while trying to conceive. They may recommend other options to help manage your symptoms, such as dietary modifications or supplements, or other forms of hormonal medication that may be more suitable for your needs.\n\nI strongly recommend consulting your healthcare professional for personalized advice and guidance based on your medical history, symptoms, and current situation.

{"question": "Is it possible to get pregnant by having sex during menses?Hi Doctor,I have been having my menses regularly, until may, when I had it twice in one month, and since june, 11th, I have not stopped bleeding. Is it possible to get pregnant in such a situation? like if I have sexual intercourse even with the menses around?", "human": "Hello dearI understand your concernPregnancy is not occur when unprotected sex was done in and around period date.It is complete safe period and ovulation is not occur during this time.So no more fertilization will occur.Period twice in month could be due to hormonal imbalance, pelvic inflammatory disorder, vaginal infection, cervix, endometrial dysplasiaI would suggest to consult gynecologist for continuous bleeding and undergo examination, vaginal swab test, USG scan, PAP smear to confirm cause.progesterone pill will help you to stop bleeding.Maintain proper hygiene, eat healthy dietBest regardsDr. Sagar", "ai": " While it is theoretically possible for pregnancy to occur during menstruation due to the release of an egg before or after the onset of bleeding (a phenomenon known as ovulation earlier or later than expected), the likelihood is extremely low. The thick cervical mucus present during menstruation is not conducive to sperm survival, making conception unlikely during this time. Furthermore, the continuous bleeding you have been experiencing could indicate an underlying medical condition, such as a hormonal imbalance, that could impact your fertility, so it is important to consult a healthcare professional for evaluation. Regular menstrual cycles and pregnancies are typically associated with consistent ovulation, so I would advise focusing on that aspect of your reproductive health, rather than the possibility of conceiving during menstruation."}

However, it's important to note that other conditions can also cause hematuria, such as kidney stones, kidney disease, or even normal age-related changes. The fact that you had a bladder infection in the past and are experiencing blood in urine again, without other symptoms, could be related to the residual effects of the infection or a new infection. It's possible that the bacteria didn't get entirely eradicated during your previous treatment, or that you're experiencing a recurrent infection. It's essential to consult a healthcare professional to discuss your symptoms and undergo further testing, such as a urinalysis and urine culture, to determine the underlying cause. They may also recommend additional tests to rule out other potential causes."}

While H. pylori infection is mostly associated with gastrointestinal symptoms like abdominal pain, bloating, and loss of appetite, it can also cause liver enzyme elevations, including ALT and AST (aspartate aminotransferase). Liver function tests can be affected by various factors, including medications, alcohol use, viral infections, and other medical conditions.\n\nIt is worth noting that you mentioned taking multivitamins the previous day. Some multivitamins may contain herbs or other compounds that could potentially affect liver function tests. It is important to inform your healthcare provider about all medications, including over-the-counter supplements, that you are taking.\n\nYour symptoms and liver function test results warrant a thorough evaluation by a healthcare provider. Your healthcare provider may recommend additional tests, such as repeated liver function tests, viral hepatitis screening, autoimmune hepatitis testing, or an endoscopy to evaluate the stomach and upper intestinal tract for signs of inflammation or other conditions. It is essential to follow up with your provider to discuss your test results and establish an appropriate treatment plan.\n\nIn conclusion, while the elevated liver function test results in conjunction with a reactive H. pylori test are concerning, further evaluation is required to establish a definitive diagnosis and appropriate treatment plan. Your healthcare provider will determine the best course of action depending on the specific findings from your workup."}

If you are elderly , nothing to worry about. This is a process of coating of the internal layer of the aorta by atheromatous plaques and are found in many patients without any symptoms.This may be taken as a aging process provided you do not have any medical issues. If the integrity of the aorta is normal , just forget about this. If you are still bothered , consult a Cardiologist who would ask you to undergo few tests like blood lipid profile and may advise you to take some medicines like statins to reduce this .", "ai": " Abdominal aorta atherosclerosis refers to thehardening and narrowing of the walls of the abdominal aorta due to the build-up of plaque caused by the accumulation of cholesterol and other substances in the arterial wall. This condition is also known as atherosclerosis or arteriosclerosis.\n\nAn aneurysm, on the other hand, is a bulging or weakened area in the wall of an artery, caused by the pressure of blood flowing through it. An aneurysm can potentially rupture, leading to life-threatening internal bleeding.\n\nYour ultrasound result indicates that you have atherosclerosis in the abdominal aorta, but no aneurysm was found. This means that the walls of your abdominal aorta are hardened and narrowed due to plaque build-up, but the artery itself remains intact and is not enlarged or bulging.\n\nIt's important to understand that abdominal aorta atherosclerosis increases your risk for other complications such as blood clots, aneurysms, and even heart disease. However, not everyone with atherosclerosis in this area will develop these complications. Your healthcare provider can help you understand your risk factors and recommend appropriate treatments, such as lifestyle modifications like a healthy diet, regular exercise, smoking cessation, and reducing stress, as well as medical interventions like medication or surgery if necessary.\n\nIt's also a good idea to follow up with your healthcare provider for regular monitoring, as asymptomatic atherosclerosis can progress and become more severe over time.

Blood clots: In rare cases, swelling and pain in hands and feet can be a sign of deep vein thrombosis or blood clots. If you suspect this might be the cause, consult your doctor immediately.\n\nSome general tips for managing swollen hands and feet include:\n\n1. Elevate your legs and arms several times a day to help reduce inflammation and improve circulation.\n2. Wear loose-fitting clothing and comfortable shoes to avoid putting additional pressure on your hands and feet.\n3. Stay hydrated to prevent your body from retaining water.\n4. Avoid prolonged standing or sitting, especially in one position.\n5. Eat a healthy diet rich in fruits, vegetables, and whole grains to support your overall health and reduce inflammation.\n\nRemember that it's essential to consult with your healthcare provider for an accurate diagnosis and a personalized treatment plan based on your specific condition."}

Core stabilizing spine exercises will help.You may consult physiotherapist for guidance. He may start TENS, or ultrasound which is helpful in your case.If not relieved you can take epidural injection.Hope this helps. Wish you a speedy recovery.  Take care", "ai": " I am an AI language model and not a doctor, but I can try to provide you with some information that might help answer your question. Please keep in mind that this info is for educational purposes only and should not be considered medical advice.\n\nSpinal fusion is a surgical procedure used to join two or more vertebrae in the spine with the goal of preventing movement at that area. While it can help reduce pain and improve stability for some people, others may still experience discomfort, especially after prolonged sitting or standing.\n\nRegarding the use of an inversion table, inversion therapy can be beneficial for some individuals with back pain, as it can help decompress the spine, reduce pressure on the discs, and improve flexibility. However, individuals with spinal fusion surgery or other spinal conditions should consult their healthcare provider before using an inversion table to ensure it's safe for their specific situation.\n\nYour husband's large size and high blood pressure are two factors that should be considered before using an inversion table. The additional weight may put more strain on the device, while high blood pressure can increase the risk of dizziness or even fainting during inversion, which could lead to injury.\n\nTo minimize risks, it would be best for your husband to consult a healthcare professional, such as his surgeon or a physical therapist, before trying an inversion table. They can assess his overall condition, consider the specifics of his spinal fusion surgery, and provide personalized recommendations based on his unique circumstances.\n\nKey takeaways:\n\n* Always consult a healthcare professional before using an inversion table, especially if you have undergone spinal fusion surgery or have other health conditions like high blood pressure. They can help determine if it's safe for your specific situation and provide guidance on proper usage."}

Thank you.", "ai": " I'm an AI language model and I cannot prescribe or suggest any specific medication for your daughter without consulting a qualified healthcare professional. However, I can suggest some commonly used medications for psychiatric disorders that may serve as alternatives to Nexto (Nefazodone). It is crucial to remember that every individual's response to medication may vary, and consultations with her doctor are necessary to determine the best treatment for your daughter.\n\nBelow are some commonly used medications for anxiety and depression, which are some of the symptoms mentioned in your post:\n\n1. Selective Serotonin Reuptake Inhibitors (SSRIs): Commonly prescribed for depression and anxiety disorders, such as fluoxetine (Prozac), sertraline (Zoloft), paroxetine (Paxil), and escitalopram (Lexapro).\n\n2. Tricyclic antidepressants (TCAs): While they are older drugs used for depression, they also have anxiolytic properties, such as clomipramine (Anafranil).\n\n3. Benzodiazepines: These medications are used for short-term treatment of anxiety and sleep distress, such as diazepam (Valium) and alprazolam (Xanax). However, they have known addictive properties and might not be a first choice in your daughter's case if she's already going through significant psychiatric issues.\n\n4. Monoamine oxidase inhibitors (MAOIs): These drugs, like phenelzine (Nardil), are used for severe depression, but they need careful consideration as they have a long list of drug interactions, dietary restrictions, and potential side effects.\n\n5. Buspirone: A benzodiazepine receptor partial agonist that is primarily used to treat anxiety disorders. It does not have sedative properties and may take several weeks to effectively manage the symptoms of anxiety.\n\n6. Quetiapine: Atypical antipsychotic medication used to treat anxiety and sleep disturbances. It has sedative properties and may cause weight gain as a side effect.\n\n7. Antipsychotic drugs: While used mainly for psychosis and delirium, some types, like olanzapine, quetiapine, and risperidone, are sometimes prescribed off-label for anxiety and sleep disorders.\n\n8. Mood stabilizers: They are used primarily in bipolar disorders; however, some of them like lithium and valproate may be beneficial for treating anxiety and sleep disorders, as well.\n\nKeep in mind that this is just a starting point, and there are plenty of other treatments available, including therapy, psychotherapy, lifestyle modifications, medication, and complementary therapies like mindfulness meditation, acupuncture, and yoga. It's important to consult with her healthcare professional for a proper evaluation and treatment options tailored to your daughter."}

Cracked tooth: A crack or fracture in the tooth or the existing restoration (cap) can lead to toothache.\n3. Gum inflammation or infection: The gap between your gums and the cap might be due to receding gums, and these gaps can collect bacteria, leading to gum inflammation and toothache.\n4. Sinusitis: In some cases, sinus issues can cause toothaches, especially in the upper back molars, and might feel like they're coming from the treated tooth.\n5. Bruxism: Grinding or clenching of the teeth can put pressure on the treated tooth, causing sensitivity and discomfort.\n\nIt's essential to consult your dentist or endodontist for an accurate diagnosis.

However, it's important to note that a small lump in the cheek could be caused by a variety of conditions, some of which may be serious, and it's essential to get it checked out by a healthcare professional for an accurate diagnosis.\n\nThe tingling sensation you described could be a sign of nerve involvement, and this could potentially be related to a condition such as trigeminal neuralgia or multiple sclerosis. However, it's also possible that the tingling is not related to the lump at all but is a separate issue.\n\nOne common cause of a lump in the cheek is a salivary gland stone or blockage. Salivary glands are located throughout the mouth, including in the cheeks, and issues with these glands can cause lumps or swelling. Other potential causes could be benign growths such as a lipoma or a cyst.\n\nAs for mouth cancer, it's important to note that mouth cancer can present with a variety of symptoms, including lumps or swelling in the mouth or throat, pain or persistent soreness, and changes in the color or texture of the tongue or lining of the mouth. However, a small lump that's only noticeable with pressure and doesn't cause any other symptoms is less likely to be mouth cancer compared to other more concerning signs.\n\nAgain, it's crucial to speak with a healthcare professional for an evaluation to determine the exact cause of the lump and any associated symptoms. Your doctor may perform a physical exam, blood tests, or imaging tests such as an ultrasound or CT scan to help make a diagnosis."}

Pleurisy: Pleurisy is an inflammation of the lining of the lungs and the inner surface of the chest wall. It can cause pain upon breathing, coughing, or yawning.\n2. Costochondritis: Costochondritis is an inflammation of the cartilage that connects the ribs to the breastbone. It can cause pain and tenderness in the upper left abdomen, particularly when taking deep breaths or coughing.\n3. rib injury: Rib injuries can cause pain and tenderness in the upper left abdomen.

Additionally, every pregnancy is unique, and your healthcare provider is the best person to advise you on this specific issue based on your individual circumstances.\n\nHowever, I can provide you with some general information about Amitriptyline and pregnancy. According to the FDA, Amitriptyline is a pregnancy category C medication. This means that there is some evidence of risk to the developing fetus, but the benefits of the drug may outweigh the risks in certain situations.\n\nThe American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists (ACOG) states that selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), which Amitriptyline is an older tricyclic antidepressant, are generally considered safe for use during pregnancy. However, the use of Amitriptyline specifically during the third trimester is not well-studied, and there have been reports of neonatal adaptation syndrome, including respiratory distress, agitation, irritability, and seizures in newborns following maternal use of tricyclic antidepressants.\n\nGiven your situation, it is recommended that you consult your healthcare provider about the risks and benefits of continuing your Amitriptyline use during your pregnancy and the potential risks of abrupt discontinuation. Your healthcare provider can help you weigh the potential risks to both you and your baby and determine the best course of action based on your individual circumstances. Listen to their guidance and make an informed decision with their support.\n\nIt's important to note that experiencing difficulty sleeping two nights in a row is not necessarily a reason to stop taking a medication without your healthcare provider's recommendation. Sleep disturbances, especially when related to anxiety, can have various causes, and discontinuing your medication may not address the root cause of your sleep difficulty. Always seek the advice of your healthcare provider before making any changes to your medication regimen."}

However, it's important that you consult with a healthcare professional for an accurate diagnosis.\n\nThe pain you're experiencing could be related to kidney stones, which can cause severe pain in the kidney area and occasionally in the testicle, especially in men. Other possible causes of pain in both areas include:\n\n1. Urinary tract infection (UTI): Pain in the kidney area and testicle could be a sign of a UTI. Symptoms of a UTI include a frequent and strong urge to urinate, a burning sensation while urinating, cloudy or strong-smelling urine, and pain or discomfort in the lower back, sides, and abdomen.\n2. Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS): Sometimes, abdominal pain can radiate to the testicle area, particularly in men. IBS is a chronic condition that affects the digestive system and can cause cramping, bloating, and diarrhea.\n3. Hernia: A hernia occurs when an organ or tissue protrudes through a weak spot in the abdominal wall. Hernias can cause pain or discomfort in the testicle area, especially when standing, lifting heavy objects, or straining during a bowel movement.\n\nThe fact that you've been administered acidity medication and experienced pain relief briefly suggests that your symptoms could be related to acid reflux or gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD).

Tumor is any abnormal growth of the normal tissue resulting in uncontrolled and unwanted proliferation in a normal tissue.. A growth from the lining of the tissue is known as cancer while the growth from the connective tissue/muscles is known as sarcoma.. Hope you have understood that...", "ai": " I'm not a doctor, but I can try to help clarify the difference between a tumor and cancer. A tumor is an abnormal growth of cells, which can be benign (non-cancerous) or malignant (cancerous). Cancer is a specific type of tumor where the cells have the ability to invade nearby tissues and spread to other parts of the body.\n\nRegarding your mother's diagnosis of heterogenous myometrium, it is a type of uterine tumor. However, the term \"heterogenous\" suggests that the tumor may have different areas of cellular growth, some of which may be cancerous and some benign. The only way to determine for certain if the tumor is cancerous is through further testing and evaluation by a healthcare professional. If your mother has not already, she may undergo additional tests such as a biopsy to determine the exact nature of the tumor. I would encourage her to discuss any concerns or questions she may have with her doctor."}

The exact cause of this phenomenon is not well understood, but it's thought to relate to focusing one's attention on the task at hand, which can help to reduce tremors.\n\nMedications, such as levodopa and dopamine agonists, are the most common treatment for Parkinson's disease tremors. They work by increasing the levels of dopamine in the brain, which helps to improve the control of movements. Injected forms of these medications can be highly effective at controlling tremors, especially in the early stages of the disease.\n\nDeep brain stimulation (DBS) is another treatment option for Parkinson's disease tremors, particularly for severe cases that don't respond to medications. DBS involves the implantation of electrodes deep in the brain and the delivery of electrical signals to specific areas. It's generally considered safe and effective, but it does involve surgery and carries some risks.\n\nThere are also non-pharmacological approaches that can help to reduce tremors, such as physical therapy, occupational therapy, and relaxation techniques, like progressive muscle relaxation and mindfulness meditation. These methods can help to improve overall functioning and quality of life.\n\nIt's important that your friend consults with their healthcare provider for personalized treatment recommendations. The healthcare provider can evaluate the severity of the tremors and determine the most effective treatment approach based on individual needs, responses to medication, and other factors."}

However, it's important to consult a healthcare professional for an accurate diagnosis.\n\n1. Dark urine: Several factors can cause dark urine. Sometimes it's a harmless condition, like consuming foods with natural coloring, such as beets or rhubarb. But it can also be a sign of more serious conditions, such as liver problems, dehydration, or certain medication side effects.\n\n2. Thick semen discharge: An occasional change in the consistency of semen is normal. However, consistently thick semen may be a sign of a condition such as prostatitis, a bacterial infection of the prostate gland, or other less common causes such as cystic fibrosis or chronic granulomatous disease.\n\n3. Yellow cast on whites of eyes: A yellowing of the whites of the eyes, also known as icterus, can be a sign of jaundice, which is caused by an obstruction or problem in the liver or gallbladder.\n\n4. Vomiting and queasiness: These symptoms could be related to an upset stomach or gastrointestinal issues, such as food poisoning or an ulcer. They could also be a sign of a more serious condition, such as hepatitis or pancreatitis, which could be related to the other symptoms you're experiencing.\n\nGiven the combination of these symptoms, it would be a good idea for you to make an appointment with your healthcare provider to have them evaluated. They can order any necessary tests or consult with specialists to help determine the underlying cause of your symptoms. Some common tests to evaluate these symptoms include a liver function test, complete blood count, and urinalysis."}
{"question": "When can walking be resumed after surgery?Hi, i broke my tibia bone while sprinting, it got operated and they kept 2 screws inside, this is about 5 weeks back, how long does it take to resume walking ? And is it true that, surgical procedure of tibia fracture leads to arthritis in future ? Thanks Joe", "human": "Hi, Two to months immobilization is required generally. Physiotherapy is required to regain full range of motion. Hope I have answered your query. Let me know if I can assist you further. Regards,Dr. Shinas Hussain,General & Family Physician", "ai": " Hello Joe, I'm an assistant and not a doctor, but I can try to provide some general information based on common recovery timelines and research regarding tibia fractures and arthritis. However, each case is unique, and I strongly recommend consulting your healthcare provider for personalized advice.\n\nRegarding your question about resuming walking after tibia fracture surgery, the recovery process can vary depending on the severity of the fracture, the location of the fracture, and individual healing rates. Generally, patients may start putting weight on their operated leg within a few days or weeks, depending on their doctor's recommendations.\n\nMost patients may be able to walk without assistance or a brace around 8-12 weeks after surgery, depending on their individual progress. However, this is just a rough estimate, and your doctor may advise a different timeline based on your specific case.\n\nAs for your question about arthritis, it's true that a tibia fracture can increase the risk of developing post-traumatic arthritis (PTA), but the precise risk depending on factors like the type and location of the fracture is not definitively known. According to research, the risk of PTA is generally lower for tibial plateau fractures compared to more complex or comminuted fractures. Additionally, older age, high-energy mechanisms (such as falls from heights), and residual instability or malalignment following surgery may increase the risk of developing PTA.\n\nThat being said, it's essential to follow your doctor's recommendations for rehabilitation and physical therapy after tibia fracture surgery to minimize the risk of complications. While the potential risk of developing arthritis is a valid concern, it's important to maintain a positive attitude, follow your treatment plan faithfully, and keep in touch with your healthcare provider to address any questions or concerns you might have.\n\nAgain, this is just general information, and I highly recommend discussing your specific case with your healthcare provider if you have any doubts or questions. They can provide the most accurate and personalized advice to help guide you through your recovery."}

Many small lumps, such as cysts, can be harmless and may go away on their own. Furthermore, your description of the lump doesn't indicate any symptoms of infection, such as redness, warmth, or pus.\n\nHowever, it's still a good idea to keep an eye on the lump and monitor any changes in size, shape, or symptoms.

Seek professional help for yourself, such as counseling or support groups, to help you cope and manage your emotions.\n\nAs for a specific doctor, I would recommend starting with their primary care physician, who can help coordinate care and refer them to a mental health professional if needed. You can also ask for recommendations from their mental health insurance provider or from other healthcare professionals, such as their general practitioner or a trusted therapist."}

Hope I have answered your query. Let me know if I can assist you further. RegardsDr.Saranya Ramadoss, General and Family Physician", "ai": " Lactacyl, also known as D-lactose or lactulose, is a medicine used to stimulate the production of breast milk. Lactacyl capsules contain lactulose, which is a type of sugar that is not digested by the body but instead acts as a laxative and is fermented by bacteria in the colon to increase the production of stomach acid and intestinal motility, leading to an increase in milk production.\n\nThe use of Lactacyl for a prolonged period has been generally considered safe during breastfeeding, and studies have not shown significant side effects in lactating women or their babies if the medication is used according to the recommended dosage (usually 2-6 tablets daily, spaced throughout the day).\n\nHowever, some common side effects of Lactacyl use may include:\n\n* Abdominal discomfort (such as bloating, gas, and diarrhea)\n* Nausea\n* Abdominal cramps\n* Laxative effects (increased frequency or volume of bowel movements)\n\nThese side effects are generally mild and usually improve over time or with dose adjustment. However, they may be more pronounced if you are taking other medications that have similar side effects, or if you have underlying gastrointestinal conditions.\n\nIt is essential to discuss the use of Lactacyl with your healthcare provider to determine if it is the right choice for you and your baby, especially if you plan to use it for an extended period. Your healthcare provider can help you weigh the potential benefits and risks, and they may recommend alternative strategies to increase milk production if Lactacyl is not an option or if you experience significant side effects.\n\nIt's also important to note that some studies suggest that prolonged use of medications to increase milk production, including Lactacyl, may be associated with some rare but serious side effects such as liver damage. However, these cases are rare, and the risk appears to be higher when the medication is taken in higher doses than recommended.\n\nIn summary, taking Lactacyl capsules for 6 months while breastfeeding your baby may be safe, but it is essential to discuss this with your healthcare provider to determine the appropriate dosage and monitor for any side effects. Remember that it is always best to consult your healthcare provider for personalized advice based on your specific situation."}

I assume you have already tried over-the-counter acne products, such as benzoyl peroxide or salicylic acid, if your doctor has diagnosed you with acne or something similar to it. Here are some additional treatments that your doctor might recommend based on your specific condition:\n\n1. Prescription topical medications: Your doctor might prescribe a stronger topical medication, such as a retinoid or a topical antibiotic, to help control acne. Topical prescription treatments can be more effective than over-the-counter options, but they may also have more side effects.\n\n2. Oral antibiotics: Oral antibiotics, such as tetracycline or doxycycline, can be prescribed to help fight the bacterial infection that contributes to acne. Be sure to take the entire prescription as directed, even if your acne clears up before you finish the medication.\n\n3. Isotretinoin: A potent oral medication, isotretinoin (also known as Accutane), is often recommended for severe acne that does not respond to other treatments.

Hormonal treatments, such as birth control pills, may help regulate hormones and improve acne symptoms.\n\n5. Chemical peels: A chemical peel can help remove the outer layers of skin, allowing new, clear skin to grow. Chemical peels can be performed in a doctor's office and may be helpful for treating acne and improving skin texture.\n\n6. Light and laser therapy: Light and laser treatments, such as blue light therapy or laser resurfacing, can help reduce acne bacteria and improve the appearance of acne scars.\n\n7.

Colorectal cancer that has spread to the liver (liver metastases) is a complex condition, and treatment options depend on the extent of the liver involvement, the patient's overall health, and the specific characteristics of the tumor.\n\n1. Chemotherapy: Your father has already been treated with chemotherapy, but the lack of improvement might indicate that the cancer is resistant to the specific drugs that were used or that the dosage was not sufficient. In such cases, a different chemotherapy regimen or targeted therapy can be considered. Some targeted therapies, such as monoclonal antibodies and tyrosine kinase inhibitors, can be more effective against certain types of colorectal cancer.\n\n2. Surgery: If your father's liver function improves enough, liver resection (hepatectomy) can be an option to remove the metastases, provided that enough healthy liver tissue remains. This approach might provide the best chance for a long-term remission, but it's only feasible for patients with limited metastatic involvement.\n\n3. Liver transplant: A liver transplant can also be considered forselected cases if the cancer has not spread beyond the liver, and the patient's overall health is sufficient to undergo the transplant procedure. This is usually a last resort, as it involves significant risks and long waiting times.\n\n4. Radiation therapy: Radiation therapy can be used to alleviate symptoms and improve quality of life by shrinking tumors, reducing pressure on organs, and improving jaundice.\n\n5. Supportive care: In cases where the cancer has advanced beyond curative treatments, supportive care can help manage symptoms, improve quality of life, and prolong survival. This may include medications to manage pain, nausea, and other symptoms, as well as emotional support and counseling.\n\n6. Clinical trials: Participating in clinical trials can also be an option, as they provide access to innovative treatments and therapies that may not be available through standard care.\n\nIt's important to discuss the available treatment options with your father's healthcare team, as they can provide a more accurate assessment of his condition and the potential benefits and risks of various treatment approaches.

In your case, some of the possible causes could be:\n\n1. Medications: The use of Flomax (tamsulosin) for lower urinary tract symptoms and the recent addition of Ambien (zolpidem) for sleep could be contributing factors. Both medications have side effects that can include rapid breathing.\n\n2. Emphysema: Having been diagnosed with Emphysema, a chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, could be causing rapid breathing as the disease progresses, making it increasingly difficult to breathe.\n\n3. Pain: Lower back pain may exacerbate your breathing by causing anxiety or stress, leading to rapid, shallow breaths.\n\n4. Anxiety: The fear and worry about your symptoms might be contributing to rapid breathing. In this case, your friend's suggestion of using Lorazapam (Ativan) for anxiety could be beneficial to help calm your mind and ease your breathing.\n\nHowever, it's essential to consult your healthcare provider promptly, especially considering the recent worsening of symptoms, a high blood pressure reading, and low oxygen level. They will be able to assess your condition, determine the underlying cause, and provide appropriate recommendations for treatment.

Nowadays there are many creams available which can decrease the scar marks. If I was your treating doctor, i would have given scarend cream for local application, this should be applied three times daily for a period of 6 months for satisfactory results.

I understand how challenging it can be to deal with something that bothers you, especially at a young age. I'm here to help you explore some possible options to help fade or minimize the appearance of the stitch marks without resorting to surgery.\n\nFirst, I would recommend trying over-the-counter scar treatment creams specifically formulated for reducing the appearance of scars. These creams often contain ingredients like silicone, vitamin E, and other natural antioxidants that can help improve skin texture, reduce redness, and promote the production of new skin cells.\n\nSome popular scar treatment creams include:\n\n1. Mederma Scar Cream: This cream contains onion extract, which is rich in antioxidants and helps to improve the appearance of scars.\n2. Cicacel Scar Gel: This water-based scar gel contains allantoin, which is known for its ability to soothe and promote the growth of new skin cells.\n3. ScarAway Silicone Scar Sheets: These sheets are adhesive and contain 100% silicone, which is an effective scar treatment that helps to keep the scar hydrated and reduce the appearance of scars.\n\nTo use the creams, apply a small amount to the stitch marks and gently massage it into the skin using circular motions. Be sure to follow the instructions on the packaging for best results.\n\nIt's important to note that scar treatment creams may take several weeks or even months to show significant results. Additionally, everyone's skin is different, so what works for one person may not work for another.\n\nAnother option to consider is wearing makeup to cover the stitch marks. Look for a lightweight, full-coverage foundation or concealer that matches your skin tone. Gently apply the makeup using a brush or sponge, being sure to blend it well around the edges of the mark.\n\nLastly, practicing self-care and self-compassion can help improve your self-esteem and build confidence. Remember that there is more to your identity than your physical appearance, and that everyone has unique features that make them special. Try engaging in activities that bring you joy, connecting with friends and family, and focusing on your strengths and accomplishments.\n\nI hope these suggestions help, and if you have any further questions or concerns, don't hesitate to ask!"}

It wasn't enough to cause an alarm but I am curious to know what could be the cause and if I can take this as a good sign.", "human": "Hi,I understand your concerns.Following is my reply:1)     It is normal to have light spotting during ovulationYou can contact me anytime directly to ask question by pasting following link in your browser:http://bit.ly/askdrsoumya", "ai": " Light vaginal bleeding after ovulation, also known as \" ovulation spotting\" or \" implantation bleeding,\" can have several possible causes. Here are some of the most common reasons for this type of bleeding:\n\n1. Implantation: If you are pregnant, implantation bleeding can occur when the fertilized egg implants itself in the uterine wall. Implantation bleeding is usually light and can occur anywhere from 10 to 14 days after ovulation.\n2. Hormonal shifts: Ovulation triggers the release of hormones like luteinizing hormone (LH) and progesterone, which can cause the cervix to become more permeable, leading to light bleeding.\n3. Cervical irritation: During ovulation, the cervix may become more open to allow the egg to pass through, which can cause slight irritation and bleeding.\n4. Cervical polyp: A small growth on the cervix can sometimes cause light bleeding after ovulation.\n5. Infection: An infection in the reproductive system can cause light bleeding after ovulation.\n\nIt's important to note that light bleeding after ovulation is not always a sign of pregnancy, and it can be normal for some women to experience it during their menstrual cycle. If you are trying to conceive and are concerned about vaginal bleeding after ovulation, it's a good idea to speak with your healthcare provider for more information and advice.\n\nIn your case, experiencing light bleeding one week after ovulation but one week before your period is due could be a sign of implantation bleeding or hormonal shifts.

The right side is 100.6 and the left side is 99.2. Do you know why there will be a difference in temperature between the left and the right side. Also, which one should we consider has her temperature. The right side or the left side.", "human": "Hi.... this sort of differential temperature is quite common in children. This is because of varying blood supply to the particular areas. So do not worry about this. After checking you need to err on the higher temperature side and treat her as such. You can give Paracetamol at the appropriate dose if temperature is more than hundred degrees Fahrenheit every 4-6 hour early.Regards - Dr. Sumanth", "ai": " A temperature difference between the left and right sides of the body in a young child is not uncommon and can have several causes. Here are some possibilities:\n\n1. Individual temperature variations: The body temperature can vary slightly between different parts of the body. This is due to the distribution of blood flow and metabolic activity.\n2. Thermoregulation: The body constantly works to maintain a stable core temperature. When the body is trying to cool down, blood may flow away from the extremities (hands and feet) to the core, resulting in cooler temperatures in those areas.\n3. Infection: An infection in one area of the body can cause an localized increase in temperature, leading to a difference between the left and right sides.\n4. Environmental factors: Drafts, hot or cold surfaces, and other environmental factors can cause temperature differences between different parts of the body.\n\nIn the case of your 19-month-old, it is important to monitor her temperature closely and consult with a healthcare professional if her temperature continues to be elevated or if she appears ill. A single temperature reading should not be relied upon exclusively, and both temperature readings should be taken into consideration when assessing her overall temperature. However, the right temperature reading (100.6 degrees Fahrenheit) is generally more representative of her core body temperature and should be given more weight in this assessment. If you are concerned about the temperature difference or her overall health, you should speak with a healthcare professional for advice."}
{"question": "How can swelling and pain in the jawbone be treated?My son had his wisdom teeth pulled yesterday he is experiencing swelling and jawbone on the outside feels like someone punched him, his gums are tender, also stitches feel tight, his jawbone hurts on the inside but more nuisance pain  but certain positions make the stitches feel like they are pulling no excurating pain", "human": "Hello,Pain and swelling just a day after a wisdom tooth extraction is not abnormal. It is commonly seen due to inflammation of tissues post-extraction, and at times swelling also occurs due to hematoma formation. So all the symptoms that he is facing are not abnormal and will get better in a period of about a week to ten days. So, for now, he should do cool compresses over the swelling. Take a combination of antibiotics like Augmentin and anti-inflammatory painkillers like Ibuprofen. After 48 hours start doing warm saline gargles. Hope I have answered your query. Let me know if I can assist you further.Regards,Dr. Honey Arora", "ai": " After having wisdom teeth extracted, it's normal to experience some swelling and discomfort in the jaw area. Here are some ways to help alleviate the symptoms and promote healing:\n\n1. Apply ice: Applying ice packs to the affected area for 15-20 minutes at a time can help reduce swelling and numb the pain. Do this every hour or as needed for the first 24 hours after the procedure.\n2. Pain relief: Your dentist or oral surgeon may prescribe pain medication or recommend over-the-counter pain relievers to help manage the discomfort. Be sure to follow the instructions carefully.\n3. Soft foods: Avoid hard, crunchy, or chewy foods for a few days following the procedure. Stick to soft foods like yogurt, pudding, scrambled eggs, or soups.\n4. Proper hygiene: Keep the extraction site clean to prevent infection. Rinse your mouth gently with warm water several times a day, and be careful when brushing near the area to avoid irritating the gums or dislodging the stitches.\n5. Relax the jaw: Clenching or grinding your teeth can cause additional pain and strain the jaw muscles. Try to relax your jaw by keeping your teeth slightly apart and avoiding activities that require prolonged jaw movement, like singing or playing a wind instrument.\n6. Avoid tobacco and alcohol: Avoid smoking or using tobacco products and limit your alcohol intake for at least 24 hours after the procedure. These substances can increase the risk of complications and slow the healing process.\n7. Get enough rest: Ensure that your son gets plenty of rest to help his body recover from the surgery.\n8. Follow-up appointment: If the symptoms persist or worsen after a few days, contact your dentist or oral surgeon for a follow-up appointment to check on the healing process and address any concerns."}

However, I can give you an idea of what the lesion could potentially be based on its appearance.\n\nThe lesion in the image appears to be raised, irregular in shape, and has a rough, uneven surface with a reddish color. This could suggest that it is a type of chronic skin condition, such as a seborrheic keratosis, a squamous cell carcinoma, or a benign or malignant pyogenic granuloma.\n\nHowever, it is important to note that a definitive diagnosis can only be made by a qualified healthcare professional after a thorough examination and consultation. If you are concerned about this lesion, I strongly recommend that you see a doctor for a proper evaluation as soon as possible. This is especially important since the lesion has been present for a long time and has not been examined before.\n\nIn the meantime, you can take some general precautions to protect your skin, such as using sun protection, avoiding trauma to the area, and practicing good hygiene.

{"question": "How many times can contraceptive pills be taken?i had unprotected sex on the 23rd December 2013 and i used the emergency contraceptive and again on the 1st of January 2014 ihad unprotectd sex before my period starts. My question is can i use the emergency contraceptive gain while i did not get period? i am very afraid i will fall pregnant", "human": "Hello,I have gone through your query and understood the concern. There is no need to use an emergency contraceptive pill around the menstrual period because this is the safe period. Ovulation occurs two weeks prior to the onset of the next period and this is the fertile period. So, in the manner you have described, you cannot get pregnant and hence, there is no need to worry. Also, restrict the use of emergency contraceptive pills to once or twice a year since they have a high hormone content and hence disturb the hormone milieu of the body badly. Hope this helps.", "ai": " I am an AI language model and cannot provide medical advice or definitive answers to your specific situation. However, I can provide you with some general information about emergency contraceptives and how they work.\n\nEmergency contraceptives, also known as \"morning-after pills,\" are medications taken after unprotected sex to prevent pregnancy. There are different types of emergency contraceptives, and they work in slightly different ways.\n\nThe most common type of emergency contraceptive is called \"levonorgestrel,\" which works mainly by preventing ovulation (the release of an egg from the ovary) or preventing fertilization (the joining of sperm and egg). Levonorgestrel can be taken up to 5 days after unprotected sex. However, its effectiveness decreases the longer you wait after having sex.\n\nIdeally, you should take emergency contraceptives as soon as possible after unprotected sex. In your case, you took it on December 23, 2013, and again on January 1, 2014, after having unprotected sex before your period started. If you have not yet had your period by the time you are asking this question, it is possible that you may have conceived despite using emergency contraceptives.\n\nHowever, it is important to note that taking emergency contraceptives multiple times in a short period does not increase the risk of side effects or health problems, beyond the usual risks associated with emergency contraceptives, which include nausea, dizziness, headaches, and breast tenderness.\n\nIf you are very concerned about the possibility of pregnancy, I would recommend that you consult with a healthcare professional or a family planning clinic for advice. They can perform a pregnancy test or provide you with more information based on your specific medical history and circumstances. It is also important to use reliable forms of contraception to prevent unintended pregnancies in the future."}

Your child's pediatrician will be able to narrow down the potential causes based on a thorough evaluation.\n5. Seek additional opinions if needed: If you are still concerned about your child's lymph nodes, you may want to consider seeking a second opinion from a specialist, such as a pediatric oncologist or a pediatric ear, nose, and throat (ENT) doctor.\n\nRemember, it's important to trust your instincts as a parent, but also rely on the expertise of medical professionals to make informed decisions about your child's health. If you have any concerns, speak to your child's healthcare provider to address your questions and alleviate your worries."}

Inmeantime I will suggest to do these remedies like do warm saline rinaes 2 -3 times a day , you can apply gum paint like stolin on inflamed gum , maintain proper oral hygiene , use mouthwash chlorhexidine regularly .Hope this will help you.", "ai": " The sore patches around your tooth could be caused by several factors. Here are some common conditions that can cause gum tenderness, swelling, and the development of sore or white spots:\n\n1. Gingivitis: This is the earliest stage of gum disease, which causes inflammation and redness of the gums. It can progress to more severe periodontal diseases if left untreated. Though food isn't stuck, irritation and inflammation can cause the gums to appear swollen, sore, or develop white, jelly-like patches (gingival hyperplasia).\n\n2. Periodontal (gum) disease: If gingivitis is not treated, it can progress to periodontal disease, which affects the structures supporting your teeth. Pockets may form between the tooth and gum, and your gums may recede. At this stage, you can notice sore or infected gums, pus, and possibly a greyish color to the area.\n\n3. Trauma or injury: Injuries to the gums can cause painful sores, redness, and swelling around the affected tooth.\n\n4. Hormonal changes: During pregnancy or hormonal changes due to menopause, women may experience gum tenderness, swelling, and the development of sore patches similar to those described.\n\n5. Nutritional deficiencies: Deficiencies in vitamin C, iron, or other essential nutrients can weaken your immune system and gum tissue, making you more susceptible to gum infections and soreness.\n\nIt's essential to visit your dentist or dental hygienist to determine the exact cause and receive proper treatment as soon as possible. If you have an infection, delaying treatment could lead to increased damage to the gum tissue and supportive structures around your tooth. Your healthcare provider may recommend deep cleaning methods, medication, or surgery if the condition has progressed to severe gum disease."}

{"question": "Is it possible to have trigeminal neuralgia like symptoms with supraclinoid aneurysm?Seeking a neurosurgeon to answer my question. Is it possible to have trigeminal neuralgia like symptoms with supraclinoid aneurysm? Symptoms include constant dull ache in face like a tooth ache (dentists have confirmed zero issues with teeth - and physician has recommended CT as he believes it to be TN). No burning sensation.  Dull ache is accompanies by ocean wave that ends with a stab. Then it repeats itself or does not. Thank you.", "human": "hi trigeminal is not related to any supraclinoid aneurysm kindly take some opiod drug u have pain is there it will subsided by itself", "ai": " A supraclaimoid aneurysm is a type of intracranial aneurysm that develops above the clival segment of the carotid artery. Trigeminal neuralgia (TN), also known as tic douloureux, is a neuropathic pain condition that affects the trigeminal nerve, which is responsible for sensation in the face. While both conditions involve facial pain, they have different underlying causes.\n\nTrigeminal neuralgia is typically characterized by brief, intense electric shocks or burning sensations in the distribution of the trigeminal nerve. These symptoms are usually provoked by light touch, brushing, or other minor stimuli. In contrast, the facial pain associated with a ruptured or unruptured supraclinoid aneurysm can be more constant and dull, similar to a toothache. The pain may also be accompanied by other symptoms, such as visual disturbances or motor weakness, depending on the location and size of the aneurysm.\n\nIt is possible to have facial pain that resembles trigeminal neuralgia as a symptom of a supraclaimoid aneurysm. However, the presence of a constant dull ache without the typical burning or electric shock sensations, along with the absence of definitive dental causes, may suggest an alternative explanation. If a CT scan has been recommended to rule out other causes, it would be important to follow that advice and consult a neurosurgeon for further evaluation and management options. A neurosurgeon can provide a more definitive diagnosis based on a thorough clinical evaluation, imaging studies, and other diagnostic tests if necessary."}

While it is possible for kidney problems to cause such symptoms, they are not the only potential cause. Here are a few common causes of lower back pain that you may want to consider:\n\n1. Muscle or ligament strain: Lifting heavy objects, sudden twisting or bending, or poor posture can cause strain in the muscles and ligaments of the lower back, leading to sharp pains.\n\n2. Herniated or bulging discs: The discs in your spine can bulge or herniate, putting pressure on the surrounding nerves and causing sharp pain, tingling, or numbness in the lower back and/or legs.\n\n3. Spinal stenosis: This condition narrows the spinal canal, putting pressure on the nerves and causing pain, especially when sitting or standing for long periods.\n\n4. Kidney stones: Kidney stones can cause severe pain in the side or back, which may be sharp, throbbing, or cramping. Other symptoms can include frequent urination, pain during urination, and blood in the urine.\n\n5. Urinary tract infection: A urinary tract infection (UTI) can cause pain and discomfort in the lower back and side, especially during urination. Other symptoms may include frequent urination, strong-smelling or cloudy urine, and pelvic pain.\n\nSince your symptoms include sharp pain on the left side of your lower back, it's worth considering a potential kidney issue.

A hemoglobin level of 12.2 g/dL is considered low and falls below the normal range, indicating that your body may not be getting enough oxygen to function properly.\n\nThe symptoms you are experiencing, such as fatigue, weight loss, and yellowish eyes and skin, are common signs of anemia. The severity of anemia can vary depending on the individual and the underlying cause. In your case, a hemoglobin level of 12.2 g/dL is considered mild anemia. However, even mild anemia can have adverse effects on your daily life and ability to perform physical activities.\n\nIt is important to follow up with your healthcare provider for further evaluation and treatment options. Anemia can be caused by various underlying conditions, such as nutritional deficiencies (iron, vitamin B12, folic acid), chronic illnesses, heavy menstrual periods, or intestinal blood loss. Your healthcare provider may recommend dietary changes, iron supplements, or other treatments depending on the underlying cause. In some cases, hospitalization may be necessary if the anemia is severe or causing significant symptoms.\n\nIt is important to note that self-diagnosis is not recommended, and only a healthcare professional can make an accurate diagnosis and develop an appropriate treatment plan.If you have any concerns, please consult your physician for guidance."}
{"question": "Does valve replacement surgery cause blood loss?My father just had valve replacement surgery due to Rheumatic fever years ago.  He has severe anemia from blood loss and the DR. hopes to valve replacement will stop the blood loss.  Could that have been the cause of his blood loss?  Dr has tested everything else.", "human": "Valve replacement Surgery is major surgery and it involves significant blood loss. So if there is hemoglobin drop immediately after surgery then it is likely due to blood loss, it should improve with time and iron and folic acid supplements. he should consume green leafy vegetables, dates, meat which are rich in iron so hemoglobin will recover Early.", "ai": " Valve replacement surgery does involve some degree of blood loss, but it is typically managed during the procedure through various methods such as transfusions and techniques to minimize blood loss. Severe, ongoing blood loss after valve replacement surgery is not common, and it is more likely that your father's anemia was a pre-existing condition related to his history of rheumatic fever. It is important for him to work closely with his healthcare provider to determine the underlying cause of his anemia and receive appropriate treatment."}

I have gone through your question. I can understand your concern. You may have leiomyoma.  It is the benign tumour of smooth muscle.  Uterus is the most common site for it. You should go for myomectomy or hysterectomy according to your gynecologist advice.  Don't worry its totally curable.Hope I have answered your question, if you have doubt then I will be happy to answer. Thanks for using health care magic. Wish you a very good health.", "ai": " Fibroids are commonly occurring benign (non-cancerous) growths in the uterus made up of muscle and fibrous tissue. The exact cause of fibroids is not known, but several factors have been identified that may increase the risk of developing fibroids, including:\n\n1. Hormonal imbalances: Fibroids grow in response to hormones such as estrogen and progesterone.\n2. Family history: There is a higher risk of developing fibroids if a close family member has had them.\n3. Age: Women of childbearing age are most commonly affected.\n4. Ethnicity: African American women are more likely to develop fibroids than other racial and ethnic groups.\n5. Obesity: There is a higher risk of developing fibroids in overweight or obese women.\n\nAs for the small lump outside your uterus, it's important to wait for the results of further investigations by the gynaecologist. This could be a number of things, including an ovarian cyst or an abscess, and only a thorough examination can determine the exact cause.\n\nIt's understandable that you are worried, but it's important to remember that most fibroids are benign and do not pose a serious threat to your health. The gynaecologist will be able to discuss your specific situation with you and outline any treatment options that may be appropriate.\n\nIn the meantime, try to relax and focus on taking care of yourself. Eating a healthy diet, getting regular exercise, and maintaining a healthy weight can all help reduce the risk of developing fibroids in the future."}

If IVIg is administered then probably your child's treatment is going on in the right direction. I suggest you continue the same and I feel the child will get better. But if the child feels pain in the shoulder then it's a warning sign that there might be an impending respiratory failure.Regards - Dr. Sumanth", "ai": " Guillain-Barré Syndrome (GBS) is a neurological disorder characterized by muscle weakness, usually in the legs, followed by the arms and face. The symptoms typically progress over hours to days. In addition to the symptoms you mentioned (difficulty walking, sitting, and reduced hand grip strength), other signs of GBS include:\n\n* Reflexes that are absent or greatly reduced\n* Abnormal sensation such as tingling, prickling, or numbness\n* Pain\n* Paralysis, which may be total and may progress to involve the chest muscles that help with breathing\n\nThe diagnosis of GBS is based on clinical examination and certain diagnostic tests. Electromyography (EMG) and nerve conduction studies (NCS) are the most common diagnostic tests used. In your child's case, the reduction in CMAP amplitude (a measure of the muscle response to electrical nerve stimulation) with near-normal conduction velocities is a common finding in GBS. However, other conditions can also cause similar findings, so a definitive diagnosis of GBS requires other supportive findings on the EMG/NCS. Additionally, your child's doctor may also consider other tests, such as a lumbar puncture, to rule out other conditions. The doctor's clinical judgment and the progression of the symptoms will also play a role in the diagnosis.\n\nIt's important for your child to continue to receive appropriate medical care while further diagnostic tests are being performed. The treatment for GBS typically involves intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG) or plasma exchange, as in your child's case. These treatments help to reduce the inflammation and damage to the nerves. Close monitoring of your child's condition and regular follow-up with a neurologist will be necessary to ensure the best possible outcome."}

Diagnosis can confirmed after examination only. A neck lump may be a lymphnode swelling and other swelling on chest me be lipoma or other cyst like sebaceous cyst. Lymphnode sweliing may subside itself, but lipoma or sebaceous cyst needs excision.Thank You.", "ai": " I'm here to help answer any questions you may have, but it's important to note that I'm an AI language model and cannot provide medical advice or treatment recommendations. I can suggest some possible causes for neck and chest mobile lumps based on the information you've provided, and then you can discuss these possibilities with your healthcare provider for further evaluation and treatment.\n\nMobile lumps, or palpable masses that move beneath the skin, in the neck and chest area can have various causes. Some common causes include:\n\n* Lymph nodes: Lymph nodes are small, bean-shaped organs that filter lymph, a clear fluid that carries immune cells throughout the body. They are located throughout the body, including the neck and chest. Lymph nodes can become enlarged due to infections, inflammation, or as a response to cancer.\n* Cysts: Cysts are fluid-filled sacs that can develop under the skin. They can be caused by a variety of conditions, including hormonal imbalances, infections, and injury.\n* Lipomas: Lipomas are benign fatty tumors that form under the skin. They are usually soft and round, but they can sometimes feel firm or be misshapen.\n* Muscle or tendon strains or sprains: Injuries to the muscles or tendons in the neck or chest area can cause localized swelling and the development of mobile lumps.\n\nTo determine the cause of the mobile lumps, your healthcare provider may perform a physical exam, request medical imaging tests, or order laboratory tests. Treatment will depend on the underlying cause. For example:\n\n* Infections may be treated with antibiotics or antiviral medications.\n* Hormonal imbalances may be treated with hormone replacement therapy or other medications.\n* Cancer may require surgery, radiation therapy, chemotherapy, or a combination of these treatments.\n* Lipomas may be removed surgically if they are causing discomfort or if they are growing.\n* Injuries may be treated with rest, ice, compression, elevation, or other forms of therapy.\n\nIt's essential to see your healthcare provider for an evaluation if you are concerned about these mobile lumps. They may be benign, but it's best to have them checked out to ensure they are not a sign of a more serious underlying condition."}
{"question": "Is open heart surgery the only option for a liver biopsy?My sister has had 2 tubes put in her heart due to an infection. She has MRSA. She has gained 32 lbs, and the doctors say the antibiotics are not working. They are doing a liver biopsy. Say liver not making enough blood. Her heart is beating fine, and fear the infection is spreading through her body. Open heart surgery is the only option?", "human": "Hi and welcome to HCM Thanks for the query. I am not sure I understand your question,but liver biopsy can be done percotaneosly with needle and there is no need for open surgery. heart surgery for heart infection is rarely indicated and it should be done only if there is serious infection and heart valvulas disorders. Wish you good health. Regards", "ai": " A liver biopsy does not require open heart surgery. The two procedures are performed through different approaches. A liver biopsy involves taking a small sample of liver tissue to be analyzed for various conditions, such as hepatitis, cirrhosis, or liver cancer. This procedure is typically done using a thin needle guided by ultrasound or CT scan.\n\nOpen heart surgery, on the other hand, is a major surgical procedure that involves opening the chest and stopping the heart to repair damaged heart tissue. The two procedures are unrelated. It's essential to clarify this with your sister's healthcare team, as they may be able to perform the liver biopsy through a less invasive approach, such as using a transjugular liver biopsy or a percutaneous approach under local anesthesia, depending on her medical condition.\n\nGiven your sister's current medical situation, it is essential to discuss the safest and most appropriate options for her care with her healthcare team. It may be crucial to consider factors such as her infection status, her weight gain, and the liver function issues to determine the best way to proceed with the liver biopsy. They may also want to focus on addressing the underlying infection and ensuring she is in the best possible condition before performing the liver biopsy."}
{"question": "Q. Will Aspirin affect D-dimer test?Hi doctor,My pain started behind knee, but now is causing recurrent chest pains and shortness of breath. I could not do much physical activity. There is no previous history of such event. I am currently on Aspirin. I had an EKG, lung x-ray and D-dimer blood test. Is it possible to have a pulmonary embolism with negative D-dimer test? If the clot breaks or moving, then will D-dimer work? What else could cause pulmonary embolism like symptoms?", "human": "Hello. I have a few questions here, if you would not mind answering them: Revert back with the answers to the above questions to an internal medicine physician online --> https://www.icliniq.com/ask-a-doctor-online/internal-medicine-physician", "ai": " A. I'm unable to provide you with a definitive answer as I'm an artificial intelligence and not a doctor. However, I can provide you with some general information on the topic.\n\nAspirin, like other non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), can affect the results of a D-dimer test. D-dimer is a fibrin degradation product, and NSAIDs can interfere with the measurement of D-dimer levels in the blood. This is because NSAIDs can inhibit the activity of certain enzymes involved in the breakdown of fibrin, which can lead to increased levels of D-dimer in the blood.\n\nHowever, a negative D-dimer result does not completely rule out a pulmonary embolism, especially if there are other suspicious clinical findings or risk factors. A pulmonary embolism is a potentially life-threatening condition characterized by the sudden blocking of a major artery in the lung by a blood clot. Symptoms may include chest pain, shortness of breath, and rapid heart rate.\n\nIf a pulmonary embolism is suspected based on clinical symptoms and other imaging studies (such as a CT angiogram), anticoagulation therapy may be initiated even if the D-dimer result is negative. A negative D-dimer result may also be seen in patients with a moving or recently formed clot, and a repeat test may be necessary after several days to ensure accuracy.\n\nIt's important to note that there are other conditions that can cause symptoms similar to pulmonary embolism, such as pneumonia, pleurisy, and cardiac conditions. A thorough medical evaluation, including a complete history and physical examination, is necessary to accurately diagnose the underlying cause of symptoms.\n\nI would recommend following up with your healthcare provider for further guidance and to discuss any concerns regarding your test results and diagnosis. They will be able to evaluate your individual case and provide you with the most appropriate diagnostic tests and treatment options."}

Let me know if I can assist you further. Take care Regards,Dr Ilir Sharka, Cardiologist", "ai": " I'm an AI language model and not a doctor, but I can suggest some possible reasons why your father's heart function may have decreased based on the information you've provided. It's important to consult with your father's healthcare provider for accurate information. Here are some possibilities:\n\n1. Restenosis: This is the narrowing or blocking of an artery again after angioplasty or a stent has been placed. This can reduce blood flow to the heart and cause the heart to work harder, leading to a decrease in heart function. Your father may need additional tests, such as an angiogram, to determine if this is the cause.\n2. Complications from angioplasty or stent placement: Although angioplasty and stenting are common and generally safe procedures, they can have complications. For example, your father may have had damage to the heart muscle during the procedure. He may also have had a reaction to the contrast dye used during the echo test. These complications can affect heart function.\n3. Other cardiac conditions: A decrease in heart function can be caused by other cardiac conditions, such as heart valve problems or cardiomyopathy. Your father may need additional tests to determine if this is the case.\n4. Medications or lifestyle factors: Certain medications, such as diuretics or beta-blockers, or lifestyle factors, such as not getting enough rest or overexertion, can affect heart function. Your father's healthcare provider may need to adjust his medications or help him make lifestyle changes.\n\nIt's important that your father follow up with his healthcare provider to discuss the results of the echo test and determine the underlying cause of the decrease in heart function. Based on the cause, your father may need additional treatments, such as medications, additional procedures, or lifestyle changes."}
{"question": "What does dark oval shadow in x-ray after recovering from toe fracture indicate?Hi, my daughter 12 yr old just recovered from a small toe fracture. X ray after 5 weeks shows a dark oval shadow on the area of previous fracture. But the fracture has healed. I would like to know the reason for the dark shadow. What does it indicate?

In case your doubt still persisting then a CT scan can be taken. Hope I have answered your query. Let me know if I can assist you further. Regards,Jay Indravadan Patel, Physical Therapist or Physiotherapist", "ai": " The dark oval shadow on the x-ray of your daughter's healed toe fracture could indicate a few different things. Here are some possibilities:\n\n1. Callus or bone sclerosis: A callus is a hard, thickened area of bone, cartilage, or fibrous tissue that forms as a response to repeated pressure or trauma. Bone sclerosis is a condition where the bone becomes denser and harder than normal. Both callus and bone sclerosis can appear as densities or shadows on x-rays. The dark shadow in your daughter's x-ray could be due to the formation of a callus or increased bone density in the healing area.\n2. Soft tissue calcification: Calcification refers to the deposition of calcium salts in tissues where they are not normally found. Soft tissue calcification can occur in various tissues such as muscles, tendons, ligaments, and blood vessels. It can appear as densities or shadow on x-rays, especially if they are not specifically designed to image soft tissues. The dark shadow in your daughter's x-ray could be due to soft tissue calcification.\n3. Metal implant or foreign body: If your daughter had a screw or other metal implant placed during the surgical repair of her toe fracture, the dark shadow could be due to the metal itself on the x-ray. Alternatively, if she had a foreign body such as a splinter or a piece of glass lodged in the area of the fracture, it could also appear as a dark shadow on the x-ray.\n4. Malignant change: Although this is less likely given your daughter's age and the healing nature of the fracture, the dark shadow could be due to a malignant bone lesion such as osteosarcoma. However, this is a rare possibility and further investigations would be necessary to rule out this possibility.\n\nIf you are concerned about the dark shadow on the x-ray, you should discuss it with your daughter's doctor. They may recommend additional imaging studies such as a CT scan or an MRI to better evaluate the area and determine the cause of the shadow. Depending on the results of these studies, other investigations such as a biopsy may be necessary. However, based on the information you have provided, it is most likely due to a benign finding such as callus or soft tissue calcification."}

You need to attend an ER and get an ultrasound scan done to find the cause. Hope I have answered your query. Let me know if I can assist you further. Take care Regards,Dr Praveen Tayal, Orthopaedic Surgeon", "ai": " Given the symptoms of sudden onset left lower quadrant (LLQ) pain, decreased bowel sounds, rebound tenderness, andcolicky pain associated with vomiting in an 87-year-old patient with a normal temperature, slight dehydration, and a history of hypertension (HTN), possible causes include acute appendicitis, left-sided inflammatory conditions such as diverticulitis or Crohn's disease, or mesenteric ischemia.\n\nInitial management should include:\n\n1. NPO(nil per os): Withholding food and fluid intake to help reduce abdominal distension and reduce the workload on the gastrointestinal tract.\n2. Fluid Resuscitation: Maintain adequate intravascular volume to help manage possible hypovolemia from vomiting and maintain renal function.\n3. Laboratory investigations: Obtain laboratory tests such as complete blood count (CBC), metabolic panel, coagulation profile, liver function tests, urinalysis, and stool studies to help rule out various causes.\n4. Imaging: Obtain an abdominal X-ray to assess for bowel obstruction or free air, and a CT scan with contrast to better define the potential cause of the pain such as appendicitis, diverticulitis, or mesenteric ischemia.\n5. Consideration for antibiotics: Given the possibility of an infectious etiology, broad-spectrum antibiotics may be considered if there are signs of sepsis, systemic inflammation, or peritonitis.\n6. Close monitoring: Monitor vital signs, electrolyte levels, and symptoms closely to assess for any signs of clinical deterioration or need for surgical intervention.\n\nIt is important to note that this is a general guideline and individual patient factors may influence the choice of treatment. Consultation with a healthcare provider or a gastroenterologist is recommended for proper evaluation and management."}
{"question": "What causes pain under chest ribs and feeling air bubbles inside?Daughter is age 13 having gas bubble type pain under both sides just under her ribs. She said when she bends over the left side pain moves down in bottom of her tummy. Gave her gas relief pills. She's sleeping now. Should I worry or is this probably gas?", "human": "Hello!Thank you for asking on HCM!I understand your concern and would explain that her symptoms seem to be related to dyspepsia (troubles with indigestion) and the accumulation of gas in her intestine, leading to a distension of the diaphragm and pain in this region. A gastric disorder ( gastritis or gastro esophageal reflux) can't be excluded. The fact that her symptoms are modulated by the body movement is another argument in favor of these disorders, including possible musculo-skeletal pain. If her symptoms persist, I recommend consulting with the GP for a careful physical examination, a chest x ray, an abdominal ultrasound and some lab tests (complete blood count, kidney and liver function tests, fasting glucose, blood electrolytes) to rule out any other disorders related to this symptomatology.  A fibrogastroscopy may be necessary to exclude possible gastro-esophageal reflux. Hope to have been of help!Best wishes, Dr. Iliri", "ai": " I'm not a doctor, but I can try to help you understand some possible causes based on the information provided. The symptoms you described - pain under the ribs, feeling of air bubbles or bloating, and relief with bending over and passing gas - are common with gastrointestinal issues like gastritis, gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD), or intestinal gas buildup. In your daughter's case, since she is a teenager, these symptoms could be related to normal digestive processes, especially if she consumes foods that cause more gas or has eaten larger portions than usual.\n\nHowever, I would still recommend monitoring her symptoms carefully to ensure they don't worsen. If her discomfort persists after a few days or if her symptoms are severe or accompanied by other signs such as fever, loss of appetite, weight loss, or difficulty swallowing, you should consider consulting a healthcare professional. It's always better to be safe, especially if there's any concern.\n\nIt's also essential to ensure your daughter is maintaining an overall balanced and healthy diet, eating smaller meals, and avoiding foods that trigger excessive gas. Additionally, staying hydrated and practicing good posture while eating can help improve digestion and alleviate symptoms.\n\nRemember, I highly recommend consulting with a healthcare professional for medical advice and concerns, especially when it comes to your child's health."}
{"question": "What does sharp pain in the lower back upon sneezing indicate?I have sharp pain in my lower back when I sneeze or cough. I m thinking it is my kidneys. I have no history of kidney stones, however I do have a diagnosis of interstitial cystitis. I get chronic UTIs. I do not have one now. Just the pain in my back/kidneys. It is both sides. What could be causing this.", "human": "Hi,I understands your question and I will try to help you. simply your back pain with sneezing is mostly due to myositis or muscle spasm of back muscles.. I suggest using muscle relaxant and hot fomentation.", "ai": " The sharp pain you experience in your lower back upon sneezing or coughing does not necessarily indicate a kidney-related issue. While kidney pain can present with such symptoms, there are other potential causes. Since you have a diagnosis of interstitial cystitis and a history of chronic UTIs, it is essential to consider the possibility of an exacerbation of your condition.\n\nInterstitial cystitis is a chronic condition that affects the bladder and may cause pain in the pelvic area, including the lower back. This condition can be aggravated by various factors, including coughing or sneezing, which may increase abdominal pressure and put strain on the bladder and the surrounding muscles.\n\nAdditionally, the chronic UTIs may have damaged the surrounding kidney tissue, causing discomfort or pain, especially when there is an increase in pressure in the abdominal cavity, such as during a sneeze or a cough.\n\nIt is crucial to consult with your healthcare provider for a proper evaluation and diagnosis. They can perform a comprehensive examination, including a physical exam, a urinalysis, and imaging studies if necessary, to determine the underlying cause of your symptoms and develop an appropriate treatment plan."}
{"question": "Is pregnancy possible due to duphaston?i m trying to concieve since last 4 years,could not suceed,all tests are normal,doctor says we me and my husband both are alright for giving birth to child,this time  i m taking duphaston since 16 days from LMP,will i be pregnant this time,when shud i expect my periods if not pregnant", "human": "Hi,Duphaston contain progesterone and it will help you in become pregnant. It make uterine environment favorable for implantation and support pregnancy. You can ask for following medicine also:- clomiphene citrate: from 3rd to 8th day of cycle, it induce the ovulation and increase fertility- Ovacre tablet: it will again help to become pregnant by providing sufficient nutrient and mineral that require to become pregnant.Avoid stress, take healthy diet, drink plenty of water and do regular exercise. If pregnancy will not occur then consult infertility specialist for detailed examination. Investigation like reproductive hormone analysis, USG scan, ovarian follicle study, HSG, semen analysis will help you. Last option is in vitro fertilization, intrauterine insemination. Hope this may help you. Contact further if follow up needed.Best regards,Dr. Sagar", "ai": " Duphaston (clomiphene citrate) is a medication used to stimulate ovulation in women who have difficulty conceiving due to ovulatory disorders. It works by suppressing the hypothalamic and pituitary glands, which in turn stimulates the release of follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) and luteinizing hormone (LH) from the pituitary gland, leading to ovulation.\n\nWhile some women do get pregnant after taking clomiphene, it does not guarantee a pregnancy. The success rate of clomiphene in helping women get pregnant is around 10-20%, depending on the cause of infertility and other factors.\n\nThe timing of your period after taking clomiphene can vary, as it depends on when you ovulated during your cycle. If you do not get pregnant and ovulation does not occur, your period will typically start around 14 days after the end of clomiphene treatment. However, some women may experience an extended menstrual cycle or irregular bleeding after taking clomiphene, so it can be difficult to predict exactly when your period will start if you are not pregnant.\n\nIf you have been trying to conceive for 4 years and have undergone various tests with normal results, it may be worth considering other causes of infertility or exploring other treatment options with your healthcare provider. In vitro fertilization (IVF) or intrauterine insemination (IUI) may be more effective options for you. It's important to note, however, that these treatments can also have risks and costs involved. Consulting with a healthcare professional can help you determine the most appropriate next steps based on your individual situation."}

The normal blood pressure ranges are 125/85 mm Hg. For this reason, it is necessary for increasing the dose of your drugs or add new drugs in order to reach these levels. From the other hand, considering your young age, I would recommend performing further tests to investigate possible causes, underlying secondary hypertension:- complete blood count, PCR, ESR for inflammation- thyroid hormone levels for thyroid gland dysfunction- blood electrolytes for possible imbalance- kidney and liver function tests- cortisol and aldosterone plasma levels for adrenal gland dysfunction- urinary metanephrines for pheochromocytoma- fasting glucose- Doppler ultrasound of the renal arteries. Hope I have answered your query. Let me know if I can assist you further. Regards,Dr. Ilir Sharka, Cardiologist", "ai": " Normal blood pressure readings for an adult, including someone your age (25 years old), is typically less than 120/80 mmHg. However, your previous reading of 170/100 mmHg was significantly higher than normal and posed a risk for potential health complications. The current reading of 150/90 mmHg is an improvement, but it's important to note that your blood pressure should still be closely monitored.\n\nIf you have recently started taking Met XL 12.5 on alternate days, it may not be enough to effectively manage your blood pressure. Maintaining blood pressure control reduces the risk of developing complications such as stroke, heart attack, and kidney disease, so it's essential to consult with your healthcare provider for individualized advice on managing your blood pressure.\n\nYour healthcare provider may recommend changing the dosage, medication type, or frequency based on your current blood pressure readings and individual health factors. Regular monitoring, including follow-up appointments and home blood pressure readings, is crucial to ensure your blood pressure remains under control.\n\nRemember, it's important to adhere to your healthcare provider's instructions for medication use and follow any lifestyle modifications they recommend, such as a healthy diet, regular physical activity, and avoiding tobacco and excessive alcohol consumption, to help manage and reduce your risk of developing complications associated with high blood pressure."}

It's important to note that everyone's experience is unique, and only a healthcare professional can provide accurate information based on a thorough evaluation.\n\nHeadaches, anxiety, and panic attacks can have various causes and can influence each other in several ways:\n\n1. Anxiety and panic attacks can trigger headaches: Feeling anxious or experiencing a panic attack can lead to tension in the muscles in your neck, shoulders, and scalp, which can cause a headache. This is a common type of headache called a tension headache. Anxiety and panic can also increase the perception of pain, making a headache feel more intense.\n\n2. Headaches can trigger anxiety and panic attacks: Some types of headaches, particularly migraines, can cause feelings of fear, anxiety, or discomfort, leading to panic attacks. Fear of having another headache or the uncertainty of the cause can also fuel anxiety and panic.\n\n3. Certain medications used to treat anxiety, depression, and headaches can cause side effects: For example, some antidepressants (like duloxetine) and blood pressure medications (like hydrochlorothiazide) can cause headaches as side effects. These side effects can sometimes be more noticeable in people with anxiety or panic disorders, as the symptoms can be mistaken for an anxiety attack or a recurrence of their condition.\n\n4. Underlying medical conditions: Coexisting medical conditions such as hypertension or vascular diseases can cause both headaches and anxiety/panic attacks. In your case, the high blood pressure reading might be contributing to both the headache and anxiety symptoms.\n\n5. Other potential causes: Other factors like dehydration, stress, poor sleep, and certain foods can cause both headaches and anxiety/panic symptoms.\n\nSince you mentioned that your blood pressure is elevated, it might be a good idea to talk to your doctor about this and explore possible causes, such as medication non-compliance, stress, or other underlying conditions. They may consider adjusting your medications or recommending additional treatments.\n\nIf you continue experiencing symptoms, keep track of your symptoms and discuss any concerns with your healthcare professional. They can help determine the cause and recommend appropriate treatments."}

Identify and avoid triggers: If your partner identifies any triggers that worsen the rash (such as certain foods, materials, or environmental factors), he should avoid them to prevent further irritation.\n5. Take over-the-counter antihistamines: Over-the-counter antihistamines, such as diphenhydramine (Benadryl), can help alleviate the itch and reduce inflammation. However, talk to a doctor before taking antihistamines, especially if your partner has any underlying health conditions or if the symptoms are severe.\n6. Wear loose-fitting clothing: Wearing loose, breathable clothing can help reduce irritation and prevent the rash from becoming rubbing against fabric.\n\nIf the rash persists or worsens, your partner should contact their healthcare provider for further evaluation and treatment options."}

Hope I have solved your query. I will be happy to help you further. Wish you good health. Thanks.", "ai": " I am not a doctor, but I can provide some general information on this topic based on commonly recommended guidelines. During the acute phase of bronchitis, it is generally advised to avoid cold beverages, alcohol, and caffeine as they can irritate the throat and bronchial tubes, making coughing and breathing more difficult. It is important to listen to your doctor's specific advice regarding any dietary restrictions during your recovery. If you are unsure whether it is safe for you to consume cold beverages or alcohol, you should consult your healthcare provider. In general, as you get closer to being fully recovered and your symptoms have subsided, you can gradually reintroduce these beverages into your diet. However, it is always a good idea to proceed with caution and pay attention to how your body reacts. If you experience any worsening of symptoms, such as increased coughing or shortness of breath, you should stop consuming the offending beverage and contact your healthcare provider."}

I will be happy to answer.Regards,Dr. Mahesh Koregol", "ai": " I'm an AI language model and cannot directly diagnose or provide medical advice. However, I can suggest some potential reasons for lack of follicular growth during IUI treatment based on common causes:\n\n1. Ovulation disorders: Your body might not be releasing a mature follicle containing an egg, making it challenging for IUI to be successful. Hormonal imbalances, Polycystic Ovary Syndrome (PCOS), or other ovulation disorders could be the culprit.\n\n2. Age-related factors: As women age, the number and quality of follicles decline, making it harder to grow and mature follicles in response to treatment.\n\n3. Poor ovarian reserve: Follicular study results and the rate of follicular growth can be affected by the size and quality of your ovarian reserve. Advanced maternal age, previous ovarian surgery, chemotherapy, or radiation therapy can impact the number and function of follicles.\n\n4. Medication non-response: Follicular medications like Ovitrop HP might not be working effectively for you, and your body may not respond as expected.\n\n5. Inadequate monitoring: Proper monitoring is necessary to ensure that the injections are administered at the right timing and dosage for optimal follicular growth. Inconsistencies or inadequate monitoring could lead to improper medication use.\n\nIt's essential to discuss your concerns with your doctor, as they can identify the underlying cause and recommend appropriate changes to your treatment plan. If necessary, your healthcare provider might suggest alternative treatments or refer you to a fertility specialist for further evaluation."}

Both Celtic sea salt and Himalayan pink salt are unrefined and rich in minerals, but their potential health benefits for papillary thyroid cancer have not been scientifically proven.\n\nThe best source of information regarding your health concerns is your doctor or healthcare professional.

It's possible that you have experienced a contusion or a bruise that has now left an indentation, which is also known as a \"bone bruise.\" This happens when the impact causes damage to the ligaments, blood vessels, or bone cells underneath the skin, leading to both the bruise and the firm tissue.\n\nGenerally, this type of injury resolves on its own over time. Rest, ice, compression, and elevation (RICE) might help reduce any lingering pain or swelling. If the indentation or firm tissue is causing significant concern or discomfort, it's always a good idea to consult a healthcare professional, especially if you notice that the indentation or other symptoms aren't improving or if you experience increased pain, instability, or limited mobility in the affected knee. In the meantime, avoid putting excess weight on the knee to allow it to heal.\n\nIt's important to remember that every injury is unique, and some can be more severe than others.

Chronic sinusitis: Sinus infections can cause recurring eye discharge and cough. This condition might not always require a fever to occur.\n\n3. Otitis Media (Middle ear infection): This condition can cause ear pain, which might lead to a cough from discomfort, and ear discharge. The presence of a fever is common.\n\n4. Conjunctivitis: Although not directly causing a fever, Conjunctivitis (pink eye) can cause frequent eye discharge and may co-occur with other respiratory infections.\n\n5.

If it is so, it is likely that it is due to Gabapin. You may consult your treating doctor and discuss this with him.There are different treatment methods for premature ejaculation.Some are as follows:1. Stop-start technique of behavior therapy.2. Female on top with active role.3. Double condom5. Pelvic muscle strengthening exercise. (As if try to hold urine intermittently during voiding)6. Penile squeeze technique applied at the point of ejaculatory inevitability.7. Applying a local anesthetic ointment to glans penis prior to penetration.

While some studies have suggested that gabapentin may help with premature ejaculation (PE), the evidence is limited and not conclusive.\n\nA recent systematic review of studies on the use of gabapentin for PE found that while some studies reported improvements in intravaginal ejaculatory latency time and overall satisfaction with sexual function, the results were inconsistent, and more research is needed to establish the effectiveness and safety of gabapentin for PE.\n\nIt's important to note that gabapentin is not an FDA-approved treatment for PE. If you're experiencing PE, it may be worth speaking with your doctor about other treatment options that have more evidence supporting their use, such as selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) or behavioral techniques.\n\nYour doctor may be able to suggest modifications to your current treatment regimen that could help improve your PE symptoms. For example, they may recommend adjusting the dosage or timing of your gabapentin medication or prescribing you a different medication to address the PE issue.\n\nUltimately, it's crucial to have an open and honest conversation with your doctor about your concerns and treatment goals. They can help you navigate your options and make the best decisions for your health."}

These are based on general recommendations and may not be suitable for everyone. please consult a healthcare professional for medical advice.\n\n1. Antibiotics: Your husband's doctor has already prescribed antibiotics, so it's important that he completes the full course of treatment as prescribed. Antibiotics are effective in treating streptococcal infections, which can help lower ASO levels.\n\n2. Hydration: Drinking plenty of water and other fluids can help the body flush out toxins and bacterial waste, including those produced during a streptococcal infection.\n\n3.

The pain relief after medication suggests that the stone is causing an obstruction, leading to hydronephrosis.\n\nHere are some possible solutions a doctor might consider:\n\n1. Pain Management: Your uncle's doctor may recommend stronger pain medications to help manage the symptoms. However, this doesn't address the underlying cause of the pain.\n\n2. Hydration: Ensuring proper hydration may help pass smaller stones through urination.\n\n3.

Extracorporeal Shock Wave Lithotripsy (ESWL): If the stones are not too large or in a difficult position, ESWL may be considered. This non-invasive procedure uses high-energy sound waves to break the stones into smaller pieces that can be passed through urine.\n\n5. Ureteroscopic surgery: If the stones are too large or in a difficult location for ESWL or natural passage, the doctor may consider performing a ureteroscopic procedure to remove or break up the stones directly.\n\n6. Stent placement: Your uncle's doctor might insert a ureteral stent to help relieve the obstruction and improve drainage, which in turn could help with pain relief and prevention of infection.\n\nBefore deciding on a treatment option, the doctor will need to consider various factors such as your uncle's overall health, size and location of the stones, and the extent of the obstruction.\n\nIt is crucial to consult with a healthcare professional to understand the best course of action based on your uncle's specific situation."}

I have reviewed your query and here is my advice. If it's an acute episode of mania, it probably cannot be controlled by 250mg. If it is uncontrollable, getting admitted under supervision of a Psychiatrist and administering injectable antipsychotics is also preferable. You can escalate gradually based on her response to medication.Avoid sedatives. I hope I have answered your query. Feel free to ask further questions.", "ai": " Severe mania is typically treated with a combination of medications and psychotherapy. The first-line medications for mania include:\n\n1. Mood stabilizers: Valproic acid (Divalproex), Lamotrigine, Carbamazepine, or Lithium are common mood stabilizers used to treat mania. Valproic acid may be the first choice for acute manic episodes due to its rapid onset of action.\n2. Antipsychotics: Risperidone, Olanzapine, Quetiapine, and Aripiprazole are often used in conjunction with mood stabilizers to help manage manic symptoms such as agitation, irritability, and psychosis.\n\nRegarding your question about the time it takes for Divalproex to take effect and the therapeutic dose for your sister, it's essential to discuss these details with her healthcare provider. The response to medication varies from person to person, and the therapeutic dose depends on several factors, including age, weight, renal function, and other health conditions.\n\nTypically, the initial dose of Divalproex is 25 mg/kg/day, divided into three doses. Your sister's current dose (250 mg) is quite low compared to her weight and age. If she is not responding to this dose, her healthcare provider may increase it gradually every few days, depending on her response and side effects. The therapeutic dose of Divalproex for a 69-year-old woman of 5 ft 11 inches and 116 lbs can range from 10-20 mg/kg/day, which could translate to 720-1440 mg/day. However, the final dose should be individualized based on her response, tolerance, and medical conditions.\n\nYour sister's healthcare provider may also recommend psychotherapy, such as cognitive behavioral therapy or family therapy, to help address any underlying emotional issues or cope with the symptoms of mania. These therapies can complement medication treatment and improve long-term outcomes."}

Your concerns are valid, especially since you use smokeless tobacco, which is a known risk factor for oral cancer.\n\nHowever, I would like to emphasize that most oral lesions are not cancerous, and irritated papillae is a common benign condition. Nevertheless, I strongly encourage you to schedule an appointment with your dentist or a healthcare professional to have the bump examined. A thorough examination, including a visual inspection of your mouth and possibly a biopsy, can help determine the cause and rule out any serious conditions, including oral cancer.\n\nIn the meantime, try to reduce your consumption of smokeless tobacco and eliminate the use of meteprol for migraines if possible, as both habits may contribute to mouth irritation and increase your risk of oral health issues. Drinking plenty of water and practicing good oral hygiene, including brushing twice daily, flossing daily, and using mouthwash, can help keep your mouth healthy. If you smoke, consider quitting, as smoking is a major risk factor for oral cancer. Your healthcare professional can provide additional resources and support to help you quit.\n\nDo not delay getting the bump checked out by a professional. Peace of mind and early diagnosis, if necessary, are worth the effort."}

However, for in-hospital cardiac arrest, the survival rate is higher, with approximately 20-25% of patients achieving a good functional outcome.\n\nThe patient's age, being 35, is a favorable factor, as younger individuals generally have a better chance of recovery. His reported prior good health also suggests that he may have better overall cardiovascular reserve and potential for recovery.\n\nOnce the patient has been weaned off sedation and taken off the ventilator, the next critical steps in the recovery process involve assessing the extent of any potential brain damage through imaging studies and neurological evaluations. A positive assessment by the brain surgeon is indeed a good sign but does not guarantee a full recovery.\n\nFurther complications, such as infections, neurological damage, or organ dysfunction, could prolong the patient's hospital stay and impact their ongoing progress.\n\nAs for your question regarding how long it will take for the patient to be fully awake, this can vary widely from person to person, depending on the extent of the brain injury (if any) and the length and intensity of their coma. In the best-case scenario, some patients might regain full consciousness within a few days, while others could take weeks, months, or even longer. Regular communication with the healthcare team and following their advice closely will help provide a better understanding of the patient's individual recovery process."}

Take care. Hope my answer was helpful, if you have any other questions I'll be glad to help you. Best regards. Dr.Olgeta Xhufka ( general and family physician ).", "ai": " While a spider bite itself cannot directly cause an infection in a knee replacement, there are a few ways it could potentially lead to complications. Here's what you need to know:\n\n1. Infection at the bite site: If the spider bite becomes infected, bacteria can enter your body and travel through your bloodstream. This could increase the risk of infection in your knee replacement. However, this is more common with deep or necrotic bites, and most spider bites are not severe enough to cause such complications.\n2. Systemic reaction: A spider bite can cause a systemic reaction, such as anaphylaxis, which can lead to various symptoms, including fever. A fever can increase the risk of infection in a knee replacement. However, symptoms of anaphylaxis, such as difficulty breathing, swelling of the face or throat, and rapid heartbeat, would be more apparent and require immediate medical attention.\n3. Toxicity: Some spider venoms, such as those from the brown recluse or black widow spiders, can be toxic. These venoms can damage tissues and, in rare cases, lead to infections that spread to the knee replacement site, although this is not the primary mechanism.\n\nIt's important to note that if you have had a spider bite and are experiencing any signs of infection, such as redness, swelling, or drainage, or if you have any concerns about the potential for infection related to the bite or the knee replacement, you should contact your healthcare provider as soon as possible.\n\nIf you have had a spider bite and are unsure of the type of spider, you should try to capture it or take a clear photograph for identification. This can be important for determining the potential risks associated with the bite.\n\nFinally, it's important to remember that taking antibiotics as prescribed is critical to preventing and treating knee replacement infections. If you're experiencing ongoing symptoms or concerns despite taking the antibiotics, you should report this to your healthcare provider. They may need to consider other diagnostic tests, such as blood cultures, or adjust your treatment plan."}
{"question": "Can immature sperms cause genetic disorder or congenital malformation?i will like to find out the following information about ICSI .I am a man of 40 yrs of age with a condition of obstructive azospermia. testicular biopsy shows evidence of spermatogenesis with immature spermaticlnow i want to know cost of icsi and ivfhow long i will have to stay over in india,what is the effect of immature spermatic i.e can it cause genetic disorder or congenital malformation", "human": "Hello, Cost of ICSI is around 1.2- 1.4 lac INR. Usually staying for 2-3 weeks is sufficient. Immature spermatids can be because of genetic diseases and we need to look for genetic testing before ICSI. Even if any genetic defects are found, there are ways by which we can bypass them. Please see this video for details- https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCwLSgRe2dY&t=3s Hope I have answered your queries. Let me know if I can assist you further. Take care Regards,Dr. Sujoy Dasgupta", "ai": " Intracytoplasmic Sperm Injection (ICSI) is a type of Assisted Reproductive Technology (ART) used in infertility treatment, particularly for men with low sperm count or poor sperm quality. ICSI involves injecting a single sperm directly into an egg to achieve fertilization.\n\nRegarding your question about immature sperms causing genetic disorders or congenital malformations, there is no clear evidence to suggest that the use of immature sperms in ICSI increases the risk of these conditions. However, it is important to note that other factors, such as the woman's age, genetic conditions, and environmental factors, can also increase the risk of genetic disorders and congenital malformations.\n\nThe cost of ICSI and In-Vitro Fertilization (IVF) can vary widely depending on the specific clinic and location. In India, the cost can range from around $1,500 to $5,000 or more for a complete cycle, including medications and monitoring. The length of stay in India would depend on the number of treatment cycles required and the duration of each cycle. typically, each cycle takes around 2-3 weeks.\n\nI would recommend consulting with a fertility specialist or a trusted fertility clinic to get a more accurate estimate of the cost and duration of your treatment, as well as any specific concerns or considerations related to your condition and the use of immature sperm in ICSI."}

However, you should consult a urologist for thorough assessment.Best of luck.", "ai": " I'm an AI language model and not a doctor, but I can try to help you understand some possible causes of your husband's knee pain after ejaculation and potential treatments. It's important to note that this issue isn't directly related to trying to conceive, but I will provide some information related to both topics.\n\nThe pain in the left knee after ejaculation is sometimes referred to as \"post-ejaculatory dyspareunia.\" This condition is characterized by painful intercourse for the female partner, but in your case, it seems to affect your husband. The causes of this condition can vary. Here are some possible explanations:\n\n1. Muscle tension: A build-up of tension in the pelvic muscles from prolonged sexual activity could lead to discomfort or pain in the legs.\n2. Hydrosalpinges: These are fluid-filled cysts that can form in the fallopian tubes. In some cases, they can cause referred pain in the legs during or after ejaculation.\n3. Prostatitis: An inflammation of the prostate gland can cause a wide range of symptoms, including pain in the legs during or after ejaculation. Prostatitis can be caused by bacterial or viral infections, or it can be non-bacterial.\n4. Referred pain: The nerves that supply the genitals and the legs are close together, so sometimes, pain or sensations in one area can be felt in another area.\n\nAs for treatments, they may depend on the underlying cause. Here are some options:\n\n1. Physical therapy: Working with a physical therapist to identify and release tense muscles can help alleviate discomfort or pain.\n2. Pain medication: Over-the-counter pain relievers or prescription medications can help manage the pain.\n3. Antibiotics: If an infection (bacterial prostatitis) is the cause, antibiotics may be necessary.\n4. Transurethral microwave thermotherapy (TUMT): This is a non-invasive treatment for chronic prostatitis and may help relieve symptoms in some men.\n5. Surgery: In severe or persistent cases, surgery may be necessary to treat underlying conditions (such as congenital abnormalities or cysts).\n\nIt's essential to consult a healthcare professional for an accurate diagnosis and appropriate treatment recommendations. If you're trying to conceive and have concerns about this issue, discussing it with your doctor or a fertility specialist may help identify any possible connections between your husband's knee pain and infertility."}

{"question": "Is Cymbalta advisable instead of narcotic painkiller for a backache?I take a narcotic pain killer and they want to change me to cymbalta. I am sure that addicted to the one I am on as I have taken it for over 5 years there is no surgery that could fix the back problem if I change over to the cymbalta with they do it all at once or slowly take me off the narcotic I am on", "human": "Hello and Welcome to ‘Ask A Doctor’ service. I have reviewed your query and here is my advice. Cymbalta is a brand name of Duloxetine and it is quite effective in chronic pain conditions. You can slowly taper the narcotic pain killers and switch over to Cymbalta. Cymbalta is a good alternative and it has got now addiction potential. Wishing you good health. Thanks.", "ai": " Cymbalta (duloxetine) and narcotic painkillers are used for different types of pain. Narcotic painkillers, also known as opioids, are strong medications that work by binding to opioid receptors in the brain and spinal cord to reduce the perception of pain. Cymbalta, on the other hand, is a type of antidepressant called a selective serotonin-norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor (SSNRI) that is used to treat various conditions, including chronic pain.\n\nCymbalta has been shown to be effective in treating chronic pain, including back pain, but it works differently than narcotics. Instead of directly suppressing the pain signal, it increases the levels of certain chemicals in the brain, such as serotonin and norepinephrine, that help to modulate pain perception.\n\nIf your healthcare provider is considering switching you from a narcotic painkiller to Cymbalta, it's important to understand that these are different types of medications with different mechanisms of action. The decision to make this change should be based on a thorough evaluation of your medical history, current symptoms, and overall health.\n\nHere are some things to consider:\n\n1. Efficacy: Cymbalta has been proven to be effective in treating chronic pain, particularly in the context of neuropathic pain or pain related to fibromyalgia. However, it may not be as effective in treating severe pain as narcotics.\n2. Safety: Cymbalta has a different safety profile than narcotics. It can cause side effects such as nausea, dizziness, and dry mouth, but these are usually mild and go away with time. However, it can also increase the risk of falls, particularly in older adults, due to its effects on balance and coordination. Cymbalta may also interact with other medications, so it's important to tell your healthcare provider about all the medications you're taking.\n3. Addiction: Narcotic painkillers can be addictive, and long-term use can lead to physical dependence and withdrawal symptoms if the medication is stopped suddenly. Cymbalta does not carry the same risk of addiction, but it can cause withdrawal symptoms if stopped suddenly, especially at higher doses.\n4. Tapering off narcotics: If you are concerned about addiction or withdrawal, your healthcare provider may want to gradually taper you off the narcotic painkiller before starting Cymbalta. This can help minimize the risk of withdrawal symptoms and prevent the need for a high initial dose of Cymbalta to manage pain.\n\nUltimately, the decision to switch from a narcotic painkiller to Cymbalta should be made in consultation with your healthcare provider, taking into account your individual medical history, current symptoms, and overall health. If you have concerns about this decision, it's important to discuss them with your healthcare provider to ensure that you have all the information you need to make an informed choice."}

Some possible causes include:\n\n1. Herniated or bulging disc: A herniated disc occurs when the soft, gel-like center of a disc in the spine bulges or ruptures through the tough outer layer. This can put pressure on the sciatic nerve and cause pain, numbness, or weakness in the buttocks and legs.\n2. Piriformis syndrome: The piriformis muscle is located in the buttocks and sits on the sciatic nerve. If this muscle becomes inflamed or spasms, it can put pressure on the nerve and cause radiating pain.\n3. Spinal stenosis: This condition is characterized by a narrowing of the spinal canal, which can put pressure on the nerves in the lower back and legs. This can cause pain, numbness, and weakness.\n4. Degenerative disc disease: This is a condition in which the discs between the vertebrae in the spine begin to break down, leading to pain and inflammation.\n5. Spondylolisthesis: This condition occurs when a vertebra in the spine slips out of place, which can put pressure on the nerves and cause pain and other symptoms.\n\nIt's important to note that these conditions can have various causes and that only a qualified healthcare professional can make a definitive diagnosis. If you are experiencing these symptoms, it's important to speak with your doctor to determine the underlying cause and appropriate treatment.\n\nRelief of symptoms with movement or position changes can be an important clue for identifying the cause of the pain, as certain positions may put pressure on specific structures in the spine.

Postpartum low back pain: This is a common condition that can occur due to the physical stresses of pregnancy and childbirth on the back. Hormonal changes during pregnancy can also cause the ligaments in the pelvis to relax, which can lead to instability and back pain.\n2. Pelvic organ prolapse: This condition occurs when the pelvic organs (uterus, bladder, rectum) descend from their normal position and press on the back muscles, causing pain and weakness. This can be a result of the physical stresses of childbirth, especially if there was a large baby or a difficult delivery.\n3. Poor posture: The physical stresses of childbirth and caring for a newborn can cause people to slouch or adopt poor postures, which can put added stress on the back muscles and lead to pain.\n4.

However, I can suggest some possible explanations for the lump you have discovered. It is common to have various bumps and lumps below the skull, including but not limited to:\n\n1. Lymph nodes: Lymph nodes are small, bean-shaped structures that help filter lymph fluid and fight infections. You may have noticed a lymph node swelling if you have recently had an infection. It is usually tender and can be painful if it is larger or infected.\n2. Muscle knots: Muscle knots are localized areas of muscle that have become contracted and fibrotic, leading to a lump or hardening of the muscle. They can occur due to stress, injury, or overuse.\n3. Cervical vertebrae: The cervical vertebrae, which make up the first seven vertebrae of the spine, are located in this area. An abnormality or growth on one of these vertebrae could potentially cause a lump.\n4. Other structural issues: Other structural issues, such as a cyst, tumor, or other growth, could also potentially cause a lump in this area.

I feel good otherwise and have had everything from head to toe checked all normal except my pulse ox drops when I stand.", "human": "Hello,The term is orthostatic hypotension. Reasons are many among which most common is age related (10% to 30% of older people have this). Others are certain drug intake as beta blockers, sugar fluctuations, heart problems, and nervous system disorders. The physiology behind this is the inability of your body to cope up with the standing position in regard to the blood circulation because more blood is pulled by the gravity in trunk, legs, pulse, BP drops, dizziness as heart cannot pump needed blood to the brain.Hope I have answered your query. Let me know if I can assist you further.Regards,Dr. Bhagyesh V. Patel", "ai": " There are several potential causes for a reduction in pulse oximetry (SpO2) readings when standing up, especially in older adults. Some common causes include:\n\n1. Orthostatic Hypotension: This is a condition where your blood pressure decreases when you stand up suddenly. The reduction in blood pressure can lead to a decrease in oxygen delivery to your body, including your extremities, leading to a drop in SpO2 reading. The weakness, falls, and bright lights you experience could be symptoms of orthostatic hypotension.\n2. Anemia: A decrease in hemoglobin (the protein in red blood cells that carries oxygen) can result in a lower SpO2 reading, as less oxygen is being carried in the blood. Anemia can cause weakness, dizziness, and even fainting, and it is important to rule out this condition with your doctor.\n3. Poor circulation: As we age, circulation can become less efficient, making it harder for oxygen to reach your extremities. This can result in lower SpO2 readings when standing.\n4. Respiratory issues: Conditions such as chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), emphysema, or pneumonia can make it harder for you to breathe, which can lead to lower SpO2 readings.\n5. Medications: Certain medications, such as diuretics, beta-blockers, and calcium channel blockers, can affect your blood pressure and heart function, which can result in a decrease in SpO2 readings when standing.\n\nIt is important to discuss these potential causes with your doctor, as they can help determine the underlying cause of your symptoms and develop an appropriate treatment plan. In the meantime, you may want to try some simple techniques to increase your circulation and prevent fainting while standing, such as:\n\n* Standing up slowly, taking your time to transition from sitting to standing position\n* Avoiding sudden movements or standing for long periods of time\n* Compressing your leg muscles to promote blood flow\n* Drinking plenty of fluids to prevent dehydration\n* Elevating your legs to help improve circulation before getting up from a seated position.\n\nYour doctor may also suggest using a compression stocking or a medical alert device to help prevent falls and ensure you receive medical attention if needed."}

I had a follow up MRI this week and it says cortical involution changes are noted also there is increased T2 and FLAIR signal abnormality in the periventricular white matter. Intracranial flow voids are grossly unremarkable. This sounds scarey to me.", "human": "Hi,Thank you for posting your query.I have noted your past history and the MRI brain findings.First of all, I would like to reassure you that these do not suggest any serious brain disease.Periventricular increased signals are a non-specific finding and can occur in a variety of situations. For example, it can be due to ischemia (decreased blood flow to brain in a high bP patient), demyelination, migraine, etc. We need to correlate the MRI findings with your symptoms. So, if you can get back with your symptoms, we would be able to give you a better opinion.I hope my answer helps. Please get back if you have any follow up queries or if you require any additional information.Wishing you good health,Dr Sudhir Kumar MD (Internal Medicine), DM (Neurology)Senior Consultant NeurologistApollo Hospitals, Hyderabad, IndiaClick on this link to ask me a DIRECT QUERY: http://bit.ly/Dr-Sudhir-kumarMy BLOG: http://bestneurodoctor.blogspot.in", "ai": " I'm an AI language model and not a doctor, but I can try to help explain what the medical terms in your report mean, and provide you with some general information based on publicly available knowledge. However, it's crucial that you discuss the details of your imaging report and any concerns you may have with your healthcare provider. They can provide you with the most accurate information and guidance based on your individual medical history and current condition.\n\nFlair (Fluid Attenuated Inversion Recovery) signal abnormality in the periventricular white matter refers to changes in the appearance of this brain region on an MRI scan. The periventricular white matter is the part of the brain that surrounds the ventricles (fluid-filled spaces in the brain). These signal changes on the FLAIR scan could indicate various conditions, such as demyelination (loss of myelin, a protective covering around nerve fibers), ischemia (lack of blood flow), small vessel disease, or inflammation. In your case, it's important to consult with your healthcare provider to determine the cause of these changes and assess the potential significance for your overall health.\n\nKeep in mind that there are many possible explanations for these signs on an MRI, and not all of them are related to a serious condition. However, given your history of an olfactory meningioma, it might be necessary for your healthcare provider to investigate further or consult with specialists to rule out any complications or related conditions. Your healthcare provider may also recommend additional tests, such as a lumbar puncture (spinal tap) or blood tests, to help determine the underlying cause of the periventricular white matter changes.\n\nIt is essential to remember that receiving a medical report can be stressful, but the information provided in the report alone may not necessarily paint a complete picture. Your healthcare provider is the best resource for understanding your specific situation and discussing any concerns you may have."}
{"question": "Medication for tonsil for a kidney patient?i am a patient with kidney problem... recently i was feeling fever and body pain so i visited a doctor and he advised me raxim 250. Now i am facing problem with tonsil it has got enlarged. i wouldlike to know whether to continue with the medicine and also whether this medicine is good for a kidney patient", "human": "Hi,I can understand your concern regarding the safety of prescribed antibiotic Raxim-250. Due to increase risk of severe side effects, it is not safe to use Raxim-250 while suffering kidney disease. It needs close monitoring of kidney functions, appropriate dose adjustments. In view of the above I advise you to consult your treating doctor for an effective alternate but a safer antibiotic for the treatment of tonsillitis.Hope I have answered your query. Let me know if I can assist you further. Regards,Dr. Mohammed Taher Ali, General & Family Physician", "ai": " I am an AI language model and not a doctor, but I can try to help you find some information regarding your question. Raxim 250 is an antibiotic medication commonly used to treat infections caused by bacteria. It belongs to the cephalosporin class of antibiotics. While I cannot definitively say whether Raxim 250 is suitable for a kidney patient without consulting a healthcare professional, I can provide you some general information that may help you.\n\nFirstly, it's important to note that Raxim 250 is generally considered safe for people with kidney problems if they have normal kidney function or minimal impairment. The medication is eliminated mostly through the urine, but it doesn't require any significant adjustment to the dose based on kidney function. However, informing your doctor about your kidney condition is crucial to ensure they're monitoring your response to the medication and any potential side effects.\n\nAs for the enlarged tonsils, Raxim 250 may help alleviate any underlying bacterial infection causing the issue. However, if your tonsils have been enlarged for an extended period or if they are obstructing your breathing or swallowing, you may need additional treatment, such as tonsillectomy or corticosteroids.\n\nIf you're experiencing persistent symptoms, fever, or significant discomfort, it's always recommendable to consult your doctor to discuss your concerns and any alternative treatment options. They may be able to recommend a different medication suitable for your kidney condition or suggest other treatments to address your tonsil issue. Keep in mind that this information should not replace the advice of your healthcare professional. Always consult with them for any medical decisions."}
{"question": "What causes chest pain and itching lump on back?I have had a shooting pain in my chest for 2 weeks now. Have bben checked at A&E and heart is fine.

Incidently, the pain in my chest seems to have disappeared. Any suggestions? I m thinking of going to the A&E", "human": "HiIt could be Infected sebaceous cyst. I prefer to remove the swelling and send it for histopathological examination. Please consult your doctor, get examined clinically and proceed accordingly. Nothing to worry. Wish you good health. Regards", "ai": " I'm not a doctor, but I can provide some possibilities based on the symptoms you've described. Your chest pain could be caused by a variety of conditions, including musculoskeletal issues, gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD), anxiety or panic attacks, or more serious conditions such as heart disease. The fact that you've been cleared by A&E for heart issues suggests that it may be something less severe.\n\nThe appearance of a hard, itchy lump on your back could be the result of a number of conditions as well, including a skin infection, a benign growth, or even a herniated disc in your back. It's also possible that the lump could be related to an underlying medical condition, such as diabetes or thyroid problems.\n\nSince you've mentioned that the chest pain has seemingly disappeared, it might be a good idea to focus on the new development of the itchy lump on your back. However, I strongly recommend that you follow up with your doctor as soon as possible to have the lump examined. It's important to rule out any serious conditions, and your doctor may be able to provide you with a definitive diagnosis and appropriate treatment. In the meantime, try not to worry excessively, but stay alert for any changes in your symptoms or any new developments."}

It's important to consult a healthcare professional for accurate diagnosis and treatment, as the symptoms you describe could be related to various conditions.\n\nRegarding your current issue with redness and swelling around the labia minora, it's possible that it could be a reaction to the Betnovate N cream or a recurrence of the underlying infection. If you suspect that the cream is causing the redness, consider trying a different antifungal cream or ointment under the guidance of a healthcare professional. Be sure to avoid using any harsh soaps or other potential irritants in the area.\n\nIt's important to note that fungal infections can be persistent, so you may need to treat them for an extended period, even if the symptoms seem to have subsided. Keep in mind that it can take several weeks for the symptoms to fully improve. Always follow the instructions provided by your healthcare professional when using antifungal medication.\n\nIf the redness and swelling persist despite treatment, it is essential to consult your doctor again.

Your doctor may recommend alternative treatments or additional tests to determine the cause and find an effective solution.\n\nHere are some general tips on how to care for the affected area while dealing with the issue:\n\n1. Keep the area clean and dry: Wash the area gently with soap and warm water, then pat it dry thoroughly before applying any cream or ointment. Moist environments can worsen fungal infections, so it's essential to avoid prolonged wetness.\n\n2. Wear breathable clothing: Cotton and other breathable fabrics can help keep the area dry and prevent irritation and chafing. Avoid wearing synthetic fabrics or tight-fitting clothes that may cause friction or moisture buildup.\n\n3. Practice good hygiene: Keep the genital area clean and dry. Wipe from front to back, particularly after using the bathroom, to avoid spreading any bacteria or fungus.\n\n4. Avoid irritants: Avoid using any harsh products, including soap, scented products, or rough towels, in the affected area. These can cause inflammation, making the redness and swelling worse.\n\n5. Consider wearing loose-fitting underwear made of breathable fabrics, such as cotton, to help keep the area dry and reduce friction.\n\nRemember, it's essential to address both the underlying infection and the redness and swelling to give yourself the best chance of fully recovering. Consult a healthcare professional for appropriate diagnosis and treatment recommendations."}

Take care.", "ai": " I'm unable to provide an accurate diagnosis based on the information given. The description of a hard lump behind the nipple that moves could be a sign of various conditions, but it's important to note that it's unlikely to be a worm. Here are some possible causes:\n\n1. Tumor or cyst: The most common cause of a hard lump behind the nipple in children is a benign tumor or cyst, such as a lipoma or a gynecomastia (male breast tissue development). However, it's rare for these conditions to occur at such a young age.\n2. Infection: A breast infection, such as mastitis, can cause a hard lump, especially if it is tender or warm to the touch.\n3. Trauma: Trauma or injury to the breast can cause a hard lump, especially if there is bruising or swelling.\n4. Hormonal changes: Hormonal changes in boys during puberty can cause the development of breast tissue, which can feel like a hard lump.\n\nIt's important to have your son evaluated by a healthcare professional, such as a pediatrician or a pediatric surgeon, to rule out any serious underlying causes. The doctor may perform a physical exam and recommend further testing, such as an ultrasound or a biopsy, to make an accurate diagnosis.\n\nIt's also important to reassure your son that a hard lump behind the nipple is not typically a sign of anything serious, especially in children, but that it's important to have it checked out by a doctor to be sure. And, please remind him that it is highly unlikely to be a worm."}

The condition you're describing sounds like Balanitis Xerosis Obliterans (BXO), which is a chronic inflammatory condition affecting the foreskin and glans (head) of the penis. The symptoms include dryness, scaling, and thickening of the skin in that area. It's not a sexually transmitted infection and is not related to sexual activity.\n\nBXO is thought to be caused by repeated retraction of the foreskin over the glans, leading to friction and irritation. Poor hygiene and certain conditions such as diabetes or psoriasis can also be contributing factors.\n\nRegularly applying a moisturizing cream or emollient to the area may help alleviate the dryness and improve the appearance of the skin. However, it's important to keep the area clean and avoid using strong soaps or detergents as they can further irritate the skin. It's also a good idea to retract the foreskin gently, if possible, to allow air and moisture to reach the area.\n\nIf the condition does not improve with home treatment, it's best to consult with a healthcare professional or a dermatologist for a proper evaluation and treatment plan. They can help determine the underlying cause of the condition and provide appropriate treatment, which may include topical corticosteroids, topical calcium channel blockers, or circumcision in severe cases.\n\nRemember, it's important to avoid delaying medical treatment as BXO can progress and lead to more serious complications if left untreated."}

{"question": "What causes the hardness of the vein in the penis?On my penis the vein that runs up the very middle on the top, the dorsal vein maybe, is very very hard. from the very bottom of the penis to around 3/4 up towards the head, when erect it is even harder and feels similar to a guitar string. im also currently suffering ED, lacking morning erections and weak erections", "human": "HelloThanks for query.You have noticed dilated vein on the dorsal aspect of your shaft of the penis.This is a dilated tortuous tributary of Superficial Dorsal Vein of Penis ,his is seen in 20-30% of men and has no significance at all.It can not be a cause for your problem of ED.For problem of ED you need to consult qualified Urologist for evaluation to find out the cause of your ED and further treatment.Dr.Patil.", "ai": " The hardness or firmness of the dorsal vein in the penis during an erection is a normal physiological process. The dorsal vein, along with other penile veins, fills with blood during an erection, and its compression by the fascia, a thick fibrous tissue, contributes to the maintenance of the erection. This hardness is a result of the engorgement of the penile tissue with blood.\n\nHowever, your report of experiencing ED, along with weak and infrequent morning erections, may indicate an underlying issue. There are several possible causes of ED, including but not limited to:\n\n1. Vascular diseases: Plaque buildup in the arteries and veins can restrict blood flow, making it difficult to achieve and maintain an erection.\n2. Neurological problems: Damage to nerves, such as those caused by diabetes or multiple sclerosis, may impact the body's ability to initiate and maintain an erection.\n3. Psychological factors: Anxiety, stress, and depression can all contribute to ED.\n4. Hormonal imbalance: Low testosterone levels can impact your sex drive and erectile function.\n5. Age: As men age, they may experience a decline in their ability to achieve and maintain erections due to changes in the body.\n\nIt is essential to consult a healthcare professional if you are experiencing symptoms of ED, as they can help determine the underlying cause and recommend appropriate treatment options. A doctor may suggest lifestyle changes, medications, or other therapies to help improve your erectile function. It is also important to note that a hard or firm dorsal vein during an erection is a normal physiological process and is not indicative of ED on its own."}

Regards", "ai": " I'm an artificial intelligence language model and not a medical professional, but I can provide some general information on this topic based on available medical research and common knowledge.\n\nThe frenulum is a thin band of tissue under the head of the penis that connects the penis to the scrotum. Its function is to help keep the foreskin in place during sexual activity. If the frenulum is torn, it can cause pain and discomfort during sexual intercourse. However, the recovery process and potential long-term effects vary.\n\nAccording to research, a torn frenulum usually heals within 1-2 weeks with proper care, including keeping the area clean and applying a topical antibiotic ointment. During this time, sexual activity should be avoided to allow the tissue to heal properly.\n\nAs for the potential long-term effects on sexual function and reproductive status, there is limited evidence. Some studies suggest that a torn frenulum may increase the risk of erectile dysfunction (ED) due to scarring or damage to the underlying tissue. However, these studies are not definitive, and most men with a torn frenulum do not experience lasting issues.\n\nIt's important to note that erectile function and reproductive status are influenced by multiple factors, and a torn frenulum is only one possible factor. Other factors, such as psychological factors, lifestyle choices, and underlying health conditions, can also affect sexual function and reproductive health.\n\nIf your fiancee is concerned about the long-term effects on his sexual function or reproductive status, I would encourage him to speak with a healthcare professional. A healthcare professional can assess his individual situation and provide personalized advice based on the latest medical research and their clinical experience. In the meantime, supportive communication and patience during the healing process can help alleviate concerns and promote recovery."}

Thanks for the query.Biopsy should not be done during pneumonia and it can wait till he recovers. this is not an emergency,he probably have those lesions for longer period. It must be evaluated and tumors must be ruled out. It is hard to say what it is exactly. it can be benign or malignant lesion. But in every case he should treat his pneumonia first. Wish you good health. Regards", "ai": " It is possible that liver nodules could impact the recovery of pneumonia in certain individuals, especially those with underlying health conditions like chronic heart failure (CHF), a metal heart valve, and a high risk for surgery.\n\nHowever, the relationship between liver nodules and pneumonia recovery is not straightforward. Here's what we know:\n\n1. Pneumonia: Pneumonia is a bacterial or viral infection that causes inflammation in the lungs. Recovery depends on various factors, including the severity of the infection, underlying health conditions, and response to treatment.\n2. Liver nodules: Liver nodules can be benign or malignant. Benign nodules, like hemangiomas and adenomas, are relatively common and usually do not cause significant issues. Malignant nodules, such as hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), can interfere with liver function and disrupt the body's ability to metabolize medications, making it difficult to treat infections like pneumonia effectively.\n3. Impact on pneumonia recovery: In general, liver function is essential for the metabolism and clearance of various drugs used to treat pneumonia. Impairment of liver function due to nodules could potentially affect the patient's response to treatment and, by extension, their recovery from pneumonia. It's also important to note that chronic conditions like CHF and having a metal heart valve could also complicate the treatment and recovery process.\n\nIn the context of your husband's health situation, a liver biopsy may be necessary to determine if the liver nodules are contributing to his difficulties in recovering from pneumonia. Your healthcare team can evaluate the results of the biopsy and adjust his treatment plan accordingly. It's essential to trust their expertise and ask any questions you may have about the procedure and its potential implications for your husband's health."}

More specifically, 65% of your sperm are non-progressive or immotile, which is relatively high.\n\nDepending on your personal and medical history, your doctor may recommend additional tests to further evaluate the cause of the decreased motility. These tests may include:\n\n1. Repeating the semen analysis: Sometimes, semen analysis results can be affected by factors like temperature or collection techniques. Your doctor may ask you to provide a new sample for analysis to confirm the initial results.\n2. Urinalysis: A urinalysis can help detect any potential infections, which could be contributing to poor sperm motility.\n3. Blood tests: Hormonal imbalances, genetic conditions, and other health issues can impact sperm quality and motility. Your doctor may recommend blood tests to evaluate various health markers.\n4. Scrotal ultrasound: This non-invasive imaging procedure can help assess the quantity and quality of the testicles and the presence of any varicoceles or other conditions that could affect sperm production.\n\nBased on your semen analysis results, it may be beneficial to discuss the possibility of using assisted reproductive technologies, such as intracytoplasmic sperm injection (ICSI), to improve the chances of successful conception. Your healthcare provider can help you weigh the benefits and potential risks of these options and determine the best course of action for your specific situation.\n\nIt is essential to follow your doctor's recommendations and ask any questions or concerns you may have during your appointments for a thorough understanding of your diagnosis and treatment options."}

{"question": "Diagnosed with celiac disease and have gluten allergyHi doctor, my father is diagnosed with celiac disease and was told he was allergic to gluten. It would be nice if u could give me an insight regarding the above said condition and gluten allergy.", "human": "Coming to the first part of your question, Gluten Intolerance or Celiac Disease is a hereditary problem affecting the immune system. The consumption of gluten destroys the lining of the small intestine called mucosa. Consequently, essential vitamins and nutrients are not properly absorbed.", "ai": " Celiac disease is an autoimmune condition where the ingestion of gluten leads to damage in the small intestine. Gluten is a protein found in wheat, barley, and rye. In individuals with celiac disease, their immune system responds abnormally to gluten, causing inflammation and damage to the villi in the small intestine. This can prevent the absorption of essential nutrients from food.\n\nSymptoms of celiac disease can vary widely, and some people may not exhibit any obvious symptoms. Common symptoms include abdominal pain, bloating, diarrhea, weight loss, fatigue, and anemia. In children, delay in growth or short stature can also be a sign. In extreme cases, untreated celiac disease can lead to malnutrition, osteoporosis, and other health complications.\n\nA gluten allergy, on the other hand, is less common than celiac disease and involves an allergic reaction to gluten. Symptoms of a gluten allergy can include hives, itching or tingling in the mouth, swelling of the lips, face, tongue, or throat, abdominal pain, diarrhea, and vomiting.\n\nThe diagnosis of celiac disease is typically made through a combination of symptoms, blood tests, and a biopsy of the small intestine. A gluten allergy is usually diagnosed through an elimination diet and challenge, or through specific IgE antibody tests.\n\nThe treatment for both conditions is the same, which is to eliminate gluten from the diet completely. This means avoiding all foods that contain gluten, including wheat, barley, and rye. Gluten-free foods, such as rice, corn, and quinoa, can be included in the diet. It's important to read food labels carefully, as gluten can be hidden in unexpected places, such as processed foods, sauces, and gravies.\n\nIt's important to note that going gluten-free can be challenging, and it's important to ensure that your father is getting all of the essential nutrients that he needs. Working with a registered dietitian can be helpful in ensuring a well-balanced and nutritious gluten-free diet. Additionally, it's important to ensure that your father is taking any necessary vitamins or supplements as prescribed by his doctor.\n\nIf your father has any questions or concerns about his celiac disease or gluten allergy, it's important that he speaks with his doctor or a registered dietitian. They can provide him with more detailed information and answer any specific questions he may have."}

If your daughter is experiencing frequent nosebleeds and pain in the cheekbone area, it would be best to consult a healthcare professional for a proper evaluation. Here are some suggestions for managing a nosebleed at home:\n\n1. Have your child sit upright and lean forward with the head tilted slightly forward. This will help the blood flow out of the nostrils rather than accumulating in the back of the throat.\n\n2. Use a soft, cool compress or a cloth soaked in ice water on the bridge of the nose for a few minutes to help reduce swelling and slow down the bleeding. Be sure not to press on the nose too hard, as this can make the bleeding worse.\n\n3. Pinching the soft part of the nose, just below the bone, with the thumb and index finger for about 5 to 10 minutes can help stop the bleeding. Apply gentle pressure and make sure your child is breathing normally.\n\n4. Keep your child calm, and try to keep them hydrated. Avoid physical activities, such as running, jumping, or yelling, as these can increase blood flow to the nose and worsen the nosebleed.\n\n5. If the nosebleed continues, or if you're concerned about your child's symptoms, contact your healthcare professional for further evaluation.\n\nIf your child's symptoms include severe pain in the cheekbone area, fever, vision changes, or difficulty breathing, seek immediate medical attention.

Minoxidil (Rogaine): Minoxidil is a non-prescription medication that has been shown to be effective for both men and women.

Minoxidil is known to be effective for androgenetic alopecia, the most common cause of hair loss.\n\n2. Finasteride (Proscar, Propecia): Finasteride is a prescription medication that is taken orally. It works by inhibiting the conversion of testosterone to dihydrotestosterone, which is a hormone that contributes to hair loss. Finasteride is generally more expensive than Minoxidil and is intended for men with androgenetic alopecia.\n\n3. Alternatives to the prescription medications you mentioned: Anlotinib, a Chinese herbal medicine, has shown promise for the treatment of hair loss. However, it is not yet widely available or approved by the FDA. Other prescription medications and supplements, such as Spironolactone, Vitamin D, and Iron supplements, may be suggested as alternatives by some doctors based on individual cases.\n\nRegarding the specific medications you mentioned - Anutra Plus, Bitozed Forte, Zinfate, Dazit, and Zinetac - I couldn't find much information about them in relation to hair loss.

Watery sperm, also known as thin or volatile semen, is a common condition that may occur occasionally in men. It is often caused by various factors, including:\n\n1. Ejaculatory Duct Issues: Problems with the ejaculatory ducts, which transport semen from the testicles to the urethra, can result in watery semen.\n2. Low Sperm Count: A lower than normal sperm count can cause watery semen since the semen contains a lower concentration of sperm cells.\n3. Infections: Certain infections, such as sexually transmitted infections (STIs) or prostatitis, can lead to watery semen.\n4. Hormonal Imbalances: Hormonal issues, such as low testosterone levels, can influence the consistency of semen.\n5. Age: As men age, the consistency of their semen may change, becoming more watery.\n6. Dietary Factors: Certain foods or drinks, such as caffeine, alcohol, and spicy foods, can impact semen consistency.\n\nRegarding pregnancy, watery semen itself is not an obstacle to conceiving. However, if the underlying cause is an underlying medical condition, that might make it more difficult for a woman to become pregnant. So, it's essential to investigate possible causes with your healthcare provider, who can provide you with personalized guidance and treatment recommendations. They may recommend tests like semen analysis, STI screening, and hormonal tests to determine the underlying cause. In the meantime, maintaining a healthy lifestyle and addressing any underlying medical conditions can improve your chances of success."}
{"question": "Can I be allergic to staph that causes impetigo?I find a link between impetigo flare-up on my scalp (puffy beneath skin with some flare-up s resulting in runny puss) and astham flare up, Is is possible to be allergic to the bacterium stap that causes the impetigo. ? I have also been treated for staph that becamse systemic in the past?", "human": "Hi,Thanks for asking.It seems from the history that you are having impetigo on the scalp.Based on your query, my opinion is as follows.1. Impetigo is bacterial infection of the skin and it can affect the skin of the scalp.2. It is caused by the infection of the bacteria and one of the common bacteria associated with this is Staphylococci.3. This requires treatment by the use of antibiotics and anti-inflammatory drugs.Hence you need to consult your doctor for evaluation and treatment.Hope it helps.Any further queries, happy to help again.", "ai": " Yes, it is possible to have an allergic reaction to toxins produced by Staphylococcus aureus, the bacterium that causes impetigo. This reaction is known as a staphylococcal scaled skin syndrome (SSSS), which can lead to widespread, severe skin detachment, blisters, and mucous membrane involvement.\n\nIt's important to note that an impetigo flare-up itself doesn't indicate an allergic reaction to S. aureus, but rather an infection caused by the bacteria. However, an allergic reaction to the toxins produced by the bacteria can occur in some individuals, and it may worsen asthma symptoms due to the release of inflammatory mediators.\n\nIf you have had a documented staph infection that became systemic in the past, it's recommended to consult your healthcare provider to discuss the potential link between your asthma and impetigo flare-ups. They may consider testing for staph allergies or prescribing medications to help manage both conditions. Additionally, good hygiene practices, such as regular bathing, washing hands often, and avoiding close contact with infected individuals, can help prevent future staph infections."}

Overdosing on pain medications can be serious, and in some cases, it can be life-threatening. While you should not delay seeking professional medical help, there are some things you can do to help manage your symptoms in the meantime.\n\n1. Rinse your mouth with warm water: Gently rinse your mouth with warm water several times to help soothe any inflammation and clean the area.\n2. Use a cold compress: Apply a cold compress to the affected area to help reduce swelling and alleviate pain. Be sure not to apply it directly to the tooth, just the outside of the cheek.\n3. Avoid hot or cold food and drinks: Avoid consuming foods or drinks that are extremely hot or cold, as they can exacerbate tooth pain.\n\nIt's crucial to seek professional medical help as soon as possible. You can try contacting your dentist or healthcare provider for advice or schedule an appointment if their office is closed.

Let me know if I can assist you further. Regards,Dr. Asmeet Kaur Sawhney, Dermatologist", "ai": " I am an AI language model and not a doctor, but I can try to help answer your question based on available information.\n\nMyloCORT cream is a topical corticosteroid, which is commonly used to reduce inflammation, redness, and itching caused by various skin conditions, including allergic reactions. MyloCORT cream does not contain any specific allergy medication.\n\nAllergex Mepryamine cream is an antihistamine and antipruritic (itch-relieving) cream. It can help alleviate symptoms of allergic reactions, such as itching and rash, by blocking the action of histamine, a chemical released during an allergic response.\n\nUsing both MyloCORT and Allergex Mepryamine creams might help reduce the severity of both the allergic reaction and the inflammation caused by itching. However, it is important to note that both creams should be used under a doctor's supervision, and prolonged use of topical corticosteroids can have side effects, such as thinning of the skin or increased susceptibility to infections.\n\nBefore using these creams together, you should consult your mother's healthcare provider to ensure that there are no potential interactions or contraindications with her current medications, including RISPERDAL. They may also be able to recommend alternative treatments or courses of action if necessary.\n\nPlease keep in mind that this information is for informational purposes only, and you should always consult with a healthcare professional for advice tailored to your specific situation."}
{"question": "What causes fever after hitting head on metal piece?my son hit his head on the metal part of a table an he has a pretty good side bump. He now has a fever of 100.2. He walks fine, puples seem fine, he is not confused. Is it common to get a fever after hitting your head? My son will be 3 in September.", "human": "Thanks for your query, I have gone through your query.The swelling and fever can be secondary to the trauma or the impact. Nothing to be panic, you can take a paracetamol for the fever(if you are not allergic).I hope I have answered your query, take care.", "ai": " A fever after hitting your head is not an uncommon occurrence, especially in young children like your son. Several potential reasons may explain this phenomenon:\n\n1. Infection: A head injury can break the skin or penetrated it, making way for bacteria to enter the body. This could lead to an infection in the head or the scalp. Infections can cause a fever as the body's immune system responds to fight the invading organisms.\n2. Inflammation: Head injuries can cause inflammation in the brain or surrounding tissues, leading to an increase in body temperature. This is the body's natural response to protect and heal damaged tissue.\n3. Brain injury: In rare cases, a head injury can cause damage to the brain, such as a concussion, contusion, or hematoma. Brain injuries can also lead to fever, as the body responds to the injury and attempts to heal the damaged tissue.\n4. Other systemic infections: A head injury could potentially allow bacteria or viruses to enter the body through the wound or the nose or mouth, leading to systemic infections that can cause fever.\n\nIt's essential to monitor your son closely, including checking for any signs of worsening symptoms such as worsening headaches, increased confusion, or difficulty walking. If you notice any of these symptoms or if his fever persists for more than a day, it would be best to consult a healthcare professional to ensure that your son receives proper medical care.\n\nIn the meantime, you can help manage your son's fever by keeping him hydrated and providing a comfortable environment. You can also offer over-the-counter pain relief medication, such as acetaminophen, to help reduce any discomfort or fever. However, it's essential to consult with a healthcare professional before administering any medication to your son."}
{"question": "Can symptoms of herp and strep be seen in 8 month old kids?Can symptoms of herpes ( 1 and 2) show up in my son 8 months after delivery? He had a severe diaper rash at a week old, thrush at 11 days old and now at 8 months he has these red spots on the roof of his mouth, a creamy white residue and red spots on tongue. Dr said the spots on roof of mouth look like it could be strep but said very rare in children this age.", "human": "Hello dear, yes it is rarely,but happens when baby has low immunity.For diagnosis confirm you should perform mouth culture for flora and sensitivity to antibiotics. Moreover,herpes 6type,EBV,CMV can cause following up symptoms . For confirmation we test babies Ig M, G to herpes 1,2 types,HHV 6type, CMV,EBV.Hope I answered your query.Wish your baby speedy recovery", "ai": " Herpes simplex virus (HSV) and Streptococcus bacteria can indeed cause symptoms in infants around the age of 8 months, although it is more common for HSV to present during the first year of life, particularly in the context of neonatal herpes acquired during childbirth.\n\nHSV-1 and HSV-2 can both cause oral herpes, which can present as red spots, ulcers, or blisters on the lips, gums, or tongue. The presence of a creamy white residue on the tongue or roof of the mouth, along with red spots, could be suggestive of oral thrush, which is a common condition in infants and can co-occur with herpes or strep.\n\nStrep throat, caused by Streptococcus pyogenes, typically presents with symptoms such as fever, sore throat, red and swollen tonsils, and difficulty swallowing. Although rare, it is possible for young children to develop strep throat, especially if they attend daycare or have older siblings or caregivers who may carry the bacteria. The red spots on the roof of the mouth could potentially be a sign of strep, but other symptoms would need to be present as well.\n\nGiven the presence of both oral symptoms and the possibility of strep, it is important that your son see a healthcare provider for further evaluation. The provider may perform a rapid strep test or a throat culture to confirm the diagnosis of strep, and may also consider testing for herpes if oral herpes is suspected. In the meantime, you can take steps to ensure good oral hygiene by frequently cleaning the mouth with a soft-bristled toothbrush or a clean cloth, and avoiding sharing utensils, cups, or other objects with others to minimize the risk of infection."}
{"question": "Suggest medication for fever and throat painMy toddler has a low grade fever, won t eat, and wakes up crying/screaming multiple times a night.

Hope I have answered your query. Let me know if I can assist you further. Regards,Dr. Sumanth Amperayani, Pediatrician, Pulmonology", "ai": " Based on the symptoms you've described, it seems your toddler may be experiencing a common viral infection, such as a cold or the flu. While it's essential to consult a healthcare professional for a definitive diagnosis and treatment plan, you can provide some relief at home with over-the-counter medications and home remedies.\n\nFor fever relief, you may use acetaminophen (Tylenol) or ibuprofen (Advil, Motrin). Consult the product label or your pediatrician for the appropriate dosage based on your toddler's age and weight. Ensure you don't give both medications at the same time as they serve different purposes.\n\nTo alleviate throat pain, you can offer your toddler age-appropriate doses of an over-the-counter throat lozenge or an antihistamine that contains a decongestant, such as Sudafed PE or Claritin-D, if your pediatrician approves. Ensure you follow the label instructions for dosage and usage guidelines.\n\nRemember, these medications are only intended for temporary symptom relief. If your toddler appears lethargic, is dehydrated, or her symptoms worsen, contact her pediatrician for further evaluation.\n\nHome remedies, like offering warm beverages (without honey for children under 1), providing small, frequent meals, and using a humidifier to help alleviate congestion, may also be helpful. Encouraging plenty of rest and ensuring she stays hydrated are essential for her recovery. If her condition does not improve, or if new symptoms arise, consult a healthcare professional for a proper diagnosis and treatment plan."}

I would strongly recommend consulting with your nephew's healthcare team for personalized advice and treatment options.\n\n1. Fluid Replacement: Maintaining adequate hydration is crucial for managing dengue fever. Infants may need intravenous (IV) fluid replacement to prevent dehydration. This can include a solution such as a balanced electrically neutral solution (BEN) or Ringer's lactate, along with oral fluids and breast milk.\n\n2. Diet: Offer the baby a balanced diet, ensuring they receive adequate energy and nutrients to support their recovery. Pediatric electrolyte solutions can be given if required.\n\n3. Close Monitoring: Keep a close eye on the baby's symptoms and report any changes to the healthcare team. This includes measuring temperature, checking for signs of dehydration, and monitoring platelet count regularly.\n\n4. Pain Management: Pain relievers like acetaminophen may be used in certain situations to manage symptoms such as headache and muscle pain. Consult a pediatrician before administering any medication.\n\n5. Rest and Recovery: Allow the baby to rest as much as possible. Reduce their activity level and provide a calming environment to help their body focus on recovery.\n\n6. Protect from Infection: Since dengue fever lowers the body's ability to fight infections, prevent the baby from being exposed to unnecessary bacterial or viral infections. Ensure that their hospital room is kept clean, and practice good hand hygiene.\n\n7. Follow-up care: After the baby's release from the hospital, continue to monitor their symptoms and follow-up with their pediatrician as directed. Keep an eye out for signs of complications such as hemorrhage or severe dehydration.\n\n8. Prevention: Ensure the baby is protected against future dengue infections by using mosquito nets, applying insect repellent, and eliminating standing water in the surroundings where mosquitoes can breed.\n\nAgain, please consult your nephew's healthcare team for the best advice and treatment options for supporting their recovery."}
{"question": "Is Erytop cream good for pimples ?HIi Team, I am 23 years old and have pimples on my face so started using Erytop cream and i am applying in the night and leaving on overnite and washing in the morning. Please advise is that a good option or can i do something better Regards,", "human": "HiWelcome to HCMRead your prob, this is common prob at your age, if you have suffering from painful acne then you should take an antibiotic after advising your doc along with that cream. you should wash your face frequently, take protine riched diet, n avoid fatty n spicy diet.", "ai": " Erythromycin topical cream, like Erytop cream, is an antibiotic commonly used to treat bacterial infections, including acne. It works by reducing the number of bacteria on the skin and decreasing inflammation. However, it's essential to note that it should not be used as your only treatment for acne, as it only addresses the bacterial aspect of the problem.\n\nIf you have mild to moderate acne, a skincare regimen that includes cleansing, exfoliating, and using a comedolytic ingredient like salicylic acid can be more effective. The American Academy of Dermatology (AAD) recommends using a cleanser with salicylic acid to help unclog pores and fight acne-causing bacteria. You can also consider using over-the-counter topical retinoids for additional benefits, such as improving skin texture and reducing the appearance of blemishes and hyperpigmentation.\n\nIf your acne is more severe or not responding to over-the-counter treatments, it's best to consult with a dermatologist or healthcare professional for prescription options. They can help determine the underlying causes of your acne and recommend a customized treatment plan.\n\nUsing Erytop cream as your only acne treatment might not be enough, as it doesn't address other potential contributing factors like excess oil production, clogged pores, or hormonal imbalances. A multi-step skincare regimen, focused on your skin's individual needs, is likely to be more effective for managing and preventing acne in the long term.\n\nIn summary, while Erytop cream can help with the bacterial aspect of acne, using it alone is unlikely to give you the best results. Consider incorporating a well-formulated acne skincare regimen and consulting a professional if your acne persists or worsens."}

However, MS is just one possible diagnosis, and it is important to wait for your doctor's evaluation and interpretation of your imaging studies before jumping to conclusions.\n\nThe symptoms you described, such as numbness in the lower back, hip, and left leg, as well as the cervical neck, could be indicative of nerve damage or compression. MS is a chronic autoimmune condition that affects the central nervous system and can cause a wide range of symptoms, including numbness and tingling, muscle weakness, and balance and coordination problems. However, other conditions, such as herniated discs or peripheral neuropathy, can also cause similar symptoms.\n\nIt is important to remember that MS is only one possible diagnosis, and your doctor will consider various factors, including your age, medical history, symptoms, and imaging results, to make an accurate diagnosis. If you are concerned about MS, it is important to discuss your symptoms and concerns with your doctor and ask any questions you may have. They can provide you with more information and help you understand your diagnosis and treatment options."}
{"question": "Can a blood test show the presence of cancer?Can you tell through blood test if you have cancer ? The past 6 months I have been feeling very strange, dizzy low-high blood pressure, hard to breath. I noticed I am looseing 2 pounds a week, even though I am eating very fatning foods & high calorie junk foods. thank you.", "human": "Hi and welcome to HCM. Thanks for the query. well basic blood tests cant show presence of tumor expect in some rare cases. there are specific blood tests which could indicate cetain types of tumor but it should be done if there is some symptom indicative of tumor.Wish you good health. Regards", "ai": " A blood test can detect certain types of cancers by measuring specific tumor markers or biomarkers in the blood. These markers are substances produced by cancer cells or by the body in response to cancer. However, it's important to note that a positive test result does not necessarily mean you have cancer, and a negative result does not guarantee that you are cancer-free.\n\nThere are several types of blood tests used to detect cancer, including:\n\n1. Tumor marker tests: These tests measure specific substances, such as CA-125, PSA, or AFP, which are produced by certain types of cancer cells. For example, CA-125 is often used to monitor ovarian cancer, while PSA is used to screen for prostate cancer.\n2. Complete blood count (CBC): This test measures the number of red and white blood cells, platelets, and hemoglobin in the blood. Abnormal results can be a sign of various conditions, including cancer.\n3. Chemistry panel: This test measures the levels of various chemicals, such as glucose, electrolytes, bilirubin, and creatinine, in the blood. Abnormal results can indicate the presence of cancer or other medical conditions.\n4. Liver function tests: These tests measure the levels of certain enzymes and proteins that are produced by the liver. Abnormal results can indicate liver damage, which can be caused by some types of cancer.\n5. Bone marrow tests: Sometimes, a blood test may suggest abnormalities that require further testing, such as a bone marrow biopsy.\n\nIt's important to note that many of these tests can also be abnormal for reasons other than cancer, such as infections, kidney or liver disease, or nutritional deficiencies. Therefore, a positive test result should always be followed up with further testing and consultation with a healthcare professional.\n\nIn your case, if you have been feeling dizzy, experiencing low-high blood pressure, having difficulty breathing, and losing weight without trying, I would recommend talking to your healthcare provider. They may recommend various tests, including a blood test, to help determine the cause of your symptoms. It's also important to mention that unexplained weight loss can be a sign of various medical conditions, including cancer. However, it's also important to remember that there are many potential causes for these symptoms, and it's important to avoid jumping to conclusions without further evaluation."}

Healthy lifestyle: Maintain a healthy lifestyle during pregnancy, including a balanced diet, regular exercise, and avoiding harmful substances and habits like smoking, alcohol, and drugs.\n\n5. Consult with your healthcare provider: Before trying to conceive, discuss your concerns with your healthcare provider, who can answer any questions and address your specific situation.\n\nIt's important to remember that many children born to first cousin parents grow up healthy and lead normal lives. Your concern is understandable but trying to alleviate your worries by taking appropriate steps is the best thing you can do for a healthy pregnancy.\n\nI wish you and your husband all the best in your journey towards starting a family. Good luck!"}

The timing you've mentioned suggests that ovulation occurred around the time of unprotected sex, increasing the chances of pregnancy. However, it's important to note that every woman's menstrual cycle is different, and some may ovulate earlier or later than the expected date. The exact risk of pregnancy in this situation is difficult to determine without more information.\n\nIf your girlfriend does get pregnant, it's essential to understand that abortion is a complex decision with moral, ethical, and legal implications. The availability and access to abortion services depend on various factors, such as the jurisdiction, individual circumstances, and personal beliefs. It's essential to discuss this option with a healthcare professional as soon as possible to receive accurate information and guidance.\n\nAvoiding unprotected sex and using effective birth control methods can minimize the risk of unwanted pregnancies in the future. It's also crucial to consider discussing emergency contraception like Plan B or Ella with your healthcare provider after a potential exposure, especially if menstruation is delayed or absent."}
{"question": "What does this chest X-ray indicate?I have a copy of chest x-ray that I had to check for Pneumonia The doctor said no Pneumonia but rather asthmatic bronchitis.

The costophrenic angles are sharp heart not enlarged aorta is uncoiled. Can you tell me what all this means", "human": "Thanks for your question on Healthcare Magic.I can understand your concern. I have gone through the x ray report you have mentioned. This x ray report is normal. No need to worry for pneumonia or tuberculosis. Asthmatic bronchitis is diagnosed by PFT (Pulmonary Function Test). Chest x ray is almost always normal in asthmatic bronchitis.So better to consult pulmonologist and get done clinical examination of respiratory system and PFT (Pulmonary Function Test).If PFT is showing obstructive defect then asthmatic bronchitis is likely. Hope I have solved your query. I will be happy to help you further. Wish you good health. Thanks.", "ai": " Based on the information provided in your chest X-ray report, the following are the key findings:\n\n* No acute infiltrations: This means that there is no evidence of a new infection or consolidation in the lungs.\n* Slight coarsening of the bronchovascular markings: This is a subtle sign of thickening of the walls of the bronchial tubes and the blood vessels surrounding the lungs. It is often seen in conditions like asthma, chronic bronchitis, and emphysema.\n* Sharp costophrenic angles: This means that there is no fluid in the pleural spaces surrounding the lungs, indicating no evidence of pleural effusion.\n* Normal heart size: The heart size appears to be normal, which rules out heart failure.\n* Uncoiled aorta: The aorta, which is the large blood vessel that carries blood from the heart to the rest of the body, appears to be uncoiled and of normal caliber.\n\nBased on these findings, it appears that your symptoms and chest X-ray results are consistent with a diagnosis of asthmatic bronchitis rather than pneumonia. Asthmatic bronchitis is a condition characterized by chronic coughing and bronchial inflammation, often in the absence of an acute infection. While it's unusual for someone who had outgrown asthma to experience a relapse, it's not unheard of, particularly if they're exposed to environmental triggers like pollution or allergens. If you have any concerns or questions about your diagnosis or treatment, I would recommend speaking with your doctor for further clarification."}

These tests will help on understanding the situation. Talk to your GP about this.Hope this helps.Best regards", "ai": " Based on the information provided, it is important to consider other possible causes of sudden numbness in the right leg and arms aside from brain or spinal conditions. Some potential causes to consider are:\n\n1. Peripheral Artery Disease (PAD): This condition is characterized by the narrowing or blocking of the blood vessels that supply blood to the legs and arms. PAD can cause numbness, pain, and weakness in the affected limbs.\n2. Diabetes: High blood sugar levels can cause nerve damage, leading to numbness and tingling sensations in the limbs.\n3. Multiple Sclerosis (MS): MS is an autoimmune disease that can affect the central nervous system, including the brain, optic nerves, and spinal cord. However, given that your wife's MRI and spinal tap results have come back negative, MS seems less likely.\n4. Thoracic Outlet Syndrome: This condition occurs when the blood vessels or nerves in the area between the collarbone and the first rib become compressed, leading to numbness, tingling, and weakness in the affected limbs.\n5. Vitamin B12 deficiency: A deficiency in this important vitamin can cause nerve damage, leading to numbness, tingling, and weakness in the limbs.\n\nTo investigate these possibilities, your wife may need additional tests, such as:\n\n1. Ankle-Brachial Index (ABI) test: This non-invasive test measures the blood flow in the legs and can help diagnose PAD.\n2. Electromyography (EMG) test: This test measures the electrical activity of muscles and can help identify nerve damage.\n3. Nerve conduction study (NCS): This test measures the ability of nerves to transmit electrical signals and can help identify nerve damage.\n4. Vitamin B12 levels test: This blood test can help diagnose a deficiency in this essential vitamin.\n5. Ultrasound or angiogram: These imaging tests can help diagnose PAD by visualizing the blood vessels in the legs.\n\nIt's important to note that these tests are not conclusive and further evaluation by a healthcare professional is necessary for an accurate diagnosis."}

{"question": "Can I conceive while taking anti tubercular medicines?Dear doctor, I am 33 yrs old female having anti tubercular medicines for asymptomatic acites with mantoux test positive for 4 months, i am now taking Rcinex 600. i have to take it 2 more months according to my physician. Now i want to know if i can concieve during taking this medicine , is there any harm being pregnant?", "human": "Hallow Dear,Tuberculosis affects the fertility by:1. Reducing general health. Mother nature has arranged our body functioning in such a way that whenever there is any risk to life, the reproductory function is jeopardized first. However, Tuberculosis is such commonly wide spread disease in India and still the population is increasing. By and large, Pulmonary tuberculosis in early stage does not affect fertility. 2. By affecting the Reproductory Organs: When there is Genital tuberculosis, the tubes and uterine lining (endometrium) get affected. Affected endometrium is not conducive for implantation of the fertilized ovum and hence pregnancy is not possible. When the tubes get affected, there is tubal block. Along with the tubal block, tubal musculature also gets affected causing dysfunction in the tubal motility. Therefore, even after the surgical correction of the tubal block, if the tubal peristaltic movements are affected, conception is not possible. This is called as Functional Tubal Block; i.e. physically patent still functionally blocked tubes. You are suffering from Tubercular ascites. There is a good chance that due to ascetic fluid and peritoneal tubercular infection, the tubes and uterus also may be affected. Even, affection of the ovaries will affect the egg release function of the ovaries.Once your anti-tubercular treatment is over and you are declared completely cured of the tuberculosis, you should undergo some investigations like Hysterosalpingography (X-ray of uterus and tubes with radio-opaque dye in it) and/or Laparoscopy to assess the status of endometrium and tubes. Ultrasonography also will be of use for the purpose. These investigations only will inform us whether your reproductory organs are in a state to offer you any successful pregnancy. Madam, your first aim should be to get cured from Tuberculosis. Once you are cured, get investigated for fertility potential. Even if you are unable to conceive, you can adopt a child - this will give you a desired child, the child will get parents and still the population will not be increased. I hope this helps you with relevant information. Dr. Nishikant ShrotriDr. Nishikant Shrotri", "ai": " I am not a doctor, but I can try to provide you with some information that might help answer your question. It is important to consult with your healthcare provider about your specific situation.\n\nAnti-tubercular medications (ATMs) can affect fertility, menstrual cycles, and pregnancy. Some studies suggest that the use of ATMs, especially ethambutol and pyrazinamide, may increase the risk of fetal toxicity and teratogenic effects. However, most of these cases are anecdotal, and there is limited data on the safety of using ATMs during pregnancy.\n\nThere is currently no consensus among healthcare professionals about whether it is safe or recommended to discontinue ATMs before planning a pregnancy or during it. Some experts suggest that it may be safer to wait until after completing the treatment before attempting to conceive. Others argue that the potential benefits of completing the treatment without interruption outweigh the risks of continuing ATMs during pregnancy.\n\nIt is essential to discuss the potential risks and benefits with your healthcare provider, who can consider your individual medical history and circumstances. They may recommend alternative treatments or closer monitoring if you choose to attempt pregnancy while taking ATMs. It is vital to follow your healthcare provider's advice regarding your specific situation.\n\nIn summary, it is generally recommended that women avoid getting pregnant while taking ATMs for tuberculosis treatment. However, this decision should be made in consultation with your healthcare provider. Ultimately, the risks of continuing ATMs during pregnancy and the benefits of completing the treatment course without interruption should be carefully considered."}

A chest CT scan and biopsy of the lump may be necessary to determine the nature of this lesion. Hope to have been helpful!Best wishes, Dr. Iliri", "ai": " A pain or lump in the nipple area in a person with high blood pressure, but no other symptoms or relevant medical history, is generally not related to the high blood pressure itself. Rather, it could be a sign of a few common conditions:\n\n1. Nipple eczema or dermatitis: This condition causes itching, redness, and sometimes pain in the nipple area. It may also present as a small lump, but the primary symptom is often the discomfort, itching, or burning sensation in the nipple.\n\n2. Gynecomastia: Gynecomastia is the development of breast tissue in men, often characterized by a painless, firm or soft breast enlargement that can affect one or both breasts. Although pain in the nipple might not be a primary symptom, it's still a possible occurrence with gynecomastia. The growth of breast tissue in men could be due to various factors like aging, hormonal imbalance, obesity, certain medications, or chronic illnesses like high blood pressure.\n\n3. Infection: A breast infection could also present with pain in the nipple area and the formation of a lump in the breast tissue. Common infections impacting the breast include mastitis and abscess. Mastitis can occur following breastfeeding or be due to certain factors, such as aging, hormonal changes, and high blood pressure.\n\nThe presence of a pain in the left nipple with a little lump can be concerning. If your father-in-law is experiencing these symptoms, it's essential to have him examined by a healthcare professional. They should perform a thorough examination, including a mammogram or ultrasound, to identify and determine the root cause of the issue, ensuring an appropriate treatment plan is put in place."}

It can be any supernumerary tooth also.A small hole can be due to tear in the gum from where the permanent molar will erupt.In case if there is no other problem and her teeth had proper milestones then you need not to worry.You can also consult a Pedodontist and get her checked and an x-ray can be done to see the condition of underlying permanent teeth.It does not look like broken piece of permanent molar, so do not worry.However, an x-ray is more appropriate to rule out the exact condition of the permanent tooth.Hope I have answered your query. Let me know if I can assist you further.Regards,Dr. Honey Arora", "ai": " A hole in the gum area where a tooth piece has emerged is typically an indication of a baby tooth that is decayed or dying, and is in the process of being pushed out by a permanent tooth. This condition is called a \"gumbo\" or \"gumboo\" and is quite common, especially if your child is approaching the age where her permanent teeth are coming in. The tooth fragment that your daughter found is likely a part of the decayed baby tooth.\n\nHowever, if you are concerned about the appearance of the hole or if your daughter is exhibiting signs of discomfort, it would be a good idea to make an appointment with your dentist to have the area checked. They can confirm the cause of the hole and recommend any necessary treatment, such as filling or extracting the decayed tooth if it's not yet ready to fall out on its own.\n\nIt's also worth noting that an enamel pearl is a small, round, white or translucent nodule that sometimes forms on the outer surface of a tooth, usually near the gum line. These pearls are not a cause for concern and do not result in holes in the gum. Instead, they are caused by calcified deposits of minerals in the enamel, and are often harmless. However, the presence of an enamel pearl does not explain the hole and tooth fragment in your daughter's gum."}

A sensation of a heart being squeezed or feeling like having a heart attack is a common symptom for chest pain or discomfort. This can be caused by various conditions, including:\n\n1. Angina: Angina is chest pain or discomfort caused by reduced blood flow to the heart muscle due to blocked arteries. The pain is often described as pressure, tightness, or heaviness, but it can also feel like a squeezing or crushing sensation in the chest. In some cases, angina can also cause pain in the left arm, neck, jaw, or back.\n2. Heart attack: A heart attack occurs when the blood flow to a part of the heart is blocked, causing the heart muscle to become damaged or die. The symptoms can be similar to angina, but the pain is usually more severe, accompanied by shortness of breath, sweating, and sometimes, numbness or tingling in the left arm.\n3. Panic attack: A panic attack is a sudden episode of intense fear or anxiety, often accompanied by physical symptoms, such as a Racing heartbeat, sweating, trembling, and shortness of breath. In some cases, the feeling of a squeezed or pounding heart during a panic attack can mimic the sensation of a heart attack.\n4. Other conditions: Other conditions, such as pneumonia, pulmonary embolism, or aortic dissection, can also cause chest pain, arm numbness, and a feeling of a squeezing or crushing heart sensation.\n\nIf you are experiencing these symptoms, it is essential to seek medical attention promptly to rule out any life-threatening conditions, such as a heart attack.

Hypothyroidism often causes weakness, cramps, myalgia, and a mild to moderate serum CPK elevation.Serum CK levels are strongly affected by race, sex, and physical activity.A patient with truly elevated levels should be evaluated for a variety of nonneuromuscular causes, including endocrine disorders, metabolic disturbances, drug effects, and malignancy.If you are diagnosed Asymptomatic, no Treatment Exists and Course is Often BenignMAY THIS OPINION HELP YOUbest wishes", "ai": " Elevated creatine phosphate kinase (CPK) levels in a type 2 diabetes patient can be caused by several conditions, including:\n\n1. Muscle damage: CPK is an enzyme found in high concentrations in the heart, brain, and skeletal muscles. Its levels tend to increase whenever there is muscle damage. In your case, the possible causes of muscle damage could be:\n- Exercise: As your rheumatologist noted, CPK may increase after vigorous physical activity due to muscle breakdown.\n- Trauma or injury: Any injury, no matter how minor, can lead to muscle damage and elevated CPK levels.\n- Kidney problems: Diabetes can cause kidney damage, leading to the build-up of creatinine and CPK in the blood.\n- Statin side effect: Statins, such as Lriptor, can cause muscle damage, leading to elevated CPK levels.\n2. Heart disease: heart disease, including congestive heart failure (CHF), can cause elevated CPK levels due to muscle damage or death in the heart (myocardial infarction or myocarditis).\n3. Brain damage: In rare cases, CPK can leak into the bloodstream from the brain due to brain damage or injury, such as strokes or traumatic brain injuries.\n\nRegarding how to lower CPK levels, your healthcare team can suggest the following options, depending on the underlying cause:\n\n1. Avoid intense physical activity: As mentioned, CPK can increase after vigorous exercise. Avoiding such activities might help lower CPK levels.\n2. Address underlying conditions: If you have kidney problems, managing your diabetes effectively and addressing any related complications can help lower CPK levels.\n3. Discontinue potentially causative medications: If your CPK levels were elevated due to Lriptor, other statins, or specific diabetes medications like fursagatinide (Perdiosine), your healthcare team might recommend alternative treatment options.\n\nIt's important to follow your healthcare team's recommendations closely and keep them updated on the progress of your condition. By closely managing your diabetes and addressing any co-existing conditions, you can help reduce your risk of elevated CPK levels and improve your overall health."}
{"question": "Is it to be concerned about the lump in the chest of child?Hi My baby has a small lump on his chest. when he was born i noticed a tiny hole and when we talked to the GP he said its nothing to worry about but now there is a lump in place of the hole and soft when pressed and kinda like jelly. he is not in any pain but am concerned what does this mean", "human": "Hi, welcome to HCM. I see similar cases in my clinic everyday. During prenatal period sometimes maternal hormones like estrogen pass in baby which causes swelling of breasts on 3 or 4 th day, a white creamy liquid may also ooze from the nipples. Usually, no treatment is required. Engorged breast should not be pressed, massaged or squeezed since this may result in infection. I hope this has helped you. Take care. Regards - Dr Deepak Patel, MD Pediatrics", "ai": " I'm an AI language model and not a doctor, but I can provide some general information that might help you understand this issue a bit better, and suggest some steps you can take to find out more. However, it is very important that you contact your baby's healthcare provider or seek professional medical advice as soon as possible to discuss your concerns and have the lump examined.\n\nThe tiny hole that was present at birth, which your doctor stated was nothing to worry about, could potentially have been a pectoralis muscle anomaly or a bruise, which healed and left no apparent scar. A small lump appearing in place of the hole may be due to several reasons such as:\n\n1. Fatty tissue: It is common for small pockets of fat to form in different areas of the body, including the chest.\n2. Accessory breast tissue: Breast tissue can extend beyond the usual location, forming additional small breast growths (areolas) or lumps.\n3. Cyst: A cyst is a fluid-filled sac that can form in various parts of the body. In the chest, these cysts are known as pectoral cysts. They are usually benign, but it is important to confirm the diagnosis with a healthcare professional.\n4. Other benign conditions: Other conditions like lipomas (fatty tumors) or fibromas (non-cancerous fibrous tumors) could also cause a small lump on the chest.\n\nAlthough there is no obvious sign of pain or discomfort, it is essential to have the lump evaluated by a healthcare professional. They might recommend imaging tests (such as ultrasound, CT scan, or MRI), a fine needle aspiration (FNA), or a biopsy, depending on the findings during a physical examination. If the lump turns out to be benign, your baby should be closely monitored for any signs of growth or other concerning changes.\n\nIt is important to remember that while the information provided here can help you understand the possibilities, a proper medical examination and diagnosis are crucial to ensuring the best outcome for your baby's overall health and wellbeing. If you haven't already, contact your GP, pediatrician, or a specialist in pediatric surgery for advice."}
{"question": "Suggest treatment for rashes on neckI had a questionable encounter with an individual about a year ago. I took a rapid test at a local clinic about 1 month ago, I have since developed a rash on my neck. As such, my question is 2 fold. How accurate are the rapid antibody tests, and can they be read incorrectly?", "human": "Hello,I read carefully your query and understand your concern. The Rapid test detects HIV antibodies in the blood. Most people will develop enough HIV antibodies to be detected three to four weeks after infection. The Rapid test is just as accurate as a Standard HIV test.If you test negative, then you do not require any further tests.Hope my answer was helpful.If you have further queries feel free to contact me again.Kind regards! Dr.Dorina Gurabardhi General &Family Physician", "ai": " Regarding the accuracy of rapid antibody tests for detecting HIV infection, they are generally reliable but not perfect. The sensitivity and specificity of these tests can vary depending on the brand, the timing of the test in relation to infection, and individual factors such as the immune system's response to the virus.\n\nThe Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) estimates that if a person is infected with HIV, the rapid test will correctly identify the infection in about 99.5% of cases. However, if a person does not have HIV, the test may give a false positive result in about 0.3% of cases.\n\nRegarding your neck rash, it may not be related to the possible HIV exposure. There are many causes of rashes, including infections, allergies, medications, and other skin conditions. It is important to consult a healthcare professional to have the rash evaluated. They will be able to assess the cause of the rash, provide appropriate treatment, and rule out any underlying medical conditions, including HIV infection if necessary.\n\nIt is important to note that a negative rapid test result does not rule out HIV infection completely. If you are concerned about a possible exposure, you should consider getting an HIV test again using a confirmatory blood test, which will provide a more definitive result. The confirmatory test measures the amount of HIV antibodies in your blood, which is a more accurate way to diagnose HIV infection.\n\nFinally, if you are concerned about the potential accuracy of the rapid test, it is important to remember that the test is only one tool in identifying HIV infection. A positive result should be confirmed with a blood test, and a negative result does not mean that you are not infected. If you have had a potential exposure to HIV, it is important to take steps to protect your sexual and reproductive health, including using condoms, getting tested regularly, and practicing safe sex."}

Let me know if any thing not clear.Thanks", "ai": " I'm not a doctor, but your symptoms of feeling extremely hot and sweating heavily even in cold temperatures, along with feeling cold and clammy, can be indicative of several conditions. Here are a few possibilities:\n\n1. Menopause: Hot flashes are a common symptom of menopause, which is a normal aging process for women. They usually occur as a result of hormonal fluctuations.\n2. Hyperhidrosis: Hyperhidrosis is a medical condition characterized by excessive sweating, even when the body does not need to cool down. It can affect various parts of the body or the entire body.\n3. Thyroid disorders: Thyroid conditions, such as hyperthyroidism or Graves' disease, can cause the body to produce too much thyroid hormone, leading to an increase in metabolism and body temperature, as well as sweating.\n4. Diabetes: Diabetes, particularly diabetes that is not well-controlled, can cause the body to experience hot flashes and excessive sweating as a result of blood sugar swings.\n5. Anxiety or stress: Mental and emotional stress can also cause hot flashes and excessive sweating.\n\nIt's important to note that these are just possibilities, and only a healthcare professional can diagnose the underlying cause of your symptoms. I would suggest making an appointment with your healthcare provider to discuss your symptoms and any concerns you may have. They can perform a physical examination, take a medical history, and order any necessary tests to help determine the cause and develop an appropriate treatment plan. In the meantime, you may find some relief by wearing light, breathable clothing, staying hydrated, and using fans or air conditioning to helpkeep cool."}

Rest and Ice: Rest your thumb as much as possible to avoid aggravating the injury. Apply ice packs to the affected area for 15-20 minutes at a time, three to four times a day to help reduce inflammation and pain.\n2. Compression: You may want to use a thumb brace or splint to provide compressive support and help immobilize the thumb. This can help reduce pain and promote proper healing.\n3. Over-the-counter pain relievers: Ibuprofen or acetaminophen can help manage the pain and reduce inflammation. Be sure to follow the recommended dosage on the label.\n4. Stretching and Exercises: Perform simple thumb and wrist stretches to maintain flexibility and improve circulation. Gently bend your thumb back and forth, rotate it, and make a fist with your hand.\n5. Modify activities: Avoid activities that worsen the pain, such as using a knife, writing, or gripping objects. Instead, switch to using tools or devices with an ergonomic design that minimize strain on the thumb and wrist.\n6.

Try to maintain a neutral wrist position and avoid bending your wrist too far back or forward.\n7. Massage therapy: Gentle massage of the affected area can help improve blood flow and reduce muscle tension.\n8. Heat therapy: Applying heat, such as a warm washcloth or heating pad, can help soothe pain and ease muscle tension.

You need to get take supplements for at least 3-4 months to neutralize deficiency. Also take milk and other milk products more. Don't worry, you will be alright with all these. Hope I have solved your query. I will be happy to help you further. Wish you good health. Thanks.", "ai": " I'm an assistant and not a doctor, but I can try to help you understand some possible causes of the sharp pain you experience when tightening certain muscles based on the information you've provided.\n\nOne possible explanation could be a condition called \"referred pain.\" This occurs when pain is felt in a location different from where the actual issue is originating. In your case, the pain might be originating from a problem within the digestive system or pelvic region, but you feel it in the muscles you tighten during bowel movements or when sitting on the toilet.\n\nAnother potential cause could be a muscle strain, spasm, or trigger point in the area. Muscle tightness, cramping, and spasms can result from various factors such as overuse, injury, or poor posture. Since you mention that this issue has been going on for six years, it's possible that you've developed chronic muscle tension or trigger points that cause pain in certain situations.\n\nLess frequently, more serious conditions like inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), irritable bowel syndrome (IBS), pelvic inflammatory disease (PID), or even rectus diaphragm issue could be causing your symptoms. However, these conditions generally come with more frequent and consistent symptoms.\n\nTo determine the exact cause, it is recommended that you consult a healthcare professional for a thorough evaluation. In the meantime, you can try relaxing techniques, such as deep breathing, progressive muscle relaxation, or yoga, to help alleviate muscle tension and discomfort. You may also find relief by addressing constipation or other common digestive issues through dietary modifications, increased hydration, and regular exercise."}

KP is a skin disorder characterized by small, hard, rough bumps that appear when the outer layer of skin clogs the opening of the hair follicle. The bumps usually appear on the upper arms, thighs, and the backs of the forearms. However, they can also develop on other areas like the hands, elbows, and feet.\n\nThe cause of KP is not fully understood, but it is believed to be related to a buildup of dead skin cells and keratin in the hair follicles. It's more common in people with dry or eczema-prone skin. The itching and hot/cold sensation you experience could be due to the irritation caused by the rough bumps or dryness of the skin.\n\nThere is no cure for KP, but there are several things you can do to help manage the symptoms:\n\n1. Keep the affected areas moisturized: Use a gentle moisturizer twice a day, especially after showering or bathing.\n2. Exfoliate regularly: Use a gentle scrub or exfoliating glove to help remove dead skin cells and unclog pores. Be sure to do this gently to avoid irritating the skin.\n3. Avoid hot water: Try to limit your showers or baths to lukewarm water, as hot water can dry out the skin and make the bumps worse.\n4. Avoid harsh soaps: Use a gentle, fragrance-free soap to wash your hands and body.\n5. Wear soft, breathable clothing: Avoid wearing tight clothing that can irritate the affected areas.\n\nIf your symptoms are severe or do not improve with self-care measures, it's a good idea to see a healthcare provider or a dermatologist to rule out other conditions and discuss potential treatment options.\n\nKeep in mind that while there are ways to manage KP, there is no quick fix or cure. Consistency in your care routine is key to keeping the bumps under control."}

It make uterine environment favorable for implantation and support the pregnancy.- Metformin: decrease insulin resistance and mainatin glucose homeostasis.- Clomiphene citrate: It induces the ovualtion and should be taken from 3rd to 8th day. It increases the chance of pregnancy. It should be taken for 3-5 cycle. USG and ovarian follicle study should be done after taking it to know the ovarian follicle rupture.

Avoid stress, take small frequent meal rather than large meal, drink plenty of water, do regular exercise and maintain weight according to BMI.Hope I have answered your query. Let me know if I can assist you further.Regards, Dr. Sagar", "ai": " I cannot definitively answer whether Ovosule (letrozole) is the best medication for getting pregnant while having Polycystic Ovary Syndrome (PCOS), as this question involves individualized medical advice. However, I can provide you with some information about Ovosule and its use in treating PCOS-related infertility.\n\nOvosule is a selective estrogen receptor modulator (SERM) that is primarily used to treat breast cancer in women. It works by inhibiting the production of estrogen in the ovaries, which can help to restore regular menstrual cycles and ovulation in women with PCOS.\n\nNumerous studies have shown that Ovosule can improve ovulation rates, menstrual regularity, and clinical pregnancy rates in women with PCOS. Specifically, it can help to increase the thickness and quality of the uterine lining (endometrium), improve insulin sensitivity, and reduce ovarian androgen levels.\n\nHowever, it is important to note that using Ovosule to get pregnant is a complex process that requires medical supervision. The dosage, duration of treatment, and monitoring for potential side effects must be carefully considered and managed by a healthcare professional. Additionally, there are other treatment options for PCOS-related infertility, such as Clomiphene citrate or Letrazole in combination with Gonadotropins, that may be more suitable for some women.\n\nSo, while Ovosule has shown promising results in helping women with PCOS to conceive, it is not a one-size-fits-all solution. Your healthcare provider can help you to determine the best treatment approach for your specific situation based on your medical history, current symptoms, and personal preferences.\n\nIn summary, Ovosule can be an effective option for women with PCOS who are struggling to get pregnant due to ovulation issues. However, it is important to consult with your healthcare provider to discuss the potential benefits and risks of this medication and to explore other treatment options if necessary. Remember, there is hope for a normal pregnancy, and with proper care and guidance, you can increase your chances of achieving this goal."}

If it is biliary pathology dietary care should include avoiding fatty foods, dairy products, egg, called cholecystokinetic foods. If it is a peptic ulcer disease dietary care should include avoiding acidic, spicy, irritant foods, alcohol and even smoking.", "ai": " I'm an AI language model and unable to provide medical advice, but I can suggest some general dietary guidelines that may help manage symptoms of gallbladder conditions, such as gallstones or bile reflux. However, it's essential to consult a healthcare professional or dietitian for personalized advice, as everyone's condition and needs are unique.\n\n1. Focus on a low-fat, low-fried, high-fiber diet: Gallbladder conditions may make it difficult for the body to digest high-fat foods. Avoiding large amounts of fats, especially saturated and trans fats, can help alleviate discomfort. Cooking methods like baking, broiling, and steaming are better options than frying. Consuming plenty of fiber-rich fruits, vegetables, and whole grains can help regulate digestion and promote optimal gallbladder function.\n\n2. Small, frequent meals: Eating smaller meals more frequently throughout the day instead of large, heavy meals can help reduce pressure on the gallbladder and improve symptoms.\n\n3. Avoid trigger foods: Certain foods can worsen symptoms for those with gallbladder conditions. Trigger foods may include fatty or greasy foods, fried foods, processed foods, high-fiber foods, and gassy foods (such as beans, broccoli, cabbage, and onions). It's essential to identify personal triggers and avoid them as much as possible.\n\n4. Eat gradually: Chewing food thoroughly and eating at a leisurely pace can help minimize the discomfort caused by eating.\n\n5. Hydration: Staying hydrated is crucial for overall health and optimal gallbladder function. Aim for at least eight glasses of water per day.\n\n6. Monitor your symptoms: Keep a food diary to record which foods may worsen your symptoms. If you experience pain or discomfort after eating, consult a healthcare professional for further guidance.\n\nWhile the information provided here can be valuable, it's essential to consult a medical professional for specific dietary advice based on your condition and personal needs."}

{"question": "Are there chances of pregnancy on fingering the vagina ?Yesterday that is on 4th i met my boyfriend.He inserted his finger into my vagina some 6 times and tried to satisfy me. But all these times he washed his hands with dettol each time he inserted them. Is there any chance of pregnancy?", "human": "Hello welcome to healthcare magic. Pregnancy can only occur during intercourse where the penis is inserted into the vagina and sperm is ejaculated into the vagina. The sperm has to have contact with an egg from the ovary for pregnancy to occur.", "ai": " Fingering alone, with proper hygiene practices like your boyfriend using soap or an antiseptic solution like Dettol each time before touching you, does not increase the risk of pregnancy. Sperm from the male body typically remains viable in the reproductive tract for up to five days after sexual activity. However, the presence of semen is necessary for fertilization to occur. Therefore, as long as no semen was introduced during the fingering, the likelihood of pregnancy is extremely low. It's essential to communicate openly with your partner about contraception and safe sexual practices to reduce the risk of unintended pregnancies. If you have concerns or questions about sexual health or pregnancy, consult a healthcare professional for accurate information."}

You should consult a dentist to check for any problem in your oral cavity.If the problem is due to calculus and plaque it can be removed by scaling and polishing of your teeth. Flossing of teeth and tongue cleaning using tongue scraper should be done daily.", "ai": " I'm here to help, Thangtling from Tampa, FL! The fact that you brush three times a day is great, but there could be other causes for your persistent mouth odor. Here are a few things to consider:\n\n1. Poor oral hygiene: Brushing only removes the bacteria on the surface of your teeth and tongue. Make sure to clean your tongue every time you brush, and floss daily to remove food particles and bacteria between your teeth.\n2. Dry mouth: Saliva plays an essential role in keeping your mouth clean and fresh. If you have a dry mouth, which can be caused by several factors including certain medications, medical conditions, or aging, you may be more prone to bad breath. Try drinking plenty of water throughout the day, chewing sugar-free gum, or using a saliva substitute to help increase saliva production.\n3. Diet: Some foods, such as garlic, onions, and spicy foods, can cause temporary bad breath. Regularly consuming these foods can contribute to persistent bad breath. Brushing your teeth after meals can help, but consider incorporating more fresh fruits and vegetables into your diet to help freshen your breath naturally.\n4. Medical conditions: Certain medical conditions, such as gum disease, sinus infections, or diabetes, can cause persistent bad breath. If you continue to experience bad breath despite good oral hygiene habits, it's important to speak with your dentist or doctor to rule out any underlying medical conditions.\n5. Smoking: Smoking not only stains your teeth and harms your overall health, but it also contributes to bad breath. If you smoke, consider quitting to improve your oral health and freshen your breath.\n\nI hope this information is helpful, Thangtling!

If you're experiencing significant pain, swelling, numbness, or difficulty moving your knee, it's a good idea to consult a healthcare professional. Here are some self-care steps you can take in the meantime:\n\n* Rest: Avoid putting weight on the knee as much as possible to allow it to heal.\n* Ice: Apply an ice pack to the knee for 15-20 minutes at a time, several times a day, to help reduce swelling and pain.\n* Compression: Consider using an elastic bandage or knee brace to help reduce swelling and provide support to the knee.\n* Elevation: Try to keep the knee elevated when possible to help reduce swelling.\n* Over-the-counter pain relievers: Continue taking Advil or other nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) as needed for pain relief, but be mindful of potential side effects and don't take more than the recommended dose.\n* Avoid alcohol consumption: Alcohol can increase bleeding and make it harder for your body to heal, so try to avoid drinking alcohol for at least 24-48 hours after your injury.\n\nIf your symptoms do not improve or worsen over the next few days, or if you're unable to walk, bear weight on the affected leg, or experience significant swelling or redness, you should seek medical attention at a healthcare facility, such as an urgent care center or emergency room. Additionally, if you have any underlying health conditions, chronic illnesses, or take blood thinners, you should consult your healthcare provider before attempting any self-care treatments."}
{"question": "Can blood tests for suspected MS mean a different diagnosis?I MS suffer told me that there is a disease that mimics MS.   I a still in the stage that they seem to think that they believe a am 97% that I have MS.   My neurologist after recently having a MIR sent me now to have blood tests.Could this mean they are considering something else.", "human": "Dear there area by desease which has similar symptoms that's why doctors make a lot of examinations before determinate the diagnose.Blood tests don't really helps in determinating MS but exlude other pathologies.MS diagnose is made by clinical findings,MRI,PEV and CSL examination.Anyway you should be patient and wait the result of the examination.Dont hesitate to contact me for further questions, wish you all the best", "ai": " Yes, there are conditions that can mimic Multiple Sclerosis (MS), and your neurologist may be considering other differentials based on your symptoms and the results of your investigations so far. MS is a complex disease that can present with various signs and symptoms, and it's essential to rule out other conditions that may have similar characteristics. Some conditions that can mimic MS include:\n\n1. Neuromyelitis Optica (NMO): This is an autoimmune disease characterized by attacks on the optic nerves and spinal cord. It often presents with symptoms similar to MS, but the response to treatments and the immune markers in the blood are different.\n2. Vitamin B12 deficiency: Deficiency in Vitamin B12 can cause neurological symptoms, including numbness, tingling, and weakness, which can resemble MS. However, blood tests can identify low levels of Vitamin B12, and treatment with Vitamin B12 supplements can help improve symptoms.\n3. Lyme disease: Lyme disease is a bacterial infection that can affect various organs, including the nervous system. It can cause neurological symptoms, such as muscle weakness, numbness, and tingling, which can be similar to MS. Blood tests can help diagnose Lyme disease.\n4. Myasthenia Gravis: Myasthenia Gravis is an autoimmune disease that affects the nerves that control muscle movement. It can cause fatigue, weakness, and muscle cramps, which can resemble MS. Blood tests and other diagnostic tests, such as an electromyography (EMG) or a single-fiber electromyography (SFEMG), can help diagnose Myasthenia Gravis.\n5. Sarcoidosis: Sarcoidosis is a systemic inflammatory disease that can affect various organs, including the nervous system. It can cause symptoms similar to MS, including muscle weakness, numbness, and tingling. Blood tests and imaging studies, such as a chest x-ray, can help diagnose Sarcoidosis.\n\nYour neurologist may order blood tests to rule out these conditions and others. A definitive diagnosis of MS can only be made with a combination of clinical assessment, imaging studies, and lab tests. If you have any concerns about your diagnosis or the potential for other conditions, it's essential to discuss them with your neurologist. They can provide you with more information about the diagnostic process and the options available to you."}

{"question": "Is CLL affected by testosterone therapy?I am a 59 year-old-male who was diagnosed with CLL about one and one half years ago.  No symptoms at this time except possibly a little fatigue.  I also suspect that I may have a low testosterone level because I don't have much hair on my legs any more, energy level is down, weight has increased a bit, and sexual desire is a bit diminished.  My question is whether or not testosterone therapy will have any effect on CLL.", "human": "Hi,Thanks for writing in.Testosterone therapy is unlikely to influence development and progress of CLL. Once you have CLL it is better to get a follow up done since it has been one and a half year from detection which is not many days back. Please get your blood tests and ultrasound scan done to know if you have any features of CLL.Diminishing of sexual desire is present in many patients of CLL during recovery and you appear to have had CLL only recently and recovery is taking place slowly. However your fatigue requires to be investigated and if you need to continue treatment for CLL. Please do not worry.", "ai": " There is limited data specifically addressing the impact of testosterone therapy on Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia (CLL). However, some studies suggest that testosterone may have an effect on the behavior of B-cells, including those found in CLL, but the results are not consistent.\n\nAndrogens, such as testosterone, have been reported to stimulate the proliferation of CLL cells in some laboratory studies. On the other hand, other studies have shown that androgens may inhibit CLL cell growth or even induce apoptosis (cell death) under certain conditions.\n\nMoreover, there is a possibility that the observed symptoms in your case, such as fatigue, weight gain, and decreased sexual desire, may not be directly related to CLL but rather to the low testosterone levels. In this case, testosterone replacement therapy could improve symptoms unrelated to CLL.\n\nIt is essential to discuss your concerns with your healthcare professional, as they can evaluate your symptoms fully and provide guidance based on your individual circumstances. They might recommend further tests to confirm a definitive diagnosis of low testosterone levels and the appropriate treatment options.\n\nKeep in mind that the potential risks and benefits of testosterone therapy, including its impact on CLL, should be carefully considered before making a decision. Regular monitoring of your CLL and testosterone levels during therapy will also be vital to ensure your health is not compromised."}
{"question": "Why does my arm has been getting shooting pain?Hi there, my arm has been getting some shooting/ throbbing pain lately. It's around my bicep area and it happens at odd times.I'm an overweight person who is currently eating and working out healthy. Could it be that it's my health? Or something else?", "human": "Dear patient Sharp shooting pain in arm on one side is radicular pain. This pain is sharp pain caused due to nerve root compression in cervical spine. Treatment  is tab pregalin x 75 mg one at bedtime and tab ibuprofen 400 mg thrice a day for 7 days. Xray of cervical spine anteroposterior and lateral views should be done to see local pathology at spine. If pain is not relieved in 7 days mri of cervical spine should be done.", "ai": " I'm not a doctor, but I can try to help you understand some possible causes of shooting pain in your arm based on the information you've provided. However, it's important to note that only a healthcare professional can diagnose your condition definitively.\n\nShooting pain in the arm can be caused by various conditions, some of which are related to your health and others not. Here are some possible causes:\n\n1. Nerve compression: One common cause of shooting pain is nerve compression, such as in the case of carpal tunnel syndrome or brachial plexus injuries. Nerve compression can cause pain, tingling, or numbness in the arm.\n2. Muscle strain or injury: Lifting heavy objects, working out too hard, or repetitive motions can cause muscle strain or injury, leading to shooting pain.\n3. Arterial or venous problems: Less common causes of shooting pain in the arm can be related to blood flow issues, such as arterial or venous problems.\n4. Other conditions: Other conditions, such as diabetes, hypothyroidism, or heart disease, can cause shooting pain in the arm.\n\nSince you mentioned that you're currently eating and working out healthy, nerve compression or muscle strain might be possible causes. However, it's important to rule out other conditions as well. Therefore, I would suggest you consult a healthcare professional, such as your primary care physician or a specialist, for a proper evaluation and diagnosis. They might recommend various tests, such as a nerve conduction study or an MRI scan, to determine the cause of your symptoms.\n\nIn the meantime, you can try to ease the pain by resting your arm, avoiding activities that aggravate the pain, and applying ice packs to the affected area to reduce inflammation. If the pain persists, you might consider taking over-the-counter pain medication or seeking medical attention to prevent any further complications."}
{"question": "Need suggestions to avoid infections on woundI just had a tolet back up and I had to put my hand in with a slightly open wound. Very small wound though.

She is also on her period and i was wondering if there is anyway that i contracted something.", "human": "Thanks for your query at HCMI think there is no need to worry! I suppose you would have washed your hands properly after cleaning. Just apply some triple action cream on the wound and get vaccinated for tetanus. Keep your wound clean wash with chlorhexidine based hand wash.Take care!", "ai": " I'm sorry to hear about the unpleasant experience you had with the toilets and the potential exposure to a small wound. While I cannot definitively rule out the possibility of infection, there are several steps you can take to minimize your risk:\n\n1. Clean the wound: Rinse the wound with clean water for at least 15 minutes several times a day. Use an antibacterial soap if you have it on hand. Gently pat the area dry with a clean towel.\n2. Apply an antibiotic ointment: Apply a thin layer of an over-the-counter or prescription antibiotic ointment to the wound after cleaning to prevent infection.\n3. Cover the wound: Use a sterile bandage to cover the wound and keep it clean and protected from the environment.\n4. Wash your hands: Frequently wash your hands with soap and water, especially before and after caring for the wound, to reduce the risk of infection.\n5. Avoid touching the wound unnecessarily: Try not to touch the wound unnecessarily to reduce the risk of introducing bacteria or other potential contaminants.\n6. Monitor the wound for signs of infection: Look for signs of infection such as redness, swelling, warmth, increased pain, or pus. If you notice any of these symptoms, contact your healthcare provider for further evaluation and treatment.\n\nAs for the concern about sexually transmitted infections (STIs), the risk is likely low, especially if the exposure was brief and the wound was covered. However, it is a good idea to get tested for STIs if you have reason to believe you may have been exposed. Your healthcare provider can advise you on the best procedures for testing and treatment. In the meantime, consider using barrier methods during sexual activity to protect against STIs and unintended pregnancies."}

However, I can suggest some general approaches to help reduce the appearance of a pimple or acne on a child's nose.\n\n1. Keep the area clean: Encourage your daughter to clean her nose gently with a soft cloth and a mild, fragrance-free cleanser twice a day. Avoid using harsh scrubs or abrasive materials that can irritate the skin and potentially make the problem worse.\n\n2. Maintain good hygiene: Make sure your daughter pays close attention to washing her face once or twice a day, especially after physical activity or sweating. Use a gentle cleanser and avoid picking at or squeezing pimples.\n\n3. Use acne treatment products: Over-the-counter acne treatments containing salicylic acid or benzoyl peroxide can be effective for treating pimples in children. Apply a small amount to the affected area, following the directions on the label. Be sure to check with your pediatrician before starting any new treatment.\n\n4. Consider over-the-counter adhesive bandages: Applying a small, over-the-counter, adhesive bandage to the area for one or two days can help keep the affected area from being touched and reduce the risk of further irritation. Be sure to change the bandage every day or two to keep the area clean.\n\n5. Diet and lifestyle: Encourage your daughter to maintain a healthy diet rich in fruits, vegetables, lean proteins, and whole grains. Staying hydrated by drinking plenty of water can also help to keep her skin looking its best. Encourage regular physical activity to help manage stress, which can contribute to acne.\n\n6. Consult a healthcare provider: If your daughter's pimple persists despite these home remedies or if it causes her significant distress, consider seeking the advice of a pediatrician or dermatologist for further evaluation and treatment options.\n\nDisclaimer: This information is for educational purposes only and is not meant to replace the advice of a medical professional.

{"question": "What is the treatment for blood in semen?I am 30 yrs old and have been masturbating for many years. recently i experienced blood in my semen. there was no pain or any other symptom. I have just got a urine test done and it shows a minor bacterial infection.please suggest possible cuases and whether it needs further investigation. I am a fit individual otherwise.", "human": "Hi, Take ultrasound pelvis and antibiotics for treatment and test for prostate issue. I hope I have answered your query. If you have further doubts, I would be happy to help you. Happy day.Regards,Dr. S. R. Raveendran, Sexologist", "ai": " I cannot definitively diagnose the cause of blood in semen based on the information you have provided. However, I can suggest some possible causes and reasons for further investigation.\n\n1. Trauma: Blood in semen can sometimes be due to trauma during sexual activity, such as rough masturbation or vigorous intercourse. However, since you mentioned that you have not experienced any pain or other symptoms, this is less likely the cause.\n2. Prostate infection or inflammation: Prostatitis, an infection or inflammation of the prostate gland, can cause blood in semen. This can also cause other symptoms, such as pain, fever, or difficulty urinating. Your urine test showing a minor bacterial infection supports this possibility. Further testing, such as a prostate exam, prostate-specific antigen (PSA) test, or prostate culture, may be necessary to rule out or confirm this diagnosis.\n3. Benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH): BPH, an enlargement of the prostate gland, can cause blood in semen. This condition is common in older men but can also affect younger men. BPH does not typically cause any other symptoms besides blood in semen. A digital rectal exam or prostate ultrasound may be needed to diagnose BPH.\n4. Sperm disorders: Certain disorders that affect the production, function, or maturation of sperm cells in the testicles can cause blood in semen. These disorders include varicocele, testicular tumors, and cystic fibrosis. Further testing, such as a sperm analysis or testicular ultrasound, may be needed to diagnose these conditions.\n5. Cancer: Rarely, blood in semen can be a sign of malignancy, such as prostate cancer, testicular cancer, or bladder cancer. A thorough evaluation, including a physical exam, blood tests, urine tests, and imaging studies, may be necessary to rule out this possibility.\n\nSince your urine test showed a minor bacterial infection, I would recommend following up with your healthcare provider to discuss the results and any further testing that may be needed. Your provider may also recommend antibiotics to treat the infection. If the infection does not improve with antibiotics or if other causes of blood in semen are suspected, additional tests may be necessary.\n\nIt is important to note that having one episode of blood in semen does not necessarily mean that you have a serious condition. However, it is always best to have any new symptoms checked out by a healthcare professional to ensure that you are in good health."}

{"question": "Is sore palate can be a result of post nasal drip?Can a sore palate be a result of post nasal drip. pseudophed helps.", "human": "I have an extremely sore palate at the roof of my mouth. It is irritated & aggrevated by hot food and salt. I've had two teeth extracted this week and have been told to use hot salty water to aid the healing process, i can't do this as the pain is excruciating and salt aggrevates even more. I also have a cold sore on my lip. What do you think is the cause of the sore palate at the roof of my mouth & are there any home remedies or cures or something i can buy over the counter?", "ai": " Yes, a sore palate can be a result of post nasal drip (PND). PND occurs when mucus from the nose drips down to the back of the throat, which can irritate the palate and cause discomfort or pain. This is also known as a postnasal drip cough or postnasal drip sore throat.\n\nWhen mucus lingers in the back of the throat, it can cause irritation, leading to symptoms such as a sore or scratchy palate, throat clearing, and a persistent cough. Pseud Ephedrine (Sudafed PE), a decongestant medication, can help alleviate some of the symptoms of PND by reducing congestion and helping to clear mucus from the nasal passages. However, it's essential to consult your healthcare provider to determine the underlying cause of your PND and the most appropriate treatment options for your specific condition."}
{"question": "What are the chances of pregnancy if penis was not completely hard and could not finish?Me and my partner were having intercourse but the condoms were tight so he wasn t fully hard.

The pre-ejaculatory fluids may contain sperm and can potentially result in pregnancy if they come into contact with the vaginal opening or cervix.\n\nHowever, the exact risk level is difficult to determine as it depends on individual circumstances. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention estimate that the risk of pregnancy is around 4% during a typical menstrual cycle if intercourse occurs around ovulation, and around 1% if it does not. However, these figures are based on perfect use of contraceptive methods, and the effectiveness of withdrawal method is much lower, being estimated to be around 78% or less. Factors such as illness or stress can also affect the regularity of menstrual cycles and possibly influence fertility.\n\nIt's important to note that having intercourse during illness or when feeling unwell may increase the risk of sexually transmitted infections, which should be taken seriously. It might also be a good idea to consider using other forms of contraception to reduce the overall risk of pregnancy. However, if you believe you could be pregnant, I recommend taking a pregnancy test as soon as possible to determine for sure. Your healthcare provider can help answer any further questions you may have."}

It is important to speak with your healthcare provider for individualized medical advice.\n\nBoth Myprodol (a combination of codeine and paracetamol) and tramadol are opioid pain medications prescribed for the management of moderate to severe pain. The combination of these two medications might increase the risk of side effects, such as drowsiness, decreased alertness, and potential for addiction.\n\nThere are some potential risks when using Myprodol and tramadol together:\n\n1. Increased risk of side effects: The combined use of these two medications can increase the risk of side effects like dizziness, drowsiness, constipation, and nausea.\n2. Increased risk of addiction: The combination of two opioid medications increases the risk of addiction and dependence.\n3. Interaction with other medications: Myprodol and tramadol may interact with other medications you are taking, leading to various side effects or decreased effectiveness of the medications.\n4. Kidney and liver function: Both Myprodol and tramadol can put pressure on the kidneys and liver, which may increase the risk of adverse side effects when taking these medications in combination.\n5. Age and health conditions: Older adults and people with certain health conditions, like respiratory or cardiovascular issues, may be more susceptible to the side effects of opioid pain medications.\n\nConsidering your medical history (back surgery and chronic back pain), it is essential to discuss the risks and benefits of taking Myprodol and tramadol together with your healthcare provider. They will weigh the potential benefits in managing your chronic back pain against the risks of potential adverse effects and any drug interactions.\n\nIt's essential to follow their recommendations, keep them informed of any side effects or changes in your condition and, if prescribed, take the medications as directed to minimize the risks and optimize the therapeutic benefits."}

This issue can be attributed to several reasons:\n\n1. Prostate irritation: During sexual arousal and ejaculation, the prostate gland muscles may contract, pushing semen out of the body. This process may cause irritation or inflammation of the prostate, which can lead to temporary difficulty in urinating or weak urine flow.\n2. Urinary tract infection (UTI): It is essential to rule out an infection, as UTIs can cause symptoms such as pain or discomfort while urinating. UTIs are typically marked by burning sensation, frequent urination, cloudy or strong-smelling urine, and visible pus in urine.\n3. Scar tissue or injury: If there is scar tissue or injury to the urethra or the surrounding area, urination could be affected. This could potentially be a rare complication from vigorous sexual activity.\n4. Bladder or kidney stones: Difficulty in urinating or experiencing pain during urination could indicate a bladder or kidney stone.\n5. Other medical conditions: Conditions like prostatitis, a non-bacterial inflammation of the prostate, interstitial cystitis, or benign prostatic hyperplasia can also cause difficulty in urinating after sexual activity, among other symptoms.\n\nIt's important that your boyfriend consults his doctor to explore these possibilities and determine the cause of his symptoms. They may suggest a physical examination, blood tests, urinalysis, and imaging tests to identify the underlying condition. While waiting for his doctor's appointment, he should drink plenty of fluids to help flush his urinary tract and stay hydrated. Additionally, he should avoid caffeine and alcohol, which can irritate the bladder."}

Thank you.", "ai": " I'm here to help answer your question to the best of my ability. However, I'm an AI language model and not a doctor, so I can't provide medical advice or diagnose conditions. I can share some general information about emergency contraceptive pills (ECPs) and menstrual cycles that might help alleviate some of your concerns, but I strongly recommend consultating a healthcare professional for accurate information specific to your situation.\n\nIt is common to experience spotting or light bleeding after taking ECPs. ECPs can sometimes cause hormonal changes that result in an early menstrual period or light bleeding. In your case, you took the pill after having sex, and it's been over a week since you took it, so it's possible that your body is shedding the uterine lining in preparation for a new menstrual cycle.\n\nRegarding your next period, it's difficult to give an exact answer without knowing the length and regularity of your menstrual cycles. Generally, a menstrual cycle lasts around 28 days, but it can range from 21 to 35 days for some people. Given your irregular periods, I highly recommend keeping track of your menstrual cycle, if possible, and consulting your healthcare professional if you have any concerns or if you experience heavy or prolonged bleeding.\n\nWhile it might be difficult to concentrate, try to keep in mind that it's normal to experience some bleeding after taking ECPs. If you continue to bleed heavily or for an extended period, or if you have other symptoms such as severe cramps, fever, or abdominal pain, it's essential to consult a healthcare professional for further evaluation.\n\nIn the meantime, try to prioritize self-care activities that can help you relax and focus on other things. You might find it helpful to keep a journal to track your menstrual cycle and your symptoms. Remember, it's important to discuss any concerns you have with your healthcare professional, who can provide you with reliable information and support."}

However, it is important to remember that I cannot diagnose conditions or provide medical advice. If you are experiencing persistent chest pain, shoulder pain, and heartburn, you should speak with a healthcare professional as soon as possible.\n\nThe symptoms you have described could be related to several conditions, some of which may be relatively common and not particularly serious, while others may be more concerning. Here are a few possibilities:\n\n1. Gastroesophageal Reflux Disease (GERD): This is a common condition in which the stomach acid flows back into the esophagus, causing heartburn and sometimes chest pain. In some cases, the pain may also be felt in the shoulder area, a condition known as \"referral pain.\" These symptoms could be related to your heartburn, especially if they are accompanied by other typical heartburn symptoms such as a burning sensation in the chest, bloating, and burping.\n2. Musculoskeletal problems: Shoulder pain can have many causes, including injuries, arthritis, and muscles strains. Chest pain can also be caused by issues with the muscles and bones in the chest area. It is possible that your shoulder pain could be due to a musculoskeletal issue and the referred pain could be contributing to your chest discomfort.\n3. Cardiac issues: While heart attacks usually cause more intense, sharp chest pain, some people may experience more subtle symptoms, including shoulder pain. Other symptoms of a heart attack include shortness of breath, dizziness, and sweating. If you suspect you may be having a heart attack, seek emergency medical help right away.\n4. Other causes: There are many other potential causes of chest pain and shoulder pain, including pulmonary issues (such as pneumonia), gallbladder problems, and anxiety or panic attacks.\n\nIt's important to remember that everyone's experience of pain and discomfort is unique, and these are just a few possibilities. If you are concerned about your symptoms, it's best to speak with a healthcare professional. They can help you determine the underlying cause of your symptoms and develop an appropriate treatment plan.\n\nIn the meantime, there are some things you can do to help alleviate heartburn and shoulder pain:\n\n* Avoid foods that trigger heartburn, such as spicy or greasy foods.\n* Eat smaller, more frequent meals throughout the day instead of large meals.\n* Avoid lying down after eating.\n* Take over-the-counter antacids to help neutralize stomach acid.\n* Practice good posture, especially when sitting for long periods of time.\n* Try gentle stretches and exercises to help relieve shoulder pain.\n\nI hope this information is helpful.

I can understand your concern. Cause of your non healing ulcer is diabetes.  It impairs the vascular supply. Your HbA1c is very high. Which suggest poor control of your diabetes. So you should control your diabetes first.  You can take insulin or oral anti diabetic drugs. Once your sugar is under control your ulcer will heal faster. Consult your doctor and take treatment accordingly. Hope I have answered your question, if you have doubt then I will be happy to answer. Thanks for using health care magic. Wish you a very good health.", "ai": " Based on the information provided, the 49-year-old female with type 2 diabetes for 7 years and a non-healing bilateral great toe ulcer, despite an irregular ulcer size of 1.5 cm x 1.5 cm (right toe) and 3.7 cm x 3.5 cm (left toe), an HbA1c level of 9.0%, and an ankle-brachial index (ABI) of 1.01 (right) and 0.92 (left), has an increased risk for infection and poor wound healing due to her diabetes, high HbA1c level, and potentially impaired blood flow (despite normal doppler results).\n\nThe treatment for the bilateral great toe ulcer should ideally focus on addressing the underlying causes, improving blood sugar control, and promoting wound healing. Here are the potential treatment options:\n\n1. Optimizing blood sugar control: Intensive insulin therapy, in combination with diet, may be considered to reduce the risk of infection and promote wound healing. Regular monitoring of blood sugar levels and adjusting insulin dosages as needed can help improve glycemic control.\n\n2. Debridement: This process involves removing dead, damaged tissue from the wound to promote healing. It can be done through various methods, including using dressings, saline solution, or surgical instruments. Debridement can be performed by a healthcare professional or through the use of specialized wound care dressings that promote autolytic debridement (the body's natural process of removing dead tissue).\n\n3. Antibiotics: Depending on the severity and infected status of the ulcer, antibiotics may be prescribed to prevent or treat infection. The choice of antibiotics will depend on the specific bacteria identified through a culture.\n\n4. Offloading: To prevent further damage to the ulcer, offloading is essential. This can be achieved by using total contact casts, specialized wound care shoes, or custom-molded orthotics. Using these devices can help redistribute weight away from the affected areas, promoting healing.\n\n5. Hyperbaric oxygen therapy (HBOT): In cases of poor blood flow, HBOT may be considered. This therapy involves breathing 100% oxygen in a high-pressure chamber, which enhances the amount of oxygen delivered to the body tissues, promoting tissue repair and wound healing.\n\n6. Surgery: In some cases, surgery may be needed to remove necrotic tissue or correct underlying bone infections. Consult with a podiatric surgeon for further guidance.\n\n7. Regular wound care: It is crucial to establish a regular wound care routine, ensuring the ulcer is clean, dry, and free from debris. Using appropriate wound care dressings can help maintain a clean wound environment and promote granulation tissue growth.\n\nIt is essential to communicate with your healthcare provider to determine the best treatment plan for your specific situation."}

Hope it helps", "ai": " There are several reasons why a couple may have difficulty conceiving, and it's important to remember that it's not always just a woman's issue. Here are some common causes of infertility:\n\n1. Ovulation problems: If you're not ovulating regularly, it can make it difficult to conceive. Ovulation can be affected by various factors, such as thyroid issues, lifestyle factors like stress or excessive exercise, and certain medical conditions like polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS).\n2. Male factor infertility: In about 30-40% of cases, infertility is due to male factors. This can include low sperm count, poor sperm motility, or structural issues with the man's reproductive system.\n3. Age-related factors: Women's fertility declines with age, and by the time a woman is in her late 20s, her fertility starts to decline. Similarly, a man's fertility also declines with age, but to a lesser extent.\n4. Other medical conditions: Certain medical conditions, such as endometriosis, fibroids, pelvic inflammatory disease, and certain STIs, can affect fertility.\n5. Lifestyle factors: Lifestyle factors like smoking, alcohol consumption, excessive caffeine intake, and certain medications can affect fertility.\n\nGiven that you have already undergone tests for hormonal and thyroid issues, it might be worth considering other possibilities. Your doctor may suggest additional tests, such as a semen analysis for your husband, or laparoscopy or hysteroscopy to check for any structural issues. Lifestyle modifications, such as quitting smoking, reducing caffeine intake, and managing stress, may also help improve your chances of conceiving. If you continue to have difficulty conceiving after trying for a year, it's a good idea to consult a fertility specialist for further evaluation and treatment options."}

Regards.", "ai": " Several factors can cause inflamed gums, also known as gingivitis. Here are some common causes:\n\n1. Poor oral hygiene: Gingivitis is often caused by a lack of brushing and flossing, which allows plaque to build up on the gum line and irritate the gums.\n2. Hormonal changes: Hormonal fluctuations, such as those that occur during pregnancy or menopause, can make gums more sensitive and susceptible to inflammation.\n3. Diet: Certain foods, especially sugary or acidic ones, can irritate the gums and contribute to inflammation. Mangos are high in vitamin C but also contain natural acids and may irritate sensitive gums.\n4. Medical conditions: Some medical conditions, such as diabetes, HIV/AIDS, and vitamin C deficiency, can increase the risk of gum inflammation.\n5. Bite problems: Misaligned teeth or a poor bite can put excess pressure on the gums and cause inflammation.\n\nTo ease the discomfort of inflamed gums, you can try the following:\n\n1. Practice good oral hygiene: Brush gently with a soft-bristled toothbrush twice a day and floss daily.\n2. Rinse with warm salt water: Rinsing your mouth with warm salt water can help reduce inflammation and kill bacteria. Mix 1 teaspoon of salt in a cup of warm water and rinse your mouth for 30 seconds before spitting it out.\n3. Use a soft-bristled toothbrush: Brush gently with a soft-bristled toothbrush to avoid further irritating your gums.\n4. Avoid irritating foods: Avoid foods that irritate your gums, such as acidic foods, spicy foods, and sugary snacks.\n5. Use an over-the-counter germicidal mouthwash: An antimicrobial mouthwash can help reduce plaque and bacteria in the mouth.\n\nIf your gum inflammation persists or worsens, you should see a dentist or periodontist for an evaluation. They may recommend professional cleaning, scaling, or other treatments to address the underlying cause of your gum inflammation."}

A small study published in the Journal of the American Academy of Child & Adolescent Psychiatry in 2011 found a correlation between increased tic exacerbation and vaccine administration in children with a history of Tourette's Syndrome. This study did not specifically focus on the flu vaccine.\n\nMore recent studies have found no definitive link between vaccines, including the flu vaccine, and the development or worsening of tic disorders, including Tourette's and PANDAS. For example, a study published in the Journal of the American Medical Association in 2014 found that there was no increased risk of Tourette's Syndrome or chronic tic disorders in children receiving six common vaccines.\n\nHowever, it is essential to note that the situation with PANDAS and its association with vaccines is still evolving, and more research is needed to fully understand the relationship, if any.\n\nIt is important for parents of children with tic disorders to closely monitor their children's symptoms following vaccinations and report any adverse reactions to their healthcare providers. Documenting symptoms and their timing in relation to vaccinations can help healthcare professionals better understand potential associations and guide future research.\n\nIf you have concerns about vaccines and your child's tic disorder, I would recommend discussing this with your child's healthcare provider. They can help answer any specific questions you might have based on your child's medical history and provide guidance on potential precautions or accommodations for vaccination."}

{"question": "What causes swollen armpits with lump underneath?this happens every now and then . i get really swollen armpits underneath . a lump under each one which hurts  to touch and sometimes causes pain under my arms in movement . now i have got a lump just in my right armpit which is the same . what is this ? as it keeps returning sometimes in both and sometimes one", "human": "Thank you for using healthcaremagic. The lump that develops under your armpit is an enlarged lymph node. The lymph node gets enlarged due to various reasons, the most common being, an inflammatory/infective condition. The armpit is also the area where sweat gets collected and there could be obstruction of the sweat glands. Proper hygiene in those areas and a course of antibiotic tablets/ointment should resolve the problem. Do consult your local doctor for the necessary medication.", "ai": " Several conditions can cause swollen armpits with a lump beneath that hurts to touch and may cause pain during movement. Some common causes include:\n\n1. Swollen lymph nodes: The armpit contains several lymph nodes that help fight infections. Swelling and tenderness in the armpit can be a sign of an infection or inflammation, leading to swollen lymph nodes. causes of swollen lymph nodes include viral infections, bacterial infections, and cancer.\n2. Cysts or lipomas: Swollen armpits with a benign lump can be caused by cysts or lipomas, which are non-cancerous growths. Cysts are fluid-filled sacs that can develop anywhere in the body, while lipomas are fatty tissue growths.\n3. Injuries or trauma: Trauma or injury to the armpit area can cause swelling and pain.\n4. Excessive sweating (hyperhidrosis): Sweat glands in the armpit can become inflamed, leading to swelling and pain.\n5. Cancer: Swollen armpits with a lump can be a sign of breast or other types of cancer.

It's important to note that I'm an AI language model and cannot provide medical advice, but I can share some general information that may help.\n\nRegarding your question about taking a bath after using Monistat, it's generally recommended to avoid baths for at least 2 hours after using an antifungal medication such as Monistat. This will help ensure that the medication stays in contact with the infected area. However, if you feel comfortable doing so, you can take a shower instead, as the water from a shower is less likely to rinse away the medication.\n\nIt sounds like you have used Monistat for only one night as of now. If you continue to experience symptoms, you may need to use the medication for a few more nights. Keep in mind that it may take a few days for your symptoms to fully resolve. If your symptoms worsen or do not improve after using Monistat for a few days, you should contact your healthcare provider for further evaluation.\n\nDuring pregnancy, it's important to be extra cautious when treating vaginal infections to ensure that you and your baby stay healthy.

These include practicing good hygiene, avoiding tight-fitting clothing, wearing breathable fabrics, and staying hydrated.

Other treatment options are oral fluconazole, itraconazole and terbinafine  given only after consulting a dermatologist.Thanks.Dr.Harshit Bhachech.MBBS, DDVL.", "ai": " Based on the information provided, it is possible that the rash in your pubic area could be caused by a bacterial infection, such as one caused by Klebsiella Pneumoniae, rather than a fungal infection. Bacterial infections can present with symptoms similar to fungal infections, such as a rash, but they may not respond to antifungal medications. If your sexual partner has tested positive for Klebsiella Pneumoniae in a vaginal culture, it is worth considering this as a potential cause of your rash. You should speak with your healthcare provider about this possibility and discuss the need for further diagnostic testing, such as a culture of the rash or blood work, to determine the exact cause and appropriate treatment.

I can't provide definitive medical advice, but I can give you some information that may help you understand your symptoms.\n\nAbdominal cramps during menstruation, also known as dysmenorrhea, are common and often caused by the contractions of the uterus. These cramps can be mild to severe and are usually located in the lower abdomen, but they can also radiate to the back and thighs.\n\nHowever, if you're experiencing cramps that are mild but persistent throughout your cycle, it's worth considering other possible causes. Some conditions that can cause abdominal pain, similar to menstrual cramps, include gastrointestinal issues like irritable bowel syndrome (IBS), ovarian cysts, endometriosis, or pelvic inflammatory disease (PID).\n\nIf the cramps are accompanied by other symptoms, such as new or excessive vaginal bleeding, pelvic pain that's not related to your menstrual cycle, fever, or abnormal discharge, these could be signs of a more serious condition, and you should contact your healthcare provider right away to rule out any potential health issues.\n\nIn your situation, since you're 35 days into your cycle and the symptoms started a few days ago, it's likely that these symptoms are related to your menstrual cycle. However, if your symptoms persist or worsen, I would recommend contacting your healthcare provider for a proper evaluation.\n\nHere are some tips that may help relieve your menstrual cramps:\n\n* Heat: Applying heat to your abdomen can help soothe the cramps and relieve discomfort. You can use a heating pad, hot water bottle, or even take a warm bath.\n* Over-the-counter pain relievers: Nonprescription medications like acetaminophen, ibuprofen, or naproxen can help reduce the pain and inflammation associated with menstrual cramps.\n* Exercise: Regular physical activity, such as walking, jogging, or yoga, can help reduce the severity of menstrual cramps by increasing blood flow to the uterus and releasing feel-good hormones called endorphins.\n* Diet: Certain foods, like processed and sugary snacks, can make menstrual cramps worse. Instead, try eating a balanced diet that includes plenty of fruits, vegetables, whole grains, lean proteins, and healthy fats.\n* Rest: Getting enough rest and reducing stress can help improve your overall health and alleviate menstrual cramps.\n\nIf you've tried these remedies and your symptoms persist or worsen, I'd recommend speaking with your healthcare provider to determine the cause and appropriate treatment."}

An active is a well kid even if she/ he is not eating well. 2. Development of a kid is as important as or I would say even more important than growth alone.3. As the kids grow their interest in food decreases and interest in play activities increases so that they eat small quantity and run away to play. As parents we need to be more patient and feed than less quantity but more aliquots per day.4. This age rather than the quantity of the food I suggest you concentrate more on the number of times you feed her and also make whatever you feed her calorie dense by adding good amount of ghee to it.5. I suggest you not to use appetite stimulants on long run as they may cause drowsiness.Regards - Dr. Sumanth", "ai": " I'm not a doctor, but I can suggest some general guidelines based on common practices for addressing low appetite in young children. Since your granddaughter has been sick recently, it's important to consider her symptoms carefully before making any drastic dietary changes. Here are some steps you can take:\n\n1. Schedule an appointment with her pediatrician: It's essential to discuss her symptoms and appetite concerns with her healthcare provider. They may be able to rule out any underlying medical conditions or offer recommendations based on her specific situation.\n\n2. Encourage small, frequent meals: Offer your granddaughter small meals more frequently throughout the day rather than three large meals. This can help prevent her stomach from feeling too full and potentially making her nauseous.\n\n3. Offer a variety of nutritious foods: Continue to serve a variety of age-appropriate, nutrient-dense foods. Try serving these foods in small portions, and encourage your granddaughter to take a few bites at a time. Be patient and avoid pushing her to eat more than she's comfortable with.\n\n4. Gradually reintroduce solid foods: If your granddaughter has been on a liquid diet for an extended period, try gradually introducing solid foods back into her diet. Start with bland, easy-to-digest foods, such as cooked carrots, bananas or rice, and gradually introduce more textures and tastes as her appetite and digestive system improve.\n\n5. Limit sugary drinks: While your granddaughter may be craving Gatorade, it's important to limit her intake of sugary drinks as much as possible. Instead, offer her water, clear broths, or diluted fruit juices to help her stay hydrated.\n\n6. Consider probiotics: Since she seems to be having some digestive issues, you may want to consider giving her a probiotic supplement to help promote healthy gut bacteria and improve her digestive health. Consult with her pediatrician before giving her any new supplements or medications.\n\n7. Monitor progress: Keep track of your granddaughter's appetite and any changes to her symptoms. Report any concerning signs to her pediatrician as soon as possible. If her appetite doesn't improve after a few days, they may recommend additional tests or treatments.\n\nIt's important to remember that every child is different, and what works for one may not work for another. Be patient, focus on offering a variety of nutritious foods, and communicate regularly with her pediatrician to ensure she's getting the care she needs."}

There are several possible reasons why the itching persists after finishing the medication.\n\nFirstly, it's essential to understand that not all yeast infections are treated with one course of medication. Some cases may require multiple doses or longer treatment durations. However, in your case, you have taken three doses of Fluconazole 150mg, which is typical for a single treatment course.\n\nThere are several reasons why the itching may persist after finishing the medication:\n\n1. Resistant strain of yeast: Some yeast infections may be caused by strains of Candida that are resistant to Fluconazole. In such cases, the medication may not be entirely effective, and the itching may persist.\n2. Ongoing irritants: If you continue to use products that irritate the vaginal area, such as harsh soaps, douches, or scented sanitary products, the itching may persist even after taking the medication.\n3. Underlying conditions: Certain conditions, such as diabetes, HIV/AIDS, or a weakened immune system, can make individuals more susceptible to yeast infections. If you have an underlying condition, the itching may not go away entirely even after taking the medication.\n4. Allergic reaction: It's also possible that you may have an allergic reaction to the medication, which could cause continued itching.\n\nIf the itching is still present two days after the last dosage of Fluconazole, it would be a good idea to consult with your doctor. They may consider additional diagnostic tests or prescribe a different antifungal medication to ensure effective treatment of the infection. It's important to note that yeast infections can recur, so if you continue to experience symptoms, you should follow up with your healthcare provider to explore potential causes and prevent future infections."}

Breast mass either benign or malignant. So better to consult doctor and get done clinical examination of breast, mammography, sonography of breast to rule out major breast diseases. If all these are normal then no need to worry much. Apply warm water pad on affected areas, you will be alright. Hope I have solved your query. I will be happy to help you further. Wish you good health. Thanks.", "ai": " The appearance of greenish-colored veins under the skin is not a common condition, and it's not typically associated with the blood itself being green. Instead, this phenomenon is more likely due to a harmless condition called chlorosis or greening of the veins, which results from an excess of biliverdin or copper in the blood.\n\nBiliverdin is a bile pigment that is formed from the break down of old red blood cells. Normally, biliverdin is converted to bilirubin, which is then processed and excreted by the liver. However, in some cases, biliverdin may not be completely converted, leading to its accumulation in the body. This can result in the greenish discoloration of the skin and mucous membranes, including the veins.\n\nCertain factors can increase the risk of chlorosis, including liver disease, excessive alcohol consumption, and certain inherited genetic disorders. However, in most cases, the exact cause remains unknown. The condition is usually benign and does not cause any symptoms or health problems.\n\nIf you're concerned about the greenish veins on your chest, it's a good idea to have them evaluated by a healthcare professional to rule out any underlying medical conditions. They may recommend blood tests, liver function tests, or other diagnostic procedures to determine the cause of the discoloration.\n\nIt's also important to note that there are some less common causes of greenish-colored blood, such as some types of anemia and inherited metabolic disorders. These conditions can cause the blood to appear green when it's drawn, rather than the veins under the skin.\n\nOverall, the presence of greenish-colored veins on your chest is generally not a cause for alarm. However, if you have any concerns or if the discoloration is accompanied by other symptoms, such as pain or irregular heartbeat, it's important to talk to your healthcare provider for further evaluation."}

Gently massaging the chest and upper abdomen in a circular motion can help to move the air and provide relief.\n3. Herbal remedies: Some herbs are believed to have carminative properties, which means they can help to expel gas from the digestive system. These include:\n\n* Ginger: Ginger has anti-inflammatory and carminative properties. You can consume ginger in various forms such as tea, raw, or as a supplement.\n* Fennel: Fennel seeds are known to help relieve bloating and gas. You can consume them as a tea or as a supplement.\n* Chamomile: Chamomile has anti-inflammatory properties and can help to soothe the digestive system. You can consume chamomile tea or take it as a supplement.\n4. Essential oils: Essential oils such as peppermint, ginger, and fennel are known to have carminative properties and can help to relieve symptoms of trapped air. You can apply diluted essential oils topically, use them in a diffuser, or add a few drops to your bathwater.\n5. Probiotics: Consuming probiotics can help to improve digestive health and reduce symptoms of bloating and gas. You can find probiotics in fermented foods such as yogurt, kefir, sauerkraut, and kimchi.\n6. Dietary changes: Certain foods can contribute to bloating and gas. Consider avoiding foods that are known to cause gas, such as beans, broccoli, cabbage, and onions, and instead, focus on consuming foods that are easy to digest, such as bananas, apples, and cooked vegetables.\n\nBefore trying any new treatment or herb, it is important to consult with a healthcare professional, especially if you have chronic or severe symptoms. They can help you determine the cause of your symptoms and provide appropriate treatments or refer you to a specialist if needed."}

I cannot diagnose conditions or provide medical advice, so please consult your healthcare provider for personalized information.\n\nThe development of a lump in your ankle after undergoing breast cancer treatment, including a bilateral mastectomy, chemotherapy, and hormonal therapy, is not typically a direct complication of these treatments. Here are some potential explanations for this lump, although it's important to remember that I can't diagnose you based on the information provided:\n\n1. Benign conditions: Several benign (non-cancerous) conditions can cause lumps or swelling around the ankle, including lipomas (benign fatty tumors), benign cysts, or ganglions (synovial cysts). These conditions are common and usually not related to breast cancer or its treatments.\n\n2. Treatment-related side effects or complications: Although rare, treatments for breast cancer can sometimes cause secondary conditions that manifest as lumps or swellings in other parts of the body. For example, lymphedema is a condition where fluid accumulates in the tissues, causing swelling, often in the arms or legs. Although it's not common around the ankle, it's worth discussing with your doctor. Inflammation from veins or arteries, infections, or even nerve damage could also potentially cause a lump or swelling.\n\n3. Unrelated conditions: Sometimes, lumps or swellings are caused by conditions unrelated to breast cancer or its treatment. These could include injuries, infections, or non-cancerous growths.\n\nGiven your history and age, it's essential to have the lump evaluated by a healthcare professional. They can examine the area, and potentially order additional tests to help diagnose the cause and rule out anything serious. It's also important to discuss any concerns or new symptoms with your cancer care team, as they have a comprehensive understanding of your medical history."}

Take care Regards,Dr Ilir Sharka, Cardiologist", "ai": " I'm not a doctor, but I can suggest some general measures that may help make your father more comfortable while he recovers from a L1 compression fracture:\n\n1. Pain management: Continue following the doctor's advice on taking painkillers as prescribed. They can help manage the pain and make daily activities more bearable. If the pain is not adequately controlled with the prescribed medication, consult the doctor for an adjustment.\n\n2. Bed rest: Ensure that your father is getting enough rest. Encourage him to stay in a comfortable position, such as lying on his back with a pillow under his knees to take the pressure off his back. Try using a firm mattress or a specialized orthopedic mattress to support his spine.\n\n3. Proper positioning: Encourage good posture while sitting. You can use a pillow or rolled towel for lower back support. Avoid slouching or hunching.\n\n4. Mobilization: Gentle mobilization and exercises, as recommended by the doctor, can help improve mobility and reduce pain. This may include simple activities such as walking short distances with assistance, leg raises, and stretching.\n\n5. Nutrition: Encourage a healthy diet, focusing on foods rich in nutrients like calcium, vitamin D, and protein. Consult with a dietitian, if necessary, to ensure a balanced and nutritious meal plan.\n\n6.

She is currently on Colicaid.", "human": "Hi. For further information consult a paediatrician online --> https://www.icliniq.com/ask-a-doctor-online/paediatrician", "ai": " I'm an AI language model and not a doctor, but I can try to help you with some general suggestions based on the symptoms you've described. It's important to note that I'm not able to diagnose or prescribe treatment, and I strongly recommend consultating with a healthcare professional for advice specific to your daughter's condition.\n\nThe symptoms your daughter is experiencing - stomach pain and foul-smelling farts - can be signs of various conditions. One common cause could be an intestinal infection, such as gastroenteritis. This can result in diarrhea, stomach cramps, and foul-smelling stools or farts. Another possible cause could be a food intolerance or allergy, or constipation.\n\nIt's good to know that she's been prescribed Colicaid for her symptoms. Colicaid is a medication that contains loperamide, which can help relieve diarrhea and related cramps and pains. It might take some time for the medication to kick in and provide full relief.\n\nThe medication Cyclopam is not commonly used for treating stomach pain and diarrhea in children, so it may not have been effective for your daughter's condition.\n\nHere are a few suggestions that might help, but please consult a healthcare professional before trying them:\n\n1. Encourage your daughter to drink plenty of fluids to help maintain her hydration, as diarrhea and vomiting can lead to dehydration. Clear broths or rice water can be helpful for maintaining electrolyte balance.\n\n2. Offer bland, easily digested foods, such as bananas, rice, applesauce, and toast. These can help replace lost nutrients and reduce gastrointestinal irritation.\n\n3. Consider probiotics, which can help restore the normal bacteria balance in the gut and improve digestion. These can come in the form of food sources like yogurt or kefir, or as supplements.\n\n4. Make sure your daughter is getting enough fiber in her diet, which is crucial for maintaining a healthy digestive system. You can add high-fiber foods, like fruits, vegetables, and whole grains, to her meals.\n\n5. If constipation is a concern, consider adding more fiber, staying hydrated, and encouraging your daughter to take frequent, short walks. Sometimes, deep belly breathing and gentle abdominal massage can help relieve constipation as well.\n\nThese suggestions might help provide relief for your daughter and improve her overall health, but remember, it's essential to consult a healthcare professional for advice on treating specific symptoms. If her condition does not improve, it's important to follow up with her doctor."}

Though they both can be due of our prior experiences and life events and so on...Regards, Dr Arun", "ai": " Recurring dreams, particularly those involving threatening or distressing themes, can be concerning and may indicate underlying emotional issues. However, it's essential to note that the relationship between dreams and mental health conditions like depression and anxiety is complex and not fully understood.\n\nYour dream about being shot and saying goodbye to your family may reflect underlying feelings of fear, helplessness, or loss. These emotions are common in people experiencing depression and anxiety, especially during times of stress or adversity. The intensity and vividness of the dream may make it feel real, leading to strong emotional reactions upon waking.\n\nSeveral factors can contribute to the development of such dreams, including:\n\n1. Stress or anxiety: Daily stressors, traumatic experiences, or significant life changes can lead to intense dreams. This is because the brain processes and integrates emotions during sleep, and unresolved emotional issues can manifest in dreams.\n\n2. Mental health conditions: Depression, anxiety, and other mental health conditions can increase the likelihood of having distressing dreams. These conditions can impact sleep quality and disturb the normal sleep cycle, leading to vivid and disturbing dreams.\n\n3. Physical health: Certain medical conditions, such as sleep apnea, restless leg syndrome, or gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD), can disrupt sleep and contribute to disturbing dreams.\n\nIf your dreams are causing significant distress and impacting your daily life, it may be helpful to speak with a mental health professional. They can help you explore the underlying causes of your dreams and develop coping strategies to manage any underlying emotional issues. Additionally, addressing any underlying medical conditions may improve the quality of your sleep and reduce the frequency of distressing dreams."}

However, it's important to consider the potential underlying causes and rule out any severe conditions.\n\nSome of the most common reasons for chest pain after drinking alcohol include:\n\n1. Gastroesophageal Reflux Disease (GERD): Alcohol consumption can relax the lower esophageal sphincter, leading to stomach acid reflux. This can cause a burning sensation in the chest, often referred to as heartburn, which can feel like chest pain.\n2. Angina: Alcohol can temporarily reduce blood flow to the heart by causing the blood vessels to constrict. In some people with underlying coronary artery disease, this can cause angina, which is chest pain due to reduced blood flow to the heart. However, if you have angina, it's likely that you'll have other symptoms, such as shortness of breath or tightness in the jaw or arms along with the chest pain.\n3. Arrhythmias: Alcohol can disrupt normal heart rhythms, and in some cases, it can trigger arrhythmias or heart palpitations, which can cause a sensation of chest pain. In most cases, these arrhythmias are harmless, but they can be uncomfortable.\n4. Dehydration: Alcohol is a diuretic, which means it makes you urinate more frequently. This can lead to dehydration, which can cause a variety of symptoms, including chest pain. Dehydration can cause your heart to beat faster, making it work harder, and this can cause chest pain or discomfort.\n5. Panic Attacks: Alcohol can affect the nervous system and cause anxiety, which can trigger panic attacks. Panic attacks can cause a range of symptoms, including chest pain or discomfort.\n\nIt's important to note that chest pain is a serious symptom and should not be ignored. If you're experiencing persistent chest pain, especially if it's severe, frequent, or accompanied by other symptoms, such as shortness of breath, sweating, or dizziness, you should see a healthcare professional for further evaluation. They may perform additional tests to rule out any serious underlying conditions.\n\nIn the meantime, you can try some steps to alleviate your discomfort after drinking alcohol, such as:\n\n* Eating a light meal before drinking\n* Sipping water or other non-alcoholic beverages between alcoholic drinks\n* Avoiding greasy or spicy foods before or after drinking\n* Quitting smoking\n\nThese steps may help reduce the likelihood of experiencing chest pain after drinking alcohol. However, if you continue to experience chest pain that's concerning to you, it's important to seek medical advice."}

I would advise you to see a Surgeon for clinical check up to see exact problem and further management.", "ai": " Frequent swelling of the scrotum, also known as scrotal edema, can have various causes. Some common causes include:\n\n1. Fluid buildup: This could be due to a condition called hydrocele, which is a collection of fluid in the sac around the testicle. Another type of fluid buildup is called a spermatocele, which is a benign cyst filled with sperm.\n2. Infection: Swelling could be caused by an infection, such as epididymitis or orchitis. These infections can cause pain and inflammation in addition to swelling.\n3. Testicular tumor: Swelling that does not go away and is not accompanied by pain could be a sign of a testicular tumor.\n4. Varicocele: This is a swelling of the veins in the scrotum, which can cause a feeling of heaviness or fullness in the scrotum. This condition is more common on the left side of the scrotum.\n5. Allergic reactions: Allergic reactions to medications or environmental allergens can cause swelling of the scrotum.\n6. Trauma: Injury to the testicles or scrotum can cause swelling.\n\nGiven that there is no pain involved and you have not had sex or masturbated in over a week, it is less likely to be caused by an infection or sexual activity. However, it would be a good idea to get examined by a healthcare professional, especially if this is a recurring condition. They can help determine the cause and recommend appropriate treatment. This is especially important because some underlying causes, such as testicular tumors, require prompt evaluation and treatment."}

However, it's important to note that I cannot provide a definitive diagnosis or medical advice. It's always best to consult with a healthcare professional for an accurate assessment and treatment plan.\n\nThe productive cough with red streaks in the sputum could be a sign of bleeding in the respiratory tract. There are several conditions that could cause this:\n\n1. Bronchitis: An inflammation of the bronchial tubes, which can cause a productive cough with clear or colored sputum. In some cases, bronchitis may be severe enough to cause minor bleeding.\n2. Pneumonia: An infection in one or both lungs that can cause a productive cough with colored sputum, sometimes tinged with blood.\n3. Allergies: Allergies to certain substances, such as pollen, pet dander, or cigarette smoke, can cause a productive cough with clear sputum and, in some cases, minor bleeding.\n4. Cancers: Lung cancer and other respiratory tract cancers can cause a productive cough with blood-tinged sputum.\n5. Other conditions: Other conditions, such as tuberculosis, COPD, and pulmonary embolism, can cause a productive cough with blood-tinged sputum.\n\nDizziness can be caused by a variety of factors, including dehydration, low blood sugar, infections, and cardiac issues. It's possible that the dizziness could be related to the respiratory symptoms or an underlying condition causing them.\n\nAs for when the coughing should go away, it's hard to say without knowing more about the underlying cause. In general, acute bronchitis may last for a few weeks, while chronic bronchitis and other underlying respiratory conditions may last much longer. If you're concerned about your symptoms or they don't improve within a few days, it's a good idea to see a healthcare professional for an evaluation."}

Infection can cause ED. Get a check up with urologist to rule out any infection. Hope I have answered your query. Let me know if I can assist you further. Regards,Dr. B. Radhakrishnan Nair,OBGYN", "ai": " Varicocele and erectile dysfunction (ED) are two distinct conditions that may be related in some cases. A varicocele is an enlargement of the veins in the scrotum, typically on the left side. ED, on the other hand, is the inability to achieve or maintain an erection sufficient for sexual intercourse.\n\nVaricocele is usually treated based on its severity and symptoms. In some cases, no treatment may be needed if there are no symptoms or if symptoms are mild. However, if the varicocele causes pain or other symptoms, such as ED, treatment may be recommended. The most common treatment for varicocele is a surgical procedure called a varicocelectomy, which involves shrinking or tying off the affected veins to improve blood flow and reduce pressure in the scrotum. Other options include nonsurgical treatments like wearing supportive underwear or taking medications to help reduce the size of the veins.\n\nAs for ED, there are several potential causes, and treatment depends on the underlying cause. Varicocele itself is not a direct cause of ED, but there is some evidence to suggest that it may contribute to ED in some cases by affecting blood flow to the penis. Other possible causes of ED include conditions like diabetes, high blood pressure, and atherosclerosis, as well as lifestyle factors like smoking and alcohol use.\n\nTo determine the cause of ED, it's important to see a healthcare provider for a thorough evaluation. Treatment options for ED include medications like sildenafil (Viagra), tadalafil (Cialis), and vardenafil (Levitra), which help improve blood flow to the penis. Other options include lifestyle changes like quitting smoking, losing weight, and getting regular exercise. In some cases, more invasive treatments like vacuum constriction devices, penile injections, or even surgery may be necessary.\n\nIn your case, since you have been experiencing pain and ED, it would be a good idea to see a healthcare provider for a thorough evaluation. They may recommend imaging tests, such as an ultrasound, to determine if there is a varicocele present and assess its severity. They may also order blood tests and other diagnostic tests to identify any underlying medical conditions that could be contributing to your ED. Based on the results of these tests, they may recommend various treatments for your symptoms."}

However, I cannot provide specific medical advice or treatment recommendations.\n\nThe terms \"bilateral bronchitis\" and \"perihilar congestion\" are common findings on a chest X-ray.\n\nBilateral bronchitis refers to an inflammation or infection of the bronchioles, which are the smaller airways that branch off from the trachea (windpipe) and lead to the lungs. It can be present in both lungs (bilateral) and causes symptoms such as cough, wheezing, and shortness of breath.\n\nPerihilar congestion, on the other hand, refers to increased fluid around the hila (the central part) of the lungs. It may be a sign of congestion or inflammation in the lung tissue.\n\nThe specific treatment for such findings depends on the severity of the symptoms and the underlying cause. Generally, symptomatic treatment might include:\n\n1. Expectorants and bronchodilators to help loosen and eliminate mucus in the bronchial tubes, easing breathing.\n2. Chest physiotherapy to help clear mucus from the lungs.\n3. Antibiotics in cases of bacterial infection.\n4. In some cases, nebulized medications may be administered.\n5. For severe or persistent cases, hospitalization and oxygen therapy may be necessary.\n6.

Hypothyroidism, which is underactive thyroid gland, can affect fertility and pregnancy. However, with proper management, many women with hypothyroidism can get pregnant. Here are some suggestions based on your case:\n\n1. Consult your doctor: It's essential to discuss your pregnancy plans with your doctor and ensure that your hypothyroidism is under control. They may need to adjust your thyroid hormone replacement dosage to optimize your thyroid function.\n2. Maintain a healthy lifestyle: Eat a well-balanced diet, get enough rest, and manage stress to improve your overall health and enhance your chances of conceiving.\n3. Regular follow-ups: Keep regular appointments with your doctor to monitor your thyroid function closely. An optimal TSH level (0.5 to 2.5 mIU/L) is recommended for pregnancy. Your doctor may need to adjust your dosage accordingly.\n4. Consider taking prenatal vitamins: It's a good idea to take a prenatal vitamin containing folic acid (0.4 to 0.8 mg/day) to reduce the risk of birth defects, especially since your thyroid condition increases this risk.\n5. Close monitoring during pregnancy: Your doctor may want to monitor your thyroid function more closely during pregnancy since your thyroid requirements may change.\n\nKeep in mind that everyone's body reacts differently to treatments, and success stories may vary. It's essential to discuss your personal situation with your healthcare provider for the best advice regarding your unique circumstances."}
{"question": "Suggest treatment for headache and sinus infectionI have recently been having headaches, around temples and sinus area which is very unusual for me. Also my eyes have been extremely dry and itchy. I noticed when trying to blow my nose there is a rattling . Like a piece between my nostrils is vibrating. My right nostril almost gets closed off when I blow. I couldn t breathe through my nose last night while sleeping. My right sinus area also seems heavy with congestion. My first thought was a deviated septum. Thoughts?", "human": "Hello ! I read your question and understand your concern. In my opinion your troubles are not caused by a neurological problem. The troubles you are having seem to come from your sinus . I would like to know if you are allergic. I would recommend a sinus x ray for sinusitis and a nasal inspection with nasal speculum from a ORL specialist to rule out a possible obstruction of the nasal nostril. The most probable diagnosis may be a nasal polip or a septal deviation. Although septal deviations give recurrent sinusitis and are from birth . So a nasal septum deviation could give problems since childhood.  Hope to have been helpful!Thank you for using HCM !Best wishes, Dr. Abaz", "ai": " Based on the symptoms you've described, it's possible that you're experiencing a sinus infection, also known as sinusitis. This condition can cause headaches, pressure in the face, nasal congestion, and sinus drainage. The symptoms you've described in your eyes, such as dryness, itchiness, and difficulty blowing your nose, may be related to the sinus infection as well.\n\nTo treat a sinus infection, there are several options you can try:\n\n1. Hydration: Staying hydrated can help thin out mucus and make it easier to drain from your sinuses. Drink plenty of fluids, including water, herbal tea, and clear broth.\n2. Saline nasal spray: Using a saline nasal spray can help relieve nasal congestion and sinus pressure. It's available over the counter at most pharmacies.\n3. Over-the-counter pain relievers: Over-the-counter pain relievers such as acetaminophen or ibuprofen can help relieve headaches and sinus pressure.\n4. Nasal decongestants: Decongestants, such as those found in Sudafed or Afrin, can help relieve nasal congestion. However, they should only be used for a few days at a time, as prolonged use can make congestion worse.\n5. Prescription medications: If your sinus infection is severe or persistent, your doctor may prescribe antibiotics or other medications to help relieve your symptoms.\n6. Home remedies: Warm compresses, humidifiers, and essential oils can help relieve sinus pressure and congestion.\n\nIt's also possible that you have a deviated septum, but that doesn't necessarily explain all of your symptoms. If your symptoms persist or worsen, it's important to speak with a healthcare professional. They can evaluate your symptoms and recommend the best course of treatment for you."}

Here are some suggestions that may help you:\n\n1. Use a gentle cleanser: Make sure you're using a gentle cleanser that doesn't irritate your skin. Harsh cleansers can strip the skin of its natural oils, leading to more acne and inflammation.\n2. Exfoliate regularly: Exfoliating helps remove dead skin cells, unclog pores, and even out skin tone. Use a gentle exfoliator once or twice a week, either in the form of a physical scrub or a chemical exfoliant like salicylic acid or glycolic acid.\n3. Keep your face hydrated: Dehydrated skin can make acne and scarring more visible. Drink plenty of water and use a moisturizer that suits your skin type.\n4. Use a scar reducing treatment: There are various over-the-counter scar reducing treatments that contain ingredients like retinoids, vitamin C, and niacinamide, which have been shown to help improve the appearance of scars.\n5. Consider professional treatments: If your marks are still bothering you despite trying home remedies, you may want to consider professional treatments such as microdermabrasion, chemical peels, or laser therapy. These treatments can be more effective in reducing the appearance of scars, but they can also be more expensive and may require multiple sessions.\n\nRemember, it's important to be patient and consistent with your skincare routine, as it can take time for scars to fade completely. If you have any concerns about your skin, it's always a good idea to consult with a dermatologist for personalized advice."}

Regards,Dr. Sumanth Amperayani, Pediatrician, Pulmonology", "ai": " Based on the description you provided, it's important to rule out potential serious conditions that could cause pain in the ribcage area, such as a fractured rib, inflammatory conditions like pneumonia or pleurisy, or abdominal issues like appendicitis or gallstones. This pain, especially when worsened by deep breathing, coughing, yawning, giggling, and touching, could be a sign of pleurisy.\n\nPleurisy is inflammation of the lining of the lungs and the inner surface of the ribcage, causing pain and stiffness upon breathing or coughing. It can result from various causes, such as viral infections, bacterial infections, or trauma. In most cases, pleurisy will improve with rest, hydration, and pain management.\n\nTo help and comfort your 13-year-old, here are some general suggestions:\n\n1. Encourage rest: Help your daughter rest as much as possible. Lying on her side that's not causing pain may be more comfortable. Avoiding any physical activities that strain the abdomen or increase pain should be a priority.\n\n2. Hydration: Ensure your daughter drinks plenty of fluids to stay hydrated. You can offer water, juice, or warm decaffeinated drinks.\n\n3. Pain management: Over-the-counter pain relievers like acetaminophen or ibuprofen may be helpful for managing her discomfort. Be sure to check the recommended dosages based on her age and consult a healthcare professional for guidance.\n\n4. Deep breathing exercises: Encourage your daughter to practice deep breathing exercises, as they can help to reduce pain and improve lung function.\n\n5. Comfort measures: You can help make her more comfortable by using heating pads or hot water bottles applied to the affected area (ensure they are set on a low temperature to avoid burns) and providing plenty of blankets to keep her warm.\n\n6.

Regards,Dr. Penchila Prasad Kandikattu, Internal Medicine Specialist", "ai": " Cervical spondylosis is a condition where the vertebrae in the neck (cervical spine) become degenerated, leading to various symptoms such as neck pain, stiffness, and radiating pain to the arms and hands. The severity of cervical spondylosis can vary from person to person.\n\nRegarding your question, the decision to resume walking or riding a two-wheeler (scooter or motorbike) after a diagnosis of cervical spondylosis should be made in consultation with your healthcare provider. Your doctor can evaluate the specifics of your condition and provide you with personalized recommendations. Generally, low-impact activities like walking are considered safe for individuals with cervical spondylosis, but it is essential to avoid activities that exacerbate symptoms or cause pain.\n\nAs for how many kilometers you can walk, it ultimately depends on your current symptoms and tolerance level. If you are experiencing significant neck pain, stiffness, or arm pain during walking, it may be best to limit your distance initially and gradually build up as your condition improves.\n\nThe severity of cervical spondylosis can vary, and some people may require only symptomatic treatment, while others may require more invasive solutions like surgery. In general, cervical spondylosis is a common age-related condition, and many people manage their symptoms with simple lifestyle modifications and prescription medications. However, in certain cases, the condition can lead to more disabling symptoms that affect one's ability to perform daily activities, including driving a two-wheeler.\n\nIt is essential to listen to your body and follow your healthcare provider's recommendations. If you are experiencing persistent pain, numbness, or weakness, it is important to seek medical attention and discuss your concerns with your doctor. They can help you manage your symptoms effectively and ensure that you are taking the necessary precautions to minimize your risk of further injury."}

The reasons for performing a lumbar puncture can vary, but in the case of your father, the neurologist may be considering this procedure for several reasons:\n\n1. Diagnostic purposes: The neurologist may be investigating the cause of your father's gait problems and stroke. CSF analysis can help diagnose various conditions, such as infections (meningitis or encephalitis), inflammatory diseases (multiple sclerosis or Guillain-Barre syndrome), or certain cancers that can affect the brain and spinal cord.\n2. Monitoring disease progression: In your father's case, with a history of having seizures and being on long-term sodium valproate therapy, the neurologist might want to check for side effects or adverse reactions to the medication, such as increased pressure in the brain (intracranial hypertension) or other complications.\n3. Treatment for specific conditions: In certain conditions like meningitis or some types of cancers that affect the central nervous system, a lumbar puncture may be required for administering medications directly into the cerebrospinal fluid or for collecting samples for further analysis.\n\nAlways make sure to discuss all the potential risks, benefits, and alternatives with your father's neurologist before undergoing a lumbar puncture."}
{"question": "Do i have PTB if my chest x-ray shows minimal PTB?I had 6 months treatment for my ptb and the last result of my sputum test is already negative, yesterday i  went to the hospital for xray as requested by my employer and the result is still the same ptb minimal.  Do i still have ptb and is it again contagious after 6 months of treatment", "human": "Thanks for your question on Health Care Magic. I can understand your concern. At present, you are mostly having old, healed, fibrotic lesion on chest x ray. After six months of treatment, active tb lesions on chest x ray heal. Healing takes place mostly in the form of fibrosis, calcification or both (fibro calcification). Complete resolution is rare in tuberculosis. So these healed areas appear as scar lesion on chest x ray. They will be seen as it is for lifetime. So presence of this fibrotic lesion is not suggestive of tuberculosis. Your sputum report is also negative. So you are mostly having healed lesion and not having active tb lesion. But if you really want to rule out active tuberculosis then get done CT thorax and bronchoscopy with BAL (bronchoalveolar lavage) analysis. If both these are negative for TB then you are not having active tuberculosis fir sure.Hope I have solved your query. I will be happy to help you further. Wish you good health. Thanks.", "ai": " Based on the information provided, it appears that you have had prior tuberculosis (PTB) as indicated by your previous sputum test results. Your chest x-ray showing minimal PTB also supports this diagnosis. However, the term \"minimal PTB\" can have different meanings in different contexts and it is important to discuss the results with your healthcare provider for a better understanding.\n\nRegarding your question about contagion, PTB is typically considered contagious when the bacteria are present in the respiratory tract and can be spread through the air when an infected person coughs, speaks, or sneezes. After completing a successful course of treatment, the risk of contagion is considered low. According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), most people with latent TB infection do not spread the bacteria that cause TB to others. Therefore, it is unlikely that you would still be contagious after completing 6 months of treatment for PTB and having negative sputum test results.\n\nIt is always a good idea to follow the advice of your healthcare provider and return for regular check-ups as recommended to ensure that your treatment was effective and that there are no lingering issues or signs of recurrence. If you have any concerns about your health or the risk of transmitting TB to others, you should discuss these with your healthcare provider."}

This can result in heartburn or symptoms of GERD, such as chest pain or pressure.\n3. Pleurisy: Pleurisy is an inflammation of the lining surrounding the lungs. It can cause sharp, stabbing pain when you take deep breaths or laugh.\n4. Pulmonary embolism: A pulmonary embolism is a blood clot that blocks an artery in the lung. This can cause chest pain or pressure, especially when you breathe deeply or cough. However, this is a more serious condition and would be accompanied by other symptoms such as shortness of breath, rapid heartbeat, and sweating.\n5. Panic attack: In some cases, laughter can trigger a panic attack, which can cause chest pain or pressure, along with other symptoms such as shortness of breath, rapid heartbeat, and sweating.\n6.

{"question": "Is ovex safe for thread worm in stomach?My 4 year old son woke on Thursday night with terrible itching in his bottom.

Actually recurrence is common in thread worm infestation ,so the dose is repeated after 15 days gap twice-to have complete cure.     Thanks.", "ai": " Ovex is not intended for the treatment of threadworms in the stomach. Threadworms primarily infect the intestines and anus. Over-the-counter treatments like Ovex are usually given to kill the adult worms residing in the intestines.\n\nHowever, if your son's symptoms persist and you suspect a threadworm infection, it's best to consult a healthcare professional. They may prescribe a different anti-parasitic medication that is more effective for stomach infections and can eliminate both the adult and larval stages of threadworms.\n\nUsually, Ovex takes effect within a few days after ingestion. The symptoms may not improve immediately due to the fact that some eggs may already be deposited outside the body, and it takes time for newly hatched larvae to cause symptoms again. If no improvement is observed after a week of medication, it's important to consult with a doctor as there could be other causes for the symptoms, or the treatment may not have been effective.\n\nGiving your child another dose of Ovex without consulting a healthcare professional might not be beneficial, and could also lead to potential side effects. It's always better to consult a medical professional for proper diagnosis and treatment."}

I understand your concern regarding getting the depression back once you stop Ashwagandha. I would advise you to continue taking Ashwagandha till you feel a good amount of improvement in your depression. Also, start doing meditation, and some yoga poses for getting rid of depression problems. Then gradually reduce the dose of Ashwagandha so that your body gets used to the reduced doses of Ashwagandha. Do not stop using it immediately. Make sure you do it gradually. This will help to maintain your health, and most likely, you will not get back with the previous symptoms. I hope I have answered your questions.", "ai": " I'm an artificial intelligence and not a doctor, but I can try to provide you with some general information based on available research. Ashwagandha, also known as Withania somnifera, is an adaptogenic herb that has been traditionally used in Ayurvedic medicine for managing stress, anxiety, and depression. According to various studies, Ashwagandha may help in reducing symptoms of anxiety and depression by regulating the levels of certain neurotransmitters in the brain like serotonin and cortisol.\n\nHowever, it's essential to note that the effectiveness and durability of Ashwagandha's benefits can vary from person to person. In clinical trials, significant improvements in symptom severity were observed in individuals who used Ashwagandha as compared to placebo groups. Yet, these improvements were not always long-lasting even after discontinuing the supplement. Some studies suggest that the benefits of Ashwagandha may persist for several weeks, but more research is needed to fully understand the extent and duration of its effects.\n\nAshwagandha is generally considered safe when used at appropriate doses for short periods of time. However, it's not without potential side effects, such as gastrointestinal upset, insomnia, and increased thyroid function in some cases.

{"question": "Constant pain for thornwald't cystI have a Thornwalt cyst 7m and I have had it since 2004. I am in constant pain, my spine is very sensitive and my neck also. I have not been able to work at all. They have not found anything wrong with my back?? Could this be cause by the Cyst??", "human": "hi, welcome to hcm  thanks for the query  there may be pain due to the cyst   but you have to rule out also other causes of spine pain  it needs full examination by a doctor  there is also need of some investigations like er,crp,hla b27, cbc ,xray ,mri etc  so its better to consult your nearest physician   take care", "ai": " I'm not a doctor, but I can provide you some information that might help you understand the potential relationship between a Thornwaldt cyst and spine or neck pain. A Thornwaldt cyst is a congenital condition where a midline cervical meningocele or myelocele persists, causing a cervical mass. This condition is typically asymptomatic or may cause slight neck discomfort. however, in rare cases, it can lead to more significant issues related to the cervical spine.\n\nThe pain you are experiencing in your spine and neck could be a result of several factors, including:\n\n1. Mechanical compression of nerves or the spinal cord.\n   Thornwaldt cysts can enlarge or compress the spinal cord, leading to pain, numbness, or weakness.\n\n2. Instability or misalignment of the cervical spine.\n   The cyst itself can cause instability within the cervical spine, which can lead to pain and inflammation.\n\n3. Inflammation or irritation of the surrounding tissues.\n   As the cyst puts pressure on the related structures, there is a potential for inflammation or irritation, causing pain and sensitivity.\n\n4. Muscle strain or spasm.\n   The continuous pain and discomfort may lead to muscle tensions, strains, or spasms in the neck and back.\n\nIt's essential to consult a healthcare professional for an accurate diagnosis and proper treatment. They may recommend imaging tests, such as an MRI or CT scan, to assess the cyst's size, location, and potential compression on the surrounding structures. Based on the results, appropriate treatment options, including surgery, can be considered. In the meantime, physical therapy, medication, or chiropractic care may help alleviate some of the pain and discomfort."}

As you are describing it as night pain it looks like the infection in your tooth has reached pulp and now requires root canal treatment.

Tooth decay: Tooth decay can cause pain, especially when you bite down or when the temperature changes. The pain may worsen at night due to increased saliva production, which can make your teeth more sensitive.\n2. Infection: An infection in the tooth or gums can cause severe pain, especially at night when you are lying down and the pressure is off your feet.\n3. Bruxism: Grinding or clenching your teeth, also known as bruxism, can cause toothaches, especially at night when you are not aware of the habit and may grind your teeth more frequently.\n4. Cracked tooth: A cracked tooth can cause pain that worsens at night, as the pressure on the tooth increases when you lie down.\n5. Sinusitis: Sometimes, toothaches can be caused by sinusitis, which is an infection or inflammation of the sinuses located near the teeth.\n\nIf you are experiencing severe toothache at night, it's important to consult a dentist for an accurate diagnosis and appropriate treatment. In the meantime, you can try some home remedies, such as rinsing your mouth with warm water or taking over-the-counter pain relievers, but remember that these are temporary solutions and do not address the underlying cause of the toothache."}

{"question": "Suggest me some claritin and cold flu medicinei started taking claritin 24 hr yesterday at noon, about 1 in the morning i woke up hackin up yellow junk but my temp is stayin around 97.0 even though my chest feels like its on fire. Can i still take my claritin with flu meds?", "human": "hi rick,  welcome to hcmthanks for the query  if your flu medications contain any antihistaminics then you can avoid claritin take care.wish you a good day", "ai": " I'm an AI language model and not a doctor, but I can provide you some general information on this topic. Claritin (loratadine) is an antihistamine, often used to relieve symptoms of allergies, such as sneezing, itching, and runny nose. It does not directly treat cold or flu symptoms like coughing up yellow phlegm, fever, or chest discomfort, which are normally caused by viral infections. These symptoms may indicate the onset of a cold or flu, or they could be side effects of your Claritin.\n\nRegarding your question, you can generally take both Claritin and cold or flu medicines. Many cold and flu medicines contain multiple ingredients for symptom relief, such as decongestants, antitussives (for cough), analgesics (for pain), and antipyretics (for fever). Since Claritin treats only allergy symptoms, taking it along with cold or flu medicines can help manage both allergy and infection symptoms.\n\nHowever, it's essential to read the labels of all medications carefully and follow the recommended dosages. Some medications may have similar active ingredients, causing potential risks when taken together. Therefore, it is recommended to consult your doctor, pharmacist, or healthcare professional before taking multiple medications to ensure safety and effectiveness.\n\nIt is also important to note that if your symptoms worsen or persist, you should contact your doctor for further evaluation. Coughing up yellow phlegm along with chest discomfort, even without a fever, could be a sign of a more severe infection and may require medical attention.\n\nIn summary, taking Claritin and cold/flu medicines together may be safe (consult instructions and healthcare professionals), but the effectiveness and safety depend on the specific medications and your overall health condition. Always consult a healthcare professional for personalized advice before taking multiple medications.\n\nStay healthy!"}
{"question": "What causes tender lump under chin?I have a lump under my chin (base of tongue), too high for thyroid and too medial for lymph glands that I am familiar with. It comes and goes but when it is large (size of walnut) it is sore to the touch and hurts if I yawn. I was recently exposed to strong chemicals and also wonder if it could be from an abscessed tooth although I am not aware of any dental problems.", "human": "Hi,It is nothing but enlarged lymph node giving this problem.Any infection in the oral cavity like decayed or carious teeth, tarter ed teeth or ulcer in the mouth can give this problem.Consult dentist and get examined.Keep oral hygiene proper.Ok and take care.", "ai": " I'm an AI language model and not a medical professional, but I can try to help you understand some possible causes for a tender lump under the chin based on the information you've provided. However, this list is not exhaustive, and it's crucial to consult with a healthcare professional for an accurate diagnosis.\n\n1. Reactive lymph nodes: Lymph nodes are an essential part of the immune system and can become swollen or tender when your body is fighting an infection. Although you mentioned that the lump is too medial for the typical cervical lymph nodes, it's still important to consider the possibility of reacting to an infection, even if it's not apparent to you. Infections can originate from various sources, such as the gums, and may not present with obvious symptoms.\n\n2. Chemical exposure: Exposure to strong chemicals can cause various health issues, including inflammation, irritation, and edema, which could contribute to the development of a tender lump under the chin. If this is a possibility, it would be essential to determine which chemicals you've been exposed to and assess the risk they pose to your health.\n\n3. Trauma or injury: Injuries or trauma to the soft tissues under the chin can result in a tender lump or swelling. This might not always be noticeable initially, but symptoms could develop later on, especially when the area is tense or stressed (e.g., during yawning).\n\n4. Tumors or cysts: Although less common, tumors or cysts can develop in various locations in the body, including under the chin. While most are benign, some can be cancerous and require prompt medical attention.\n\n5. Abscessed tooth or infection: Even though you mentioned not being aware of any dental problems, it's important to rule out an infection originating from the teeth. A dental consultation with an x-ray and professional examination would be necessary to determine if this is the cause. The symptoms you're experiencing could potentially be related to an infection affecting the base of the tongue or lymph nodes near the affected tooth.\n\nAlthough you've shared some information about potential causes, there are many other factors that could contribute to a tender lump under the chin. A definitive diagnosis would be best determined by consulting a healthcare professional, ideally an Ear, Nose, and Throat (ENT) specialist or a medical doctor, for a proper evaluation."}

You can definitely conceive again if ovulation can be achieved and tubes are patent. A mature follicle measures about 18 mm. just before ovulation and sizes more than that may indicate cysts. Considering your age, I would advise you to see an expert in infertility and get further advice. Take care.", "ai": " I'm an artificial intelligence language model and not a doctor, but I can try to help you understand the information you've provided and point you in the right direction. However, I cannot give you a definitive answer about your ability to conceive again.\n\nPCOD (Polycystic Ovary Syndrome) is a hormonal disorder that can affect a woman's menstrual cycle, ovulation, and metabolism. Miscarriage is the loss of a pregnancy before the 20th week. Both PCOD and miscarriage can impact a woman's ability to conceive.\n\nYour follicular test results indicating MSF (Multifollicular Simultaneous Follicular Development) on day 12 and 15 suggest that multiple follicles may be developing in both ovaries. This is a good sign and can potentially increase your chances of ovulating and conceiving.\n\nHowever, it is important to know that miscarriage and PCOD can have underlying causes that may need to be addressed before trying to conceive again. These causes can include various factors such as chromosomal abnormalities, lifestyle factors, and medical conditions. A consultation with a healthcare professional, preferably a reproductive endocrinologist or a fertility specialist, is recommended to discuss your concerns and undergo thorough evaluation to address any potential underlying causes.\n\nIn conclusion, while your follicular test results are promising, you should consult a healthcare professional for personalized medical advice and to develop a safe and effective plan for trying to conceive again."}

I see than you haven't mentioned the date of your last menstrual period. Ideally, if you have had a regular 28days cycles, the urine pregnancy test is usually positive by the time you skip your periods. Delayed ovulation can be common in PCOS, So, I would suggest you to recheck your home pregancy test with an early morning urine sample tomorrow, and exactly at the time interval at which the result has to be read as mentioned on the kit. Sometimes if seen very late , the evaporation line also may seem as faintly positive which is actually a false positive. Early morning urine sample is supposed to be having concentrated levels of the Beta HCG hormone which is detected on the pregnancy kit. So recheck again tomorrow with a morning sample of urine. If you donot have any pain or spotting, you can visit your Gynaecologist at ease, may be in a week, and get an ultrasound done for pregnancy viability and localisation. Meanwhile continue taking folic acid & Eltroxin Medications & recheck your thyroid levels as during the pregnancy the dose may have to be changed due to increased requirements in pregnancy.

A faint positive result on a pregnancy test can be inconclusive and it's not uncommon for women, especially those with medical conditions like thyroid and PCOS, to experience irregular periods. However, given your history of thyroid and PCOS, and the fact that your period is delayed, it would be a good idea to consult your healthcare provider for a definitive diagnosis and to discuss any potential precautions or adjustments to your medication during pregnancy.\n\nIt's important to remember that every woman's pregnancy is unique, and individual situations may require different approaches. Your healthcare provider can help you assess your specific situation and provide guidance based on your medical history and current condition. Some doctors may recommend repeating the pregnancy test in a week if the result is inconclusive, but others may prefer to schedule an appointment for an examination and blood tests to confirm pregnancy and assess the hormonal environment.\n\nIn the meantime, ensure that you are taking good care of yourself by eating a balanced diet, staying hydrated, and continuing your medication as prescribed. If you experience any unusual symptoms, such as heavy bleeding, severe cramping, or unusual vaginal discharge, contact your healthcare provider right away. Remember, communication is key, so don't hesitate to share any questions or concerns you may have with your healthcare provider."}

If it does not, then consult a psychiatrist for proper evaluation and treatment.", "ai": " I'm sorry to hear that you're experiencing fear of death after watching a distressing video. It's natural to have thoughts and feelings about mortality from time to time, but when these thoughts become persistent and debilitating, they can interfere with daily life. Here are a few suggestions that might help you manage your fear of death:\n\n1. Practice mindfulness meditation: Mindfulness meditation involves bringing your attention to the present moment without judgment. This can help reduce anxiety and stress related to fear of death by allowing you to focus on the present rather than dwelling on thoughts about the future. You can try practicing mindfulness meditation through guided videos or apps, or through practices like deep breathing or body scan.\n2. Connect with others: Sharing your feelings with others can help you feel less alone in your experience. Reach out to friends or family members, or consider joining a support group for people dealing with anxiety or fear of death. Talking about your feelings and hearing about others' experiences can be comforting and validating.\n3. Engage in activities that give meaning and purpose to your life: Focusing on things that you care about and find meaning in can help you feel more alive and less afraid of death. This might include pursuing hobbies, volunteering in your community, or spending time with loved ones.\n4. Seek professional help: If your fear of death is causing significant distress and interfering with your daily life, consider seeking help from a mental health professional. A therapist or counselor can help you develop coping strategies and work through your feelings in a safe and supportive environment.\n5. Focus on what you can control: It's natural to feel powerless in the face of the inevitability of death, but focusing on the things you can control in your life can help reduce anxiety and stress. This might include practicing healthy habits like eating well, exercising regularly, and getting enough sleep. It can also involve setting and working towards personal goals, or taking steps to prepare for the future, such as creating a will or making sure you have adequate insurance coverage.\n\nRemember, fear of death is a normal and common experience, but there are ways to manage it and find peace of mind.

IT is very difficult and not advisable to aspirate such a small fluid.", "ai": " Trace amounts of free fluid in the pelvis on a CT scan can have various possible causes, and it's essential to understand that not all of them are necessarily concerning. In your case, having had a hysterectomy in 2008, some common possibilities include:\n\n1. Post-surgical changes: It's not uncommon for some residual scarring or fibrosis after a hysterectomy to cause minimal free fluid in the pelvis. This fluid is often considered normal, especially if you haven't experienced any significant symptoms or changes since the surgery.\n\n2. Benign conditions: Certain conditions like endometriosis, pelvic cysts, or ovarian remnants can cause minimal fluid accumulation, which is usually benign. However, a follow-up evaluation may be recommended to rule out these conditions, especially if you have a relevant symptomatology.\n\n3. Other causes: There are several other reasons for free fluid in the pelvis, like inflammation, infection, or a leaking abdominal or pelvic organ. While these causes are less common, especially considering your surgical history, your healthcare provider may choose to monitor your symptoms or perform further tests to ensure your well-being.\n\nGiven your CT scan result, it's important to discuss the findings with your gastroenterologist and ask for clarification about the amount of fluid, its location, and any potential underlying causes. If necessary, additional tests, like pelvic ultrasound or bloodwork, may be recommended to investigate further.\n\nIt's crucial to remember that having trace amounts of free fluid doesn't always indicate a serious condition, but it's always better to be informed and address any concerns with your healthcare provider."}

Because without complete diagnosis treatment will be impossible. Scabies is contagious disease. If you have contacted with scabies patients than and than you get scabies. You can use permethrin cream for it. But doctors guidance is necessary. Glad to answer your further concern. We wish you a best health at healthcare magic. Thank you,Dr. Arun TankIf you are satisfied with my answer rate me as five star and close the answer", "ai": " Scabies is not caused by having ovarian cancer, whether in remission or not. Scabies is caused by a mite called Sarcoptes scabiei. It burrows under the skin and lays eggs, causing intense itching, rashes, and papules.\n\nThe fact that you had a red, sore navel and were prescribed an antibiotic cream suggests that this may have been a separate bacterial infection. The low body temperature might also be related. Feeling cold when the temperature is 73 degrees is not normal and could indicate an underlying medical issue.\n\nHowever, having ovarian cancer, even if it's in remission, makes it essential to keep open lines of communication with your medical team. Therefore, considering the combined symptoms (low temperature, possible separate infection, and history of ovarian cancer), it would be wise to consult your oncologist or primary care physician. They can assess your overall health and investigate any potential causes, including the possibility of an infection related to scabies treatment."}

If symptoms persist better to consult an orthopedic and plan for an MRI scan. Hope I have answered your query. Let me know if I can assist you further. Regards,Dr. Shinas Hussain, General & Family Physician", "ai": " Locked knees, also known as extending or hyperextending the knees, can have various causes. In young children, it's common to have some degree of hyperextension due to the flexibility of their muscles and ligaments. However, if your son is experiencing pain, inability to move his legs, and the position looks unnatural or forced, it could be a sign of an underlying condition.\n\nWhile I can't diagnose your son based on the information provided, here are some possible causes of locked knees:\n\n1. Muscle or ligament tension or strain: Overexertion or overuse of the quadriceps muscles in the front of the thighs can cause the knee to lock.\n2. Growing pains: Some children may experience discomfort or pain in their legs due to growth spurts or bone changes.\n3. Hyperextension of the knee joint: If your son's knees hyperextend significantly, it could be due to loose ligaments or muscle imbalances.\n4. Neurological conditions: Rare neurological conditions, such as cerebral palsy or spinal cord injuries, can cause abnormal posturing or muscle control.\n5. Rhabdomyolysis: In extreme cases, the locked knee position could be a sign of rhabdomyolysis, a condition where muscle tissue breaks down and releases myoglobin into the bloodstream.\n\nIf your son is experiencing pain, crying, or an inability to move his legs when they are in the locked position, it is important to consult a healthcare professional. They will be able to perform a thorough assessment and recommend appropriate treatments, if needed.\n\nIn the meantime, you can try the following to help alleviate symptoms:\n\n1. Encourage rest: Allow your son to take breaks from activities that may be contributing to the knee locking.\n2. Gentle stretches: Perform gentle stretches in a controlled manner, focusing on the muscles in the front and back of the thighs.\n3. Massage: Gently massage the quadriceps muscles to help release tension.\n4. Comfortable clothing: Ensure your son is wearing comfortable, loose-fitting clothing that doesn't restrict movement or put additional pressure on the affected area.\n5. Ice therapy: Applying ice to the area can help reduce inflammation and provide temporary pain relief.\n\nIf your son's symptoms persist or worsen, consider scheduling an appointment with a pediatrician or a physical therapist for further evaluation and professional guidance."}

Wishing you good health.", "ai": " Swollen occipital lymph nodes, which are located at the back of your head and neck, can be caused by various conditions. In your case, the connection between the swollen nodes and the sinus infection you've recently had is likely due to lymph node reaction to inflammation or infection in the head and neck area. However, it doesn't necessarily mean you have cancer, especially given that the lymph nodes aren't significantly large.\n\nHere are some common causes of swollen occipital lymph nodes:\n\n1. Infections: Infections in the head and neck, such as sinus infections, ear infections, dental infections, or throat infections, can cause lymph nodes to swell.\n2. Allergies: Allergies to food, environmental factors, or other substances can result in swollen lymph nodes.\n3. Neck injuries: Trauma or injury to the neck can cause localized swelling of lymph nodes.\n4. Systemic infections: Systemic infections, such as tuberculosis, meningitis, or HIV, can also cause swollen lymph nodes, including those in the occipital area.\n5.

They may perform a physical examination, and depending on the results, may recommend further tests such as a lymph node biopsy or imaging studies to rule out any underlying conditions.\n\nIf your sinus infection symptoms persist or worsen, it would be a good idea to follow up with your healthcare provider to ensure that the infection is being treated effectively. In the meantime, try to keep the area around your ears and neck clean and avoid putting any unnecessary pressure on the lymph nodes.

Appendicitis: Appendicitis is inflammation of the appendix, a small tube-shaped organ that connects to the large intestine. It is a medical emergency that can cause pain in the upper left abdomen, often accompanied by fever and loss of appetite.\n\nThese are just a few possible causes, and there may be others as well. It's important that you continue to seek medical attention and try to provide your healthcare provider with as much information as possible about your symptoms, including their location, frequency, duration, and any other associated symptoms. The prescribed medications, such as Dilaudid and methocarbanol, may be useful for managing pain, but they won't address the underlying cause.\n\nI hope that you find the answers you're looking for and that you get the care you need as soon as possible. Best of luck to you!"}
{"question": "Can Truvada prevent STD after anal intercourse?Is truvada used specifically for men engaged in anal intercourse only or is it used as a sort of preventative med helping prevent infection from sucking infected men orally?  Does it insure that there will  be no STD caught as a result of taking this drug?", "human": "HiThanks for posting your query on HCMI have read and understood your concernTruvada contains a combination of emtricitabine and tenofovir that may be used in the treat HIV though it does not cure the infection.Truvada may also be used together with safer-sex practices to reduce the risk of becoming infected with HIV. You must be HIV-negative and an adult to use Truvada for this purpose. It may not provide protection from disease in every person.So, this drug does not ensure that there is no STD.It only protects against HIV and some viral infections but not at 100%.Also, it may not offer protection against STDs of bacteria origin.Hope this will help.You may write back if more concernsBest regardsDr Mbuomboh", "ai": " Truvada is a medication that is primarily used as pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) for HIV infection. It does not specifically prevent other sexually transmitted diseases (STDs) or infections, such as gonorrhea, chlamydia, syphilis, or herpes.\n\nWhile Truvada does not provide 100% protection against STDs, it has been shown to reduce the risk of HIV transmission by up to 99%. However, it does not protect against the transmission of other STDs.\n\nIf you are engaging in anal intercourse and want to protect yourself from STDs as well as HIV, you should consider using condoms in combination with Truvada. Condoms are still the most effective means of protection against most STDs, including HIV.\n\nIt's important to note that Truvada is not a substitute for regular STD testing and screenings. Regular testing is still necessary to ensure early detection and treatment of STDs, if necessary.\n\nFurthermore, Truvada is not used specifically for men engaged in anal intercourse only; it can be used by anyone who is at risk for HIV infection through sexual contact, including men and women who have sex with men, men and women who have sex with women, and people who have injected drugs.\n\nTaking Truvada does not ensure that there will be no STDs caught as a result, but it does significantly reduce the risk of HIV transmission. It's always a good idea to talk to your healthcare provider about your sexual health and risk factors for HIV and STDs to determine the best prevention strategies for your situation."}
{"question": "Suggest treatment for bump on my kids foreheadOur 18 month old fell off the toddler bed today and got a good sized bump on her forehead. Not much later today, her left eye started looking really glossy and red. Not sure if it is coincidence or if we should be concerned. Please advise. Thanks!", "human": "Hi and welcome to HCM. this is normal, you just need to ice it and it will pass in seveeral days. WIsh you good health. Regards", "ai": " I'm not a doctor, but I can suggest some general advice based on common symptoms you've described. A bump on the forehead from a fall is relatively common in toddlers and usually not a cause for significant concern if it's not severe. However, the redness and glossiness in the left eye could suggest an injury to the eye, and you should have it checked by a healthcare professional.\n\nHere are the steps to take:\n\n1. Observe and monitor the bump: Check the bump regularly for signs of swelling, bruising, or worsening. Keep an eye out for any changes that may be cause for concern, like increased pain or warmth.\n\n2. Provide comfort: Encourage your child to rest and offer them comforting measures like a cool compress on the forehead or a favorite toy. Avoid pressing on the bump or causing any discomfort.\n\n3. Watch for signs of additional injuries: Check for other injuries like cuts, scrapes, or swelling in other areas. If you notice any symptoms like excessive crying, lethargy, decreased appetite, or difficulty breathing, seek medical attention right away.\n\n4. Monitor the redness and glossiness in the eye: Keep an eye on the eye and monitor for any changes in the redness, glossiness, or discharge from the eye. If the symptoms worsen or do not improve within a day or two, call your doctor or seek professional care.\n\n5. Seek Medical Advice: If you are unsure about the severity of the injury or symptoms, it's always better to err on the side of caution and consult your pediatrician or healthcare professional for evaluation and advice.\n\nAlways remember that this advice is not a substitute for professional medical opinion, and you should consult with a healthcare professional for the best approach in treating an injury in your child."}
{"question": "Why is a 26months old pronunciation difficult to understand?My son is 26months old,he understands everything u tell him to do,I do send him to get me water,phone,my dress,my bag etc and he delivers perfectely well,but the problem is I do not understand a word when he communicates to me.He cannot pronounce words not even mummy or daddy.What do I do?

If he's watching TV or video games or tablet more than 1 hour per day, it needs to be restricted.4. Encourage him to sing rhymes starting from words by continuous positive stimulation.5. GE needs complete evaluation by a developmental pediatrician.Regards - Do. Sumanth", "ai": " At 26 months old, language development can vary greatly between children. Some kids may be speaking clearly and in full sentences, while others may still be in the process of developing their pronunciation skills. Your son's ability to follow instructions and complete tasks shows that he has a good understanding of language, which is an important foundation for spoken communication.\n\nHowever, if you are having difficulty understanding him, there are a few things you can try to help improve his pronunciation:\n\n1. Speak clearly and slowly: Make sure you are enunciating your words clearly and speaking at a slow pace. This can help your son learn the correct sounds and pronunciation.\n2. Use repetition: Encourage your son to repeat words after you. This will help him familiarize himself with the sounds and improve his pronunciation over time.\n3. Use visual aids: Show your son pictures of objects and label them for him. Repeat the names of the objects several times, and encourage your son to try saying them himself.\n4. Read books together: Choose books with simple, repetitive language and illustrations that help your son understand the words. This can help him learn new words and their pronunciation.\n5. Sing songs: Singing songs with your son can be a fun way to help him learn new words and their pronunciation. Repetition and the musical nature of songs can make it easier for him to pick up new sounds.\n\nRemember, each child develops at their own pace, so it's important to be patient and support your son's language development in a positive and encouraging way. If you're concerned about your son's development, you may want to speak with your pediatrician to rule out any underlying issues."}

As per your query you have symptoms of hair loss which can occur due to many reasons like genetic factor, improper hygiene, fungal infection and hormonal changes. Need not to worry. Mintop 10 is good to use to get proper results and don't stop in between. Apply Indian gooseberries. You should consult dermatologist once for proper examination. Doctor may order skin patch test, blood test, allergic test and physical examination and may prescribe supplements like Omega-3 minoxidil spray, and Vitamin E.Hope your concern has been resolved.Best Wishes,Dr. Harry Maheshwari", "ai": " Mintop 10 is a hair care product that contains minoxidil as its active ingredient, which is a drug approved by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for the treatment of androgenetic alopecia, also known as male-pattern baldness. Minoxidil works by stimulating the hair follicles to promote hair growth and prevent further hair loss.\n\nHowever, minoxidil is not a cure for baldness and its effects are not permanent. It requires consistent use for as long as the person wants to maintain the benefits. Also, it may take several months to see any significant improvement in hair growth.\n\nMoreover, minoxidil is not recommended for everyone, especially for those with certain medical conditions, such as heart disease, low blood pressure, or pregnant or breastfeeding women. It may also cause side effects, such as scalp irritation, dizziness, and unwanted hair growth on other parts of the body.\n\nTherefore, before starting any hair loss treatment, including Mintop 10, it is best to consult a dermatologist or a healthcare professional to evaluate your individual condition and determine if minoxidil is appropriate for you. They can also provide you with a proper dosage and usage instructions to ensure maximum benefit and safety."}

Please consult a dermatologist or the doctor who performed the laser treatment for personalized advice.\n\n1. Topical Creams: Prescription-strength topical creams containing hydroquinone, retinoids, or corticosteroids can help fade pigmentation over time. These treatments can take several months to show results.\n\n2. Chemical Peels: A chemical peel involves the application of a chemical solution to the skin to remove the outer layers and stimulate the production of new cells. This can help reduce pigmentation, especially when combined with other treatments.\n\n3. Microdermabrasion: Microdermabrasion uses fine crystals to gently exfoliate the skin and remove dead cells. This treatment can help improve the appearance of skin and fade pigmentation, but it may not be effective on deep-set pigmentation.\n\n4. Laser Resurfacing: Laser resurfacing can be used to target pigmentation deeper in the skin. This treatment can be more effective than other treatments but comes with a higher risk of side effects, including scarring and infection.\n\n5. Intense Pulsed Light (IPL) Therapy: IPL therapy uses light energy to target pigmentation. This treatment can be more effective than other treatments, but it may not be suitable for everyone, especially those with darker skin tones.\n\n6. Sun Protection: Avoiding sunlight and wearing sunscreen are essential for preventing further pigmentation. Protecting your skin from the sun can also help existing pigmentation fade faster.\n\nRemember, every individual's skin responds differently to treatments, so it's essential to consult a healthcare professional for personalized recommendations. Also, always follow your healthcare professional's instructions carefully to avoid any potential complications."}

In my opinion, you are mostly having GERD (gastroesophageal reflux disease). It is due to laxity of gastroesophageal sphincter. Because of this the acid of the stomach tends to come up in the esophagus and cause the symptoms of Central chest pain, fullness, chest pressure etc. So better to follow these steps. 1. Avoid stress and tension. 2. Avoid large meals, instead take frequent small meals. Avoid hot and spicy food. Avoid junk food. 3. Start proton pump inhibitors and prokinetic drugs. 4. Go for walk after meals. 5. Keep 2-3 pillows under head in the bed to prevent reflux. 6. Loose weight if you are obese. 7. Quit smoking and alcohol if you have these habits. Don't worry, you will be alright. Hope I have solved your query. Wish you good health. Thanks.", "ai": " There are several potential causes for tightness or discomfort in the chest area while eating. Some common reasons include:\n\n1. Gastroesophageal Reflux Disease (GERD): This condition occurs when the stomach acid flows back into the esophagus, causing heartburn and chest discomfort. Eating large or spicy meals, lying down immediately after eating, and certain medications (like thyroid medication) can worsen GERD symptoms.\n2. Food allergies or sensitivities: Some people may experience chest tightness or discomfort due to an allergic or sensitivity reaction to certain foods. Common food allergens include cow's milk, eggs, peanuts, tree nuts, soy, wheat, and fish or shellfish.\n3. Angina: Angina is chest pain or discomfort that occurs when the heart muscle is not getting enough oxygen. This condition is often caused by narrowing or blockages in the heart's blood vessels. Risk factors for angina include high blood pressure, high cholesterol, diabetes, obesity, and smoking.\n4. Panic attack: Anxiety or panic attacks can cause symptoms such as chest tightness, shortness of breath, and heart palpitations. While eating, some people may experience anxiety due to stress, fear, or other emotional triggers.\n5. Other conditions: There are other medical conditions that can cause chest tightness or discomfort while eating, such as pulmonary embolism, pneumonia, or heart attack. However, these conditions are less common than the above-mentioned causes.\n\nTo determine the cause of your chest tightness while eating, it's important to speak with your healthcare provider. They may ask you about your symptoms, medical history, medications, and lifestyle habits. They may also perform diagnostic tests, such as an EKG or stress test, to rule out more serious conditions like heart disease.\n\nIn the meantime, you may find relief by avoiding spicy or large meals, eating slowly and chewing your food thoroughly, and avoiding foods that you suspect may be causing an allergic or sensitivity reaction. Additionally, try taking small sips of water during meals and waiting a few hours after eating before lying down. If your symptoms persist or worsen, contact your healthcare provider for further evaluation."}

Regards - Dr. Sumanth", "ai": " I'm not a doctor, but I can try to provide you with some information that might help answer your question.\n\nWatery stools in an infant on Dumex Dupro Step 2 could be caused by several things. Here are some possibilities:\n\n1. Transition from exclusive breastfeeding or formula feeding to complementary feeding: As your son begins to eat solid foods, it's not uncommon for his stools to become looser and more watery. This is because solid foods take longer to be digested than liquid ones, and they may not provide the same consistency as formula or breast milk. However, if the watery stools are concerning you, it's worth discussing with your child's healthcare provider.\n2. Allergy or intolerance to the formula: While it's less common with hydrolysate formulas like Dumex Dupro, some infants may still experience an allergic or intolerant reaction. Symptoms of a formula allergy can include diarrhea (watery stools), vomiting, and bloating. If you suspect an allergy or intolerance, speak with your child's healthcare provider. They may recommend trying a different formula or conducting further tests to diagnose the issue.\n3. Illness: Watery stools can also be a sign of an illness, such as a stomach virus or bacterial infection. If your son has other symptoms, such as fever, vomiting, or diarrhea, you may want to contact your healthcare provider to rule out any underlying conditions.\n4. Constipation: It might seem counterintuitive, but watery stools can also be a sign of constipation. If your son is straining during bowel movements or passing hard, dry stools between watery ones, it may be worth discussing constipation with your healthcare provider.\n\nRegardless of the cause, if your son's watery stools persist or are accompanied by other concerning symptoms, such as fever, vomiting, or prolonged diarrhea, it's important to speak with your healthcare provider for further evaluation and guidance."}

On Day 11, the follicle measured 1.7 cm and had an estradiol (EM) level of 6.4 pg/mL. By Day 13, the follicle had grown to 1.7 cm in size and had an EM level of 8.9 pg/mL. By Day 15, the follicle had reached a size of 1.8 cm and an EM level of 9.8 pg/mL, and the ovary was described as having a raphenaeolum (a thin, fibrous tissue in the ovary).\n\nThe presence of a dominant follicle with increasing size and estradiol levels suggests that ovulation may occur soon. A follicular study measurement of over 1 cm in size with an EM level above 5 is considered indicative of a mature follicle.\n\nHowever, it's important to keep in mind that follicular studies cannot definitively predict when ovulation will occur. Additionally, the size and estradiol level of a follicle do not always directly correlate with fertility.\n\nIf you are trying to conceive, it is recommended that you engage in regular intercourse around the time of ovulation. This could be estimated by monitoring your ovulation signs, such as cervical mucus changes and ovulation predictor kits, or by tracking your menstrual cycle and calculating the estimated ovulation day based on a regular 28-day cycle. Alternatively, you could consult with a fertility specialist for further evaluation and guidance.\n\nIt's also important to note that this information is not a substitute for professional medical advice.

A diffuse bulge with minimal compression of the thecal sac and hypertrophy of the ligamenta flava can be a concerning finding, but the severity of the condition depends on various factors.\n\nTheligamenta flava is a pair of ligaments that run along the spine, and they help keep the spinal cord and nerves protected by maintaining space between the vertebrae. Hypertrophy means that the ligament has thickened, which can potentially cause pressure on the spinal cord or nerves. Minimal compression of the thecal sac suggests that there is some pressure on the tissue surrounding the spinal cord, but it has not yet caused significant damage.\n\nThe locations of the findings, L2-3, L3-4, L4-5, and L1-L2, suggest that this issue may be affecting multiple levels in your lower back and neck. This could potentially lead to symptoms such as pain, numbness, tingling, or weakness in the affected areas.\n\nGiven your medical history of back surgery in 2012 and neck surgery in 2013, it's essential to discuss these MRI findings with your healthcare provider. They will consider your symptoms, medical history, and the imaging results to determine the best course of action. Treatment options could include physical therapy, pain management, or further surgical intervention, depending on the severity of the condition and your individual circumstances.\n\nIn summary, a diffuse bulge with minimal compression of the thecal sac and hypertrophy of the ligamenta flava can be a potential concern, and it's essential to discuss this finding with your healthcare provider. They will help determine the best course of action based on your specific situation."}
{"question": "5 year old with hepatomegaly. Abdominal ultrasound done. Need help in reading the liver function testHave a five year old boy with mild hepatomagelly according to the Abdominal ultra sound scan that was done. but the liver functioning tests are as follows. Alkaline phosphate 113 iu/l Alanine transaminase 21iu/l Aspartate transaminase 38 iu/l Total bilirubin 3 mmol/l Direct bilirubin 0 mmol/l Gamma GT 13 iu/l Albumin 38 g/l", "human": "hi there,his LFT suggest that his ALKP are raised and there is no conjugated bilirubin with hepatomegaly and hypoprotenemia. There is derangement in his liver funtion which point to an in born error of metabolism occuring due to deficiency in certain liver enzyme. You need to get your son thoroughy investigated preferrably by a peciatrician trained for this purpose. The hepatomegaly is also due to this reason. Take care.", "ai": " Based on the given liver function tests, the following are the key findings:\n\n1. Alkaline phosphatase (ALP): The ALP level is slightly elevated at 113 IU/L. ALP can be produced by various tissues including the liver, bone, and intestine. Elevated ALP in the absence of bone disease can indicate liver disease, but other causes such as biliary tract obstruction should be considered as well.\n2. Alanine transaminase (ALT) and Aspartate transaminase (AST): Both ALT and AST are slightly elevated, with ALT at 21 IU/L and AST at 38 IU/L. Transaminases are enzymes that are released from the liver when it is damaged. Elevated levels of these enzymes can indicate liver injury or disease.\n3. Total bilirubin: The total bilirubin level is moderately elevated at 3 mmol/L. Bilirubin is a yellow pigment that is produced when the body breaks down old red blood cells. Elevated bilirubin levels can indicate a problem with the production, processing, or excretion of bilirubin.\n4. Direct bilirubin: The direct bilirubin level is normal at 0 mmol/L. Direct bilirubin is the fraction of bilirubin that is bound to proteins in the blood and is primarily produced in the liver.\n5. Gamma-glutamyl transferase (GGT): The GGT level is slightly elevated at 13 IU/L. GGT is an enzyme that is found in various tissues, including the liver. Elevated GGT levels can indicate liver disease or other conditions such as bile duct obstruction or medication use.\n6. Albumin: The albumin level is normal at 38 g/L. Albumin is a protein that is produced in the liver and helps maintain fluid balance in the body.\n\nBased on the liver function tests and the finding of mild hepatomegaly on ultrasound, it is likely that the child has some form of liver disease. However, it is important to note that other causes of hepatomegaly such as congestive heart failure or chronic infection should also be considered. Further evaluation with additional tests such as viral serology, imaging studies, or invasive procedures may be necessary to make a definitive diagnosis. It is recommended that you consult with a pediatrician or a pediatric gastroenterologist for interpretation of these results and for appropriate management of the child's condition."}

The sudden stabbing upper back pain and burping could be related to the following:\n\n1. Indigestion or gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD): The pain could be due to acid reflux, which can cause discomfort in the upper back, especially if you've recently eaten a large or spicy meal. The burping could be a result of the body trying to expel stomach acid.\n2. Musculoskeletal issues: Upper back pain could be due to muscle strain or spasms, which can be triggered by poor posture, overuse, or injury. Your herniated disc could also contribute to this pain.\n3. Heart-related conditions: While the sudden pain and burping could be unrelated to the heart, they can also be symptoms of heart conditions such as angina or a heart attack. However, these symptoms usually occur during physical activity or stress, and they typically do not go away after burping.\n\nIt's important to consult a healthcare professional to determine the true cause of your symptoms. They can perform a physical exam and recommend appropriate tests if necessary. If you are concerned about heart-related symptoms, it's best to seek medical attention right away. In the meantime, try to identify any triggers for your symptoms, such as certain foods or activities, and avoid them if possible."}

Life expectancy is not good. Sorry to say but it is fact.Consult your oncologist and plan accordingly. Hope I have answered your question, if you have any doubts then contact me at bit.ly/Drsanghvihardik, I will be happy to answer you.Thanks for using health care magic.Wish you a very good health.", "ai": " I'm an artificial intelligence language model and I cannot diagnose or prescribe treatments for your uncle's condition. I can, however, provide you with some general information about esophageal tumors and the possible treatment options that might be discussed with his healthcare team.\n\nEsophageal tumors, especially those that are advanced and have spread to other organs like the liver and lungs (metastasis), are often challenging to treat and have a poor prognosis. The most common type of esophageal tumor is esophageal cancer, which can be squamous cell carcinoma or adenocarcinoma.\n\nYour uncle's healthcare team may consider the following treatment options depending on the stage, location, and overall health of your uncle:\n\n1. Surgery: If the tumor is localized and the health of your uncle is good enough, surgery may be an option to remove the tumor and any affected lymph nodes. However, since your uncle's tumor has metastasized to other organs, this may not be a viable option.\n\n2. Chemotherapy: Chemotherapy is a systemic treatment that uses drugs to kill cancer cells. It can be used to shrink tumors and help control symptoms, improve quality of life, and prolong life in advanced cases. Chemotherapy is usually administered intravenously, but it can also be given orally.\n\n3. Radiation therapy: This treatment uses high-energy X-rays to kill cancer cells. It can be used to shrink tumors, relieve symptoms, and improve quality of life. Radiation therapy can be administered externally, or a catheter can be used to deliver the radiation directly to the tumor (brachytherapy).\n\n4. Palliative care: In cases where the cancer has advanced and treatment options are limited, palliative care focuses on improving the quality of life and managing the symptoms through a combination of medical, emotional, social, and spiritual support.\n\n5. Clinical trials: Clinical trials are ongoing research studies evaluating new and experimental treatments for various diseases, including esophageal cancer. Your uncle's healthcare team may discuss the possibility of participating in a clinical trial if other treatment options have been exhausted.\n\nKeep in mind that these are just potential options and the best course of treatment for your uncle will depend on a variety of factors, including his overall health, age, and the specific characteristics of the tumor. It's important to consult with the healthcare team to discuss all the possibilities and make informed decisions regarding your uncle's care.\n\nRemember, this information is presented to provide you with a general understanding of treatment options for esophageal tumors. For accurate and specific information, consult with the healthcare team caring for your uncle. They will be able to provide you with the most current and accurate information based on your uncle's individual condition."}
{"question": "What causes fall in GFR in case of stage 3 CKD?hi i have ckd stage 3, my gfr is 45. the doctors are now trying to work out why in 6 months my gfr  has gone from 82 to 45. i have been taking extra strong pain killers which has contained 300mg of asprin would this not have helped the fall in my gfr? many thanks debbie (aged 45) and only kidney!", "human": "Sudden fall in gfr could be due to pain killer intake,herbal or ayurvedic medicinal intake,infections and dehydration. About ecosprin 300 mg,it is possible. Ecosprin 75 mg is the recommended safe dose in CKD", "ai": " There are several potential causes for a significant decrease in Glomerular Filtration Rate (GFR) in just six months, especially from 82 to 45 ml/min/1.73m2 in someone with Stage 3 CKD. However, the relationship between taking extra-strength painkillers containing 300mg of aspirin and the observed decrease in GFR is not straightforward. Here, we'll discuss some common potential causes for the observed decline in GFR and how painkillers might be involved.\n\n1. Acute Kidney Injury (AKI): This can be an acute episode of kidney damage that results in a rapid decline in GFR. Various factors such as infections, medications like nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), and intravenous contrast dyes used in medical imaging can cause AKI. The painkillers you've mentioned contain ibuprofen, which is an NSAID, so they could potentially have contributed to an episode of AKI. However, it's essential to determine if AKI was the underlying cause of the drop in your GFR.\n\n2. Progressive Kidney Disease: Chronic kidney disease can be a relentless process, and the decline in GFR could be due to worsening disease activity. There are several potential causes for disease progression, including uncontrolled high blood pressure, poor blood sugar control in diabetes, and ongoing damage due to inflammation or oxidative stress. Moreover, as mentioned, certain medications, such as NSAIDs, can contribute to disease progression.\n\n3. Renal Vascular Disease: Narrowing of the renal arteries (renal artery stenosis) or the renal veins can decrease blood flow to your kidneys, ultimately leading to a decline in GFR. Since NSAIDs like ibuprofen can worsen kidney function due to their vasoconstrictive effect, they are known to increase the risk of renal vascular disease.\n\nIn conclusion, the combination of extra-strength painkillers containing ibuprofen and the onset of acute kidney injury, progressive kidney disease, or renal vascular disease can be factors causing a decline in GFR in someone with Stage 3 CKD. It's important to discuss these potential possibilities with your healthcare team to understand the underlying cause and develop an appropriate management plan. They may recommend further tests, such as blood tests, urine analysis, imaging studies, or renal biopsy, to determine the exact cause of the decline in your GFR. In the meantime, consider the following:\n\n- If you continue to take NSAIDs or other painkillers, discuss alternative pain management strategies with your healthcare team.\n- Regularly monitor your blood pressure, urine output, and kidney function through regular blood tests.\n- Manage any underlying health conditions, such as diabetes or high blood pressure, as advised by your healthcare team.\n- Maintain a healthy lifestyle through regular physical activity, a balanced diet, and limiting sodium and processed foods."}

However, it is important to note that this information should not replace a consultation with a healthcare professional.\n\nYour description of painful surges in the center of your abdomen, about an inch and a half below your nipple line, may be suggestive of gastrointestinal discomfort or pain. Here are some potential causes that could be related to your symptoms:\n\n1. Foodborne illness: Eating old or spoiled nuts can lead to foodborne illness. Symptoms can range from mild to severe and can include abdominal pain and cramping, diarrhea, nausea, vomiting, and fever. In most cases, foodborne illness resolves on its own within a few days, but severe cases may require medical attention.\n2. Allergic reaction: Nuts are a common cause of food allergies. A reaction to consumed nuts can result in symptoms such as abdominal pain, cramping, diarrhea, nausea, vomiting, and difficulty breathing. Severe allergic reactions (anaphylaxis) can be life-threatening and require immediate medical attention.\n3. Gastroenteritis: This is an inflammation of the stomach and intestines, often caused by a viral or bacterial infection. Symptoms can include abdominal pain, cramping, diarrhea, nausea, and vomiting. The pain usually subsides as the infection runs its course.\n4. Gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD): This is a chronic digestive disorder where stomach acid flows back into the esophagus, causing pain, heartburn, and other symptoms. In some cases, the pain may be located in the center of the abdomen.\n5. Gallstones: If you have a gallstone, it can cause abdominal pain, particularly in the upper right quadrant of the abdomen.

A sore throat can have various causes, and it's important to consider different possibilities.\n\n1. Allergies: Allergens in the environment, such as pollen or dust, can irritate the throat and cause symptoms like soreness or scratchiness. If you have a history of allergies, especially to seasonal allergens, it's worth considering this as a potential cause. However, if you have no other allergy symptoms like runny nose, itching eyes, or wheezing, allergies might not be the primary cause.\n2. Dry environment: Traveling, especially during winter months, can expose you to dry environments, which can irritate your throat. Planes and cars both have low humidity levels, and staying in heated indoor spaces can further dry out the air and your throat.\n3. Viral infection: Although your sore throat occurred after your travels, it's not uncommon for viral infections, such as the common cold or flu, to take a day or two to develop symptoms. You may have been exposed to the virus during your trip but didn't notice any symptoms until after you returned home.\n\nTo help make a more informed decision, consider tracking your symptoms and documenting the environment around you, such as the time of year, local weather, and any potential allergens (pollen counts, for example). If your symptoms worsen or you develop other symptoms like a fever or persistent cough, it would be best to consult a healthcare professional for a proper diagnosis and treatment recommendations.\n\nOverall, it's not uncommon for individuals to experience a sore throat after traveling, especially if they've been exposed to dry environments or potential allergens.

{"question": "What causes high heart rate while race walking?I am a healthy 58 yrs old woman. I race walk competively. I have been going faster lately. Sometimes my heart rate goes to 230 for 10-20 seconds. When I end my race walking trainings (4 miles average), my heart rate drops down quickly, no problem. Should I worry about the 230?", "human": "hello thanks for posting here. A heart rate of 230 on exertion definitely requires evaluation. however first of all we need to evaluate whether you really reach that 230 reading. while running the heart rate detector may mistake your body vibrations and movements for heart beats and count them  accordingly. hence the heart rate may erroneously show a high reading. So you have to check whethrr it happens with you only or with everyone. Another thing that can be done is a treadmill test. It requires you to run on a treadmill, the speed of which increases gradually to a point till your heart rate reaches a target rate. this TMT test will continuously record your EKG while you are running so all aberrations and errors can be rules out. It will definitely show whether you really have a fast heart rate on exercising. If it documents very fast heart rate further work up can be done. wishing yoi good health. thank you", "ai": " A heart rate of 230 beats per minute during physical activity is quite high and can be concerning. It's important to note that your reported heart rate may not be entirely accurate, as heart rate monitors can sometimes have margin of error.\n\nSeveral factors can contribute to a high heart rate during race walking or other physical activities, including:\n\n1. Fitness level: As you mentioned, you have been going faster in your training. Your body may not yet be fully adapted to the increased workload, leading to a higher heart rate.\n2. Dehydration: Not getting enough fluids before, during, and after your race walking sessions can lead to a decrease in blood volume and an increase in heart rate.\n3. Heat stress: Training in hot weather can increase heart rate as your body works to maintain a normal body temperature.\n4. Anxiety or stress: Feeling nervous or anxious before or during competition can cause your heart rate to increase.\n5. Medications: Some medications can increase heart rate as a side effect.\n\nThat being said, a heart rate of 230 beats per minute is beyond the normal range for maximum heart rate during physical activity. It's important to consult with your healthcare provider to discuss the possible causes and any potential concerns related to your high heart rate. Your doctor may recommend further testing to rule out any underlying conditions that could be contributing to your high heart rate.\n\nIt's also worth noting that you mentioned your heart rate drops quickly after your trainings, which is a good sign. It's normal for your heart rate to return to normal post-exercise. However, if your heart rate remains high for extended periods, or if you experience other symptoms such as dizziness, shortness of breath, or chest pain, seek medical attention right away."}

It will surely help in the condition.Hope I have answered your query. Let me know if I can assist you further.Regards,Dr. Harsh Swarup", "ai": " The symptoms you're describing, such as pain from the thigh to the calf, numbness in the toes, and continuous pain in the foot while sleeping, could be related to a condition called sciatic nerve compression or radiculopathy. The sciatic nerve is the largest nerve in the body, and it runs from the lower back down to the legs and feet.\n\nYour reported history of a fused L5 vertebrae and a slight problem in L3/L4 could be contributing to this nerve compression. The L5 vertebrae is a common site of nerve root compression, which can lead to sciatic nerve symptoms. The pain and numbness you're experiencing could be the result of pressure on the nerves as they exit the spine and travel down the legs.\n\nIt's essential to consult with a healthcare professional, such as a doctor or a physical therapist, to receive an accurate diagnosis and appropriate treatment. The causes of your symptoms can vary, and a thorough evaluation is necessary to determine the underlying condition.\n\nTreatment options for sciatic nerve compression may include physical therapy exercises to improve flexibility and strength, pain management techniques, medication, or surgery, depending on the severity and specifics of the condition. Your healthcare professional can help you determine the best course of action based on your individual situation.\n\nIn the meantime, you can try some self-care measures to alleviate your symptoms, like:\n\n1. Avoid prolonged sitting or standing: Take frequent breaks when sitting for long periods, and try to stand up and walk around every half hour while working.\n2. Practice good posture: Maintain a straight back and avoid slouching, especially while sitting.\n3. Exercise regularly: Gentle stretching and strength training exercises can help improve flexibility and muscle tone in the affected leg.\n4. Use a heat or ice pack: Applying heat or ice can help reduce pain and inflammation.\n5. Use proper footwear: Wear shoes with good arch support and cushioning to reduce pressure on the affected foot.\n\nThese self-care measures can help provide temporary relief, but it's crucial to schedule a consultation with a healthcare professional to discuss a proper treatment plan for your condition."}

Should I be concerned?", "human": "Hi, I have gone through your question and understand your concerns. Infectious mononucleosis is a viral infection and it can cause thrombocytopenia (low platelets) and due to that one can have bruises. As bruises are fading it means your infection is improving, some bruises can take time to fade so you can wait and observe. If after few days to a week if it will not settle or if you have bleed from any site than you should visit your physician and should have repeat blood tests like cbc,pt aptt. Hope I have answered your question. If you have any other query feel free to ask.Wish you good health.", "ai": " A bruise on the lower spine can have various causes, and mononucleosis, also known as mono or the \"kissing disease,\" is not typically associated with this specific location. Mononucleosis causes symptoms such as fatigue, fever, swollen lymph nodes, sore throat, and body aches. The bruises you experienced could be a symptom of mono, as one of the less common symptoms, although they are more commonly found on the arms, legs, or torso. Other possible causes of a bruise on the lower spine include trauma or injury, such as falling or lifting heavy objects, or certain medical conditions like hemorrhagic diseases, which can affect blood clotting.\n\nIn your case, since you have been generally feeling well since your mono diagnosis, and all your other bruises have faded except for the one on your lower back, it is less likely that it is related to mono. You may want to consider the possibility of a recent injury, as bruises can take time to appear and might not always be noticeable right away. If you cant recall any injury or trauma, or if the bruise doesn't improve or worsens over time, it's a good idea to mention it to your doctor during your next appointment to rule out any underlying condition or concern. However, if you experience any new symptoms, such as intense pain, difficulty walking, or abdominal swelling, seek medical advice immediately."}

However, the rapid onset and spread of fluid-filled blisters on various body parts suggest that this could be a recurrence or a new flare-up of psoriasis. Psoriasis is a chronic inflammatory skin condition that can present with red, scaly, and sometimes painful or itchy patches or blisters. It can affect different parts of the body, including the palms, arms, and neck.\n\nIf your psoriasis has come back and is causing significant symptoms, here are some steps you can take:\n\n1. Apply a cool compress to the affected areas to help reduce inflammation and relieve pain.\n2. Keep the affected areas clean and moisturized to prevent the blisters from getting infected.\n3. Avoid scratching or picking at the blisters, as this can lead to infection and worsening of the symptoms.\n4. Consider using over-the-counter topical treatments for psoriasis, such as corticosteroid creams or salicylic acid, to help reduce inflammation and clear up the blisters.\n5. If your symptoms are severe or not responding to over-the-counter treatments, talk to your healthcare provider about prescribing a stronger medication, such as a systemic medication or phototherapy.\n6. Consider making lifestyle modifications to help manage your psoriasis, such as quitting smoking, reducing stress, getting enough sunlight exposure (while taking appropriate sun protection measures), and maintaining a healthy diet.\n\nIt's also important to note that while psoriasis can often be managed effectively, it is a chronic condition and may require ongoing treatment to keep it under control. If your symptoms are severe or getting worse despite treatment, or if you have concerns about your overall health, you should talk to your healthcare provider for further evaluation and guidance."}

How much is the average cost for the same and is here any risk involved?", "human": "Hi,Since you have not mentioned the place you belong to I will mention the cost in USD- 150-200.Kidney biopsy is advised when there is no other way to find out the reason for kidney disease.The procedure is quite safe in experienced hands.Sometimes minor complications like blood in the urine may occur but subsiding rapidly", "ai": " A kidney biopsy is a medical procedure in which a small sample of kidney tissue is removed and examined under a microscope to determine the cause of kidney damage or disease. As with any medical procedure, there are risks involved with a kidney biopsy. These risks include, but are not limited to:\n\n1. Bleeding: Kidney biopsies carry a risk of bleeding, which can range from mild (requiring little to no treatment) to severe (requiring transfusions or surgery to stop the bleeding).\n2. Infection: There is a risk of developing an infection at the biopsy site or in the kidney. This risk can be reduced by taking antibiotics before and after the procedure.\n3. Complications: Other complications can include damage to the kidney or other organs, as well as reactions to the anesthesia used during the procedure.\n\nThe risk of complications from a kidney biopsy is generally low, but it does depend on the individual's overall health and the reasons for the biopsy. Your mother's age and elevated creatinine levels may increase the risk slightly, but the benefits of diagnosing the underlying cause of her kidney damage likely outweigh the risks.\n\nAs for the cost of a kidney biopsy, it can vary widely depending on the location, the specific medical facility, and the type of biopsy procedure used. In the US, the cost can range from $5,000 to $30,000 or more. I recommend checking with your insurance provider to see what, if any, of the costs will be covered, and speaking with your doctor or the hospital's billing department for an estimate of the out-of-pocket costs.\n\nI hope this information is helpful. I recommend discussing any concerns or questions you may have with your mother's doctor before the biopsy procedure. They will be able to provide more detailed and personalized information based on her specific health situation."}
{"question": "How can I remove dark spots due to skin cell rupture ?sir , i have some injury on my face , which causes my skin cell rupture perhaps , so dark spot come, how can i remove this????????", "human": "hiit depend how deep the scar is?better to consult dermatologist.if not then apply HEXILAK cream over it", "ai": " I'm an AI language model and not a doctor, but I can suggest some common skincare approaches to help reduce the appearance of dark spots caused by skin cell rupture, also known as post-inflammatory hyperpigmentation. Keep in mind that everyone's skin is unique, so results may vary.\n\n1. Protect your skin from the sun: Sun exposure can worsen the appearance of dark spots. Use a broad-spectrum sunscreen with an SPF of at least 30 every day, even indoors, to prevent further damage.\n\n2. Treat inflammation and injury: Apply a cool compress to soothe the injury and reduce inflammation. Over-the-counter anti-inflammatory creams or gels, such as hydrocortisone or those containing tea tree oil, may also help.\n\n3. Exfoliate gently: Regularly exfoliating your skin can help even out skin tone and fade dark spots. Choose a gentle exfoliator, such as a chemical exfoliant containing glycolic or lactic acid, or a physical exfoliant with small particles, like microbeads or a cleansing cloth. Use these products no more than twice a week to avoid irritation.\n\n4. Use vitamin C serums: Vitamin C is a powerful antioxidant that can help brighten the skin and fade dark spots. Look for a vitamin C serum with a concentration of at least 10% and apply it to your face once or twice a day.\n\n5. Apply retinoids: Retinoids, derived from vitamin A, can help stimulate collagen production, minimize dark spots, and improve overall skin texture. Prescription retinoids or over-the-counter retinol derivatives can be used, but start with a low concentration and gradually increase as your skin adjusts.\n\n6. Eat a healthy diet: Certain foods rich in antioxidants, such as citrus fruits, spinach, carrots, and bell peppers, can help promote healthy skin and reduce inflammation.\n\n7. Avoid picking at or squeezing the injury: Doing so can worsen the injury and lead to more dark spots. Allow the injury to heal on its own, and avoid touching it excessively.\n\nDiscuss any skincare concerns or new treatments with your healthcare professional, especially if you have persistent dark spots or other significant skin issues."}

{"question": "What causes severe pain in back and legs in supine position?Hi, The last two days my one year old had a very bad cold and needed me to hold him all the time while we were both lying down (I never lay down or rest this much).  I have had a slight pain in my lower back but much more pain in both legs, like they are being squeezed very hard ever since.  What can this be?", "human": "Pain in back and pain in leg this could be related to each other or it could be separate issues also. You can check one thing lying position on your back legs straight. Now when you lift your leg up straight ( any one leg ) then how is your pain in leg and back.

Here are some possibilities, but please keep in mind that I'm an AI language model and cannot diagnose conditions based on symptoms alone. I strongly recommend consulting a healthcare professional for an accurate assessment.\n\n1. Sciatica: This condition is caused by irritation or compression of the sciatic nerve, which runs from your lower back down through your legs. Symptoms can include radiating pain, tingling, or numbness in the buttocks, hips, and legs.\n2. Muscle or ligament strain: Prolonged periods of lying down can put added strain on your lower back and leg muscles, leading to pain or cramping.\n3. Herniated disc: A herniated disc can put pressure on nerves in your lower back, causing pain that radiates to your legs.\n4. Piriformis syndrome: This condition occurs when the piriformis muscle in your buttocks compresses the sciatic nerve, resulting in pain and discomfort in your back and legs.\n5. Arthritis: Arthritis can cause inflammation and pain in your back or legs, making it difficult to rest comfortably.\n\nAgain, these are just a few possible causes. Your individual situation may be different, and it's essential to consult with a healthcare professional for an accurate diagnosis. In the meantime, you can try to alleviate your symptoms with home remedies like applying heat or ice to the affected area, gentle stretching, and over-the-counter pain relievers.

{"question": "How can spiral fracture of the ring finger be treated?I have a spiral type fracture on my ring finger metacarpul in my hand a doctor put in a cast for 5 weeks after five weeks the cast was removed and the xrays show small healing and also showed the fracture is still there. what do you think I need to do", "human": "Hello,Thank you for your question.Sometimes healing in Xray shows later than it is acctualy.the doctor should check for clinical healing. I mean the doctor should move the finger and try tonsee if there is crepitation or click sound in the fracture site that shows not healing.If you do not have neither pain nor crepitations that means that the fracture is healed.If not healed then you need surgery to fix it.Best regards, Dr. Selmani", "ai": " I am an AI language model and unable to diagnose or provide specific medical advice. I can, however, provide some general information about spiral fractures of the ring finger and potential treatment options based on common medical practices.\n\nA spiral fracture occurs when the bone in the finger twists or spirals, often due to a high-energy injury. The initial treatment typically involves immobilization through a cast or splint to allow the bone to heal. In your case, if the cast was removed after five weeks and x-rays revealed that the healing progress was slow, there are several potential options you can discuss with your healthcare provider:\n\n1. Re-immobilization: Your doctor may suggest placing the finger back into a cast or a more supportive brace for a longer period. Healing times may vary based on the severity and location of the fracture, and a cast for 8 weeks or even longer might be recommended.\n\n2. Surgery: If the fracture fails to heal properly with non-surgical treatments or the bone is significantly displaced, your healthcare provider may recommend a surgical intervention. This may involve inserting a small plate or screws to stabilize the bone and help the healing process.\n\n3. Physical therapy: Once the bone has healed, your doctor may recommend physical therapy to help regain finger flexibility, range of motion, and strength. This can involve exercises and specialized techniques to restore function to your ring finger.\n\nWhile it is important to follow your healthcare provider's advice, I encourage you to discuss any concerns or questions you may have about your treatment options to ensure the best possible outcome."}

The doses offered to you are in normal range.. & I feel you shoulf believe your treating doctor & continue taking it as per the advise, while regular pregnancy check ups are done.     Thanks.", "ai": " I am an artificial intelligence language model and I cannot provide definite answers to medical questions, but I can give you some general information about the use of Ofloxacin, INH (Isoniazid), and Ethambutol during pregnancy based on available data.\n\nThe use of anti-tuberculosis (TB) medications during pregnancy is a common issue. According to the World Health Organization (WHO), there is no evidence that the fetal risk from the mother receiving first-line TB drugs is greater than the risk of the mother developing TB and transmitting it to her fetus. However, some studies suggest that the use of Ofloxacin, a fluoroquinolone antibiotic like Ofloxacin, during pregnancy may be associated with congenital abnormalities, particularly of the musculoskeletal system. In 2013, the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) updated the labeling for fluoroquinolones, including Ofloxacin, to include a warning against their use during pregnancy due to this risk.\n\nRegarding the specific medications your wife is taking, INH and Ethambutol have been considered safe during pregnancy for many years, and there is little evidence of teratogenic effects. However, INH may cause hepatotoxicity, which may not become apparent until weeks to months after starting treatment. This risk is increased during pregnancy, and all pregnant women taking INH should undergo regular monitoring of liver function.\n\nEthambutol has also been extensively studied during pregnancy, and no significant adverse effects on the fetus have been reported. However, Ethambutol may cause optic neuritis, an inflammatory condition of the optic nerve, in adults and children, and there is some evidence that the risk may be increased during pregnancy. This condition usually resolves following discontinuation of the drug, but it may cause visual impairment, so close monitoring of visual acuity and fundoscopic examinations is recommended for pregnant women taking Ethambutol.\n\nYour wife's healthcare provider is the best person to discuss these concerns with, as they have access to her medical history and can provide guidance based on the most up-to-date information and her specific situation. It is recommended that she continues her TB treatment as prescribed, but with close monitoring for any adverse effects, especially those related to liver function and vision.\n\nIt is also important to note that untreated or inadequately treated TB during pregnancy can have serious consequences for both the mother and the fetus, including premature labor, low birth weight, and an increased risk of infecting the newborn. Proper management of the mother's TB treatment is crucial for the health of both the mother and the fetus."}

However, I cannot provide definitive medical advice, and it's essential to consult your healthcare provider for accurate information based on your individual situation.\n\n1. Hormonal therapy: Your doctor might suggest taking hormonal medication to thin the endometrial lining. Combination hormonal contraceptives, progestin-only pills, or gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) agonists are some common options. These medications can help reduce the frequency and thickness of your endometrial lining.\n\n2. Diet and lifestyle changes: Some studies indicate that certain dietary modifications and lifestyle changes might help reduce endometrial thickness. For example, maintaining a healthy weight, consuming a balanced diet rich in fruits, vegetables, whole grains, lean proteins, and healthy fats, and engaging in regular physical activity can help promote better hormonal balance and reduce inflammation in some individuals.\n\n3. Transvaginal ultrasound monitoring: Another non-surgical option could be undergoing regular monitoring of your endometrial thickness through ultrasound examinations. This approach may be suitable if your endometrial thickness is only mildly elevated and if you're at low risk for developing endometrial cancer. However, more frequent ultrasound monitoring may be necessary, and your healthcare provider would need to establish the appropriate follow-up schedule based on your individual situation.\n\n4. Hysteroscopy: While not entirely non-surgical, hysteroscopy is less invasive than traditional surgical procedures. This procedure involves inserting a thin, lighted tube into the uterus to examine the lining and remove any potentially harmful growths or polyps. It is usually performed as an outpatient procedure and carries fewer risks compared to hysterectomy or other significant surgical interventions.\n\nAlways remember that it's essential to consult your healthcare provider before making any decisions regarding your treatment options. They will be able to consider your unique situation and discuss the pros and cons of each option, allowing you to make an informed decision that's best for you."}

Caffeine allergies are rare and usually present with symptoms such as hives, itching, swelling, and anaphylaxis. Instead, this reaction might be attributed to other factors:\n\n1. Caffeine sensitivity: Some people are more sensitive to caffeine than others. Consuming even small amounts can lead to symptoms such as anxiety, restlessness, heart palpitations, and muscle tremors.\n\n2. Caffeine intolerance: A small percentage of people have a metabolic disorder called phhenylketonuria (PKU), which prevents them from breaking down the amino acid phenylalanine found in caffeine. Ingesting caffeine can lead to symptoms such as muscle weakness, tremors, and shaking.\n\n3. Anxiety or panic attacks: Caffeine can trigger or worsen anxiety and panic attacks in some individuals. This may result in feelings of weakness, shaking, and muscle softness.\n\n4. Dehydration: Consuming caffeine, particularly in large quantities, can lead to dehydration. Being dehydrated can result in feelings of weakness, shakiness, and muscle softness.\n\n5. Low blood sugar: Consuming caffeine on an empty stomach or between meals can cause your blood sugar to dip, leading to feelings of weakness, shaking, and muscle softness.\n\nIt's important to consider these possible explanations and consult a healthcare professional if you continue to experience these symptoms after consuming caffeine. They can help you determine the underlying cause and offer targeted solutions. In the meantime, you may want to explore decaffeinated alternatives or gradually reducing your caffeine intake to determine if that helps alleviate your symptoms. Additionally, staying hydrated and ensuring you have consistent meals can help mitigate potential negative effects."}

As with soreness, it will dissipate with time.Bruising - Bruising can occur around the gum area simply as a consequence of the surgical procedure. This too will abate with time.I do hope that you have found something helpful and I will be glad to answer any further query.Take care", "ai": " I cannot definitively say that your dental implants are the cause of your symptoms without a thorough examination by a healthcare professional. However, there are some potential connections between dental issues and symptoms you described.\n\nTemporomandibular joint (TMJ) disorders, which can cause pain in the temple and behind the eye, may be related to dental implants. The implant procedure can put stress on the TMJ, leading to discomfort or pain. If you grind or clench your teeth, which is a common habit in response to discomfort or stress, it may put additional pressure on the TMJ and worsen any symptoms.\n\nToothaches and earaches can also be related to dental issues. Infections or other problems in the teeth or gums can spread to the ear, causing pain or pressure. Your continued buzzing in the ear could also be related to a tooth issue, specifically if it is accompanied by pain or pressure in the affected tooth.\n\nIt is important to note that your recent CT scan findings of an old minor stroke may also contribute to your symptoms. Strokes can affect various parts of the body, including the nerves and blood vessels that supply the head and face.

Here doctor prescribed her today with Amoxylin and a cough syrup. I gave her a dose , due to cough she again vomited, I am bit worried because she is taking the medicines out.

Thanks.", "human": "Hi dear Welcome to the HCM,acidity is the cause for such vomitings. give her some thing to eat.Antiemetics like ondensetron can be given about 5 ml . this will take care of this problem,Hope the query is answered.Thanks", "ai": " I'm an artificial intelligence and not a doctor, but I can try to provide you with some general suggestions based on the information you have provided. If your daughter is vomiting after taking the medicines, it's important to let her rest and stay hydrated. Vomiting can make it difficult for her body to absorb the medicine, so it may be necessary to change the dosing schedule or the type of medicine. Here are some steps you can take:\n\n1. Call your doctor: It's important to inform your doctor of your daughter's symptoms and the vomiting incident. He or she may be able to adjust the dosage or prescription based on your daughter's specific condition.\n2. Offer small, frequent feedings: Instead of giving your daughter large meals or doses of medicine all at once, try offering small, frequent feedings of water, clear liquids, or simple foods such as rice or crackers.\n3. Give medicine with food: Having your daughter take her medicine with a small amount of food may help reduce the likelihood of vomiting.\n4. Use a syringe or dropper: If your daughter is having difficulty taking medicine by mouth due to vomiting, consider using a syringe or dropper to administer the medication directly into her mouth.\n5. Keep her hydrated: Dehydration can be a concern when a child is vomiting, so make sure she is getting enough fluids to stay hydrated. Offer water, clear liquids, or suckers to help encourage hydration.\n6. Monitor for side effects: If your daughter continues to vomit or experiences other side effects such as diarrhea, drowsiness, or difficulty breathing, contact your doctor right away.\n\nAgain, I am an artificial intelligence and not a doctor, so please consult with a healthcare professional for medical advice."}

After taking a severe knock to the ankle, it's normal to experience some swelling, bruising, or a lump forming due to the injury. This hard lump above your ankle bone could be a hematoma or a bruised area that has not yet completely resolved.\n\nHowever, if you're concerned about it not going away or looking unusual, you should consult a healthcare professional for an evaluation. They may recommend an X-ray or other imaging tests to ensure there is no bone damage or other underlying conditions causing the lump.\n\nAs for traveling on a long-distance flight, try to make sure your ankle is as comfortable as possible during the journey. Use compression stockings or a support brace to promote blood flow and reduce swelling. If the area is painful, consider taking over-the-counter pain medication before the flight. Additionally, try to move your legs frequently during the trip to prevent deep vein thrombosis. Remember, it's always better to be safe and check with your healthcare provider if you have any concerns before traveling.\n\nIn summary, if you're feeling anxious about the hard lump in your ankle, it's important to seek medical advice from a healthcare professional.

Male breast enlargement, also known as gynecomastia, can be caused by various factors including genetics, hormonal imbalances, obesity, or certain medications.\n\nExercise, especially strength training and cardio, can help reduce body fat and improve overall health, which can contribute to a reduction in breast size in some cases. However, if the enlargement is primarily due to excess glandular tissue rather than fat, exercise may not be effective. In such cases, surgery may be an option.\n\nGym classes can be a good option to help you get started with a regular workout routine and provide motivation and social support. However, they may not be as effective as specifically targeting the chest area through dedicated exercises and weightlifting.\n\nUltimately, the decision to pursue exercise or surgery depends on the underlying cause of your gynecomastia, your individual needs and preferences, and the advice of a healthcare professional. Before making a decision, it may be a good idea to consult with a doctor or a healthcare professional to determine the underlying cause and discuss potential treatments.\n\nIt's also worth noting that surgical procedures carry risks and benefits that should be carefully considered before making a decision. Your healthcare professional can provide you with more information on both options and help you make an informed decision.\n\nI hope this information helps, Lingesh. Best of luck to you in your journey towards improving your health and wellbeing!"}
{"question": "Is rise in pressure from 116/66 to 140/80 normal?I have PAD and am on 40mg of Lisinopril a day. I have been taking 1/2 of that some days as my blood pressure has been dropping giving me a quick feeling of faintness and I am tired a lot of the time. My pressure today was 116/66 then within an hour was up to 140/80 then later dropped again. Is this normal?", "human": "Hello!Welcome and thank you for asking on HCM!Regarding your concern, I would explain that these blood pressure fluctuations are quite normal during the day. They are related to physical or emotional activity. Isolated blood pressure are not conclusive for high blood pressure. I would recommend measuring your blood pressure frequently during the day (in sitting position after 10 minutes of total relax) and write those values in a notebook. You should do this for a week and then show these values to your doctor in order to make the proper changes to your actual therapy. Some blood lab tests may be needed to exclude other possible causes of blood pressure fluctuations: - complete blood count- blood electrolytes for possible imbalance- thyroid hormone levels for possible thyroid dysfunction- inflammation tests (PCR, sedimentation rate). Hope you will find this answer helpful!Kind regards, Dr. Iliri", "ai": " I am an AI language model and cannot directly observe or diagnose your medical condition. It is important to discuss any significant changes in your blood pressure readings with your healthcare provider, especially if you have a history of Peripheral Arterial Disease (PAD) and are currently taking medication for hypertension like Lisinopril.\n\nA one-time increase in blood pressure from 116/66 to 140/80, followed by a drop, could be due to various factors. Factors such as stress, physical activity, certain foods or medications can cause short-term changes in blood pressure. However, consistently high blood pressure readings despite medication could indicate that your dosage needs to be adjusted.\n\nYour symptoms of fainting and tiredness could also be related to your blood pressure. If your blood pressure drops too low, you may experience symptoms such as dizziness or fatigue. On the other hand, if your blood pressure is too high, it could be due to insufficient medication or other underlying conditions.\n\nIt is important to communicate openly and honestly with your healthcare provider about your symptoms and any concerns you may have. They may be able to provide additional guidance or adjust your medication as needed. If you are unsure about any aspect of your condition or treatment, I strongly recommend consulting with a healthcare professional."}
{"question": "What could cause a painless lump in the right arm near the shoulder?I have small lump the size of approximately a quarter on my upper right arm near my shoulder. For the most part it is painless, but occasionally there is a very slight muscle pain. It is not red or warm. I believe I have had this for over one week. It has not changed size.", "human": "Hi, * As per my surgical experience, the issue sounds to be soft tissue lesion as sebaceous cyst or lipoma more likely. * If visible over the surface, a photocopy of the same as an attachment in follow up conversation will serve best to proceed for detailed analysis. Hope I have answered your query. Let me know if I can assist you further. Take care Regards,Dr Bhagyesh V. Patel, General Surgeon", "ai": " There are several possible causes for a painless lump in the right arm near the shoulder. Some of the less serious possibilities include:\n\n1. Lipoma: A lipoma is a benign fatty tumor. It is usually round or oval in shape and can move slightly under the skin. It is generally painless and can be moved with the fingers.\n2. Cyst: A cyst is a closed pocket of fluid that can form under the skin or inside a structure such as a gland. A sebaceous cyst, for example, can form in the skin and is usually painless unless it becomes infected.\n3. Scar tissue: A painless lump near the shoulder could be due to scar tissue that has formed after an injury.\n4. Lymph node: Lymph nodes are small, bean-shaped organs that help filter lymph fluid and fight infection. They are found throughout the body, including in the armpits. A painless lump in the armpit could be an enlarged lymph node, but this is usually associated with an infection or other illness.\n\nHowever, it is important to note that a painless lump near the shoulder could also be a sign of a more serious condition, such as breast cancer or a bone tumor. If the lump has not gone away after one week and you are concerned, it is important to see your doctor for further evaluation. Your doctor will be able to perform a physical exam and order any necessary tests to determine the cause of the lump."}
{"question": "Can Acutret be given to a child for treatment of skin rashes?i have 4yrs 9 months girl baby. she had rashes and one dermetologist suggested acutret 5mg. she is 18 kg. i am afraid to start the dosage as i read the warning given in the tablets. is there any food restrictions when she take acutret ? kindly suggest", "human": "Although it is difficult to comment whether Acutret (isotretinoin) needs to be given for rash, I would probably not have prescribed it. The dosage is proper and you need not worry. Do not worry about the warning labels as doctors might have a different thing in mind while prescribing and that correlation might not be apparent to you. No food restrictions needed.For skin rashes, I would probably have prescribed calamine lotion and some antiallergic like fexofenadine for 3-4 days.", "ai": " I cannot definitively say whether Acutret (isotretinoin) is suitable for your daughter based on the limited information provided. Acutret is a potent retinoid medication typically used for the treatment of severe acne, not for common skin rashes. The decision to prescribe Acutret for a child should be made by a qualified healthcare professional, taking into account the specific diagnosis, the potential benefits, and the potential risks.\n\nRegarding your concerns, Acutret does come with some significant warnings and precautions. There are risks of severe side effects, particularly in regards to the liver, skin, eyes, and lips. Your healthcare provider should have discussed these risks with you and provided guidance on how to minimize them. It is important to closely follow the prescribed dosage, and regular monitoring by a healthcare professional is typically required.\n\nAs for food restrictions, there are no specific foods that need to be avoided while taking Acutret. However, it is recommended to take the medication with a full meal to minimize stomach upset. Additionally, grapefruit and grapefruit juice should be avoided while taking Acutret, as it may increase the levels of the drug in your body and increase the risk of side effects.\n\nIt is essential to discuss any concerns you have with your daughter's healthcare provider. They can provide you with more detailed information based on your daughter's specific circumstances and offer advice on how to monitor for side effects while she is taking Acutret."}

I have gone through your question. firstly an ECG is required and if itshows complete heart block (more likely) a pacemaker may beneeded.Hope to have been helpful!Wishing good health, Dr D Sunil Reddy", "ai": " Based on the information you provided, a one-time episode of dizziness, shortness of breath, and a low heart rate (35 beats per minute) in conjunction with a relatively normal blood pressure reading of 119/65 does not necessarily indicate a heart-related cause for concern, especially if you are not experiencing ongoing symptoms today. However, I am not a doctor, and I cannot definitively diagnose or rule out any conditions based on this information.\n\nThe symptoms you described could be associated with various conditions, including anemia, dehydration, certain medications, or underlying health conditions such as rheumatoid arthritis (RA) and fibromyalgia. Given your medical history, it is worth discussing these symptoms with your healthcare provider. They may want to consider potential contributing factors related to your RA or fibromyalgia, or they may order some tests to help rule out other potential causes.\n\nIf you continue to experience symptoms or if they worsen, seek medical attention right away. In the meantime, ensure you stay hydrated, maintain a balanced diet, and follow any specific recommendations from your healthcare provider for managing your conditions."}
{"question": "Suggest treatment for back pain after walking for some timeI am 18 and I get terrible back ache after standing up or walking around for only a few hours.
